Extension of Indication to Prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) re-infection in HBsAg and HBV-DNA negative patients at least one week - instead of the approved at least 6 months - after liver transplantation for hepatitis B induced liver failure.

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

An updated RMP has been provided.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Not applicable

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The applicant did not seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP; however the MAH sought twice national Scientific Advice on the clinical study design. The open, prospective, single-arm study design (study 987) was generally considered appropriate to investigate the efficacy and safety of a human hepatitis B immunoglobulin for subcutaneous application in patients after liver transplantation. The treatment schedule was aimed at maximum ease of use and flexibility while assuring the preventive antibody levels above 100 IU/L in HBV-DNA negative patients.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## About the disease

Hepatitis B is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). It can range in severity from a mild disease lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong disease. Viral hepatitis is the leading cause of liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation.

About 10% of orthotopic liver transplantations are due to HBV-associated liver disease (cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma). Without interventions there is a risk of infection of the allograft which is estimated to be at least 80% [Colquhoun et al. 2000]. Re-infection is thought to be due to replication and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

release of HBV from extra hepatic reservoirs. While primary HBV infection may progress to liver cirrhosis over 10 to 20 years, recurrent HBV infection after transplantation may lead to liver failure within 1 to 2 years. This rapid progression is thought to be due to a combination of different factors in the immunosuppressed host, i.e. stimulation of viral replication by corticosteroids, a direct cytopathic effect and the emergence of resistant viral mutants. Of note, a further determinant of post-transplant recurrence is the level of viral replication before transplantation. Patients who are HBV-DNA or HBeAg-positive at the time of transplantation having the highest rate of graft re-infection.

The risk of HBV re-infection is directly related to the HBV viral load at transplantation. Currently, HBV prophylaxis after transplantation with long-term administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin preparations (HBIG) in combination with antiviral agents (nucleos(t)ide analogues) appears to be the most reasonable prophylaxis and can effectively reduce the risk of HBV recurrence mainly in patients without active HBV replication [Samuel 2008, Cholongitas, Papatheodoridis 2013, Roche, Samuel 2013].

Figure 1: Treatment scheme

<!-- image -->

For patients with active viral replication, antiviral therapy should be started before orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) with the goal of achieving viral suppression prior to transplantation and improving clinical status. Post transplantation, these patients should receive a combination of antiviral(s) and HBIG to maintain anti-HBs titers &gt;500 IU/L [Samuel 2009].

For OLT patients without active HBV replication pre-transplantation, pre-operative antiviral therapy is not needed. These patients should receive 10,000 IU HBIG IV in the anhepatic phase and daily for 7 days, and then to maintain anti-HBs titres &gt; 100 to 150 IU/L [Samuel 2008, Samuel 2009]. In this initial phase after transplantation, large amounts of HBIG are consumed to bind and eliminate HBsAg. Therefore, the approach after OLT due to HBV induced liver failure is to initiate treatment with high dose, intravenous HBIG administration to attain serum HBIG levels above 500 IU/L.

After some weeks of treatment the serum will be free of HBsAg. In these patients, who are HBsAg negative, low-dose continuation treatment with HBIG is recommended and several studies provided evidence that it is sufficient to maintain the HBIG serum level above 100 IU/L to protect the graft from re-infection [Beckebaum et al., 2009, Ferretti et al., 2004, Testino et al., 2009, Yilmaz et al., 2008]

## About the product

Zutectra is highly purified (96%) preparation of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) with antibodies to hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBs), which is intended for subcutaneous administration. The active ingredient of BT088 (Zutectra) is human hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG).

Zutectra is indicated for

- Prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) re-infection in HBV-DNA negative patients ≥ 6 months after liver transplantation for hepatitis B induced liver failure.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The clinical data to support the extension of indication consist of one pivotal study:  An open, prospective, single-arm study investigating efficacy and safety of the human hepatitis B immunoglobulin Zutectra in liver transplanted patients - the ZEUS Study (Study 987).

## Guidelines

The draft Guideline on the clinical investigation of hepatitis B immunoglobulins (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/585257/2009) was published shortly before the start of trial. A full compliance with the guideline cannot be expected since the protocol was already finalised. The MAH adjusted the sample size in accordance to the guideline.

However two guidelines on the core SPC for hepatitis B immunoglobulins were available (Guideline on the core SPC for human plasma derived hepatitis B immunoglobulin for intramuscular use (CPMP/BPWG/4222/02) and Guideline on the core SPC for human plasma derived hepatitis B immunoglobulin for intravenous use (CPMP/BPWG/4027/02)). These guidelines give valuable information e.g. for the design of the study and should have been respected. The MAH made reference to these guidelines when appropriate

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

## Clinical study programme- overview

The MAH conducted one phase I study (Study 956), four phase III studies (Study 958, Study 974,

Study 987 and Study 959) and one non-interventional post-authorization safety study (Study 978) with human HBIG for intramuscular and subcutaneous administration.  The clinical studies 956 and 958 were part of the marketing authorization approval of Zutectra in 2009 in the initial indication 'prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) re-infection in HBV DNA negative patients ≥6 months after liver transplantation for HBV induced liver failure in adults'.

Study 974 was used for the collection of further valid data concerning the hospital-based treatment in specialist units as well as the compliance with regard to the self-injections during home treatment in the same indication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The clinical study 987 'Zutectra Early Use - ZEUS Study' was performed in order to investigate the aimed therapeutic indication for BT088 (Zutectra) 'prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reinfection in HBsAg and HBV-DNA negative adult patients at least one week after liver transplantation for hepatitis B induced liver failure'.

Purpose of the post-authorization safety study 978 was to collect data on safety and overall experience, with focus on compliance with injection schemes as prescribed by the treating doctor of subcutaneously administered BT088 (Zutectra) in home self-treatment for the prevention of hepatitis B re-infection in liver transplanted patients.

The clinical study 959 was performed to show safety and efficacy of BT088 (Fovepta) in the indication 'Immunoprophylaxis of hepatitis B in the newborn of a hepatitis B virus carrier-mother'.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

No new pharmacokinetic data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacodynamics data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable.

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Main study

An open, prospective, single-arm study investigating efficacy and safety of the human hepatitis B immunoglobulin Zutectra in liver transplanted patients - the ZEUS Study (Study 987).

## Methods

This clinical trial was designed as an open, prospective, single-arm, multicentre phase III study. It was planned to enrol at least 40 evaluable patients undergoing long-term hepatitis B immunoglobulin prophylaxis (SC) against hepatitis B re-infection in patients undergoing OLT. The study was planned to be conducted in 12-19 study centres in UK, France, Spain, and Italy.

The patients were to be converted from the intravenous standard hepatitis B immunoglobulin to subcutaneous injections with Zutectra according to the individual scheduled dosing interval, approximately 8-11 or 15-18 days after OLT.

The treatment period lasted from Day 8-11 (Week 1) or Day 15-18 (Week 2) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) until Day 162 (Week 24) with weekly or fortnightly injections of study medication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 3: Study design with 1st dose 15-18 days after OLT

<!-- image -->

After the closing visit on day 169 the respective standard HBIG dosing scheme (IV, IM or SC, depending on the usual practice of the hospital) was to be continued and had to be documented by the investigator.

## Study participants

The study population was patients with hepatitis B infection requiring liver transplantation. The population for study 987 comprised adult HBV-DNA negative patients one week after liver transplantation, HBsAg negative pre-dose (day 7-10 or day 14-17 after OLT) and serum HBs antibody concentration ≥400 IU/L pre-dose (day 7-10 or day 14-17 after OLT).

Patients with hepatitis B infection could also be infected with a second virus known as hepatitis delta virus (HDV). Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) positive patients couldbe included in this clinical study.

Patients with ascites one week after OLT are also allowed to participate in this study and may be included on day 14 after OLT.

A minimum safety trough level of the serum HBs antibody concentration of &gt;100 IU/l must be maintained during the study.

Patients with HIV or HCV test at time of transplantation are excluded from the study

## Treatments

Subcutaneous injections of 500 IU (1mL) or 1,000 IU (2mL) Zutectra were administered weekly or fortnightly until 24 weeks after transplantation. The patients were to be converted from the intravenous standard hepatitis B immunoglobulin to subcutaneous injections with Zutectra according to the individual scheduled dosing interval, approximately 8-11 or 15-18 days after OLT.

Injections on a weekly or fortnightly basis were performed according to the serum anti-HBs concentrations and at the discretion of the physician in charge according to local practice.

Patients whose serum HBs antibody concentrations decreased to 100 IU/L or below even after dosage adaptation (allowed in exceptional cases up to 1,500 IU), were to be withdrawn from further participation in this study.

## Objectives

- Investigation of efficacy and safety of Zutectra in liver transplanted patients.
- Prevention of hepatitis B virus re-infection in HBV-DNA negative patients ≥ one week after liver transplantation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was the failure rate after 24 weeks of treatment based on

- anti-HBs trough levels of serum ≤ 100 IU/L during the active treatment phase, and/or
- hepatitis B related re-infections in patients with serum anti-HBs trough levels &gt; 100 IU/L.

Trough levels of serum anti-HBs were determined for 24 weeks at each study visit after 1st dose or at occurrence of a hepatitis B related re-infection, to assess if serum concentrations &gt; 100 IU/L were achieved after subcutaneous treatment

The secondary efficacy endpoint was the number of all patients with hepatitis B related infections, irrespective of the corresponding anti-HBs trough levels. Hepatitis B related infections where assessed by monitoring clinical signs, liver function and measurement of HBsAg and HBV-DNA.

## Sample size

Initially it was planned to include 60 evaluable patients undergoing long-term HBIg prophylaxis against hepatitis B re-infection. In accordance with the draft guidance document for clinical investigation of hepatitis B immunoglobulins (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/585257/2009, 2012) this number was lowered to 40 evaluable patients via Amendment 2 to the clinical study protocol.

## Randomisation

Not applicable; open label study

## Blinding (masking)

Not applicable; open label study

## Statistical methods

Descriptive methods were applied to analyse the data. All data were described by statistical characteristics (continuous data: number of observations, mean, SD, minimum, median, maximum; categorical data: absolute and relative frequencies).  95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to describe the uncertainty regarding observed effects.

A Clopper-Pearson 95%-CI was applied to describe the primary efficacy variable (treatment failure). The trial was to be considered positive in case the upper limit of the 95% CI for the failure rate at week 24 was below 16.9%.

## Recruitment

The study comprised a screening visit prior to OLT to confirm eligibility, the pre-dose visit and the following treatment phase with up to 12 visits over a treatment period of 24 weeks.

## Conduct of the study

The protocol was amended twice, without any impact on the safety and efficacy analysis of the study.

Amendment No. 1 of 28 February 2013 was implemented to clarify inclusion and exclusion criteria, expand the time window for study visits, increase the number of participating countries and sites, and adapt the definition of AEs/IRAEs.

Amendment No. 2 of 03 April 2014 was implemented to prolong the study duration, decrease the required patient number, adapt inclusion criterion 2 (Historical evidence within the last 3 months that HBV-DNA is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

undetectable at time point of signature of Informed Consent), update information on completed studies with Zutectra, and change AE reporting requirements before start of treatment with study drug.

Patients with residual disease i.e. clinical signs of hepatitis B infection and/ or detectable HBV-DNA prior to informed consent were not included. According to inclusion criteria I02, historical evidence within the last 4 weeks prior to signature of informed consent that HBV-DNA was undetectable was required prior to participation in this clinical study.  Unfortunately, the historical evidence that HBV-DNA was undetectable within the last 4 weeks prior to informed consent was not available for 10 patients because the time period was longer than 28 days (between 1 and 160 days).

With study protocol amendment 02 (03 Apr 2014) inclusion criterion I02 was changed in order to adapt the time window of the HBV-DNA test to common hospital practice. Starting with amendment 02, historical evidence within the last 3 months that HBV-DNA was undetectable at time point of signature of informed consent was introduced.

## Baseline data

The majority of included patients were male (41/49 patients, 83.7%). Mean age was 52.2 ± 9.2 years with 21 patients (42.9%) between 50 and 60 years of age. Mean weight at inclusion was 73.1 ±12 kg and mean height was 171.6 ±8.1 cm. Ethnic affiliation was Caucasian for 45 patients (91.8%).

All of the patients received concomitant antivirals for systemic use and immunosuppressive agents.

The following antivirals, according to ATC system level 2 (chemical substance), were used during the study: entecavir (antivirals for systemic use, undefined, 27/49 patients, 55.1%), lamivudine (12/49 patients, 24.5%), tenofovir (10 patients, 20.4%), valaciclovir (2 patients, 4.1%) and adefovir (1 patient, 2.0%). The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

most frequently used immunosuppressive agent was tacrolimus in 48 patients (98.0%)

Additionally, the most frequently documented concomitant drugs were drugs for acid related disorders (46/49 patients, 93.9%), analgesics (45 patients, 91.8%), antibacterials for systemic use (43 patients; 87.8%) and corticosteroids for systemic use (40 patients, 81.6%). The most commonly prescribed single medication apart from the immunosuppressive treatment was acetyl salicylic acid in 39 patients (79.6%).

With regard to the medical history all patients included in the full analysis set (FAS) suffered from at least one previous disease as documented at the screening and pre-dose visits. The most frequently documented previous diseases (SOCs) were gastrointestinal disorders (29/49 patients, 59.2%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (25 patients, 51%) and infections and infestations (23 patients, 46.9%).

## Numbers analysed

Four study populations were defined for analysis:

- All subjects population: All patients entered in the clinical database (i.e. all patients having signed the informed consent form
- Safety Set (SS): All patients who received the study medication at least once
- Full-Analysis Set (FAS): All patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one post dose efficacy assessment
- Per-protocol Set (PPS): All patients of the FAS who completed the whole study period until assessment of treatment failure or Closing Visit (whichever comes first) without major protocol deviations.

## Table 2: Data sets analysed

| Population       |   Total (m) |
|------------------|-------------|
| All subjects set |          75 |
| SS               |          49 |
| FAS              |          49 |
| PPS              |          46 |

## Outcomes and estimation

The definition of treatment failure (primary efficacy variable) is based on any trough level of serum anti-HBs ≤ 100 IU/L and/or diagnosed hepatitis B related re-infection in patients with trough levels of serum anti-HBs &gt; 100 IU/L during the period between first study drug administration and end of study.

No treatment failures occurred during the 6-month study period. Thus the 95% confidence interval [CI: 0.00%; 7.25%] for the failure rate was clearly below the upper CI-limit [0.6%; 16.9%], applied for the sample size determination under the assumption that the failure rate does not exceed 5%.

Serum HBs antibody concentrations above the minimum safety trough level of &gt; 100 IU/L were maintained in all patients at all assessments. No hepatitis B related reinfection (HBsAg positive) was observed during the study.

At screening anti-HBs was negative in most of the patients. The mean anti-HBs values pre-dose were 960.32 ± 585.77 IU/L on Day 7 (n=49) and 1112.21 ±776.23 on Day 14 (n=10). During the 6-month treatment phase the mean anti-HBs values were 746.08 ± 629.10 IU/L before the start of home administration Day 29

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(n=49), 491.53 ± 383.03 IU/L on Day 57 (n=48) and 288.28 ± 147.64 IU/L at the closing visit (n=48).

HBsAg was negative throughout the study from Day 15 to Closing Visit. All tested patients were negative for HBV-DNA at screening, days 29, 57, 113, and closing visit HBV-DNA tests were not performed in 3 patients at the Closing visit. However, all patients were HBsAg negative at the Closing visit without clinical signs of hepatitis B infection.

## Ancillary analyses

In order to account for the residuals of the IV-phase, reference was made to the investigated anti-HBs antibody pharmacokinetics of a single intravenous dose of 9,820 IU Hepatect CP in post-OLT patients (Biotest Study 953). In that study, 21 male and female, HBsAg-negative, post-OLT patients (≥ 6 months after liver transplantation; stable condition) had been investigated to characterise the pharmacokinetics of serum anti-HBs antibodies after an acute intravenous infusion of 9,280 IU Hepatect CP. To assess the contribution of the IV treatment to plasma levels, the simulated time course of IV plasma levels was calculated for each evaluable patient based on the pharmacokinetic parameters of Hepatect CP study 953, starting with the initially observed anti-HBIg plasma levels in study 987 with Zutectra.

For each evaluable patient participating in Biotest study 987 (N: 49) graphs were presented that describe the observed anti-HBs antibody levels under IV- and SC-treatment relative to the IV- and SC-dosing in the context of the patients' specific characteristics (country and site of conduct, demography, HBs-Ag and anti-HBs status prior to transplantation and shortly thereafter); additionally these data are presented vs. the estimated time courses of the serum anti-HBs levels that might have been expected for the IV regimen if the pharmacokinetics derived from Biotest study 953 similarly applied under the present conditions.

An example is given below:

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SC-treatment was not started on D08 unless the HBs-Ag status was negative on D07; in such situations, IV-treatment was usually continued and SC-treatment was started on D15 after HBs-Ag had been shown to be negative on D14. In the course of the post-transplantation follow-up, SC-dosage was often increased when the serum anti-HBs levels were lower or declined faster than might have been expected considering the preceding IV treatment phase; in general, such increases in SC-dose led to a favourable improvement of the anti-HBs levels.

From the graphs of all patients participating in study 987 it was apparent that in post OLT patients the post-IV residuals and carry-over effects were far less than might have been expected from the pharmacokinetics of intravenous HBIg-treatments characterised in biologically more stable patients (as studied in Biotest study 953).

There was an obvious trend in study 987 that the anti-HBs antibody levels reached throughout and after the IV-phase were lower than anticipated. This reflects a substantially lesser rise in anti-HBs antibodies on IV-dosing in transplantation-stressed patients compared with the biologically more stable off-transplantation patients (&gt; 6 months after OLT, e.g. in study 958).

In study 987 it has been demonstrated, that with an individualised flexible SC-regimen according to patient's anti-HBs trough level no treatment failure occurred. Serum HBs antibody concentrations above the minimum safety trough level of &gt; 100 IU/L were measured in all patients at all time-points independent of the dose regimen (500 IU, 1,000 IU, 1,500 IU) or the treatment intervals (weekly, fortnightly). No clinical signs of a hepatitis B virus re-infection were observed and no patient tested HBsAg positive or HBV-DNA positive during the study.

At least two patients received hepatitis B vaccination in timely relation to the study. The MAH provided separate anti-HBs data for these patients and it was shown that the vaccination had no demonstrable impact on the course anti-HBS serum levels.

## Analysis performed on other Phase III studies

## Study 974

Phase III, open, prospective, single-arm, multicentre, feasibility, efficacy and safety study.  Male and female patients (age 18-75 years), ≥ 3 months after OLT, who required long-term prophylaxis against HBV recurrence, received SC BT088 HBIG at a dose of ca. 500 IU/week for patients who weighed &lt;75 kg and 1000 IU/week for patients ≥ 75 kg BT088. Dosage could be adapted up to 1000 IU/week to maintain anti-HBs serum levels of &gt;100 IU/L. The planned treatment period was 24 weeks. Therapy was continued for a facultative extension period of another 24 weeks (total duration 48 weeks) for patients who were compliant with injection technique and had stable anti-HBs serum levels. The primary objective was feasibility of home self-treatment with SC BT088 and maintenance of serum anti-HBs levels ≥100 IU/L.

A total of 10 serum anti-HBs concentrations below 150 IU/L were observed in 7/66 patients (10.6%) during the course of the study. After dose adaption trough serum level subsequently increased to values &gt; 150 IU/L in 5 of 7 patients (no dose adaption in two patients).  At study start these 7 patients were dosed adequately according to the SmPC, receiving the appropriate dose of 500 IU (6/7 patients) or 1000 IU (1/7 patients)

Zutectra weekly according to their body weight.  Furthermore, 5/7 patients received regular long-term IV or IM HBIg prophylaxis in combination with lamivudine prior and lamuvidine during study 974, and only 2/7 patients received Zutectra as monotherapy for HBV reinfection prophylaxis, i.e. not in combination with an antiviral.

The MAH has provided individual graphs for the 7 patients which are described in detail with respect to the individual values (data not shown), the corresponding dose adaptations of Zutectra and the characteristics of these patients with respect to body weight, individual anti HBs levels, medical history and concomitant medications are provided.

These 7 patients differ in regard to age, body weight, time between OLT and first dose of Zutectra, concomitant disease and medication and were treated in 4 different study sites. The levels for anti-HBs concentrations typically decrease with time after transplantation and are variable across centres. Furthermore, anti-HBs serum levels can vary within the same patient even with the administration of a fixed dose of HBIg. Looking at the individual patients, the anti-HBs concentrations below 150 IU/L could not be attributed to the patients' self-injection regimen. All patients were dosed adequately according to their bodyweight at study start and all patients (except for one omitted injection) were compliant with the injection schedule during the course of the study. These results suggest that not the weight per se but body composition and patient's pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics may impact HBIg levels through distinct HBIg distribution. A high interindividual variability of anti-HBs consumption may be of multifactorial etiology. It would seem advisable to monitor anti-HBs levels regularly to allow for HBIg dose adjustments based on trough levels.  An appropriate warning is stated in the SmPC.

## Study 958  - An Open, Prospective, Single-arm Study Investigating Efficacy and Safety of the Human Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin BT088 after Subcutaneous Application in Liver Transplanted Patients (Original pivotal study)

Phase III, open, prospective, single-arm, efficacy and safety study. Male and female patients (age 18-75 years), ≥ 3 months after OLT, who required long-term prophylaxis against HBV recurrence, received SC Zutectra at a dose of ca. 500 IU/week for patients who weighed &lt;75 kg and 1000 IU/week for patients ≥ 75 kg BT088. Dosage could be adapted up to 1000 IU/week to maintain anti-HBs serum levels of &gt;100 IU/L.

The planned treatment period was 18 weeks. Therapy was to continue for a further 6 weeks (total duration 24 weeks) for patients who were compliant with injection technique and had stable anti-HBs serum levels.

The primary efficacy variable was maintenance of serum anti-HBs levels ≥100 IU/L.

In study 958, patients switched only in the late post transplantation period and the observed anti-HBs antibody levels after Zutectra SC administration were higher (than levels in study 987) within the range of 350 to 400 IU/L.  In due consideration of the special patient population in study 987, which was treated early after liver transplantation, the observed lower mean anti-HBs level of 288 IU/L at the end of the treatment period is not clinically relevant compared to study 958 (in view of flexible dosing in study 987).

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

This clinical trial 987 was designed as an open, prospective, single-arm, multicentre phase III study to evaluate long-term hepatitis B immunoglobulin prophylaxis (SC) against hepatitis B re-infection in patients undergoing OLT. In principle, an open label study approach is acceptable for the type of product in the sought indication; it is line with the requirement laid down in the draft Guideline on the clinical investigation of hepatitis B immunoglobulins (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/585257/2009) which was published shortly before the start of trial.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study population consists of patients with hepatitis B infection requiring liver transplantation. The population for study 987 comprised adult, HBV-DNA negative patients, one week after liver transplantation, HBsAg negative pre-dose (day 7-10 or day 14-17 after OLT) and serum HBs antibody concentration ≥ 400 IU/L pre-dose (day 7-10 or day 14-17 after OLT). Since patients with hepatitis B infection can also be co-infected with hepatitis delta virus (HDV), these could be enrolled in this clinical study; however patients co-infected with HIV or HCV at time of transplantation were to be excluded from the trial. This exclusion is noted as 'missing information' in the RMP.  In addition, SmPC section 5.1 is updated to reflect the HIV and HCV exclusion from the trial population and also to provide information on the proportion of HBV patients in study 987 testing positive for HDV.

Patients were to be converted from the intravenous standard hepatitis B immunoglobulin to subcutaneous injections with Zutectra according to the individual scheduled dosing interval, approximately 8-11 or 15-18 days after OLT.  Two time-points for start of the SC treatment were possible, further treatment was for both groups either weekly or fortnightly. The different schedules were not accounted for whilst evaluating the efficacy data.  It was argued that even if stratification was attempted, it would be of doubtful validity while confounded by multiplicity and not likely to be more informative than the overall non-stratified statistics.  It was also noted that heterogeneity occurs in the number of observations per time point and site specificity in both preferred SC-regimens.

The treatment period lasted for 24 weeks, thereafter patients received the respective standard HBIg dosing scheme (IV, IM or SC, depending on the usual practice of the hospital). Thus patients could switch therapy twice (standard therapy &gt; study treatment &gt; standard therapy).

The primary efficacy endpoint was the failure rate after 24 weeks of treatment based on anti-HBs trough levels of serum ≤ 100 IU/L during the active treatment phase and/or hepatitis B related re-infections in patients with serum anti-HBs trough levels &gt; 100 IU/L.

It was also remarked that for hepatitis B immunoglobulin as monotherapy, it is recommended that anti-HBs titres should be maintained &gt;500 IU/L for patients with active viral replication (HBeAg and/or HBV DNA positive) (Guideline on the core SPC for human plasma derived hepatitis B immunoglobulin for intramuscular use [CPMP/BPWG/4222/02] and Guideline on the core SPC for human plasma derived hepatitis B immunoglobulin for intravenous use [CPMP/BPWG/4027/02]).   However, no patients with detectable HBV-levels &gt; 4 weeks prior to informed consent / OLT were included in the study.  Taking account of protocol amendment 2, requiring historical evidence within the last 3 months that HBV-DNA was undetectable at time point of signature of informed consent, CHMP advised to reflect this in the therapeutic indication (SmPC section 4.1).

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The data suggested that the primary efficacy endpoint was met. Throughout the study, all patients had anti-HBs trough level above &gt; 100 IU/L; no hepatitis B re-infection was observed. Of note, the anti- HBs levels declined constantly during the entire study period. This 'effect' is related to the study design. Patients were switched from the intravenous standard hepatitis B immunoglobulin to subcutaneous injections with Zutectra at 8-11 or 15-18 days after OLT. Considering the treatment schedule for IV hepatitis B immunoglobulins in prevention of hepatitis B re-infection after liver transplantation for hepatitis B induced liver failure and their half-life of 20-25 days, a considerable 'carry-over' effect is expected with serum anti-HBs largely driven by the IV preparation. Thus the waning of the HBs antibodies applied with the IV immunoglobulin could explain the observed steady decrease of the serum anti-HBs levels.  To assess the contribution of the IV treatment to plasma levels, the simulated time course of IV plasma levels was calculated for each evaluable patient based on the pharmacokinetic parameters of Hepatect CP study 953, starting with the initially observed anti-HBIg plasma levels in study 987 with Zutectra.  As a limitation, the simulation of the IV plasma levels was based on stable patients' data (study 953), whilst the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pharmacokinetic parameters in critically ill patients differ from 'stable' patients.   For patients in trial 987, no stable levels were observed over the entire study period. It was questioned if patients in the early post-transplantation period may benefit less from a switch to SC preparation than patients switching in a later phase.  It was clarified that the assumption that this 'reflects a substantially lesser rise in anti-HBs antibodies on IV-dosing in transplantation-stressed patients compared with the biologically more stable off-transplantation patients (&gt; 6 months after OLT, e.g. in study 958)' is not substantiated by scientific data, nor relevant for the current extension application with early switch to SC administration. It was further considered that the pharmacokinetic profile of the product is influenced by the underlying condition, i.e. differs in critically ill patients is considerably as opposed to stable patients (Perazella 2012). The observed differences of the mean anti-HBs level between the two studies was not considered as clinically relevant though.  The SC-dosage regimen for study 987 was flexible within protocol defined limitations in order to maintain a protective value of 100 IU/L, depending on the patient's individual needs and catabolism. Dose adaptations were performed whenever required according to the serum anti-HBs concentrations at the discretion of the investigator in charge.

Individual graphs showed that the number of dose adjustments made for some patients appear to be numerous and thus questions the feasibility for home treatment for every patient, at least in this patient population.  It was clarified that a patient in home treatment has to be monitored regularly, at least every 2-4 weeks for the first 6 months. Between these monitoring visits, the patient is on a fixed dose.  The posology can be individualised to each patient but only in a limited variety of settings with respect to dose and frequency according to the regular monitoring results. As a consequence, various sections of the SPC/PL were amended to emphasise the necessity of monitoring the anti-HBs level and adaption of the dosage regimen. All patients need to achieve protective antibody levels &gt;100 IU/l as reflected in the SmPC.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The results of the clinical study 987 demonstrated that serum anti-HBs &gt; 100 IU/L, which are required for effective prophylaxis against HBV re-infection in OLT patients at risk, were attained with weekly or fortnightly SC administration of 500 IU, 1,000 IU or in exceptional cases up to 1,500 IU Zutectra according to patients serum anti-HBs levels.

## The following caveats apply:

1.   Patients had to be HBV-DNA negative within the last 3 months before OLT and HbsAg negative prior to start of treatment.
2.  A patient in home treatment has to be monitored regularly, at least every 2-4 weeks for the first 6 months. A statement to this effect has been added to SmPC section 4.2.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

Symptoms typically associated with intravenous (IV) human hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) infusion are common but intermittent and consist of myalgia, predominantly back pain, headache and flushing [Al-Hemsi et al., 1996]. As with other immunoglobulins, hypersensitivity reaction or even anaphylaxis may rarely occur following HBIG administration. Patients with IgA deficiency have a greater risk [Shouval and Samuel, 2000].

As the SC route provides lower peak and higher trough immunoglobulin levels, severe headaches and other adverse effects are reduced compared with IV immunoglobulin [Berger M, 2004; Helbert M, Farragher A,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2007; Lobo ED et al., 2004].

## Patient exposure

The safety population for Zutectra SC included a total of 236 adult subjects: 30 healthy volunteers and 206 orthotopic liver transplantation patients at risk for HBV infection. These patients were included in the 3 clinical studies for the MAA, a non-interventional post authorisation safety and study 987 to support the current application.

In a supportive Phase III efficacy and safety Study 959, a total of 34 healthy mature male and female infants born to HBsAg positive mothers were exposed to Zutectra.

## · Study 987

In this study the overall exposure of all patients to study medication was 0.180 kg HBIg for an overall duration of treatment with Zutectra of 19.92 Patient Years. The minimum individual exposure of a patient to study medication was 1,584 mg HBIg, whilst the maximum individual exposure of a patient to study medication was 6,768 mg HBIg. The patients are exposed for a minimum of 0.15 Patient Years and for a maximal of 0.43 Patient Years.

Only one AE was assessed to be treatment related. Injection site haematoma was reported for one patient. The event was of mild intensity and resolved on day 80. Injection site haematoma is listed in the IB, SPC and expected with Zutectra subcutaneous injections.

The most common single treatment-emergent AEs experienced during the study were cytomegalovirus infection in 12/49 patients (24.5%), and assessed as not related to Zutectra and was not reported as symptom of reinfection with hepatitis B.

Liver transplant rejection or suspicion of liver transplant rejection was experienced in 5/49 patients (10.2%), 3 were classified as serious adverse event. In addition, 2 cases of liver transplant rejection between OLT and start of treatment with Zutectra were reported in medical history. Liver transplant rejection or suspicion of liver transplant rejection were assessed as not related to Zutectra and were not reported as symptom of re-infection with hepatitis B.

E. coli urinary tract infection, diarrhoea, diabetes mellitus and pyrexia were each occurring in 4 patients (8.2%).

Splenomegaly was reported in one patient, starting before treatment with Zutectra and documented as medical history.

Hepatic arterial thrombosis was reported in one patient on Day 2. Hepatic arterial thrombosis was serious in severity but started before treatment with Zutectra and was associated with the OLT. This event was reported as medical history (not treatment related).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the current study the frequency of AEs was higher than in the previous studies. However the profile of adverse events was in line with the clinical course of the underlying condition of patients after OLT and no new safety finding was detected.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## · Study 987

In total 24 serious treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 14/49 patients (28.6%). No SAE reported during the observation period was causally related to Zutectra.

There were two significant adverse events; an acute liver transplant rejection leading to withdrawal from study, and the report of hepatocellular carcinoma. Both events are neither related to Zutectra nor reported as symptoms of re-infection with hepatitis B.

There was no death reported in Studies 956, 958, 974, 987 and PASS 978.

## Laboratory findings

In the four studies 956, 958, 974 and 987, routine laboratory assessments (electrolytes, haematology, renal and hepatic function) showed no clinically relevant changes during the study for any subject, nor levels of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, IgM or Complement C3 and C4.

## · Study PASS 978

There were only 3 patients with laboratory parameters that switched from not clinically relevant to clinically relevant during the observation period. In patient 001 the LDL value increased from 340 to 664 U/L, and in patient 110 urea decreased from 98 to 11 mg/dl. For patient 113 two parameters were concerned: urea decreased from 86 to 79 mg/dl, and creatinine increased from 1.77 to 1.91 mg/dl.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

## · Study 987:

Only one patient who experienced the serious TEAE, liver transplant rejection, not related to Zutectra discontinued the study on Day 74 due to this event.

## Safety in special populations

No formal safety analyses by age, gender or race were performed. However, data from clinical studies showed no obvious differences in safety for any intrinsic factor.

No formal analyses of AEs by smoking status, extent of alcohol consumption and other extrinsic factors were performed.

Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the course of pregnancy, or on the foetus and the neonate are to be expected (Guideline on the core SPC for human plasma derived hepatitis B immunoglobulin for intramuscular use (CPMP/BPWG/4222/02) and Guideline on the core SPC for human plasma derived hepatitis B immunoglobulin for intravenous use (CPMP/BPWG/4027/02).

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No formal drug interaction studies were performed. No drug-drug interactions have been apparent from clinical studies.

The interaction with live attenuated virus vaccines as well as interference with serological testing is addressed in the relevant guidelines for core SPC (Guideline on the core SPC for human plasma derived hepatitis B immunoglobulin for intramuscular use (CPMP/BPWG/4222/02) and Guideline on the core SPC for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

human plasma derived hepatitis B immunoglobulin for intravenous use (CPMP/BPWG/4027/02).

## Post marketing experience

Zutectra is authorized in the European Union and in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein via centralised MAA. Zutectra is also nationally authorised in Switzerland. The medicinal product is currently marketed in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Iran, Israel, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and UK.

Since the launch of Zutectra in 2008, patients received 284,605 Standard Doses. Treatment with Zutectra was well tolerated. The frequency and profile of adverse events are in line with the clinical course of the underlying condition of patients after OLT.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety data base for Zutectra SC included a total of 236 adult subjects: 30 healthy volunteers and 206 orthotopic liver transplantation patients at risk for HBV infection. These patients were included in the 3 clinical studies for the MAA, a non-interventional post authorisation safety and study 987 to support the current application.

In study 987 the total duration of exposure to study medication was 19.92 Patient Years. Safety and tolerability were assessed by number and type of adverse events, safety laboratory measurements, vital signs and body weight.

A total of 139 adverse events were observed in 45/49 (91.8%) patients; this corresponds to an incidence of 7 AEs per Patient Year. Out of these 45 patients, 14 patients (28.6%) experienced serious AEs (all not related to study drug). For one patient (2.0%) the non-serious adverse event (injection site haematoma) was considered treatment-related to study medication. This corresponds to an incidence of one Zutectra related adverse event for the treatment duration of 19.92 Patient Years.

The most common single treatment-emergent AEs experienced during the study were cytomegalovirus infection in 12/49 patients (24.5%), liver transplant rejection or suspicion of liver transplant rejection in 5/49 patients (10.2%) 3 of which were classified as serious AEs, followed by E. coli urinary tract infection, diarrhoea, diabetes mellitus and pyrexia each occurring in 4 patients (8.2%).

In total 24 serious TEAEs occurred in 14/49 patients (28.6%). No SAE reported during the observation period was causally related to Zutectra

There was no death reported in Studies 956, 958, 974, 987 and PASS 978.

In the four studies 956, 958, 974 and 987, routine laboratory assessments (electrolytes, haematology, renal and hepatic function) showed no clinically relevant changes during the study for any subject, nor levels of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, IgM or Complement C3 and C4.

Patients with HIV and/or HCV infection were excluded from the study.  The MAH addresses this as missing information in the RMP and the info is reflected in the SmPC accordingly (section 5.1 SmPC).

Only one patient who experienced the serious TEAE, liver transplant rejection, not related to Zutectra discontinued the study on Day 74 due to this event.  The safety profile remains unchanged.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety data for Zutectra showed an acceptable safety profile. No new safety signals became apparent in the clinical study. The safety profile is in line with the profile described in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of note, the assessment of potential safety signals would have been largely biased by the study design, due to the carry over effect of the IV hepatitis B immunoglobulin in the early study phase.

The exclusion of patients with HIV and/or HCV infection from the study is addressed as missing information in the RMP and is reflected in the SmPC.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.5.4. Direct Healthcare Professional Communication

Not applicable.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC opinion on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2 is acceptable.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

During assessment by CHMP, following amendments were emphasized:

## Section 4.1 Therapeutic indication

1. Section 4.1 \"Therapeutic indication\" of the SmPC: the concomitant use of adequate virostatic agents is currently recommended:

\"The concomitant use of adequate virostatic agents should be considered, if appropriate, as standard of hepatitis B re-infection prophylaxis.\"

The MAH agreed to amend the wording, deleting \", if appropriate,\" emphasising the recommendation of a concomitant use of virostatic agents.

2. Considering protocol amendment 2 requiring historical evidence within the last 3 months that HBV-DNA was undetectable at time point of signature of informed consent, it was advised to reflect this in the amended therapeutic indication (4.1 SmPC).  Besides the HBV-DNA negative status, the MAH proposed to keep also the information regarding HBsAg status:

\"Prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) re-infection in HBsAg and HBV-DNA negative adult patients at least one week after liver transplantation for hepatitis B induced liver failure. HBV-DNA negative status should be confirmed within the last 3 months prior to OLT.  Patients should be HBsAg negative before treatment start.\"

## Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration

A more precise wording is introduced with regard to the monitoring schedule in order to make sure that all subsets of patients are well-controlled while treated with Zutectra. This is ensured by a fortnightly or monthly measurement of serum HBs antibody concentration for the first six months:

\"Patients must be monitored for serum anti-HBs antibody levels regularly. Serum anti-HBs antibody levels should be measured at least every 2-4 weeks and at the discretion of the physician in charge for at least half a year.\"

Depending on the regular anti-HBs antibody level monitoring results the dose can be individually adapted at the discretion of the physician. An individual dose adaption is foreseen.

\"The dose can be individually established and adapted from 500 IU up to 1,000 IU (in exceptional cases up to 1,500 IU) subcutaneous injections on a weekly or fortnightly basis, according to the serum anti-HBs concentrations and at the discretion of the physician in charge. Antibody levels &gt;100 IU/l should be maintained.\"

With respect to the switch to home treatment the SmPC was amended further to emphasise the need of monitoring the anti-HBs level.

\"Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product Injection of the medicinal product by the patient or by caregiver in a home treatment requires training by a physician experienced in the guidance of patients for home treatment. The patient or caregiver will be instructed in injection techniques, the keeping of a treatment diary and measures to be taken in case of severe adverse events. A sufficient surveillance period with stable anti-HBs trough serum levels of &gt; 100 IU/l as well as a fixed dosage regimen is required: the monitoring schedule of patients anti-HBs antibody levels (see above) needs to be closely followed. In addition patient or caregiver must comply with the injection technique as well as with the dosing regimen to ensure anti-HBs trough serum levels &gt; 100 IU/l after extended periods between level controls.\"

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These wordings are also reflected in section 3 of the PL, which was amended as follows:

\"Your doctor will regularly check your condition and tell you how much and how often you need to use Zutectra.\"

\"However, if your antibody levels are sufficient and you have a fixed dose regimen, you or your caregiver may be trained to carry out the injection at home (see below).\"

## Section 4.8 Undesirable effects

According to the 'Guideline on the Core SPC for Human Plasma Derived Hepatitis-B Immunoglobulin for Intramuscular Use (CPMP/BPWG/4222/02), dated April 2006' the MAH added the following threeheadings of the following System Organ Classes : 'Immune system disorder; Cardiac disorder and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder' (Zutectra SmPC 4.8 table).

The PL was adjusted accordingly.

Further on, the introductory sentence was amended as follows in order to reflect the post-marketing experience:

\"Most adverse drug reactions (ADRs) observed in three four clinical trials were mild to moderate in nature. In isolated cases human normal immunoglobulins may cause an anaphylactic shock.\"

## Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

SmPC section 5.1 is amended to reflect the exclusion of patients with HIV or HCV at time of transplantation and also to provide the proportion of patients in study 987 testing positive for HDV:

'(...) At the time of transplantation 21 patients (42.9%) were tested positive for HDV, patients with a positive HIV or HCV test were excluded from study participation.'

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity of this procedure to update the Annex II in compliance with the QRD template version 9.1.

Please refer to Attachment 1, which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Serum anti-HBs levels &gt; 100 IU/L and no clinical, liver function or serological evidence for hepatitis B re-infection were observed. The primary endpoint was met and the result is clinically important since clinical studies in context of the initial MAA demonstrated that serum anti-HBs &gt; 100 IU/L are required for effective prophylaxis against HBV reinfection in OLT patients at risk.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

All patients were converted from the intravenous standard hepatitis B immunoglobulin to subcutaneous

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

injections with Zutectra at 8-11 or 15-18 days after OLT.   Carry-over effect is expected with serum anti-HBs largely driven by the IV preparation. The anti- HBs levels declined constantly during the entire study period. Individualised dose adaptations were common, whenever required according to the serum anti-HBs concentrations.   Home treatment proved feasible, but patients had to be monitored regularly, at least every 2-4 weeks for the first 6 months.

The study duration is relatively short at 24 weeks, since recurrence of HBV in OLT patients has been reported at significantly longer intervals in the literature.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

No new safety signals became apparent in the clinical study. The safety profile is in line with the profile described in section 4.8 of the SPC.

The safety profile of IV, IM and SC immunoglobulins is well established: adverse events include myalgias, predominantly back pain, headache and flushing and hypersensitivity reaction or even anaphylaxis may rarely occur following immunoglobulin administration. Patients with IgA deficiency have a greater risk.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Patients with HIV and/or HCV infections were excluded from the study, thus no safety data are available for this sub-population.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Zutectra is approved for long-term Hepatitis B prophylaxis in patients who underwent liver transplantation at least 6 months ago and who are stable on intravenous hepatitis B immunoglobulin treatment.

For patients who were HBV-DNA negative within the last 3 months before OLT and HbsAg negative prior to start of treatment, study 987, 'ZEUS Study', demonstrated that serum anti- HBs &gt; 100 IU/L were attained with trough level based weekly or fortnightly SC administration of Zutectra.  No clinical, liver function or serological evidence for hepatitis B re-infection were observed.  The primary endpoint was seemingly met and the result is clinically important since clinical studies in context of the MAA demonstrated that serum anti-HBs &gt; 100 IU/L, which are required for effective prophylaxis against HBV reinfection in OLT patients at risk.

The safety profile was excellent and in line with the excellent safety profile for the product class.

## Benefit-risk balance

The MAA could not demonstrate that the observed serological and clinical efficacy is attributed to Zutectra. In order to elaborate how the influence of the carry over effect from the IV immunoglobulins is addressed in the determination of the PK and efficacy for Zutectra SC the MAH provided a simulation exercise. To assess the contribution of the IV treatment to plasma levels, the simulated time course of IV plasma levels was calculated for each evaluable patient based on the pharmacokinetic parameters of Hepatect CP study 953. Given the limitation of the approach, the outcome of the modelling exercise is accepted.

Since a flexible dosage regimen based on the patient's actual anti-HBV level will be applied the concern related to the insufficient described pharmacokinetic profile of Zutectra is not clinically relevant.

Overall, a positive benefit/ risk balance can be concluded.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Zutectra was initially approved in the indication for long-term Hepatitis B prophylaxis in patients who underwent liver transplantation at least 6 months earlier and who are stable on intravenous Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin treatment. The clinical studies performed with Zutectra, Study 956, Study 958, Study 974 and the non-interventional PASS 978, demonstrated that serum anti-HBs &gt; 100 IU/L, which are required for effective prophylaxis against HBV reinfection in OLT patients at risk, were easily attained with weekly SC administration of Zutectra at the recommended dose.

Study 987 demonstrated that early switching after OLT from intravenous hepatitis B immunoglobulin to subcutaneous Zutectra is feasible and allows for protective anti-HBs titres.  Serum anti-HBs levels &gt; 100 IU/L and no clinical, liver function or serological evidence for hepatitis B re-infection were observed. To assess the contribution of the IV treatment to plasma levels, the simulated time course of IV plasma levels was calculated for each evaluable patient based on the pharmacokinetic parameters of Hepatect CP study 953. Given the limitation of the approach, the outcome of the modelling exercise is accepted.

All Patients were converted from the intravenous standard hepatitis B immunoglobulin to subcutaneous injections with Zutectra at 8-11 or 15-18 days after OLT. Considering the treatment schedule for IV hepatitis B immunoglobulins in prevention of hepatitis B re-infection after liver transplantation for hepatitis B induced liver failure and their half-life of 20-25 days, a considerable carry-over effect is expected to be observed with serum anti-HBs largely driven by the IV preparation. The anti- HBs levels declined constantly during the entire study period, which also supports the evidence that the measured effect is related to the IV hepatitis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

B immunoglobulin therapy. Since a flexible dosage regimen based on the patient's actual anti-HBV level will be applied the concern related to the pharmacokinetic profile of Zutectra is not clinically relevant.

The safety profile of IV IM and SC immunoglobulins is well established. The observed safety profile for Zutectra SC administration was consistent with the excellent safety profile of the product class. However since patients with HIV and/or HCV infections were excluded from the study, no safety data are available for this sub-population.

Limitations on the knowledge of the beneficial effects are properly addressed in the RMP and added as appropriate warnings in the Product Information.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, II and IIIB     |

Extension of Indication to Prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) re-infection in HBsAg and HBV-DNA negative patients at least one week - instead of the approved at least 6 months - after liver transplantation for hepatitis B induced liver failure.

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity of this procedure to update the Annex II in compliance with the QRD template version 9.1.

An updated RMP version 2 has been agreed.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).
