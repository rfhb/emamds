## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for sunitinib, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Twelve cases of aortic dissection and aneurysm with a possible causal relationship to sunitinib have been retrieved cumulatively. Based on the evidence from literature, case reports, pathophysiologic mechanisms considering also some cases occurring in patients without hypertension, the fatal outcome observed in 26 cases and overall the severity of the ADR, the product information should be updated to reflect the risk.

A cumulative review of cases related to colitis retrieved 7 cases from clinical trials data and 82 cases from post-marketing for which a causal relationship between the event and sunitinib could not be excluded. Similarly, a search performed on EV database revealed a total of 81 cases (spontaneous and from studies) cumulatively reported. A disproportionality analysis used to evaluate the dataset revealed a positive RORs. Finally, colitis and inflammatory bowel disease are listed for other multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors with similar targets as sunitinib.

As a result, section 4.4 and 4.8 of the Summary of Products Characteristics (SmPC) should be updated to add 'aortic aneurysms and dissections' to the list of adverse reactions with a frequency not known and to introduce a relevant warning.  In addition, section 4.8 of the SmPC should be updated to add the adverse reactions 'colitis' and 'ischaemic colitis' with a frequency uncommon.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for sunitinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing sunitinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
