## 1. Background information on the annual renewal

The European Commission issued on 21 December 2020, a conditional marketing authorisation (MA) for Comirnaty. This implied that, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) has to complete ongoing studies, or to conduct new studies, as listed in Annex II.E of the MA, the so-called Specific Obligations (SOBs). These data form the basis of the renewal of the conditional MA.

A conditional MA is valid for one year and may be renewed annually upon request by the MAH. Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 6(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the MAH BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, submitted to the Agency on 18 June 2021 an application for renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation for Comirnaty. The expiry date of the MA is 21 December 2021.

The period covered by this annual renewal is 21 December 2020 to 29 April 2021.

| SO1 (a)                     | Additional data is to be provided to further characterise the truncated and modified mRNA species present in the finished product. Data are expected to cover batches used in clinical trials (for which the characterisation data could be available earlier) and the PPQ batches. These data should address results from ion pairing RP-HPLC addressing 5'cap levels and presence of the poly(A) tail. These data should further address the potential for translation into Assessment report EMA/707383/2020 Page 37/140 truncated S1S2 proteins/peptides or other proteins/peptides. Relevant protein/peptide characterization data for predominant species should be provided. Any homology between translated proteins (other than the intended spike protein) and human proteins that may, due to molecular mimicry, potentially cause an autoimmune process should be evaluated. | July 2021                        | 02/08/2021           |                                      | Ongoing          |

## SOB 5: Quality: Process and control strategy for the excipient ALC-0159

The due date for this SOB was July 2021 and a variation application EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0054/G is under assessment. Interim reports were submitted in January and April 2021.

## SOB 6: Clinical

In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Comirnaty, the MAH should submit the final Clinical Study Report for the randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study C4591001.

Interim results from study C4591001 were included in the initial Marketing Authorisation Application for Comirnaty, and the study design and results were extensively assessed during the approval procedure. The study is still ongoing according to plan, and final results are expected in December 2023.

## CHMP comment:

Specific Obligations 1,2, 4, 5 and 6 are ongoing and progressing according to plan.

The CHMP issued an opinion on the 20 th  of May 2021 concluding that Specific Obligation 003 had been fulfilled, and therefore deleted from the Annex II.

## 2.3. Overall conclusion on Specific Obligations

During the period covered by this annual renewal, several aspects for all quality SOBs have been addressed.

SOB 004 and SOB 005 relating to the novel excipients are partially fulfilled. The data to fulfil the remaining parts of these SOBs have been submitted in variation EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0054/G and are currently under assessment by the CHMP. A Request for Further Information has been adopted on 14

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

October 2021.

Similarly, data to fulfil SOB 001 (characterisation) and SOB 002 (control strategy &amp; specifications) have been submitted in variation EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0056/G and are currently under assessment by the CHMP. A Request for Further Information has been adopted on 14 October 2021.

Therefore, overall SOB 001, SOB 002, SOB 004 and SOB 005 are not fulfilled at the time point of the present assessment report; nevertheless, the MAH has been compliant in providing the data in response to these SOBs in line with the imposed deadlines, and therefore, the overall status of compliance is satisfactory.

Regarding SOB003 : In order to confirm the consistency of the finished product manufacturing process, the MAH should provide additional validation data, the due date for this SOB was March 2021 and the SOB was fulfilled with the variation EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0023/G (approved on 20 May 2021).

During the period covered by this annual renewal interim data on the clinical SOB 006 have been submitted that overall are compliant in terms of adherence to deadlines and in terms of acceptability of data submitted. The available clinical evidence includes a tolerable safety profile and high vaccine efficacy against COVID19 in individuals ≥12 years of age.

## 3. Additional scientific data provided relevant for the assessment of the benefit/risk balance

## 3.1. Quality

For several of the remaining Quality SOBs the due date was July 2021 and variations EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0054/G and EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0056/G are currently under assessment.

## 3.2. Clinical efficacy

Since approval of Comirnaty the MAH has submitted efficacy and safety data for children 12-15 years of age, and approval of an indication in this age group was obtained on May 31, 2021. (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0030). For further details on the efficacy of Comirnaty, please see the initial marketing authorisation approval.

## 3.3. Clinical safety

The MAH submitted the Addendum to the Clinical Overview (ACO), covering the period from 21 December 2020 until 29 April 2021.

## Worldwide Marketing Authorisation Status

BNT162b2 received a first temporary authorisation for emergency supply under regulation 174 in the UK on 1 December 2020 and in EEA countries on 21 December 2021. Up to the DLP (29 April 2021), it is currently conditionally approved in 42 countries (including EEA).

| Compared to the global supply of BNT162b2, an increased complaints rate for leakages was observed by the MAH in Hong Kong, with 19 vials with leakages reported from 3 different vaccination sites in the country; overall 26 vials with leakages and/or loose caps were reported. All vials were from 1 batch, the only batch in use for vaccination in Hong Kong and Macau. During the investigation, it became apparent that the root cause of the reported product quality complaints is a combination of the container closure process (crimping) at 1 single CMO and of the specific transport conditions on dry ice that are required for BNT162b2. Vaccination in Hong Kong and Macau was stopped as soon as the issue became apparent (24 March 2021). A total of 2 batches have been affected (including the one being used and another one already shipped to Hong Kong, but still in storage) and were quarantined. The root cause of the reported product quality complaints was clearly identified through analysis of the data generated and collected as of 31 March 2021. According to the data, the crimping process used for batches at the CMO fill and finish site requires optimization to ensure the container integrity during storage and shipment with dry ice. Under the ultra-cold conditions created by storing and shipping on dry ice, the stopper loses flexibility and, if not optimally crimped, allows the ingress of ambient gas into the vial. During thawing the flexibility of the stopper is regained and the stopper reseals the vial. This can result in increased pressure in the vial and presence of elevated CO2 levels. Due to the identified root cause the MAH could exclude any influence on batches that are on the market anywhere outside of Hong Kong and Macau. The CMO in question has not manufactured any batch that was released for any market other than Hong Kong and Macau. Vaccinations in Hong Kong and Macau were resumed with a vaccine batch from a different CMO on 3 April 2021; discussions to address the issue and resume supplies with the previous CMO are ongoing, no batches from this CMO are currently distributed. | Hong Kong and Macau | Vaccination in Hong Kong and Macau was stopped on 24 March 2021 and was resumed with a vaccine batch from a different CMO on 3 April 2021 | 24 March 2021    |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH also reported that after the DLP of this ACO , the CDS has been further updated (CDS ver. 4.0 dated 19 May 2021) with the following:

- -a warning on stress-related responses associated with the process of vaccination was added in section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
- -data from studies in section 4.8 Undesirable effects was updated to add available data in 12 to 15-year-old subjects and in stable HIV-infected subjects
- -Decreased appetite, Lethargy, Hyperhidrosis, Night sweating and Asthenia were added as Adverse Drug Reactions in section 4.8 Undesirable effects.

Respectively on 5 May 2021, on 10 May 2021 and on 28 May 2021, BNT162b2 was authorized for use in individuals 12 years of age and older in Canada, in US and in Japan.

Variation 0030 (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0030) was also submitted to EMA on 30 April 2021 to seek expansion of the indication to subjects 12 to 15 years of age; on 28 May 2021, EMA CHMP recommended granting the extension of indication for use in children aged 12-15 years and the European Commission adopted a decision accordingly on 31 May 2021.

## PRAC comment:

The SmPC is in line with the core data sheet (CDS).

Furthermore, the CHMP adopted an Opinion on the 16 th  September 2021 to add asthenia, lethargy, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, and night sweats as side effects to the product information. In addition, following the PRAC meeting in July, myocarditis and pericarditis were added to sections 4.4. and 4.8 of the SmPC, and the package leaflet was updated accordingly.

## Patient exposure

## Clinical studies

Cumulatively up to 21 April 2021, the MAH estimated that 49,315 subjects have participated in the Pfizer-managed studies of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical development program: 195 subjects received BNT162b1 (modRNA which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain); 41,368 subjects received BNT162b2 (modRNA which encodes a membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 fulllength spike) of which, 20,291 subjects, who had received Placebo, were offered BNT162b2 postunblinding and 758 subjects received BNT162b2 and the Blinded boost; 329 received BNT162S017, 6,370 subjects received blinded-therapy; and 1,053 subjects received placebo.

Additionally, 1,691 subjects have participated in 2 studies managed by BioNTech (BNT162-01 and BNT162-04) and in 2 studies (BNT162-03 and BNT162-06) managed by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical in China.

## PRAC comment:

Up to 29 April 2021, it is estimated that over 332 Mio doses of BNT162b2 were administered worldwide.

During the reporting period of this renewal, it is estimated that over 97 Mio doses of Comirnaty were administered in the EU and EEA countries.

## Data in Summary Tabulations

Cumulatively, there have been 882 clinical trial cases (1072 SAEs) reported.

Cumulatively 1  up to 29 April 2021, there have been 109,692 post-marketing cases (414,594 unique PTs) reported. During the reporting interval, there have been 108,980 post-marketing cases (412,318 unique PTs) reported.

## Significant Findings from Clinical Trials and Non-Interventional Studies

## Completed Clinical Trials

No clinical trials were completed up to 21 April 2021.

## Ongoing 2  Clinical Trials

There were 10 ongoing clinical trials up to 21 April 2021 (sponsored by BioNTech SE), out of which 2 studies (BNT162-03 and BNT162-04) for study vaccines BNT162b1 and BNT162b3.

Six studies were conducted by Pfizer: C4591001, C4591005, C4591007, C4591015, C4591017, C4591020.

Four studies were conducted by BioNTech, including 2 studies in China managed by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Development (BNT162-03 and BNT162-06).

Clinically important emerging efficacy and/or safety findings were identified for Study C4591001/BNT162-02 3  and C4591005 and are summarized below.

## · Study C4591001/BNT162-02

Title : A Phase 1/2/3, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Observer-Blind, Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity, and Efficacy of SARS-COV-2 RNA Vaccine Candidates Against COVID-19 in Healthy Individuals

Countries : Argentina, Brazil, Germany, South Africa, Turkey, US

This study is a Specific Obligation in the context of BNT162b2's conditional marketing authorisation and it is being conducted in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of the vaccine; the MAH should submit the final Clinical Study Report, including a 2-year follow up of the studied population.

Study C4591001/BNT162-02 is an ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dosefinding Phase 1/2/3 registration study evaluating the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidates against COVID-19 in healthy individuals.

Study C4591001/BNT162-02 was started as a Phase 1/2 study in adults in the US and was then amended to expand the study to a global Phase 2/3 study to accrue sufficient COVID-19 cases to conduct an efficacy assessment. The protocol was initiated in adults 18 years of age and older and subsequently amended to include adolescents as young as 12 years of age. The study has

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

enrolled approximately 46,000 participants, including 2,260 young adolescents 12 to 15 years of age. Data from the Phase 1 part of the study was the basis for selection of the vaccine candidate and dose level for Phase 2/3. The Phase 2/3 part of the study evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the selected vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, and is intended to support licensure globally.

The available clinical evidence for BNT162b2 includes a tolerable safety profile and high VE against COVID19 in individuals ≥12 years of age.

The potential risks are based on the observed safety profile to date, which shows mostly mild to moderate reactogenicity, an acceptable incidence of severe or serious events, and no clinically concerning safety observations. The vaccine appears to be safe and well tolerated across the safety population and within demographic subgroups based on age, sex, race/ethnicity, country, and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. The preponderance of severe cases of COVID-19, as defined by the FDA Guidance for Industry (June 2020) 4 , in the placebo group relative to the BNT162b2 group (9 of 10) suggests no evidence of vaccine-associated enhanced disease.

Vaccine efficacy was ≥95% for participants without prior evidence of SARS -CoV-2 infection and &gt;94% for those irrespective of prior infections. Observed VE was &gt;93% when data were stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and country with the exception of the 'all others' race group (89.3% VE) and Brazil (87.7% VE).

Severe cases evaluated for efficacy were confined predominantly to the placebo group; only 1 severe case was reported in the BNT162b2 group in the final analysis. The efficacy data suggest high efficacy against COVID-19 in a broad population of individuals.

## · Study C4591005

Title : A Phase 1/2, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, and Observer-Blind Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA Vaccine Candidate Against Covid-19 In Healthy Japanese Adults

Country : Japan

Study C4591005 is a Phase 1/2, randomized, placebo-controlled, and observer-blind study in healthy Japanese adults. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccine candidate (BNT162b2) against COVID-19 administered as two 30-µg doses, 21 days apart, in Japanese adults 20 to 85 years of age.

Clinical laboratory tests were performed for the first 24 participants (12 participants 20 to 64 years of age and 12 participants 65 to 85 years of age) (clinical laboratory subset). Local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site), systemic events (fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, fatigue, chills, new or worsened muscle pain, and new or worsened joint pain), and use of antipyretic medication were collected by all participants in an e-diary from Day 1 through Day 7 after each administration of study intervention. AEs were collected from the time the participant provided informed consent through 1 month after Dose 2. SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICD to approximately 12 months after Dose 2.

In this study, 160 Japanese participants (including 130 participants 20 to 64 years of age [younger age group] and 30 participants 65 to 85 years of age [older age group]) were randomized in an approximate 3:1 ratio of BNT162b2 to placebo. Interim data show BNT162b2 was well tolerated, with local reactions and systemic events mostly mild or moderate in severity, and no immediate AEs within 30 minutes reported. An acceptable safety profile was observed in both younger and older Japanese adults with no SAEs reported through 1 month after Dose 2. Immune responses elicited by BNT162b2 were robust 1 month after Dose 2, consistent with data from the global program. These

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

encouraging results led to the marketing authorization of BNT162b2 in Japan. This study has since been converted to a post-marketing study.

## PRAC comment:

This small study does not add to the current knowledge on the safety profile of Comirnaty.

## Non-Interventional Studies

There were 3 ongoing non-interventional studies (C4591008, C4591012 and C4591006) up to 21 April 2021, which are presented below:

According to the MAH, there was no new safety information reported regarding these ongoing noninterventional studies.

## PRAC comment:

Within the first interim report of the PASS study C4591012, which is listed in the RMP of Comirnaty, (procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/MEA/010), only demographic and clinical characteristics of the two cohorts (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine recipients and seasonal influenza vaccines recipients) were provided. No safety information was provided in the first interim report of study C4591012. Studies C4591008 and C4591006 are not part of the EU RMP.

## Medication Errors

During the reporting interval, there were no serious clinical trial cases contained in the Global safety database that reported medication errors.

From post-authorisation sources, 4,591 cases potentially indicative of medication errors were retrieved from the global safety database worldwide up to 29 April 2021. Upon review, 447 cases were determined to be non-contributory and are not included in the discussion for the following reasons:

- Off-label use or misuse rather than medication error was reported in 95 cases;
- Questions about the scheduling of the 2 doses of BNT162b2 and/or information that the second dose may be administered (but it was not administered yet at the time of reporting) or was scheduled outside the prescribed dosing window were reported in 169 cases;
- No error or intercepted/potential error with BNT162b2 were identified in 183 cases, including 55 cases where the callers asked for information other than the scheduling of the 2 doses of BNT162b2.

Among the 4,144 relevant medication error cases, the following scenarios, were described:

- Medication errors associated with harm [i.e., resulting in adverse reaction(s)] were reported in 154 cases (3.7% of relevant medication error cases);
- Medication errors without harm [i.e. not resulting in adverse reaction(s)] were reported in 3,814 cases (92.0% of relevant medication error cases), of which 2,043 cases involved coreported AEs;
- Potential medication errors were reported in 172 cases (4.1% of relevant medication error cases).
- Intercepted medication errors were reported in 4 cases (0.1% of relevant medication error cases).

The analysis of the relevant cases indicative of medication error did not lead to any change in the RSI with regard to the instructions for preparation, administration or storage of BNT162b2.

## PRAC comment:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No new safety signal was identified from the cases reporting medication errors.

Medication errors are also analysed in the MSSRs for Comirnaty. From the MSSR assessments covering the period from 21 December 2020 to 29 April 2021, no safety issues were identified that required mitigation activity.

The MAH stated that further analysis of cases indicative of medication errors will be provided in the PSUR with DLP of 18 June 2021. This is accepted.

## Non-clinical Data

No new non-clinical safety findings were identified in the period from 21 December 2020 to 21 April 2021.

## Literature

Nonclinical (Published)

According to the MAH, a search of the Medline and Embase databases did not identify non-clinical studies that presented important new safety findings for Comirnaty up to 21 April 2021.

## Clinical (Published)

From a search of the Medline and Embase databases up to 21 April 2021, the MAH identified 4 clinical trials that presented important new safety/efficacy findings for Comirnaty when administered in at risk patients (i.e., patients on haemodialysis) or special population, including elderly and pregnant/lactating women.

Background and objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Patients on dialysis tend to have a reduced immune response to infection or vaccination. We aimed to assess, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the humoral response following vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients on maintenance hemodialysis and the factors associated with it. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: The study included 56 patients on maintenance hemodialysis (dialysis group) and a control group composed of 95 health care workers. All participants had received two doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine. The serology testing was done using Quant II IgG anti-Spike severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) assay by Abbott a median of 30 days after receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. Results: All subjects in the control group developed an antibody response compared with 96% (54 of 56) positive responders in the dialysis group. The IgG levels in the dialysis group (median, 2900; interquartile range, 1128-5651) were significantly lower than in the control group (median, 7401; interquartile range, 3687-15,471). A Mann-Whitney U test indicated that this difference was statistically significant (U=1238; P<0.001). There was a significant inverse correlation of age and IgG levels in both groups. The odds of being in the lower quartile were significantly higher for older individuals (odds ratio, 1.11 per year of age; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.20; P=0.004) and for the dialysis group compared with the control group (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 7.51; P=0.05). Within the dialysis group, older age and lower lymphocyte count were associated with antibody response in the lower quartile (odds ratio, 1.22 per 1-year older; 95% |

Impact of age, ethnicity, sex and prior infection status on immunogenicity following a single dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine: Real-world evidence from healthcare workers, Israel, December 2020 to January 2021. Euro Surveill. 2021; 26(6):2100096. doi: 10.2807/1560- 7917.ES.2021.26.6.2100096 The BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine showed high efficacy in clinical trials but observational data from populations not included in trials are needed. We describe immunogenicity 21 days post-dose 1 among 514 Israeli healthcare workers by age, ethnicity, sex and prior COVID-19 infection. Immunogenicity was similar by ethnicity and sex but decreased with age. Those with prior infection had antibody titres one magnitude order higher than naïve individuals regardless of the presence of detectable IgG antibodies pre-vaccination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Clin Infect Dis. 2021: ciab266. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciab266. (Accepted manuscript). Maternal and cord blood sera were collected from 20 parturients who received the BNT162b2 vaccine. All women and infants were positive for anti S- and anti-RBD-specific IgG. Cord blood antibody concentrations were correlated to maternal levels and to time since vaccination. Antenatal SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may provide maternal and neonatal protection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Objective: In December 2020, 2 lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified messenger RNA-based vaccines received emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration, after their trials demonstrated 94% to 95% efficacy in preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19). Although no lactating people were included in the vaccine trials, national organizations support vaccination of this population, suggesting potential infant protection by passive transfer of maternal antibodies. The authors sought to characterize breast milk levels of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in lactating people undergoing COVID-19 vaccination. Study Design: Participants were prospectively recruited during phase IA rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine at a tertiary care center, after institutional review board approval. Inclusion criteria included lactation and planned vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine. After obtaining informed consent, participants provided frozen breast milk samples at the following time points of vaccination: before, within the first 24 hours, and the following week. Samples were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and antispike immunoglobulin |
| Results: A total of 5 subjects and 29 human milk samples were included in the analysis. All prevaccine milk samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, as defined by the cycle threshold value of >40 for the N1 target. Antispike IgG and IgA levels were significantly elevated relative to the prevaccine baseline at all time points. Antispike protein IgG remained sustained at a significant elevation beginning at 20 days after the first dose compared with the prevaccine baseline (P=.0061), through the final milk sample (day 30-39 P=.0095, >40 days P=.0040. Levels of antispike protein IgA were significantly elevated from baseline, starting 2 weeks after the first dose (P=.0286) through to the final sample (day 20-29 P=.0121, day 30-39 P=.0095, >40 days P=.0040); however, individual level data suggest a possible gradual decline in antispike IgA in human milk over time after the second dose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|       | Conclusion. The Authors characterized longitudinal breast milk levels of antispike IgG/A following Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccination, demonstrating sustained elevation of IgG/IgA levels. This response is similar to previous studies on maternal vaccination, which have shown high levels of breast milk IgA/G production for up to 6 months after vaccination for influenza and pertussis. A concurrent decrease in infant respiratory illness rates suggest that maternal vaccination confers protection against infection in breastfed infants. Thus, the Pfizer-BioNTech/BNT162b2 vaccination may also confer protection against COVID-19 to breastfed infants as well. Our study is limited by a small number of participants, but we report data that suggest a potential immune benefit to infants of lactating people up to 80 days after COVID-19 vaccination. Further studies are needed to characterize the length of antibody production in breast milk and the effect on infant infection rates after maternal COVID-19 vaccination. |

## PRAC comment:

It is agreed with the authors that further investigation regarding vaccination with BNT162b2 in subjects at higher risk of COVID-19 (e.g., patients on hemodialysis) or special populations, including elderly and pregnant/lactating women, is needed. From the literature provided by the MAH, no new safety issues were identified. No changes to the product information are considered warranted at this moment.

Re-opened duetoEMA request to include as adverse reaction in EU SmPC at time of conditional approval. Signal closed on 10 March 2021. | Review of unblinded clinical study data; review of post- authorization and epidemiological safety data (Observed vs Expected analyses) | At the time of conditional approval by the EMA, facial paralysis was added as an adverse reaction toSection 4.8of the EU SmPC per EMA request. Core position: Based on theresults ofthe evaluation to date, a causal association withBNT162b2 has not been established. However, causality assessment will be further informed by additional safety data from clinical study C4591001, and from non- interventional post-authorization safety studies which are expected tocapture data on a sufficiently large vaccinated population to detect an increased risk of Bell's palsy after vaccination through formal comparative analyses. Facial nerve paralysis, an adverse reaction as presented in the SmPC, but not in the CDS, was re-reviewed and closed on 10 March 2021; there was not sufficient evidence toconclude a causal associationtothevaccine. This signal will be re-opened for re-evaluation if appropriate when non-interventional study safety data is available. |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## PRAC comment:

Regarding the ongoing signals ' Myocarditis and Pericarditis ' and ' Dizziness ':

After the DLP of the ACO, section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated with a warning for myocarditis and pericarditis (procedure IAIN/0050). Dizziness was included as part of 'stress-related responses associated with the process of vaccination' in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Myocarditis and Pericarditis were also added as ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

With regards to the closed signals for which signal closed is accepted :

Anaphylaxis: included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC and added as important identified risk in the RMP. Signal closed is accepted.

Hypersensitivity reactions (other than anaphylaxis): included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC (procedure Type II/0016/G).

Signal closed is accepted.

Pain in extremity : included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC (procedure Type II/0016/G). Signal closed is accepted.

Vomiting: included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC (procedure Type II/0016/G). Signal closed is accepted.

Diarrhoea: included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC (procedure Type II/0016/G). Signal closed is accepted.

Tachycardia: as part of a warning about stress-related responses with the process of vaccination added to section 4.4. of the SmPC. Signal closed is accepted.

Vaccine stress-related responses: a warning about stress-related responses with the process of vaccination added to section 4.4. of the SmPC. Signal closed is accepted.

Facial nerve palsy: included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Signal closed is accepted.

Insomnia: included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Signal closed is accepted.

Injection site pruritus: included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Signal closed is accepted.

Overdose: based on review of post-authorisation medication errors of full vial dosing and co-reported adverse event in the 2 nd  MSSR, no significant new safety information was identified and no updates to the Overdose section of labelling was warranted. Signal closed is accepted.

Eye pain &amp; Eye swelling: review of the cases reporting eye pain and/or eye swelling in the 2 nd  MSSR did not suggest a causal association with the Comirnaty vaccine. No update of the included ADRs in the Comirnaty SmPC was considered needed regarding eye pain and eye swelling. Closure of the signal concerning 'Eye pain' and 'Eye swelling' is accepted.

Hearing loss and Tinnitus: In the 3 rd  MSSR AR (covering 1 February until 28 February 2021), based on a cumulative review of the cases reporting hearing loss and/or tinnitus it was concluded that a causal association with Comirnaty exposure was not suggested and the signal was closed.

Seizure: under close monitoring as part of Neurological AESIs in the MSSRs. At the moment no new safety signal of seizure identified. Signal closed is accepted.

Reaction associated with dermal fillers: after the DLP of the ACO, Facial swelling (in vaccine recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers) has been added to section 4.8 of the SmPC (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0038/G). Signal closed is accepted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Delayed skin reactions: based on a review by the MAH of literature and cases reporting delayed skin reactions, a causal association was not supported. Signal closed is accepted.

Delayed syncope: following US-FDA request, delayed syncope and loss of consciousness were evaluated by the MAH. It was concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support a causal relationship to the vaccine. Signal closed is accepted.

Extensive swelling of vaccinated limb: after the DLP of the ACO, Extensive swelling of the vaccinated limb has been added to section 4.8 of the SmPC (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0038/G). Signal closed is accepted.

The closed signals for which however further evaluation is ongoing or requested in MSSR/PSUR and therefore cannot be considered closed are the following:

Paraesthesia : as part of a warning about stress-related responses with the process of vaccination added to section 4.4. of the SmPC. This signal is closed, however, for the 8 th  MSSR (covering 1 July-31 July 2021) the MAH has been requested to provide an analysis of hypoaesthesia and paraesthesia and to discuss whether paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia are sufficiently covered in the product information in the context of stress-related reactions or these should be included in the product information as separate ADRs.

As an outcome of the review provided by the MAH in the 9 th  MSSR, PRAC did not agree that hypoesthesia/paraesthesia is sufficiently covered in the product information by the currently included text regarding stress-related reactions and requested the MAH to add hypoesthesia and paraesthesia to the product information (SmPC section 4.8 and PIL section 4) and to propose a frequency, via an appropriate variation procedure.

Asthenia, Lethargy, Decreased appetite, Hyperhidrosis, Night sweats: the CHMP adopted an Opinion on the 16 th  September 2021 to add as side effects to the product information of Comirnaty.

Deaths including elderly or frail individuals: no new safety information was identified based on review of the fatal cases (EMEA/H/C/005735/LEG/019). Death/fatal cases are reviewed in the MSSRs as a Special Situation.

Immune thrombocytopenia: a re-review of this signal is provided in the PSUR submitted in August 2021.

Thromboembolic events, including those associated with thrombocytopenia: at the moment, there is insufficient evidence to support a causal association. However, TTS (Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome) is an ongoing signal of the MSSR for Comirnaty. In addition, thromboembolic events are reviewed in the MSSRs as AESIs.

Herpes zoster, including ophthalmic herpes zoster: it should be noted that following assessment of the 7 th  MSSR, the MAH was requested to provide an analysis of herpes zoster and discuss possible mechanisms that could underpin herpes zoster reactivation following vaccination, in the PSUR submitted in August 2021.

- a. As per EU RMP ver. 1.0 (dated 21 December 2020).

b. As per the EUA PVP ver. 0.2 (dated 05 December 2021).

During the reporting period, the EU RMP has been updated as follows:

- EU RMP version 1.0 (dated 21 December 2021, when the initial marketing authorization was granted) was updated during the reporting period (EU RMP version 1.1, dated 17 March 2021 and approved on 15 April 2021), to revise the post-authorization vaccine effectiveness study C4591014 included in the RMP (Category 3) as a commitment and to add 2 vaccine effectiveness epidemiology studies (WI235284 and WI255886) not sponsored by Pfizer.
- After DLP of this ACO, on 4 May 2021 and on 14 May 2021, EU RMP version 2.0 (dated 29 April 2021) and version 2.1 (dated 14 May 2021) were submitted.

EU RMP version 2.0 was submitted on 30 April 2021 with Variation 0030 to seek for extension of the indication to individuals aged 12-15 years of age; on 28 May 2021, EMA CHMP recommended granting the extension of indication for use in children aged 12-15 years and the European Commission adopted a decision accordingly on 31 May 2021.

EU RMP version 2.1 has been submitted in the context of Variation 0036.

No changes to the list of the safety concerns were implemented in the above stated EU RMPs during and after the reporting period of this ACO.

## PRAC comment:

Based on the data submitted with the renewal application, no changes are warranted for the RMP.

At the end of the interval period, the missing information ' Use in pediatric individuals &lt;16 years of age ' was re-worded to ' Use in paediatric individuals &lt;12 years of age', which is only applicable for the EUA US PVP.

Furthermore, the CHMP adopted an Opinion on the 16 th  September 2021 for the EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0036 variation in which the RMP version 2.2 was approved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.4. Pharmacovigilance inspections

During the renewal period, the following inspection of MAH's pharmacovigilance system was conducted:

## PRAC comment:

The MAH was requested to provide the findings of the inspection performed by Swissmedic. ( Request for Supplementary Information )

## 4. Risk management plan

The MAH has confirmed the current approved RMP remains unchanged and applicable.

Since the granting of the marketing authorisation, the following changes have been implemented in the RMP:

- Revision of the Pharmacovigilance Plan, including updates on milestones, objectives, study rationale and design;
- Revision of the post-authorization vaccine effectiveness study C4591014 and addition of 2 new vaccine effectiveness epidemiology studies;
- Update of the indication to include individuals aged 12-15 years, with supporting epidemiology and exposure data;
- Inclusion of myocarditis and pericarditis as important identified risks, with supporting data from clinical trials and safety databases and update of the information on planned/ongoing post-authorization safety studies with inclusion of 2 new studies, and the circulation of a DHPC;
- Inclusion of a new formulation and update on potential medication errors.

## 5. Changes to the Product Information

No changes to the Product Information (PI) are introduced with this renewal procedure.

## Additional monitoring

Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Comirnaty (COVID-19 mRNA vaccine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(nucleoside-modified)) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU and it is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation.

The summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet therefore includes a statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle

The audit report is a redacted copy of the final Pfizer response (redacted inspector names and Pfizer names for privacy), also you will notice there are track changes in the report as Swissmedic had asked for updated responses to be tracked in the final response as accepted by Swissmedic. Additionally, please note that this audit report contains information that is considered confidential by Pfizer..

## Assessment of the MAH's response

As requested, the MAH provided the findings of the inspection performed by Swissmedic on 8-9 March 2021. It is acknowledged that the content of the audit report is confidential and therefore is not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

presented in this assessment report. In the context of the MSSR assessment, several comments have been made regarding the handling and presentation of data. The inspection from Swissmedic did not raise additional issues relevant for the EU.

## Conclusion

Issue is solved.

## Question 2

## The MAH is requested to explain what 'BNT162S017' is compared to BNT162b1 and BNT162b2.

## Summary of the MAH's response

The code BNT162S017 reported on page 12 of the Addendum to the Clinical Overview submitted in the renewal application results from a typo and should be read as BNT162b2s01.

The figure 7 at the end of the code refers to the footnote 7 where it is stated that BNT162S01 is also named BNT162SA. In the same footnote (footnote 7, Page 12) BNT162SA should read as BNT162b2SA.

Both these codes (BNT162b2s01 and BNT162b2SA, in the submitted ACO erroneously reported as BNT162S01 and BNT162SA) refer to the same clinical candidate, a new construct based on BNT162b2 and modified to address the B.1.351 lineage, first identified in South Africa. This clinical vaccine candidate has been introduced in study C4591001 / BNT162-02 as part of the global program to address emerging variants.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The code 'BNT162S017' was a typo and should be BNT162b2s01, also named BNT162b2SA , which is explained as a new construct based on BNT162b2 and modified to address the B.1.351 lineage, first identified in South Africa. This is noted.

## Conclusion

Issue is solved.

## 8. Overall conclusions and benefit-risk balance

## 8.1. Specific Obligations (SOBs)

## Compliance of SOB data submitted

During the period covered by this annual renewal, data on the Quality Specific Obligations (SOBs) have been submitted. Interim reports and monthly updates have been provided as requested.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regarding  the  Quality  SOB  003: In  order  to  confirm  the  consistency  of  the  finished  product manufacturing  process,  the  MAH  should  provide  additional  validation  data, on  the  20 th   May  2021, following the assessment of additional validation data (provided in variation EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0023/G), the CHMP was of the opinion that the obligation had been fulfilled, and therefore recommended its deletion from the Annex II.

For the Quality SOB 001, SOB 002, SOB 004 and SOB 005 the due date was July 2021. On 27 July and 2  August  2021  respectively,  the  MAH  submitted  two  variations  (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0054/G  and EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0056/G)  to  provide  the  additional  data  requested  to  fulfil  these  SOBs.  These variations are currently under assessment by CHMP and Requests for Further Information have been adopted on 14 October 2021.

During the period covered by this annual renewal interim data on the clinical SOB 006 have been submitted that overall are compliant in terms of adherence to deadlines and in terms of acceptability of data submitted. The available clinical evidence includes a tolerable safety profile and high vaccine efficacy against COVID19 in individuals ≥12 years of age.

## Updated list of specific obligations (SOBs)

In the framework of a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures:

| Number   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Due date   |

| SOB 001  | In order to complete the characterisation of the active substance and finished product, the MAH should provide additional data.                                                                                                                                                             | July 2021  |
| SOB 002  | In order to ensure consistent product quality, the MAH should provide additional information to enhance the control strategy, including the active substance and finished product specifications.                                                                                           | July 2021  |
| SOB 004  | In order to confirm the purity profile and ensure comprehensive quality control and batch-to-batch consistency throughout the lifecycle of the finished product, the MAH should provide additional information about the synthetic process and control strategy for the excipient ALC-0315. | July 2021  |
| SOB 005  | In order to confirm the purity profile and ensure comprehensive quality control and batch-to-batch consistency throughout the lifecycle of the finished product, the MAH should provide additional information about the synthetic process and control strategy for the excipient ALC-0159. | July 2021  |
| SOB 006  | In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Comirnaty, the MAH should submit the final Clinical Study Report for the randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study C4591001.                                                                                                      | Dec 2023   |

## 8.2. Benefit-risk Balance

During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data have emerged. However, these data do not have an impact on the established benefit-risk balance of Comirnaty in the approved indication.

The data collected as part of the specific obligations for Comirnaty during the period covered by this annual renewal support its positive benefit-risk balance in the approved indication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Favourable effects

The favourable effects were demonstrated in the initial marketing authorisation for persons 16 years of age and older and updated in a type II variation to also include adolescents 12-15 years of age. No additional efficacy data have been submitted during this renewal procedure. The most important favourable effects are briefly summarised below.

The overall vaccine efficacy against symptomatic laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from 7 days after dose 2 was 95.0% (95% CI 90.0, 97.9) in subjects ≥16 years of age without prior evidence of SARS CoV2 infection and 94.6% (95% CI 89.6, 97.6) in all subjects regardless of prior evidence of SARS CoV-2 infection (primary endpoint). This outcome met the pre-specified success criteria.

The efficacy of the vaccine (BNT162b2, 2 doses of 30 µg, separated by 21 days) to prevent COVID-19 in the adolescents aged 12- 15 years either without or with and without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, occurring at least 7 days after the second dose, was 100.0% (CI95% 75.3, 100).

In addition, Comirnaty was shown to elicit non-inferior immune responses in subjects 12-15 years of age without previous Covid-19 compared to subjects 16-25 years in terms of geometric mean titres of neutralising antibodies one-month post dose 2.

## Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

The uncertainties and limitations of favourable effects are similar to those at the time of the initial assessment and were updated in variation EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0030 (12-15-year-old subjects). The principal uncertainties remain on duration of protection and efficacy in risk groups, e.g. pregnant women and immunocompromised subjects. Since the initial approval, uncertainty regarding the vaccine efficacy against upcoming virus variants of concern has arisen with variants of concern (VOC) emergence.

## Unfavourable effects

The safety of Comirnaty was evaluated in participants 16 years of age and older in 2 clinical studies (BNT162-01 and C4591001) that included 21,744 participants that have received at least one dose of Comirnaty in the initial approval application. Overall, the safety profile of Comirnaty is considered acceptable. The product information has been updated since approval as new data has emerged. All data have been assessed in other procedures such as monthly safety updates, signal assessments and variations.

## Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

The uncertainties and limitations of unfavourable effects have been discussed in other procedures. The principal uncertainties are related to long-term effects, and effects in specific risk groups.

## Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

The benefits of Comirnaty in terms of protection against COVID-19 clearly outweigh the identified risks, and no new information has emerged during this renewal period that has changed the balance. The clinical SOBs are currently ongoing, according to plan. The quality related SOBs are also considered either fulfilled or ongoing according to plan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Not Applicable.

## Balance of benefits and risks

Based on the cumulative evidence in terms of favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefit-risk balance of Comirnaty remains positive.

## 9. Recommendations

Based on the review of the available information on the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations, the marketing authorisation holder has complied with the specific obligations and the benefit-risk balance for Comirnaty in its approved indication (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics) continues to be favourable, and therefore the renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation is recommended, subject to the conditions and obligations as detailed in this assessment report.

## Amendments to the marketing authorisation

The renewal requires no amendments to the terms of the marketing authorisation.

## Conditions of the marketing authorisation

The marketing authorisation is subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

## Risk management plan (RMP)

The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

An updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
- Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

## Specific obligations to complete post-authorisation measures for the conditional marketing authorisation

This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures:
