## Sample size

23 patients were enrolled, 18 patients were dosed, and 18 patients completed the study.

## Statistical Methods

A statistical analysis plan (SAP) was developed and finalised before database lock (DBL), which described the patient populations to be included in the analyses and the procedures to account for missing, unused, and spurious data.

No formal statistical hypothesis tests were performed. Categorical data were summarised by the number and percentage of patients in each category. Continuous variables were summarised by descriptive statistics, including the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for non-PK data. Median was presented together with first and third quartile where appropriate. For the summary of PK concentration levels, the geometric mean and CV% based on logtransformed data were also presented. All summary tables presented descriptive statistics and/or frequency by visit unless otherwise stated.

Demographics and patient characteristics were summarised using frequency and percentages (for categorical variables) and n, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum (for continuous variables) using both the PK and safety analysis set.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The frequency and percentages of patient disposition and reasons for withdrawal from the study were presented. Frequency and percentages of patients in each analysis population were provided. Important protocol deviations were defined at patient level prior to DBL and were summarised and listed.

## Pharmacokinetics

Tezepelumab serum concentration data were listed by individual and summarised by nominal time using descriptive statistics, including N, geometric mean, geometric CV%, arithmetic mean, arithmetic SD, median, minimum and maximum. The mean and individual serum tezepelumab concentrations were plotted over time. Based on the serum concentration-time data of tezepelumab, the following PK parameters were estimated using noncompartmental analysis method as appropriate: AUC0-inf, AUC0last, Cmax, tmax, terminal t ½ , CL/F, and Vss/F. In addition to the primary PK parameters, Vz/F was also derived. PK parameters were listed by individual and were summarised using descriptive statistics. The PK analysis was performed using WinNonlin version 8.3.

## Pharmacodynamics

Observed and change from baseline values in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1; observed value and percent of the predicted normal values computed by means of the Global Lung Function Initiative equations), forced vital capacity (FVC), eosinophils and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) were summarised using descriptive statistics. Mean absolute and mean change from baseline values over time for pre-bronchodilator FEV1, FENO, IgE, and blood eosinophil levels were presented.

Data collected by means of the Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ) were listed by individual. In addition, each domain score (i.e., symptoms, activity limitation and emotional function) and the overall score were summarised, presenting descriptive statistics of observed values and change from baseline values at each scheduled assessment visit.

## Immunogenicity

Anti-drug antibody data were summarised using descriptive statistics by visit. Samples confirmed positive for ADA were tested for nAb and listed by patient.

## Safety

Safety data were presented using descriptive statistics except where otherwise specified. The overall number and percentage of patients with adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were presented. The occurrence of AEs was also described by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT), and separately by severity and by relationship to the IP (as determined by the Investigator). Where a patient reported the same PT/SOC within multiple severity or relationship categories, the patient's worst occurrence (most severe/most related) was tabulated. Serious AEs, AEs leading to death, AEs leading to withdrawal from study, commonly occurring AEs, and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were included in key listings.

Laboratory data, including serum chemistry, haematology and urinalysis were summarised by presenting summary statistics of observed values and change from baseline values at each scheduled assessment visit. Shift tables were also presented using normal ranges (baseline to most extreme postbaseline value).

The number of patients with elevated liver function tests that met the Hy's Law definition was summarised and evaluated. Vital signs data were summarised by presenting summary statistics of observed values and change from baseline values at each scheduled assessment visit. Abnormal ECGs (as per Investigator's overall interpretation) were summarised using the frequency and percentage of patients.

## Description of analysis sets

For this study, the following analysis sets were defined per Table 2 :

All PK summaries were based on the PK analysis set. Anti-drug antibodies and PD parameter summaries and safety presentations were based on the safety analysis set.

## Determination of sample size

No formal sample size calculation was conducted for this study. The number of patients was based on the desire to obtain adequate PK and safety data while exposing as few paediatric patients as possible to tezepelumab and study procedures. A total of 12 patients was considered sufficient to provide adequate data to characterise the PK of tezepelumab in ch ildren aged ≥ 5 to 11 years. At least 4 patients were to have a body weight of &lt; 25 kg and at least 3 patients were to have a body weight of ≥ 25 kg and &lt; 40 kg. To reach the goal of having at least 12 patients complete the study, enrolment aimed for approximately 14 patients to receive tezepelumab.

Patients who were eligible to participate but did not go on to receive tezepelumab, or patients who did not complete the required evaluations through to Day 85 could have been replaced to maintain the stipulated number of evaluable patients, at the discretion of the Sponsor.

## Handling of missing data

In the case of a missing value at a scheduled visit, which was then followed by a non-missing value at an unscheduled or repeat assessment within the same visit window, the non-missing value at the unscheduled/repeat assessment was to be used.

If a patient had more than one non-missing value within the same visit window, the following rules applied:

- The non-missing value closest to the target day was selected for analysis at that visit,
- If 2 non-missing values are the same distance from the target day, the earlier of the 2 values was selected for analysis at that visit,
- If 2 non-missing values were recorded on the same day and have a different assessment time associated with both of them, the value with the earliest assessment time was selected for analysis at that visit,
- If 2 non-missing values (for continuous variables) were recorded on the same day and have no assessment time associated with at least one of them, or the same assessment time associated with both of them, the average of the 2 values was selected for analysis at that visit. For categorical variables in this situation, the worst case was used.

If a patient had no value within a particular visit window, then the patient had a missing value on that scheduled study day in summaries and analysis. Where a PK sample was missing for a patient, the pharmacokineticist and Sponsor evaluated the PK samples collected (collection times only, not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concentrations) for the patient and determined if enough samples were collected to report some or all of the protocol defined PK parameters. Data from patients that had missing PK sample(s) were included in concentration-time listings, individual PK profile plots and associated summary statistics. Available PK parameters were included in the PK parameter listing and associated summary statistics.

## Pharmacodynamic results

## Pulmonary function

The change in pulmonary function variables over time are shown in Table 6 . No substantial change was noted in the percent predicted FEV1 or predicted FVC during the study. Similarly, the FEV1/FVC ratio did not demonstrate any substantial change following a single dose of 70 mg SC tezepelumab. No notable changes were observed in pulmonary function parameters following a single dose of tezepelumab.

The mean change from baseline over time in blood eosinophils, serum IgE and FENO values are displayed in Figure 3 , Figure 4 and Figure 5 , respectively. For eosinophils and FENO, the data suggest a trend to an initial reduction at 4 weeks followed by a gradual return to baseline levels. For IgE, the data suggest no notable changes in values over the course of the study.

## Paediatric quality of life

There was a trend towards an improvement in the total score as well as all 3 PAQLQ domain scores (activity limitations, symptoms, and emotional function) from baseline to Study Day 29 with gradual return to baseline by Study Day 85/end of study.

## Immunogenicity results

Anti-drug antibody prevalence (ADA positive at baseline and/or post-baseline) was 16.7% (3/18 patients) ( Table 8 ). One of these patients was ADA positive at both baseline and post-baseline, but the baseline ADA titre did not increase over time. Post-baseline ADA titres were low, being just above the limit of detection. No patient was classified as treatment-emergent ADA positive. No patients were nAb positive.

Patients with multiple events in the same prefered term are counted only once in that preferred tem. Patients with events in more than one prefemed term are counted once in each of those preferred terms. Includes adverse events that occured during the on-study period. On-study is any day between the date of IP administration and study completion or withdrawal date. Percentages are based on the total numbers of patients in the treatment group (N).

AE adverse event; N mumber of patients in treatment group.

Out of 7/18 patients (38.9%) with reported AEs, 2/18 patients (11.1%) reported moderate AEs and 5/18 patients (27.8%) reported mild AEs. No patients reported severe AEs. Adverse events reported as moderate were asthma and cough, each reported in one patient.

No AEs were assessed as causally related to the IP by the Investigator. No AEs with fatal outcome, no SAEs and no AEs of special interest were reported in this study. No adverse events were classified as other significant adverse events.

## Clinical laboratory evaluation

Aside from the expected effect of tezepelumab on lowering blood eosinophil counts, no trends were noted for haematology results. No AEs related to haematology were reported. No AEs related to clinical chemistry were reported and no clinically meaningful trends were noted. There were no individual clinically important abnormalities in clinical chemistry reported. No patients had ALT ≥ 3 × ULN or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and TBL ≥ 2 × ULN. No patients were found to have a clinically meaningful change in urinalysis results during the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical findings and other observations related to safety

There were no clinically meaningful trends in either vital signs or ECG parameters over the course of the study. There were no individual clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or ECG parameters. There were no clinically relevant abnormal medical findings in physical examination observations as compared with the baseline assessment.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the PK of tezepelumab following a single 70 mg SC dose in children aged ≥ 5 to 1 1 years with mild, moderate, or severe asthma. Additional aims were to evaluate the PD, immunogenicity, safety and tolerability. The design and methodology of this study are acceptable.

The PK of tezepelumab in 18 paediatric patients included in this study was well characterised. The mean t1/2 was 25.7 days, which is similar to that previously observed in the adult and adolescent populations.

An exploratory efficacy objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single 70 mg SC dose of tezepelumab on pulmonary function in a paediatric population. No notable changes were observed in FEV1, FVC or FEV1/FVC ratio. However, this study was not powered to detect this effect. Further, only a single dose of tezepelumab was administered.

ADA prevalence and ADA incidence were 16.7% and 0%, respectively. There were no treatmentemergent ADA positive patients in the study. Therefore, the potential impact of ADA on PK could not be assessed. One patient, who was ADA positive at baseline only, experienced an AE during screening, which was assessed as mild. No patients were nAb positive.

There were no safety findings of concern or tolerability concerns reported in the study. A total of 7/18 patients (38.9%) reported AEs, none of which were considered causally related to tezepelumab by the Investigator. Two patients reported moderate intensity AEs (asthma and cough, 1 event in each patient); all other AEs were of mild intensity, and there were no SAEs or AEs resulting in death or study discontinuation.

No clinically meaningful laboratory findings for haematology, serum chemistry, or urinalysis parameters were identified. There were also no clinically relevant findings in vital signs, ECGs, physical findings or other safety-related observations. Overall, the data suggest an acceptable safety profile.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

Overall, the results of this study support the further development of tezepelumab in paediatric patients aged ≥ 5 to 11 years with mild, moderate, or severe asthma . However, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions given the limited number of patients included in this study (n=18). No issues of concern were identified, and no further actions are required.
