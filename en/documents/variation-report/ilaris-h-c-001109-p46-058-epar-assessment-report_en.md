Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

On 02 May 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study Ilaris, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that CACZ885D1401, Drug Use Investigation of ILARIS for s.c. injection 150 mg and ILARIS solution for s.c. injection 150 mg, is a stand alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

ILARIS for s.c. injection 150 mg and ILARIS solution for s.c. injection 150 mg

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- CACZ885D1401, Drug Use Investigation of ILARIS for s.c. injection 150 mg and ILARIS solution for s.c. injection 150 mg

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

CACZ885D1401-Drug Use Investigation of ILARIS for s.c. injection 150 mg and ILARIS solution for s.c. injection 150 mg

## Description

Study ACZ885D1401 was an observational study conducted in, which aimed to evaluate postmarketing safety and efficacy on the long-term clinical use of ILARIS in cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) patients. Study ACZ885D1401 enrolled 41 pediatric subjects (aged &lt;18 years) and concluded on 15-Nov-2021 (final database lock).

ILARIS for s.c. injection 150 mg was approved in for the treatment of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) on September 26, 2011, under the condition that 'Because of the extremely limited number of patients included in clinical studies in, post-marketing surveillance for safety and efficacy should be conducted by registering all patients treated with this drug during the re-examination period or until data from a certain number of patients are accumulated. In the post marketing surveillance, the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment, including the occurrence of infections, should be thoroughly investigated.\"

This was a single-group, multicenter, observational study (drug use investigation) with no control group that is conducted in accordance with the GPSP Ordinance.

The study included an observation period of 2 years and a follow-up period of up to 5 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

All-case surveillance was conducted by the central registration method.

The observation period was 2 years from the start of treatment with ILARIS (for patients who discontinued or dropped out of treatment, until discontinuation or dropout of treatment). For patients who entered from the Japanese clinical trial D2308 (hereinafter, the clinical trial) to the post marketing clinical study after approval of ILARIS and switched from the investigational product to the marketed product, the observation period was 2 years from the switch (for patients who discontinued or dropped out of treatment, until discontinuation or dropout of treatment) with the day of switch as the start date of treatment.

## Study participants

The investigation included all patients who used ILARIS in daily medical practice for a certain period of time after marketing for CAPS, including familial cold auto inflammatory syndrome (FCAS), MuckleWells syndrome (MWS), or neonatal onset multi-system inflammatory disease (NOMID). Patients who entered from a clinical trial to a post marketing clinical study after approval of ILARIS and then switched from the investigational product to the marketed product were also subject to registration. Although the investigation was to be started on or after the date of conclusion of the contract for the investigation, patients who started treatment with ILARIS before the date of conclusion of the contract were also enrolled in the investigation and the case report form was completed for them.

## Treatments

ILARIS for s.c. injection 150 mg and ILARIS solution for s.c. injection 150 mg. This investigation is non-interventional and does not specify a treatment plan, treatment procedures, or visit schedule.

## Objective(s)

The objective of this investigation was to collect and evaluate the following information under the longterm clinical use in CAPS patients who used ILARIS for s.c. injection 150 mg and ILARIS solution for s.c. injection 150 mg.

1. Unknown adverse reactions (particularly important adverse reactions)
2. Understanding of the occurrence status of adverse reactions under the actual use status of the drug
3. Factors that may affect the safety, efficacy, etc.
4. Understanding of safety (occurrence of infections and malignant tumors) and efficacy (severity of symptoms that may affect physical function and life prognosis) in long-term use
5. Priority investigation items:
- Occurrence of infections
- Occurrence of tuberculosis
- Occurrence of severe injection site reactions
- Occurrence of malignant tumors
- Occurrence of demyelinating disorders
- Occurrence of neutropenia
- Occurrence of hypercholesterolaemia
- Occurrence of hepatic function disorder

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

Patient demographics, history of prior treatment (biologics, non-biologics, and non-drug therapies), status of administration of ILARIS, status of drug suspension, status of use of concomitant medications, status of implementation of concomitant therapies, clinical evaluations (auto inflammatory symptoms, treatment response, and symptoms considered to have a significant impact on physical function and life prognosis), laboratory tests (hematology general tests), discontinuation/dropout of treatment with ILARIS, adverse events (presence/absence of adverse events specified as priority investigation items, presence/absence of other adverse events, and details of adverse events), and follow-up.

## Efficacy endpoints

The following analyses were performed for the efficacy endpoints.

- Proportion (%) of patients who did not relapse at Week 24 and thereafter (including patients in whom the dose was increased)
- Response to treatment (proportion of patients with complete remission) by Day 15 after the start of treatment in patients without dose increase and by Day 29 after the start of treatment in patients with dose increase
- Physician's global assessment of auto inflammatory symptoms at Week 24 and thereafter
- Mean CRP and SAA at Week 24 and thereafter
- Efficacy evaluation by patient characteristics
- Physician's assessment of clinical symptoms that may significantly affect the physical function and life prognosis of CAPS patients

## Statistical Methods

Details of the statistical analyses are described in \"Statistical Analysis Plan Ver. 20.0.\"

## Results

## Participant flow and recruitment

In total, 43 pediatric patients were enrolled in the study. The safety analysis set includes 41 patients, of which 39 patients (95.12%) completed the 2-year observation period and 2 patients (4.88%) prematurely discontinued from the study. The reasons for discontinuation were occurrence of adverse events and inadequate response (1 patient, 2.44% each). During the reexamination period, ILARIS was used for in 2 patients for the treatment of hyper-IgD syndrome (mevalonate kinase deficiency), which was not approved at the start of treatment with ILARIS, after consultation with the regulatory authorities. The safety analysis set therefore excludes these 2 patients with off-label use.

## Baseline data

Among the 41 patients in the safety analysis set, the proportion of new patients was 73.17% (30 patients) and the proportion of continued patients was 26.83% (11 patients). The median age (minimum to maximum) at the start of treatment with ILARIS was 5.5 (0 to 17) years in new patients and 10.0 (4 to 17) years in continuing patients. Only new patients had those aged &lt; 2 years (8

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients, 26.67%) included. The median body weight (minimum to maximum) at the start of treatment with ILARIS was 17.35 (2.1 to 53.9) kg in new patients and 23.33 (15.0 to 46.7) kg in continuing patients. Among new patients, the most common phenotypes included were MWS (16 patients, 53.33%) and NOMID (8 patients, 26.67%). A similar trend was observed for continuing patients where the most common phenotypes were NOMID (6 patients 54.55%) and MWS (5 patients, 45.45%).

## Safety results

The occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events in patients aged &lt; 18 years is shown in Table 2-6. The incidence of adverse events in patients aged &lt; 18 years was 92.68% (38 patients), and common adverse events by SOC were \"infections and infestations\" in 73.17% (30 patients) and \"gastrointestinal disorders\" in 31.71% (13 patients). Common adverse events by PT were bronchitis in 36.59% (15 patients) and upper respiratory tract infection in 31.71% (13 patients). The incidence of serious adverse events in patients aged &lt; 18 years was 19.51% (8 patients). Common serious adverse events by SOC were ' infections and infestations ' in 12.20% (5 patients) and \"respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders\" in 9.76% (4 patients). By PT, serious adverse events that occurred in ≥ 2 patients were bronchitis, pneumonia, and asthma in 7.32% (3 patients) each, and neutropenia in 4.88% (2 patients), and the outcomes were all \"resolved\" or \"resolving.\" The outcomes of all other serious adverse events observed in 1 patient each were either ' resolved ' or ' resolving, ' except for papilloedema (with sequelae), circulatory collapse and sepsis (fatal), and rhabdomyosarcoma (unknown). Overall, canakinumab was also well tolerated over longer term treatment in this study population, with no new safety signal detected and no change in frequency of known safety signals.

In the 2 patients excluded from the safety analysis set, 24 adverse events were observed, and all of which were not related to ILARIS (Source: AE\\_L003\\_E). In the first excluded patient, 22 adverse events occurred. Nine events were considered serious by the investigator, including 2 events of vomiting and 1 event each of dehydration, gastroenteritis, tibia fracture, pharyngitis, gastroenteritis

viral, headache, and nasopharyngitis. The outcomes of all 9 serious adverse events were ' resolved. ' The outcomes of the 13 nonserious adverse events were ' not resolved ' for 1 event of inflammation and ' resolved ' or ' resolving ' for the other events. Two adverse events occurred in the second excluded patient. One event of gastroenteritis norovirus was considered serious and 1 event of upper respiratory tract infection was considered non-serious. The outcomes of both events were ' resolved. '

## Death

There was one fatal case.

The events with fatal outcome were circulatory collapse and sepsis, which were both assessed as serious events and assessed as not related to ILARIS. Factors other than ILARIS were the underlying disease or complications. All other adverse events reported in this patient were assessed as not related to ILARIS.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The results of the finalized study CACZ885D1401, Drug Use Investigation, showed the efficacy of canakinumab in maintaining a treatment response and symptom control in the evaluated patients. Results showed a high proportion of complete and long term responders and patients in complete remission without relapse events. The efficacy of long-term treatment with ILARIS in CAPS patients in the routine clinical setting in was therefore consistent with that observed in global clinical studies.

The overall safety profile of canakinumab in this study was consistent with previous global studies without any new safety signals observed and no change in frequency of known safety signals. Infections were the most frequently reported events during the observation. Infections and infestations are already described in the SmPC of canakinumab. The safety data presented showed no new safety findings compared to the known safety profile of canakinumab.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The efficacy and safety results of the presented investigational post approval study in in paediatric and adult subjects do not alter the benefit risk balance.

Overall, the described safety findings are in line with the already known profile reflected in the SmPC.
