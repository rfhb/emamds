## 1. Introduction

Tasigna (nilotinib) 200 mg hard capsule was approved in the EU through the centralized procedure on 19-Nov-2007  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  phase  and  accelerated  phase  Ph+  CML  in  adult  patients resistant to or intolerant to at least one prior therapy including imatinib. Subsequently, Tasigna 150 mg hard capsule was approved in the EU on 20-Dec-2010 for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in CP. More recently, on 15-Nov-2017 (Procedure EMEA/H/C/000798/X/0088/G), Tasigna was approved in the EU for the treatment of paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in the chronic phase and paediatric patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML  with  resistance  to  or  intolerance  of  prior  therapy  including  imatinib.  This  approval  was accompanied by the approval of new 50 mg hard capsule strength.

Tasigna  was  approved  in  Japan  on  21-Jan-2009  for  treatment  of  imatinib-resistant  chronic  myeloid leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase. Prior to the marketing approval in Japan, limited number of Japanese patients received Tasigna in clinical studies as part of Tasigna clinical development program. Therefore,  the  Pharmaceuticals  and  Medical  Devices  Agency  required  a  conduct  of  a  long-term observational  study  in  Japanese  patients  to  collect  safety  and  efficacy  data  from  all  patients  who received  Tasigna  after  its  launch  in  Japan  (Post-approval  measure).  This  observational  study; CAMN107A1401, was an uncontrolled, open-label, multi-center, observational, post-marketing study in CML-CP  or -AP  adult  and  paediatric  patients  who  received  Tasigna  as  of  16-Feb-2009.  A  central registration system was adopted and all patients who received Tasigna were registered and followed for up to 3 year from the start of the administration of Tasigna. The registration period ended on 13Jul-2015 and the end of investigation occurred on 18-Jan-2019. A total of 7 paediatric patients had been included in the study.

On 11 July 2019, the MAH submitted documentation for the stand-alone submission of the data of the 7 paediatric patients included in the CAMN107A1401 study, in order to adhere to the requirements of Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study CAMN107A1401

## Description

An uncontrolled, open-label, multi-center, observational, post-marketing study in CML-CP or -AP adult and paediatric patients who received Tasigna as of 16-Feb-2009, conducted in Japan

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of Tasigna over long-term clinical use in patients with CML in chronic phase or accelerated phase.

## Study design

An uncontrolled, open-label, multi-center, observational, post-marketing study in CML-CP or -AP adult and paediatric patients who received Tasigna as of 16-Feb-2009.

In order to collect the data on long-term safety and efficacy of Tasigna in Japan, a central registration system was adopted and all patients who received Tasigna from the start of the study (16-Feb-2009) were registered. CRFs of all patients who received Tasigna were screened from 418 sites by the end of investigation occurred on 18-Jan-2019.

## Study population /Sample size

728 patients were included in the efficacy analyses and 928 patients (CML-CP or -AP adult and paediatric patients) were included in the safety analysis including seven paediatric patients. Of the seven paediatric patients, four were boys and three were girls.

## Treatments

Tasigna was administered orally and was available as hard capsule in dosage strengths of 50 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg. The dose of Tasigna in paediatric patients was calculated based on body surface area (230 mg/m2 of Tasigna bid). The daily dose of Tasigna in paediatric patients ranged between 309.0 mg and 800.0 mg (mean daily doses).

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of Tasigna over long-term clinical use in patients with CML in chronic phase or accelerated phase.

## Results

## Efficacy results

## In the overall population

- The response rate (CHR) in the CML-CP hematologic response analysis population was 93.01%. Although it should be noted that the measures in this investigation are slightly different from the data at approval (Study 1101), the response rate was comparably high to the response rate at approval (CHR: 100%).
- The response rate in the CML-CP cytogenetic response analysis population (major CyR) was 75.45%  (complete  66.82%,  partial  8.64%).  Because  of  different  patient  characteristics including  the  presence/absence  of  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  and  a  considerable  number  of patients not evaluable (81 patients), a simple comparison may not be appropriate. However, although the response rate was slightly lower than the response rate at approval (Study 1101) (major CyR: 93.8%, (complete 68.8%, partial 25.0%)), but the complete response rates were similar.
- The  response  rate  (CHR,  MR/NEL,  RTC)  in  the  CML-AP  hematologic  response  analysis population was 68.52%. Although this investigation and the Japanese clinical study data are slightly  different  in  terms  of  variables,  the  result  was  comparable  to  the  response  rate  at approval (Study 1101) (CHR: 71.4%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The response rate in the CML-AP cytogenetic response analysis population (major CyR) was 50.98%  (complete  39.22%,  partial  11.76%).  Because  of  different  patient  characteristics including the presence/absence of inclusion/exclusion criteria, a simple comparison may not be appropriate.  However,  the  response  rate  in  this  investigation  was  higher  than  the  response rate at approval (Study 1101) (Major CyR: 14.3%).

In  the  paediatric  population  (&lt;18  years),  the  complete  hematologic  response  (CML-CP)  rate  was 100.0%.  The  major  cytogenetic  response  (CML-CP),  a  cytogenetic  response  measure,  was  also 100.0%.

## Pediatrics (&lt; 15 years)

In this investigation, 6 pediatric patients (&lt; 15 years) were reported, all of whom had CML-CP. In the pediatric population, the complete hematologic response (CHR) rate was 100.0%. The major CyR, a cytogenetic response measure, was also 100.0% (relevant parts of Table 15-9 &amp; Table 15-10 included below).

## Pediatrics (&lt; 18 years)

In this investigation, 7 pediatric patients (&lt; 18 years) were reported, all of whom had CML-CP. In the pediatric population, the complete hematologic response (CHR) rate was 100.0%. The major CyR, a cytogenetic response measure, was also 100.0% (Table 15-9, Table 15-10).

CML-CP hematological effects of adult (over 18) was 92.93% (617/664 cases) and CML-CPcytogenetic effects of adult (over 18) was 75.15% (490/652 cases). There is no difference between pediatric and adult.

## Safety results

In the overall population

- In  the  safety  analysis  population  (928  patients),  adverse  reactions  occurred  in  720  patients and the incidence was 77.59% (720/928 patients), which was not higher than the incidence of adverse reactions at approval (97.06%; 33/34 patients) in Study 1101.
- Common adverse reactions were platelet count decreased in 14.01% (130/928 patients), blood bilirubin increased in 12.28% (114/928 patients), lipase increased in 9.91% (92/928 patients), hepatic function abnormal in 9.05% (84/928 patients), gammaglutamyltransferase increased in 8.84%  (82/928  patients),  anaemia  in  8.30%  (77/928  patients),  rash  in  7.97%  (74/928 patients), alanine aminotransferase increased in 7.11% (66/928 patients), electrocardiogram QT prolonged in 6.79% (63/928 patients), white blood cell count decreased in 6.36% (59/928 patients) and blood glucose increased in 6.14% (57/928 patients).
- All of these common adverse reactions in this investigation were already observed by approval (Study 1101) and thus expected events in clinical use.
- The  incidence  of  serious  adverse  reactions  in  this  investigation  was  20.26%  (188/928 patients). Common serious adverse reactions were platelet count decreased in 5.06% (47/928 patients) and white blood cell count decreased in 2.16% (20/928 patients). This incidence of serious adverse reactions was not higher than the incidence at approval (Study 1101), which was  35.29%  (12/34  patients).  All  of  these  common  serious  adverse  reactions  in  this investigation were already observed by approval (Study 1101) thus expected events in clinical use.
- The incidences of adverse reactions of priority variables in this investigation were as follows: cardiac disorders in 11.75% (109/928 patients), electrocardiogram QT prolongation in 6.90% (64/928 patients), fluid retention in 8.94% (83/928 patients), interstitial lung disease in 1.29% (12/928  patients),  rash  in  18.21%  (169/928  patients),  haemorrhage  in  0.86%  (8/928 patients), infections in 3.02% (28/928 patients), worsening of hepatic impairment in 53.85% (35/65 patients) and worsening of renal impairment in 21.74% (25/115 patients).
- There  was  no  issue  to  note  about  adverse  reactions  in  patients  with  special  characteristics (pediatrics, elderly, pregnant women, hepatic/renal impairment).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the seven paediatric patients in this study, five patients (71.4%) experienced adverse events. The incidence of adverse events in adults ( ≥ 18) was 77.6% (714/920 cases). One serious adverse event (acne  pustular)  was  reported  and  no  deaths  were  reported  in  paediatric  patients.  All  the  adverse events  were  suspected  to  be  related  to  Tasigna.  Based  on  the  available  data,  no  differences  were observed in the safety profile of Tasigna in paediatric and adult patients in this study (CAMN107A1401) because most adverse events that occurred in paediatric were events that were generally observed in adults.

## Pediatric patients (&lt; 15 years)

In this investigation, 6 pediatric patients (&lt; 15 years) were reported, of whom 4 patients had adverse reactions.

The  following  adverse  reactions  occurred:  acne  pustular,  strabismus,  hepatic  function  abnormal, jaundice,  dry  skin,  rash,  chest  pain,  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  increased,  electrocardiogram  QT prolonged and hepatic enzyme increased in 16.67% (1/6 patients) each.

## Pediatric patients (&lt; 18 years)

In this investigation, 7 pediatric patients (&lt; 18 years) were reported, of whom 5 patients had adverse reactions. The data on the occurrence of adverse events in the safety analysis population are shown in Table 15-6.

Table 15-6. List of adverse events that occurred under 18 years old

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

The following adverse reactions occurred: Hepatic enzyme increased (3 events), Jaundice, Electrocardiogram  QT  prolonged,  hepatic  function  abnormal,  Rash  (each  2  events),  Dry  skin, Strabismus, Headache,  Liver disorder, Bone  pain, Acne  pustular, Chest pain, Blood creatine phosphokinase increased (each 1 event). Only acne pustular was reported as serious event. 7 cases were  reported  in  this  study,  and  71.43%  (5/7  cases)  occurred  adverse  events.  The  incidence  of adverse  events  of  adult  (over  18)  was  77.61%  (714/920  cases).  There  is  no  difference  between pediatric  and  adult,  because  most  adverse  events  that  occurred  in  pediatric  were  events  that  were generally observed even adult.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Study CAMN107A1401 was conducted in CML-CP or -AP adult and paediatric patients to characterize the safety and efficacy profile of Tasigna, in line with the approved marketing authorization in Japan.

The  information  provided  in  the  clinical  study  report  included  the  entire  study  population;  safety analysis  population  consisted  of  928  patients,  and  the  efficacy  analysis  population  consisted  of  728 patients, i.e. adult and paediatric patients, and of these only 7 paediatric patients were included.

In this investigation, 7 pediatric patients (&lt; 18 years) were reported, all of whom had CML-CP. In the pediatric population, the complete hematologic response (CHR) rate was 100.0%. The major CyR, a cytogenetic response measure, was also 100.0%. Compared to this the CML-CP hematological effects of adult (over 18) was 92.93% (617/664 cases) and CML-CPcytogenetic effects of adult (over 18) was 75.15% (490/652 cases). There is no difference between pediatric and adult.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Only one serious adverse event (acne pustular) was reported in a 14-year-old patient, the event was reported to be related to Tasigna as per physician's causality assessment. No new safety events were detected in the paediatric population treated with Tasigna. The safety profile observed in this study is consistent with the known and well characterized safety profile of Tasigna. The benefit risk assessment remains unchanged and positive.
