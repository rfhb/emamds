## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Opdivo (nivolumab) is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (HuMAb), which binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T cell immune responses. Engagement of PD-1 with the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour microenvironment, results in inhibition of T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Nivolumab potentiates T cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands.

Opdivo was granted EU approval through an accelerated assessment procedure on 19-Jun-2015 for the treatment, as monotherapy, of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adult. In parallel, nivolumab was granted EU approval on 20-Jul-2015, under the brand name of Nivolumab BMS, for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic SQ NSCLC after prior chemotherapy in adults. On 28 October 2015, the indication in treatment of locally advanced or metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior chemotherapy in adults was added to Opdivo MA and Nivolumab BMS MA was subsequently withdrawn.

## Problem statement

Kidney cancer accounts for approximately 2%-5% of all cancers worldwide 1,2,3 . Rates of kidney cancer are highest in Europe, North America, and Australia and lowest in India, Japan, Africa, and China 4,5 .

The incidence of RCC varies widely among European countries, with the highest incidence rates reported for the Czech Republic, with up to 15.3 cases per 100,000 among males 4 . Although RCC incidence rates range widely among individual regions, the incidence rate for men is consistently approximately twice as much as that observed for women across all regions examined 4 .

Prognosis of advanced RCC is poor.  Approximately 30% of patients with RCC have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. For patients initially diagnosed with locally advanced RCC, 40% ultimately develop metastatic disease. .  There are several distinct histological subtypes of RCC, including clear cell (reported in approximately 80% of patients), papillary, chromophobe, translocation, and collecting duct tumors.

Important established risk factors that are commonly associated with the development of RCC include smoking and obesity. Patients with a history of smoking were reported to have an increased risk for RCC compared to those with a never-smoker history (RR=1.38; 95% CI: 1.27 1.50), with a dose-dependent increase in risk associated with the number of cigarettes smoked per day.  Excess body weight has also been associated with increased risk for RCC, with a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI resulting in an RR of 1.24 (P &lt; 0.0001) in men and 1.34 (P &lt; 0.0001) in women.

The scientific literature has shown that HIFα signalling is involved in the pathogenesis of clear-cell RCC. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling has been identified as an important target pathway because constitutive activation of the upstream signalling pathway leads to HIFα upregulation and activation.  Constitutive HIFα activation has been demonstrated to lead to the upregulation and activation of several proteins including VEGF, which is involved in tumor proliferation and neovasculature formation. Until 2005, the cytokines IL-2 and IFNα were the only active treatment for advanced RCC. Since 2005, targeted agents have been approved for the treatment of RCC that will specifically act at the level of VEGF and mTOR signalling pathways. Agents that target angiogenesis include VEGFr TKI (eg, sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, and axitinib) and VEGF binding monoclonal antibodies (eg, bevacizumab), while agents that target the mTOR pathway include the mTOR inhibitors (eg, everolimus and temsirolimus).

Everolimus and axitinib are considered the two standard therapies for use after first-line TKI therapy in advanced RCC by ESMO clinical practice guidelines.  In addition, everolimus and axitinib are the only two targeted therapies with a category 1 recommendation in the NCCN guidelines for use in advanced RCC after first-line TKI therapy.

The MAH applied for an extension of indication to add treatment as monotherapy of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after prior therapy in adults, based on Study CA209025; a phase 3 study of nivolumab vs. everolimus in subjects with advanced or metastatic clear-cell RCC who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy, and the CA209010 addendum study report; phase 2 dose-ranging study of nivolumab in subjects with progressive advanced/metastatic clear-cell RCC who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy.

The proposed and recommended indication for nivolumab for RCC is as follows:

## OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma after prior therapy in adults.

The recommended dose and schedule of nivolumab monotherapy for RCC is the same as the approved dose of 3 mg/kg IV infusion over 60 minutes Q2W for melanoma and SQ NSCLC.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data has been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Nivolumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), nivolumab is exempt from preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.2. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA justifying the lack of ERA studies is considered acceptable.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

Nivolumab's clinical pharmacology profile, including single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK), drug-drug interaction potential, QT prolongation potential, and dose selection for phase 2/3 studies was well characterized at the time of the initial marketing authorization.

The nivolumab PPK model was updated to assess the potential effects of tumor type and immunogenicity on nivolumab PK in subjects with advanced RCC. The E-R relationship for efficacy was assessed in subjects with advanced RCC from studies CA209025 (a global, randomized, open-label Phase 3 study of nivolumab monotherapy vs everolimus for advanced or metastatic RCC) and CA209010 (a randomized, blinded, phase 2 dose-ranging study of nivolumab in subjects with progressive advanced/metastatic RCC who have received anti-angiogenic therapy) and the E-R safety relationship was assessed in subjects from Study CA209025. Additionally, an integrated immunogenicity analysis across the solid tumor patient population was performed to assess the incidence and effect of immunogenicity on the pharmacokinetics and safety of nivolumab.

## Population PK analyses

The initial PPK analysis was performed using data from three Phase 1 studies (MDX1106-01, MDX1106-03 and ONO-4538-01 [CA209005]), three Phase 2 studies (CA209010, ONO-4538-02, and CA209063) and three Phase 3 studies (CA209017, CA209057, and CA209025), with a total of 1484 subjects included. Studies CA209010 and CA209025 allowed for the assessment of nivolumab PK in subjects with advanced RCC. Bio-analytical methods used for quantifying nivolumab serum concentrations across the development program were cross-validated, thereby allowed merging of the exposure data for PPK analysis.

The PPK model was developed using a previously developed final model and included the effect of tumor type (RCC, NSCLC, or other), immunogenicity, and albumin on CL and VC. The final model was a 2-compartment model with zero-order IV infusion input and first-order elimination with a proportional residual error model. The final PPK model included effects of baseline WT, eGFR, and ECOG on CL and baseline WT, sex, and NSCLC histology (using the combined SQ and NSQ groups) on VC.

Parameter estimates from the final PPK model are provided in table 1.

D CLREF and VCREF are typical values of CL and VC at the reference covariate values. Covariate effects were NSCLC, and ADA assay negative. The reference values for continuous valued covariates were selected to be approximately the median of the covariate values in the analysis dataset.

The typical value of CL and VC corresponding to continuous valued covariates of subiect i are modeled as:

The magnitude of the effect of covariates on CL, accounting for uncertainty, was within the ± 20% boundaries for all covariates, except BW, serum albumin, other tumor type, and immunogenicity.

## Immunogenicity of Nivolumab

## Immunogenicity Analysis

During the clinical development of nivolumab, three assays were used to detect the presence of nivolumab ADA. The primary study in this submission, Study CA209025, and all of the studies included in the integrated summary of immunogenicity used assay ICDIM 140 V1.00/V2.02 for immunogenicity analysis.

## Immunogenicity Results from Study CA209025

A summary of the ADA assessments for nivolumab subjects on Study CA209025 who had evaluable ADA data at baseline and on treatment is presented in the table below.

Table 4: Summary of anti drug antibody assessments in study CA209025, based on 16-week definition for persistent positive-all nivolumab treated subjects with baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment.

See the narrative for Subject CA209025-31-317 in Appendix 7.4A of the CSR

There were 27 (7.3%) subjects who were ADA positive, of which 1 (0.3%) subject was considered persistent positive and no subjects were neutralizing ADA positive. The highest titer value observed in ADA positive subjects was 256, which occurred in only one subject. This subject had only one ADA positive sample observed at 2 weeks after initiation of nivolumab dosing and no other ADA positive samples (Other category). All other ADA positive subjects had titer values less than 16.

A total of 26 nivolumab treated subjects experienced hypersensitivity/infusion reaction category events and all were ADA negative. Thus, the presence of ADA was not associated with the occurrence of hypersensitivity and/or infusion-related reactions. Overall, it does not appear that immunogenicity had an effect on the safety of nivolumab in Study CA209025. A pooled analysis of nivolumab ADA assessments with data available from several BMS-sponsored studies in which ADA was assessed by a sensitive and drug tolerant assay showed similar results.

## 2.3.4. PK/PD modelling

The exposure-response relationship was characterized for nivolumab exposure (Cavgss) and OS using 596 previously treated subjects with advanced RCC from studies CA209025 and CA209010, who had exposure data available. The relationship between the nivolumab exposure and OS was characterized using a CPH model that incorporated the effects of covariates that may modulate the E-R relationship. The estimated effects of all of the predictor variables (Cavgss, CL, and covariates) on the hazard ratio of OS in the full model are presented in figure 2. Nivolumab Cavgss was not a significant predictor of hazard of death (95% CI of effect included 1) in the full model after accounting for nivolumab CL.

## Exposure-Response Analysis for Safety in RCC

The E-R relationship for safety was characterized for nivolumab exposure and AE-DC/D in 402 previously treated subjects with RCC in studies CA209025 and CA209010. The relationship between nivolumab exposure (Cavgss) and time to AE-DC/D was described by a semiparametric CPH model, and included assessments of the modulatory effect of covariates on the E-R relationship. The covariate variables investigated in the E-R analysis of AE-DC/D included age, baseline body weight, sex, number of prior anti-angiogenic therapies, and baseline performance status (Karnofsky scale).

Figure 3 presents the estimated effects of all of the predictor variables on the hazard of AEDC/ D in the Full Model.

## 2.3.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The PPK analysis included in this submission has shown that nivolumab volume of distribution was similar across tumor types (data not shown).

Overall, immunogenicity was not considered clinically meaningful based on low ADA titers, low persistent positive rates, low incidence of neutralizing antibodies, and minimal impact on nivolumab clearance, with no evidence of altered safety profile and no evidence of loss of activity with neutralizing antibodies.

The results of the analysis demonstrated that Cavgss was not a significant predictor of hazard of death after accounting for nivolumab CL.

The risk of AE-DC/D, appeared to increase with decreasing Cavgss, but this may be due to confounding with variables not included in the analysis.

## 2.3.6. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Pharmacology data are overall in line with previous observed data in NSCLC and melanoma patients. No relevant differences have been observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Dose response study

CA209010 was a randomised, double-blind, 3-arm dose-ranging, Phase 2 study of nivolumab (0.3, 2, or 10 mg/kg) in adult (aged ≥18 years) subjects with advanced RCC with a clear-cell component who had received prior treatment with at least 1 anti-angiogenic therapy in the advanced setting. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups (0.3, 2, or 10 mg/kg) and received nivolumab as an IV infusion over 60 minutes Q3 wks.

CA209010 was designed to investigate the dose-response relationship in the nivolumab treatment groups. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the dose-response relationship in the 0.3, 2, and 10 mg/kg nivolumab groups as measured by PFS. Secondary objectives included the estimation of PFS, ORR, OS, and the rate of adverse events (AEs) in each nivolumab treatment group.

Subjects were evaluated for response according to the RECIST v1.1 criteria every 6 weeks (± 1 week) for the first 12 months from randomisation and then every 12 weeks (± 1 week) until progressive disease (PD) was documented.

The data reported was based on a cutoff date of 15-May-2013. The database lock point for this final analysis occurred on 02-Jul-2013. At the time of this final CSR, the analysis of PFS was completed and evaluation of OS was ongoing. The median number of doses subjects received during the treatment period was 6.0, 7.5, and 8.0 in the 0.3, 2, and 10 mg/kg treatment groups, respectively. A CSR addendum (database lock 12-Mar-2015) was completed to update the results of PFS, DOR, OS, and safety.

## Results

Of the 168 randomized subjects, 167 were treated with nivolumab (59, 54, and 54 subjects in the 0.3, 2, and 10 mg/kg groups, respectively). One subject randomized to the 0.3 mg/kg group was not treated because the subject no longer met study criteria.

- Median age was 61.0 years, with 6.5% aged 75 years or older. Most subjects were white (93.5%) and male (72.0%).
- 33.0%, 42.0%, and 25.0% of randomized subjects in the favorable, intermediate, and poor-risk MSKCC prognostic categories, respectively (IVRS source).
- The median duration of time from initial diagnosis to randomization was 4 years.
- The most common tumor sites reported were visceral/lung (74% overall) and lymph nodes (58% overall).
- Most subjects had a baseline KPS of 80 to 100 (87.5%).
- Most subjects had a quantifiable PD-L1 expression at baseline (88.1%)

## PFS (primary endpoint)

In the CA209010 Addendum, the PFS was similar across treatment groups (Table 5 and Figure 4) and consistent with results reported in the CA209010 Final CSR. Median PFS was reached for each treatment group (2.7,  4.0,  and  4.2  months  in  the  0.3,  2,  and  10  mg/kg  treatment  groups,  respectively).  In  the CA209010  Final  CSR,  a  stratified  log-rank  trend  test  indicated  no  dose  relationship  for  PFS  and  was confirmed  by  estimated  HRs  with  80%  CI  including  1.  The  estimated  HRs  for  the  addendum  likewise indicated no difference in PFS between treatment groups.

## OS (secondary endpoint)

As of the cut-off date, median OS was reached for all three treatment groups in CA209010 (18.5, 25.5, and 24.8 months for the 0.3, 2, and 10 mg/kg treatment groups, respectively). Estimated HRs indicated no statistically  significant  difference  in  OS  between  treatment  groups.  Updated  OS  (estimated  using  K-M methodology) for each treatment group was plotted along with the median and its 80% CI. At the time of the data cut-off, 113 (67%) of 168 randomized subjects had died. The K-M estimations of OS are shown in Table 6 and Figure 5.

## ORR (secondary endpoint)

CR or PR was achieved in 12 out of 60 subjects, 12 out of 54 subjects, and 11 out of 54 subjects in the 0.3, 2, and 10 mg/kg groups, respectively. Time to response ranged from approximately 1.2 to 10 months across treatment groups. The median DOR was achieved in the 2 and 10 mg/kg groups (21.6 and 22.3 months, respectively).

## Treatments

Subjects received one of the following treatments:

- Nivolumab group: nivolumab at 3 mg/kg Q2W by IV infusion.
- Everolimus group: everolimus 10 mg as a daily oral dose.

## Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment

The IVRS randomly assigned subjects in a 1:1 ratio to either nivolumab or everolimus.

## Duration

Patients were allowed to continue their assigned treatment (nivolumab or everolimus) beyond progression as long as a clinical benefit was observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurred.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Dose reductions/Interruptions

For nivolumab, no dose escalations or dose reductions were allowed.

For everolimus, dose reductions and escalations were allowed as per the approved product label or as per standard practice in countries where everolimus is not approved for the treatment of advanced RCC.

Dose delays were permitted for nivolumab and everolimus for up to 6 weeks from the last dose. Delays longer than 6 weeks were allowed only in cases where a prolonged steroid taper was required to manage drug-related AEs, or in some cases, if the delay was due to a non-drug related cause. Prior to re-initiating treatment in a subject with a dosing interruption lasting &gt; 6 weeks, the BMS Medical Monitor must have been consulted. Subjects were to be monitored continuously for AEs while on study. Treatment modifications (eg, dose delay) were to be based on specific laboratory and AE criteria.

## Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments

The following medications were prohibited during the study:

- Immunosuppressive agents (except to treat a drug-related AE).
- Systemic corticosteroids &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent (except to treat a drug-related AE).
- Any  concurrent  antineoplastic  therapy  (ie,  chemotherapy,  hormonal  therapy,  immunotherapy, extensive radiation therapy, or standard or investigational agents for treatment of cancer).
- Live vaccines.
- Strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or PgP inhibitors and strong CYP3A4 inducers were to be avoided by all enrolled subjects. If subjects who received everolimus required moderate CYP3A4 and/or PgP inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers during the course of study drug treatment, dose modifications should have occurred as outlined in the study protocol.

## Sample size

The  sample  size  was  calculated  in  order  to  compare  the  OS  between  subjects  randomized  to  receive nivolumab and subjects randomized to receive everolimus. Approximately 569 events (ie, deaths) with an interim analysis after 398 events (70% of total OS events needed for final analysis) provides 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.76 with an overall type 1 error of 0.05 (two-sided).

The HR of 0.76 corresponds to a 32% increase in the median OS, assuming a median OS of 14.8 months for everolimus and 19.5 months for nivolumab. The stopping boundaries at interim and final analyses were to be derived based on the number of deaths using O'Brien and Fleming α spending function. It was projected that an observed hazard ratio of 0.845 or less, which corresponds to a 2.7 months or greater improvement in median OS (14.8 mo vs 17.5 mo), would result in a statistically significant improvement in OS for nivolumab at the final OS analysis. The final analysis was planned to take place after 569 events (ie, deaths).

Approximately 822 subjects were to be randomized to the two arms in a 1:1 ratio. Assuming a piecewise constant  accrual  rate  (with  a  maximum  rate  of  63  subjects/month  and  an  average  rate  of  41 subjects/month), the accrual was expected to be approximately 20 months. The total duration of the study from start of randomization to final analysis of OS was expected to be 42 months (20 months of accrual + 22 months of follow-up). The table below summarizes the expected timing of each analysis.

## Randomisation

An IVRS randomly assigned subjects in a 1:1 ratio to either nivolumab or everolimus, and stratified by the following  factors:  MSKCC  risk  group  (favorable-  vs.  intermediate-  vs  poor-risk);  number  of  prior anti-angiogenic therapy regimens in the advanced or metastatic setting (1 vs. 2) and region (US/Canada vs. Western Europe vs Rest of World).

The randomization was carried out via permuted blocks within each stratum.

## Recruitment

The  enrolment  period  lasted  approximately  18  months  (Oct-2012  to  Mar-2014).  The  last  subject  was randomized on 11-Mar-2014, and the last patient's last visit date for this CSR occurred on 06-May-2015, providing a minimum follow-up of approximately 14 months.

A total of 146 sites in 24 countries randomized subjects. Of the 821 randomized subjects, 346 (42.1%) were in the US and Canada, 281 (34.2%) were in Western Europe, and 194 (23.6%) were in the 'rest of world'.

## Conduct of the study

The original protocol for this study was dated 18-Jun-2012. Eight country-specific amendments and six global amendments were issued for this study.

There were 15 amendments to the protocol. Of them the amendment 12 and 15 were the most relevant. The former changed the order of the secondary objectives, indicating that ORR would be first after testing OS and then PFS. The amendment 15 modified the protocol to allow the crossover from everolimus to nivolumab (nivolumab extension phase) and defined the interim analysis as final analysis.

Relevant protocol deviations were low in frequency (12 subjects [1.5%]) and similar between treatment groups: 7 subjects (1.7%) and 5 subjects (1.2%) in the nivolumab and everolimus groups, respectively. The most common relevant protocol deviation was subjects receiving concurrent anti-cancer therapy while on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study treatment: 8 subjects (1.0%) (3 subjects [0.7%] in the nivolumab group and 5 subjects [1.2%] in the everolimus group).

## Baseline data

A total of 821 subjects were randomized (1:1), 410 to nivolumab and 411 to everolimus. Most of the patients received treatment (406 and 397 patients, for nivolumab and everolimus, respectively).

Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two groups. The median age was 62 years (range: 18-88) with 40% ≥65 years of age and 9% ≥75 years of age. The majority of patients were male (75%) and white (88%), all Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk groups were represented, and 34% and 66% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80% and 90 to 100%, respectively. The majority of patients (72%) were treated with one prior anti-angiogenic therapy. The median duration of time from initial diagnosis to randomisation was 2.6 years in both the nivolumab and everolimus groups. The median duration of treatment was 5.5 months (range: 0- 29.6+ months) in nivolumab-treated patients and was 3.7 months (range: 6 days-25.7+ months) in everolimus-treated patients.

Souroe: Table S.3.1

The MSKCC and Heng risk group breakdown was as expected for an advanced RCC population:

- 49.2% and 15.1% of subjects were in the intermediate or poor MSKCC risk groups at baseline (IVRS), respectively.
- 58.8% and 21.8% of subjects were in the intermediate or poor Heng risk groups at baseline (CRF), respectively.

Between the 2 treatment groups, the most common site of disease was the lung (67.1%), followed by the lymph node (49.0%), and 'other' (36.2%) sites.

Most randomized subjects had a quantifiable PD-L1 status at pre-study (baseline) (756/821, [92.1%]). Subjects  were  enrolled  regardless  of  PD-L1  expression  level,  and  PDL1  expression  level  was  not  a stratification factor.

## Medical History

Abnormal physical examination findings were reported at baseline for 42.2% of subjects randomized to nivolumab and 40.6% of subjects randomized to everolimus. The most frequent body system ( ≥ 10% of subjects) with abnormal physical exam findings at baseline was skin (14.1%) and musculoskelatal (10.0%) in the nivolumab group and skin (11.7%) in the everolimus group.

pre-treatment events were fatigue (19.3%) and cough (11.0%) in the nivolumab group and fatigue (16.3%) in the everolimus group.

## Previous and Subsequent Treatments

The numbers and types of prior cancer therapies (per CRF) were balanced between treatment groups (see table below). The most frequent prior systemic cancer therapies in the metastatic setting (10% of subjects) in the nivolumab and everolimus groups, respectively, were the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors sunitinib (60.0% and 58.9%), pazopanib (29.0% and 31.9%), and axitinib (12.4% and 12.2%).

## Outcomes and estimation

Nivolumab  demonstrated  superior  OS  and  ORR  compared  with  everolimus.  Responses  to  nivolumab occurred early (median time to objective response: 3.52 months) and were durable.

PFS  was  not  statistically  significant,  but  the  available  data  suggested  a  benefit  with  nivolumab  vs. everolimus (HR: 0.88 [95%CI: 0.75, 1.03], stratified log-rank test p-value = 0.1135), with separation of the K-M curves after 6 months favouring nivolumab.

Of 803 treated subjects, 179/406 (44.1%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 183/397 (46.1%) subjects in the everolimus group were treated beyond initial RECIST v1.1 progression. Of the 179 subjects in the nivolumab group treated beyond initial RECIST v1.1 progression, 51 experienced non-conventional benefit (ie, durable reductions and/or stabilization in the size of target lesions after initial progression).

## OS (primary endpoint)

Nivolumab  demonstrated  superior  OS  compared  with  everolimus  (HR:  0.73  [98.52%  CI:  0.57,  0.93]; stratified log-rank test p-value = 0.0018).

Median OS was 25.00 months in the nivolumab group and 19.55 months in the everolimus group. OS rates were higher in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group at 6 months (89.2% vs 81.2%, respectively) and 12 months (76.0 % vs 66.7%, respectively).

The Kaplan-Meier curves for OS separated early, favouring nivolumab.

Source: Figue S.5.1

A total of 227 (55.4%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 196 (47.7%) subjects in the everolimus group were censored. At the time of this database lock point, a higher proportion of subjects in the nivolumab group vs the everolimus group were still on treatment (16.3% vs 6.8%), and a similar proportion were either in follow-up (36.6% vs 36.7%) or off study (2.4% vs 4.1%).

Median follow-up for OS (time between randomization and death or last known date alive) was 18.25 months (range: 0.0 to 30.7 months) in the nivolumab group and 17.22 months (range: 0.0 to 31.5 months) in the everolimus group.

Follow-up for OS was current for the majority of subjects; 96.1% and 93.9% of randomized subjects in the nivolumab and everolimus groups, respectively, either died or had a last known alive date on or after the last patient last visit date for the CSR of 06-May-2015.

Results of 3 sensitivity analyses (unstratified analysis, analysis using stratification factors as determined at baseline [CRF source], and analysis of all treated subjects) were consistent with the primary OS analysis. In a multivariate analysis of OS, the treatment effect when adjusted for time from diagnosis to start of first systemic therapy in metastatic regimen (&lt; 1 year), baseline ANC &gt; ULN, and baseline platelets &gt; ULN, was consistent with the primary OS analysis (HR: 0.73; stratified Cox model p-value = 0.0030). Time from diagnosis to start of first systemic therapy in metastatic regimen, baseline ANC, and baseline platelets were significant prognostic variables for OS.

## PFS (secondary endpoint)

While not statistically significant, PFS data suggested a benefit with nivolumab vs everolimus (HR: 0.88 [95%CI: 0.75 to 1.03], stratified log-rank test p-value = 0.1135), with separation of the K-M curves after 6 months favouring nivolumab; see Table 14 and Figure 8.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The median PFS was 4.60 months in the nivolumab group and 4.44 months in the everolimus group.
- The 6-month PFS rate was 39% in both treatment groups and the 12-month PFS rate was 23% in the nivolumab group and 19% in the everolimus group.
- The K-M curves overlapped until approximately 6 months and then separated, favouring nivolumab beyond this time point and more pronounced over time when looking at the tail of the curve (Figure 8).
- 318 (77.6%) subjects had a PFS event in the nivolumab group (311 progression and 7 deaths) and 322 (78.3%) subjects had a PFS event in the everolimus group (312 progression and 10 deaths);
- 92 (22.4%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 89 (21.7%) subjects in the everolimus group were censored. Among the randomized subjects censored on the date of last on study tumor assessment (72 [17.6%] nivolumab and 55 [13.4%] everolimus), the most common reason for censoring was 'still on treatment' in the nivolumab group (47 [11.5%] subjects) and 'received subsequent anti-cancer therapy' in the everolimus group (28 [6.8%] subjects).

Results of 3 sensitivity analyses of PFS (analysis using stratification factors as determined at baseline [CRF source],  analysis  accounting  for  assessment  after  subsequent  therapy,  and  analysis  accounting  for radiographic progression or death) were consistent with the primary PFS analysis.

## ORR

The investigator-assessed ORR using RECIST v1.1 which was superior in the nivolumab group (103/410, 25.1%) compared with the everolimus group (22/411, 5.4%), with a stratified CMH test p-value of &lt; 0.0001 (Table 15).

- BOR was CR in 4 subjects (1.0%) in the nivolumab group and 2 subjects (0.5%) in the everolimus group
- BOR was PR in 99 (24.1%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 20 (4.9%) subjects in the everolimus group.
- BOR was unable to be determined (UTD) in 23 (5.6%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 47 (11.4%) subjects in the everolimus group (see Table 15 for all reasons for UTD).
- In both treatment groups, the main reason for BOR UTD was 'death prior to disease assessment.'
- For the 2 subjects in the everolimus group with 'not reported' as the reason for BOR UTD, the BOR was reported as 'not evaluable', with no specified reason provided.

Reductions in target lesion tumor burden appeared to be deeper in the nivolumab group as compared to the everolimus group.

The ORR with a confirmatory scan after at least 4 weeks (ie, confirmed ORR) was superior in the nivolumab group (88/410, 21.5%) compared with the everolimus group (16/411, 3.9%), with a stratified CMH test p-value of &lt; 0.0001.

## DOR

Median TTR was 3.52 months in the nivolumab group and 3.70 months in the everolimus group (see table below). The majority of responses occurred within the first 4 months (77/103 [74.8%] for nivolumab and 14/22 [63.6%] for everolimus).

At the time of the database lock point, the proportion of responders with an ongoing response of PR or CR (as of the last tumor assessment before censoring) was 49/103 (47.6%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 10/22 (45.5%) subjects in the everolimus group (Table 14, Table 16, and Figure 9).

Median DOR was 11.99 months in both treatment groups. In the nivolumab group, 49 responders were censored (36 still on treatment, 9 in follow-up, and 4 received subsequent anti-cancer therapy). In the everolimus group, 10 responders were censored (7 still on treatment, 1 in follow-up, 1 received subsequent anti-cancer therapy, and 1 withdrew consent).

Among subjects with a BOR of SD, the median duration of SD was 5.59 months (95% CI: 5.36, 7.36) in the nivolumab group (25/141 [17.7%] subjects with ongoing SD) and 7.29 months (95% CI: 5.88, 7.75) in the everolimus group (47/227 [20.7%] subjects with ongoing SD).

## Quality of life results

Overall survival could be accompanied by an improvement over time in disease related symptoms and non-disease specific quality of life (QoL) as assessed using valid and reliable scales in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index-Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS) and the EuroQoL EQ-5D. Apparently, meaningful symptom improvement (MID=2 point change in FKSI-DRS score; p&lt;0.001) and time to improvement (HR= 1.66 (1.33,2.08), p&lt;0.001) were significantly better for patients on the nivolumab arm. While both arms of the study received active therapy, the QoL data should be interpreted in the context of the open-label study design and therefore cautiously taken.

## Nivolumab Subjects Treated Beyond RECIST v1.1-Defined Progression

A total of 44.1% (179/406) of treated subjects in the nivolumab group and 46.1% (183/397) of subjects in the everolimus group were treated beyond progression (defined as a last dosing date after a RECIST v1.1 progression date).

Of the 179 subjects treated beyond progression in the nivolumab group, 51 were considered non-conventional benefiters, defined as subjects who had not experienced a BOR of PR/CR prior to initial RECIST v1.1-defined progression, and met at least 1 of the following criteria:

Criterion 1: Appearance of a new lesion followed by decrease from baseline of at least 10% in the sum of the target lesions (15 subjects).

Criterion 2: Initial increase from nadir ≥ 20% in the sum of the target lesions followed by reduction from baseline of at least 30% (5 subjects).

Criterion 3: Initial increase from nadir ≥ 20% in the sum of the target lesions or appearance of new lesion followed by at least 2 tumor assessments showing no further progression defined as a 10% additional increase in sum of target lesions and new lesions (44 subjects).

## Ancillary analyses

## Results according to PD-L1 expression

Subjects were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 tumor membrane expression levels were evaluated using a novel automated IHC assay incorporating a rabbit-anti-human PD-L1 antibody. PD-L1 expression was defined as the percentage of viable tumor cells demonstrating plasma membrane PD-L1 staining in a minimum of 100 evaluable tumor cells per this validated Dako PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay. All  randomized subjects had tumor samples available, and subjects with evaluable pre-study (baseline) tumor samples were tested for PD-L1 expression. The majority of samples (74.7%) were collected at the primary tumor site.

Most subjects (92.1%) had a quantifiable PD-L1 level at pre-study (baseline), and the proportion of subjects with quantifiable PD-L1 expression was balanced between the treatment groups (90.2% nivolumab and 93.9% everolimus) (see table below).

Efficacy results were generally consistent across PD-L1 expression levels (1%, 5%, or 10%), with the exception of the OS result in the small subgroup of subjects with ≥10% PD-L1 expression (n = 32 nivolumab and n= 30 everolimus).

## OS per PD-L1 expression

Nivoumab  demonstrated  superior  OS  compared  with  everolimus  regardless  of  PD-L1  expression. Kaplan-Meier plots of OS by PD-L1 expression at the 1% level are provided in Figure 10, with unstratified HRs and 95% CIs provided in Figure 11.

- In subjects with pre-study (baseline) PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%:
- o Median OS (months) was 21.82 for nivolumab subjects compared to 18.79 for everolimus subjects.
- o The OS HR (nivolumab over everolimus) was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.17).
- In subjects with pre-study (baseline) PD-L1 expression &lt; 1%:
- o Median OS (months) was 27.37 for nivolumab subjects compared to 21.22 for everolimus subjects.
- o The OS HR (nivolumab over everolimus) was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.97).

There was longer median OS in subjects with &lt; 1% PD-L1 expression relative to subjects with ≥ 1% PD-L1 expression (Figure 10).

- The OS HR for PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% vs &lt;1% was 1.27 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.78) in the nivolumab group and 1.24 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.70) in the everolimus group.

## PFS per PD-L1 expression

Results  across  pre-study  (baseline)  PD-L1  expression  subgroups  were  similar  to  the  PFS  result  in  all randomized subjects.

- In subjects with pre-study (baseline) PD-L1 expression ≥1%:
- o Median  PFS  was  5.36  months  for  nivolumab  subjects  compared  to  4.17  months  for everolimus subjects.
- o The PFS HR (nivolumab over everolimus) was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.57, 1.12).
- In subjects with pre-study (baseline) PD-L1 expression &lt; 1%:
- o Median  PFS  was  3.94  months  for  nivolumab  subjects  compared  to  4.67  months  for everolimus subjects.
- o The PFS HR (nivolumab over everolimus) was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.07).

Similar  to  the  K-M  curve  of  the  all  randomized  population  (Figure  8),  the  K-M  PFS  curves  for  PD-L1 subgroups overlapped initially and then separated, favoring nivolumab, becoming more pronounced over time when looking at the tail of the curve.

## ORR per PD-L1 expression

In the nivolumab group, objective responses were observed in subjects regardless of PD-L1 expression. In the everolimus group, no objective responses were observed in the ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and indeterminate/not evaluable PD-L1 expression subgroups.

- A  higher  ORR  was  observed  in  nivolumab-treated  vs  everolimus-treated  subjects  across  PD-L1 expression subgroups.
- In the nivolumab group, the ORR was higher for subjects with ≥ 1% PD-L1 expression (30.9%) than subjects  with  &lt;  1%  PD-L1  expression  (22.8%)  (see  table  below).  At  a  cut-off  of  5%  for pre-treatment tumour PD-L1 expression, nivolumab-treated patients with ≥ 5%PD-L1 expression had an ORR  of 43%  (95%CI:  28.3-59.0), compared to 22%  (95%CI:  18.0-27.3) for nivolumab-treated patients with &lt;5% baseline PD-L1 expression.

## OS per subgroups

Subgroup analyses were conducted using an unadjusted univariate Cox model to assess the impact of baseline MSKCC risk group, number of prior antiangiogenic regimens in the advanced/metastatic setting; region, age category, gender, race, smoking status, Karnofsky performance status, prior cytokine in the advanced/metastatic setting, time from diagnosis to start of first systemic therapy in metastatic regimen, and Heng risk group.

The OS unstratified HR favored nivolumab vs. everolimus for all pre-defined subgroups, with the exception of the ≥75 years and  Asian subgroups (Figure 12 ). The CIs in these subgroups were wide and encompassed 1.0 due to small subgroup sizes.

The poor MSKCC risk subgroup and Karnofsky performance status &lt; 90% subgroup showed the greatest OS benefit with nivolumab vs. everolimus.

In  the  sub-population  of  subjects  (N=  46  and  52  in  the  nivolumab  and  everolimus  treatment  groups, respectively) without nephrectomy enrolled in study CA209025, patients on nivolumab had substantially better ORR (15.2% [6.3-28.9] vs 1.9% [0-10.3]) than patients on everolimus.

## PFS per subgroups

Subgroup analyses of PFS were conducted for the following: baseline MSKCC risk group, number of prior anti-angiogenic regimens in the advanced/metastatic setting; region, age category, gender, race, smoking status,  Karnofsky  performance  status,  prior  cytokine  in  the  advanced/metastatic  setting,  time  from diagnosis to start of first systemic therapy in metastatic regimen, and Heng risk group.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Non applicable

## Clinical studies in special populations

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with nivolumab in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of malignant solid tumours.

## Elderly patients

Regarding elderly patients, a relatively large number of patients aged ≥65-&lt;75 years of age was enrolled in the pivotal study, and superiority of nivolumab over everolimus was demonstrated in this population. A relatively small number of patients aged ≥75 years of age was enrolled, and in this population no clear benefit from treatment with nivolumab relative to everolimus could be established (HR: 1.23, 95%CI: 0.66-2.31, for OS).

## Supportive study

See dose-response section of this AR.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

CA209025 was a randomized, open-label study that included subjects with advanced RCC who had received prior therapy.

The inclusion/exclusion criteria recruited a population in second line of RCC (clear cell) according to the current clinical practice.

However it should be noted that third line patients could be also included into the trial. As per current guidelines (NCCN version 3.2015 Kidney Cancer) cytoreductive nephrectomy (when possible) is recommended in stage IV disease. From the full list of inclusion criteria, it appears that patients that were not amenable to this procedure were also eligible for enrolment in the study. The results in terms of ORR and OS in this sub-group point out the better results for those treated with nivolumab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects were randomized 1:1 to nivolumab or everolimus and stratified according to the following factors: region, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk groups and number of prior anti-angiogenic therapies. These stratification factors were considered acceptable. MSKCC or Heng's model are widely used.

The primary objective was to compare the OS of nivolumab vs everolimus. A single pre-planned interim OS analysis was to be conducted when at least 398 (70%) of the 569 required events for the final analysis had been reported. This formal comparison of OS allowed for early stopping and would become the final analysis if results were statistically significant (P ≤0.0148) and clinically meaningful.

The secondary endpoints of investigator-assessed ORR and PFS (per RECIST v1.1) were tested hierarchically to preserve the experimental-wise type I error rate at 5%. The endpoints were considered acceptable.

Given that OS was the primary endpoint, the open label design was considered acceptable. However, for determination of the secondary endpoints PFS and ORR, investigator-assessed RECIST measurements were used, and no use was made of independent review committee (IRC)-based RECIST measurement. This approach was chosen despite the advice to use IRC-based response evaluation, as previously recommended by the CHMP (scientific advice EMEA/H/SA/2253/2/2011/II). The use of investigator-assessed response determination was not considered adequate in view of the open-label nature of the study, and the consequent high risk of bias influencing determination of PFS. However, this uncertainty is no longer relevant given the magnitude of the effect in terms of OS observed in favour of nivolumab treatment.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The baseline characteristics were evenly balanced between both arms. The majority of subjects were men and white (75% and 88% respectively) with only 9% &gt; 75 years. The majority of the population included in the study were in the intermediate and poor MSKCC risk group. The disease characteristics and prior treatments are reflecting the current clinical practice. Almost 83% did not receive cytokine agents in previous treatments and the majority of patients received 1 prior anti-angiogenic therapy (76.0%) with 23% receiving two.

Results from study CA209025 are based on a pre-defined interim analysis (clinical database lock of 18-Jun-2015). This interim analysis, according to the protocol and SAP was to be conducted when at least 398 (70%) of the 569 required events for the final analysis had been reported. The independent DMC reviewed the interim OS data on 17-Jul 2015. The DMC confirmed that the pre-specified boundary for significance was crossed (P &lt; 0.0148) and noted that there were no new safety signals that would affect continuation of the study. The last subject was randomized on 11-Mar-2014, and the last patient's last visit date occurred on 06 May 2015, providing a minimum follow-up of approximately 14 months (median of 18.25 months for nivolumab and 17.22 months for everolimus).

The analysis of the primary endpoint (OS) revealed a longer survival for patients treated with nivolumab vs everolimus (HR: 0.73 [98.52% CI: 0.57, 0.93]; stratified log-rank test p value = 0.0018). The median of OS for nivolumab group was 25 months, whereas subjects treated with everolimus achieved a median of OS of 19.55 months. This gain in OS (5.45 months) is considered clinically meaningful. The survival rate at 1 year was higher in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group (76.0% vs 66.7%). The profile of the Kaplan-Meier curves showed a clear separation.

This result seems quite robust, since 3 different sensitivity analyses (unstratified analysis, analysis using stratification factors as determined at baseline [CRF source], and analysis of all treated subjects) demonstrated similar results (HR and 98.5% CI; 0.76 [0.59, 0.97], 0.70 [0.54, 0.90] and 0.72 [0.56, 0.93] respectively). In addition, the results obtained with the multivariate analysis (adjusted for time from diagnosis to start of first systemic therapy in metastatic regimen (&lt; 1 year), baseline ANC &gt; ULN, and baseline platelets &gt; ULN) was also similar with the main analysis (HR: 0.73; stratified Cox model p-value = 0.0030).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Also, the low degree of censoring prior to ~15 months (the minimum follow-up for OS) in both treatment groups substantiate the maturity of the results.

Subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy was received by 67.3% of nivolumab subjects and 69.1% of everolimus subjects. The most frequently treatments administered were axitinib (24.1% vs 36.3%) and pazopanib (9.0% and 15.6%) for nivolumab subjects and everolimus subjects respectively. Of note, 25.6% of patients previously treated with nivolumab received everolimus after progression, versus 5.6% of the patients in the everolimus arm. However, the OS benefit seen for patients treated with nivolumab in comparison to those treated with everolimus, does not seem to be largely influenced by the use of more or more effective post study treatment by patients treated with nivolumab. More patients in the everolimus arm had post study treatment and the kind of used post study treatments was (apart from anti PDL-1 treatment in the everolimus arm) not different in the two study arms.

The subgroups analysis are consistent with the main study results.

Of note, in the sub-population of subjects (N= 46 and 52 in the nivolumab and everolimus treatment groups, respectively) without nephrectomy enrolled in study CA209025, patients on nivolumab had substantially better survival benefit (mOS: 19.78 [11.3-24.61] vs 8.48 [4.73-13.40]; HR 0.56, p=0.0188) than patients on everolimus.

Regarding the secondary endpoints, there is a lack of difference in PFS between the two treatment arms. This is discordant with the large treatment effect observed on the primary endpoint OS. A potential explanation could be related to the delayed effect of nivolumab.  In previous studies with nivolumab it was observed that there is a delay in the effect of nivolumab, for example observed in melanoma patients with rapid disease progression (before 3 months of treatment) where the effect of nivolumab seems to be limited. However, in that case also a delay effect on OS was observed.

Although, the discrepancy between the observed PFS and OS results are not yet completely explained, it is unlikely that the OS benefit seen for nivolumab in comparison to everolimus is caused by subsequent use of different post study treatments in the nivolumab arm.

ORR was superior in the nivolumab group (25.1% vs 5.4%; 21.5% vs 3.9% with a confirmatory scan after at least 4 weeks) even though the medians of the duration of response were identical (11.99 months).

A relatively large proportion of patients were treated beyond progression in both treatment arms: 44.1% (179/406) of treated patients in the nivolumab group and 46.1% (183/397) of patients in the everolimus group were treated beyond progression. Despite a similar proportion of the patients being treated beyond progression, there was a clear and large difference in the treatment duration, demonstrating that patients in the nivolumab arm were treated far longer beyond progression than patients in the everolimus arm.

The analysis of PD-L1 expression did not offer any conclusive data, probably due to the sample size of each subgroup. Overall, no effect on the predictive value of PD-L1 was observed in both treatment arms.

The biomarker analysis presented by the Applicant was not comprehensive, and additional analyses can be envisioned which may lead to improved understanding of predictive biomarkers in patients treated with nivolumab, including: determination of other biomarkers (including but not restricted to PD-L2, PD-L1, mismatch-repair status) and alternative methods for immunohistochemical scoring of PD-L1/PD-L2 (e.g. expression localisation [e.g. tumour center vs. invasive margin], tumour versus immune cell staining).

The impact of different biomarkers on nivolumab treatment will still be further investigated for all approved indications including RCC, post approval. Further investigations on the potential role of PD-L1/2 expression, or any other biomarker, on the efficacy of nivolumab in RCC was considered needed, consistent with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

previous requirements for already approved indications. The annex II conditions have been updated to include the exploration of biomarkers in the RCC indication.

In the pivotal study, only patients pretreated with antiangiogenic therapy were enrolled. Some limited data in patients without prior antiangiogenic therapy (9 out of 34 subjects from a phase 1 clinical trial) support that efficacy appears in line to that of patients pretreated with antiangiogenic therapies, but  given the limited data available, no definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of nivolumab in this subgroup of patients can be drawn. However, as nivolumab has a different mode of action than the anti-VEGF and mTOR inhibitor therapies currently indicated for RCC, it is probable to extrapolate the rational that nivolumab would be effective after another treatment other than antiangiogenic therapy. Hence, a restriction to only after prior anti-angiogenic therapy is not deemed adequate. It is noted that antiangiogenic therapies constitute the  current  standard  of  care  in  first  line,  therefore,  it  is  expected  that  patients  treated  without  prior antiangiogenic treatment in the clinical practice would be limited. However, physicians should be aware of the existing limitations and appropriate information has been included in Section 5.1.

In addition, no patients with non-clear cell RCC have been treated with nivolumab, but in light of the unique mechanism  of  action  of  nivolumab  which  is  independent  of  any  specific  mutations  such  as  the  Von Hippel-Liday (VHL) mutation, restrictions based on histology subtype are not deemed appropriate. This is consistent with regulatory precedent, taking also into account the rarity of non-clear cell RCC.  Additional data  will  be  generated  in  this  subgroup  of  patients  from  an  ongoing  study  (study  CA209374)  at post-approval. The lack of clinical data for nivolumab in patients with non-clear cell RCC has been mentioned in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The treatment with nivolumab in patients with RCC previously treated has shown a longer survival than everolimus. This result was considered clinically meaningful.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy (changes underlined):

To further investigate the value of biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status at tumour cell membrane level by IHC (e.g., other methods / assays, and associated cut-offs, that might prove more sensitive and specific in predicting response to treatment based on PD-L1, PD-L2, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes with measurement of CD8+T density, RNA signature, etc.) as predictive of nivolumab efficacy. This will be provided for all the approved indications:

- Melanoma: studies CA209038 and CA209066
- RCC: studies CA209025 and CA209009

To further investigate the associative analyses between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression conducted in Study CA209066 and CA209025.

Also, the CHMP recommended that the efficacy results, of study CA209374 (on-going), for the sub-group of patients with non-clear RCC should be submitted post approval.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The assessment of safety of nivolumab in the proposed indication is based on safety data from the pivotal phase 3 study CA209025 and supportive phase 2 study CA209010.

There are no across study integration analyses in this summary of clinical safety. The rationale for not integrating is due to the large sample size in the primary controlled study (CA209025) using the proposed dosing regimen allows for robust characterization of safety, and second, the supportive study (CA209010) was a 3-arm dose-ranging study which evaluated different dosing from the proposed dosing regimen.

The last subject was randomized on 11-Mar-2014, and the last patient's last visit date for this CSR occurred on 06-May-2015, providing a minimum follow-up of approximately 14 months.

At  the  time  of  the  database  lock  for  this  CSR  (18-Jun-2015),  there  were  708  subjects  (88%)  who discontinued study therapy (339 subjects [83.5%] in the nivolumab group and 369 subjects [92.9%] in the everolimus group). The most common reason for discontinuation of study therapy between the 2 treatment groups was disease progression: 285 subjects (70.2%) and 273 subjects (68.8%) in the nivolumab and everolimus groups, respectively.

Subjects were able to receive a higher dose of nivolumab than everolimus (82.0% vs 68.5% received ≥ 90% of the planned dose intensity), an observation consistent with the observed safety profile of both agents, and with protocol-defined dose reductions for everolimus toxicity as per the approved product labeling (Table 21).

In CA209025, nivolumab was administered at 3 mg/kg monotherapy as an IV infusion every 2 weeks. The majority of nivolumab-treated subjects received the intended nivolumab dosing regimen on-study.

The median duration of nivolumab treatment was 5.54 months (range: 0.0 to 29.6+ months) with a median of 12.0 doses received (range: 1 to 65 doses), which was higher than the median duration of everolimus treatment of 3.71 months (range: 0.2 to 25.7+ months) (Figure 15).

Figure 15: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Duration of Study Therapy Subjects -

<!-- image -->

A substantially higher proportion of subjects in the nivolumab group had a duration of therapy lasting &gt; 6 months  than  in  the  everolimus  group,  and  this  trend persisted  for  duration  of  therapy  &gt;  12  months. Accordingly, at the time of analysis, a greater number of subjects were continuing nivolumab treatment than everolimus treatment (67 vs 28 subjects).

A lower frequency of discontinuation for study drug toxicity regardless of causality was observed in the nivolumab group compared with the everolimus group (8.6% vs. 13.4%, respectively). In addition, there were fewer subjects who requested to discontinue study treatment in the nivolumab group compared with the everolimus group (1.2% vs. 4.5%). Nine subjects (2.2%) in the nivolumab group and 14 subjects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(3.5%) in the everolimus group discontinued study treatment due to AEs unrelated to study drug; none of these subjects had disease progression as an additional reason for discontinuation. No subject discontinued nivolumab in the treatment period for a reason listed as 'other'. However, 4 subjects in the everolimus group discontinued treatment for a reason listed as 'other': one subjects  for PI discretion, other subject for CT report suggested radiological progression and investigator used this instead of RECIST to determine that patient had progressed and took them off trial treatment, in other subject the investigator has determined that the patient should receive radiotherapy for cutaneous metastasis and other required interruption of everolimus for greater than 6 weeks.

Reasons  for  withdrawal  of  consent,  when  given,  were:  subject  refusal  to  continue  treatment,  study procedures  and  survival  follow-up  (nivolumab  group);  subject  admitted  on  oncological  network  and accessing on-market everolimus (everolimus group); subject decided to stop the medication and not accept follow-up contact (everolimus group); subject refused further treatment under the protocol and refused surveillance in the site (everolimus group); and subject will see doctor closer to home (everolimus group).

A total of 5 subjects (2 in the nivolumab group and 3 in the everolimus group) discontinued the study treatment for maximum clinical benefit.

## Dose Delay, Dose Reduction, Infusion Interruption, and Reduction of Infusion Rate

Most subjects received all doses of study medication without an infusion interruption (96.6 in the nivolumab group), rate reduction, or delay (Table 22). Dose reductions were not permitted with nivolumab treatment.

## Dose Delays and Interruptions

In the nivolumab group, 51.0% of subjects had at least 1 dose delayed, with 42.4% of subjects in the nivolumab group experiencing an AE leading to dose delay (Table 23). Of subjects who experienced dose delays, most experienced only 1 delay, and the majority of cycle delays were ≤14 days.

A safety update for CA209025 with a database lock (DBL) of 21-Aug-2015, 15.8% of subjects on the nivolumab arm and 6.5% of subjects on the everolimus arm remained on study treatment, and all subjects have had a minimum of 16 months of follow-up. No new safety signals were identified in CA209025 with the longer follow-up. The database lock point of the safety profile for CA209025 is for 18-Jun-2015.

## Adverse events

The primary analyses of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation are based on all treated subjects using a safety window of 30 days after last dose. The 30-day safety window was intended to provide a characterization of the safety experience of nivolumab monotherapy without influence of AEs associated with subsequent therapies. Additional analyses with extended safety follow-up (using a 100-day window), although potentially confounded by subsequent therapies, were conducted to assess differences in safety potentially due to late occurring AEs.

## Safety with Extended Follow-up

Overall, similar frequencies were observed for all-causality, any-grade AEs reported within 100 days of the last dose (extended follow up) compared to those reported within 30 days for the nivolumab group.

- With extended follow-up, the frequencies of all-causality, all-grade SAEs, and Grade 5 SAEs/AEs increased compared to the frequencies reported within 30 days. This increase was observed for subjects in both treatment groups and was primarily due to disease-related deaths as would be expected.
- The frequencies of AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related AEs and drug-related SAEs reported within 100 days of last dose were consistent with those reported within 30 days of the last dose.

A summary of the safety results in all treated subjects in study CA209025 is provided in the table below.

## Selected AEs - CA209025

In  order  to  characterize  AEs  of  special  clinical  interest  that  are  potentially  associated  with  the  use  of nivolumab, the Applicant identified select AEs based on the following 4 guiding principles:

06AUG2015:06:35:44

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- AEs that may differ in type, frequency, or severity from AEs caused by non-immunotherapies
- AEs that may require immunosuppression (e.g., corticosteroids) as part of their management
- AEs whose early recognition and management may mitigate severe toxicity
- AEs  for  which  multiple  event  terms  may  be  used  to  describe  a  single  type  of  AE,  thereby necessitating the pooling of terms for full characterization.

Based on these guiding principles and taking into account the types of AEs already observed across studies of nivolumab monotherapy, endocrinopathies, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, and rash are currently considered to be select AEs. Multiple event terms that may describe each of these were grouped into endocrine, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic, pulmonary, renal, and skin select AE categories, respectively.

Analysis of AEs belonging to select AE categories were not performed on an individual term level, but instead include all terms in each select AE category. The composite group of MedDRA PTs belonging to each select AE category was included in each individual select AE section below. Events of special clinical interest that do not benefit from pooling of multiple terms were analyzed outside of the context of the select AE categories.

Hypersensitivity/infusion  reactions  were  analyzed  along  with  the  select  AE  categories  because  multiple event terms may be used to describe such events and pooling of terms was therefore necessary for full characterization. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions do not otherwise meet criteria to be considered select AEs.

Among nivolumab-treated subjects, skin, GI, renal and hepatic were the most frequently reported select AE categories (≥ 15% of subjects), regardless of causality. The majority of select AEs reported were Grade 1-2, and most were considered drug-related by the investigator.

The most frequently reported (&gt; 10% of subjects) any grade drug-related select AE category with nivolumab treatment was skin (24.9%), followed by GI (12.6%), and hepatic (11.3%). The most frequently reported (≥ 1% of subjects) Grade 3-4 drug-related select AE categories with nivolumab treatment were hepatic (2.7%), GI (2.0%), pulmonary (1.5%); endocrine, renal and skin were each reported by 1.0% of subjects.

The median time to onset varied among the select AE categories. Drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reaction select AEs (any grade) had a median time to onset &lt; 6 weeks after initiation of nivolumab treatment whereas all other categories had a median time to onset &gt; 6 weeks.

The time to resolution also varied among the select AE categories. Most drug-related select AEs (any grade) in the GI, pulmonary, and hypersensitivity/infusion reaction categories had a median time to resolution &lt; 6 weeks after onset. Those in the hepatic category had a median time to resolution 8.00 weeks; while renal and skin categories had a median time to resolution of 31.14 and 20.14 weeks, respectively. Most AEs belonging  to  the  endocrine  select  AE  category  had  not  yet  resolved  due  to  the  continuing  need  for replacement therapy.

## Endocrine Events - CA209025

The endocrine select AE category included the following subcategories: adrenal disorders, diabetes, pituitary disorders, and thyroid disorders. These terms were selected to encompass those considered most likely to be reported in a subject with an endocrinopathy belonging to the subcategories above.

Endocrine select AEs (all-causality, any grade) were reported in 12.3% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 4.8% of subjects in the everolimus group. The majority of endocrine select AEs in the nivolumab group were considered to be drug-related by the investigator.

In the nivolumab group:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Drug-related endocrine select AEs were reported in 39 subjects (9.6%) and the majority of the events reported were hypothyroidism (24 subjects [5.9%]).
- There were 4 subjects (1.0%) with Grade 3-4 drug-related events. Three of these events were considered serious drug-related events (Grade 3-4): 2 subjects (0.5%) had adrenal insufficiency drug-related SAEs, and 1 subject (0.2%) had a diabetic ketoacidosis drug-related SAE.
- One subject (0.2%) reported drug-related events of adrenal insufficiency and hypophysitis that led to treatment discontinuation.
- The median time to onset for any grade drug-related endocrine select AE was 16.00 weeks
- Eight  subjects  with  a  drug-related  event  were  treated  with  immune-modulating  medication,  3 subjects received high-dose corticosteroids.
- Overall, 14 (35.9%) of the 39 subjects with drug-related endocrine AEs had resolution of their events.
- A similar incidence was observed for AEs belonging to the endocrine select AE category reported within 100 days of last dose compared to those reported within 30 days of the last dose.

## Gastrointestinal Events - CA209025

The GI select AE category included the following terms: autoimmune colitis, colitis ulcerative, diarrhea, enteritis,  enterocolitis,  frequent  bowel  movements,  and  GI  perforation.  These  terms  were  selected  to encompass those most likely to be reported in a subject with diarrhea or colitis.

The frequency of GI select AEs (all-causality, any grade) was lower in the nivolumab group than in the everolimus group (24.4% vs 31.2%, respectively). The frequency of drug-related GI select AEs (any grade) was also lower in the nivolumab group than in the everolimus group (12.6% vs 21.2%, respectively).

In the nivolumab group:

- All  drug-related  events  reported  were  diarrhea  (12.3%)  or  colitis  (1.7%),  and  the  majority  of drug-related GI select AEs were Grade 1-2. Seven drug-related GI select AEs were reported as SAEs; for 4 subjects, the AEs led to discontinuation of study therapy.
- -There  were  5  subjects  with  Grade  3  diarrhea  events  reported:  2  subjects  had  SAEs  of diarrhea; 2 subjects had 2 AEs of diarrhea; 1 subject had 4 events of diarrhea reported (2 AEs and 2 SAEs). There were no Grade 4 or 5 events reported.
- -There were 3 subjects with Grade 3 colitis events reported, each subject had 1 event. For 2 of the 3 subjects, the events of colitis were SAEs and drug was withdrawn. There were no Grade 4 or 5 events reported.
- The median time to onset for any grade drug-related GI select AE was 8.29 weeks. The median time to onset of the Grade 3 drug-related events was 20.71 weeks.
- Eleven subjects received immune-modulating medication (high-dose corticosteroids in 10 of the 11 cases) for drug-related GI select AEs.
- The majority of subjects (44 subjects [86.3%]) with drug-related GI AEs (any grade) had resolution of their event. All but 1 subject with Grade 3 drug-related GI select AEs had resolution of their events. The median time to resolution for any grade drug-related GI select AEs was 5.57 weeks.
- A similar incidence was observed for AEs belonging to the GI select AE category reported within 100 days  of  last  dose  compared  to  those  reported  within  30  days  of  the  last  dose.  One  additional drug-related Grade 3 SAE of diarrhea was reported during the extended follow-up period (between 30 and 100 days after last dose).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic Events- CA209025

The hepatic select AE category included the following terms: acute hepatic failure, ALT increased, AST increased,  autoimmune hepatitis, bilirubin  conjugated  increased,  blood  alkaline  phosphatase  increased, blood  bilirubin  increased,  drug-induced  liver  injury,  GGT  increased,  hepatic  enzyme  increased,  hepatic failure,  hepatitis,  hepatitis  acute,  hepatotoxicity,  hyperbilirubinemia,  liver  disorder,  liver  function  test abnormal, liver injury, and transaminases increased. These terms were selected to encompass those most likely to be reported in a subject with hepatitis.

Hepatic select AEs (all-causality, any-grade) were reported in 16.0% of subjects in the nivolumab and 11.3% of subjects in the everolimus groups.

In the nivolumab group:

- Drug-related hepatic select AEs were reported in 46 (11.3%) subjects, and increased ALT, increased blood ALP, and increased AST were the most frequently reported drug-related hepatic select AEs.
- The majority of drug-related hepatic select AEs were Grade 1-2.
- Eleven subjects (2.7%) reported Grade 3-4 drug-related hepatic select events, and most of the AEs were laboratory abnormalities. One of these subjects reported a serious drug-related hepatic select event  for  autoimmune  hepatitis  (and  increased  transaminase)  (Grade  3)  that  led  to  study medication discontinuation. In addition, the following subjects discontinued study medication (all grades): 4 subjects (1.0%) discontinued due to increased ALT, and 3 subjects (0.7%) discontinued due to increased AST.
- The median time to onset of any grade drug-related hepatic AE was 7.21 weeks. The median time to onset of the Grade 3-4 drug-related events (in 11 subjects) was 4.14 weeks.
- Five subjects received immune-modulating medication (high-dose corticosteroids in all cases) for drug-related hepatic select AEs.
- The  majority  of  the  subjects  (37  subjects  [82.2%])  with  drug-related  hepatic  select  AEs  had resolution of their event. Ten of the 11 Grade 3-4 drug-related events resolved, and all of the subjects  with  Grade  3-4  drug-related  events  who  received  immune-modulating  medication  had resolution of their event. The median time to resolution for any grade drug-related hepatic select AE was 8.00 weeks.
- A similar incidence was observed for AEs belonging to the hepatic select AE category reported within 100 days of last dose compared to those reported within 30 days of the last dose.

## Pulmonary Events - CA209025

The pulmonary select AE category included the following terms: acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory failure, interstitial lung disease, lung infiltration, and pneumonitis. These terms were selected to encompass those most likely to be reported in a subject with pneumonitis. Although hypoxia and dyspnea are not included as terms in this category, all events of hypoxia and clinically important events of dyspnea (Grade 1-2 requiring dose modification, Grade 2 requiring treatment, or Grade 3-4) occurring on or after the first day of dosing, were systematically queried by the Sponsor to confirm that an underlying diagnosis such as pneumonitis, rather than a sign or symptom related to another etiology, was reported if available.

Pneumonia was not included as a term in the pulmonary select AE category because of the high frequency with  which  it  was  expected  to  be  reported,  especially  to  describe  infectious  etiologies  rather  than non-infectious pneumonitis. The inclusion of pneumonia as a select AE term would hinder characterization of the true frequency of pneumonitis.

Pulmonary select AEs (all-causality, any-grade) were reported in fewer subjects in the nivolumab group compared  with  the  everolimus  group  (5.7%  vs  18.6%).  The  majority  of  pulmonary  select  AEs  in  the nivolumab group were considered to be drug-related by the investigator.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the nivolumab group:

- Drug-related pulmonary select AEs were reported in 18 subjects (4.4%).
- Pneumonitis (3.9%) and interstitial lung disease (0.5%) were the only drug-related pulmonary select AEs reported.
- The majority of drug-related AEs were Grade 1-2. Drug-related Grade 3-4 events of pneumonitis were reported in 6 subjects (5 subjects with Grade 3 and 1 subject with Grade 4 events). There were no Grade 3-4 interstitial lung disease events reported.
- All 6 drug-related Grade 3-4 pulmonary AEs were considered SAEs; all but 1 event led to treatment discontinuation.
- The median time to onset of any-grade drug-related pulmonary select AE was 16.57 weeks. The median time to onset of the Grade 3-4 drug-related events (in 6 subjects) was 15.79 weeks.
- Fourteen of the 18 subjects with drug-related pulmonary select AEs received immunemodulating medication (12 were high-dose corticosteroids); all 5 subjects with Grade 3-4 events were treated with high-dose corticosteroids.
- Fifteen of the 18 subjects (83.3%) with events (any grade) had resolution of their events. Five of the Grade 3-4 pulmonary events resolved; 1 event of pneumonitis was ongoing at the time of database lock. The median time to resolution for any grade drug-related pulmonary select AE was 5.57 weeks.

A similar incidence was observed for AEs belonging to the pulmonary select AE category reported within 100 days of last dose compared to those reported within 30 days of the last dose. No additional drug-related events were reported during the extended follow-up period (between 30 and 100 days after last dose).

## Renal Events - CA209025

The renal select AE category included the following terms: acute kidney injury, blood creatinine increased, blood urea increased, creatinine renal clearance decreased, hypercreatinemia, nephritis, nephritis allergic, nephritis autoimmune, renal failure, renal tubular necrosis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, and urine output decreased. These terms were selected to encompass those most likely to be reported in a subject with nephritis.

Renal select AEs (all-causality, any-grade) were reported in 17.5% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 14.1% of subjects in the everolimus group. Drug-related renal select AEs were similar between the  2 groups: 6.9% and 8.8% in nivolumab and everolimus groups, respectively.

In the nivolumab group:

- Grade 3-4 drug-related renal select AEs included: increased blood creatinine (0.2%), acute kidney injury (0.7%), and tubulointerstitial nephritis (0.2%). Three subjects (0.7%) reported drug-related renal select SAEs.
- -1 subject had 4-Grade 3 and 1-Grade 4 increased blood creatinine events, and this subject also had a SAE reported of acute kidney injury (Grade 4), which led to study medication discontinuation.
- -1 subject had a SAE of tubulointerstitial nephritis (Grade 3), and study medication was discontinued due to this SAE.
- -1 subject had a SAE of acute kidney injury (Grade 3), and 1 subject had an AE of acute kidney injury (Grade 3).
- The median time to onset of any grade drug-related renal AE in the nivolumab group was 10.64 weeks.
- Seven subjects with drug-related renal select AEs received immune-modulating medication (all high dose corticosteroids).
- Sixteen (59.3%) of the 27 subjects in the nivolumab group with drug-related renal select AEs had resolution of their event. Two subjects with Grade 3-4 events who received immune-modulating

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

medication had resolution of their event in 1.57 weeks. The median time to resolution for any grade drug-related renal select AE was 31.14 weeks.

A similar incidence was observed for AEs belonging to the renal select AE category reported up to 100 days after last dose compared to those reported up to 30 days after last dose.

## Skin Events - CA209025

The  skin  select  AE  category  included  the  following  terms:  autoimmune  dermatitis,  blister,  dermatitis, dermatitis exfoliative, drug eruption, eczema, erythema, erythema multiform, exfoliative rash, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, photosensitivity reaction, pruritus, pruritus allergic, pruritus generalized, psoriasis, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculo-papular, rash papular, rash pruritic, skin exfoliation, skin hypopigmentation, skin irritation, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria, and vitiligo. These terms were selected to encompass those most likely to be reported in a subject with rash.

Skin select AEs (all-causality, any-grade) were reported in fewer subjects in the nivolumab group (37.2%) compared  with  the  everolimus  group  (44.6%).  Most  of  the  skin  select  AEs  were  considered  to  be drug-related by the investigator in both treatment groups.

In the nivolumab group:

- Drug-related skin select AEs were reported in 101 (24.9%) subjects.
- The most frequently reported drug-related terms (&gt; 1% of subjects) were pruritus, rash, rash maculo-papular, and erythema.
- There was no event of toxic epidermal necrolysis reported.
- The majority of drug-related select skin AEs were Grade 1-2; there were 4-Grade 3 drug-related events reported (rash, rash macular, and rash maculo-papular). There were no Grade 4 or 5 events.
- One subject  (0.2%)  had  a  drug-related  skin  select  SAE  (erythema  multiforme),  and  1  subject (0.2%) reported an AE of rash maculo-papular, which led to study medication discontinuation.
- The median time to onset of any grade drug-related skin AE was 8.29 weeks.
- Thirty-one subjects (30.7%) with drug-related events received immune-modulating medication (2 subjects received high dose corticosteroids).
- Seventy-five (75.8%) of the 99 subjects with drug-related skin select AEs had resolution of their event, including 21 of the subjects treated with immune-modulating medication. All 4 subjects with Grade 3 drug-related skin select AEs had resolution of their events. The median time to resolution of any grade drug-related skin select AE was 20.14 weeks.

A similar incidence was observed for AEs belonging to the skin select AE category reported up to 100 days after last dose compared to those reported up to 30 days after last dose.

## Hypersensitivity/Infusion Reactions - CA209025

Hypersensitivity/infusion  reactions  were  analyzed  along  with  the  select  AE  categories  because  multiple event terms may be used to describe such events and pooling of terms is therefore necessary for full characterization. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions do not otherwise meet criteria to be considered a select AE. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions included the following terms: anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, bronchospasm, hypersensitivity, and infusionrelated reaction.

Hypersensitivity/infusion related reactions (all-causality, any-grade) were reported in 6.2% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 1.0% in the everolimus group. Most of the hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were considered to be drug-related by investigators.

In the nivolumab group:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Drug-related hypersensitivity and infusion reactions were reported in 21 subjects (5.2%).
- There  was  1  SAE  reported  of  anaphylactic  reaction,  Grade  4,  which  led  to  study  medication discontinuation. One subject also discontinued study medication due to an AE of an infusion-related reaction (Grade 2).
- The median time to onset of any grade drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reaction was 2.00 weeks.
- Seven subjects with drug-related events received immune-modulating medication; 3 received high dose corticosteroids.
- All subjects with drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reactions had resolution of their event. The median time to resolution of any grade drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reaction was 0.14 weeks.

No  new  Grade  3-4  hypersensitivity/infusion  reactions  were  reported  in  the  extended  follow-up  period between 30 and 100 days after last dose.

## Adverse drug reactions

Safety data to support Section 4.8 of the SmPC were pooled across completed studies in multiple indications using the intended dose and regimen for nivolumab monotherapy. The studies included in the analyses for nivolumab monotherapy (3 mg/kg Q2W) were as follows: three studies in NSCLC (CA209057, CA209017, and CA209063), three studies in melanoma (CA209037, CA209066, and CA209067 [monotherapy arm]) and one study in renal cell carcinoma (CA209025).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The general safety profile in the pooled monotherapy data across indications is consistent with the safety reported for each indication.

The studies used for the pooling of safety data are summarized in the table below.

Abbreviations: NSCLC: non-small cell lung cancer; RCC: renal cell carcinoma.

a Mean duration of study therapy was calculated as total exposure (years) * 12/number of treated subjects.

All studies are Phase 3, with the exception of Phase 2 Study CA209063.

Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy in the different indications is consistent.

In general, the type, frequency, and severity of AEs were consistent across tumour types.

Exposure-adjusted AE incidence rates (events per 100 person-years of exposure) were 1648.7 in RCC, 1747.7 in melanoma, and 1795.6 in NSCLC.

## Safety of nivolumab monotherapy across tumour types

The safety profile of nivolumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy in RCC was compared to the recently submitted pooled safety profiles of nivolumab monotherapy in melanoma and NSCLC.

Studies submitted in support of approval used for comparison of safety of nivolumab 3 mg/kg monotherapy in RCC versus other tumour types (melanoma and NSCLC) are summarized in Table 30. The mean duration of nivolumab therapy and the number of nivolumab doses received was higher in RCC than melanoma and NSCLC.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Serious Adverse Events - CA209025

The overall frequencies of all-causality SAEs (any grade) were similar between the treatment groups (Table 31).  The  SAE  rates  represent  those  for  any  causality  (i.e.  reported  as  related  or  not  related  by  the investigator).

Pleural effusion was considered related to study therapy in each arm. All cases of spinal cord compression in both arms were considered not related to study therapy and most often related to metastatic disease. There were two cases of Grade 3-4 acute kidney injury that were considered related to study therapy in each arm.

All reported cases of malignant neoplasm progression were indicated as not related to study therapy on both arms.  Other  neoplasms  unrelated  to  RCC  were  reported  on  both  arms  and  were  not  categorized  as 'Malignant neoplasm progression.' These included cases of skin cancers (basal, squamous, melanoma). Nivolumab subjects had reports of basal cell and squamous cell (3 each) and malignant melanoma (1). For everolimus there was one report of basal cell. In addition, other types of potentially new neoplasms reported included; neoplasm (1), neoplasm malignant (1) and lung adenocarcinoma (1) for the nivolumab arm, and

duodenal  neoplasm,  lymphangiosis  carcinomatosa,  peritoneal  neoplasm,  neoplasm  and  oesophageal adenocarcinoma (1 each) for the everolimus arm.

MedDRA Version:18.0;CTC Version 4.0

Includes events reported between first dcee and 30 clays after last doee of stucly therapy.

## Study CA209010

The CA209010 CSR included narratives for all nivolumab-treated subjects who experienced a related serious adverse event (SAE, 'related' or 'missing' relationship per investigator's assessment), discontinued study therapy due to an AE, died due to reason other than progressive disease, or had other significant medical events, within 100 days of last dose as defined by the old narrative criteria. In addition, narratives for all nivolumab subjects who experienced any Grade 2 related select AE requiring systemic immunosuppressants to treat the AE were also provided.

## Other Events of Special Interest - CA209025

Other events of special interest are events that do not fulfill all criteria to qualify as select AEs. These events may differ from those caused by non-immunotherapies and may require immunosuppression as part of their management, but do not benefit from pooling of multiple AE terms for full characterization and are therefore presented as unique events rather than using select AE methodology. Other select event categories included myasthenic syndrome, demyelination, Guillain-Barré syndrome, pancreatitis, and uveitis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No  events  of  myasthenic  syndrome,  demyelination,  Guillain-Barré  syndrome,  and  encephalitis  were reported in either the nivolumab or everolimus treatment groups.

The only event of special interest requiring treatment with immune-modulating medication was 1 case of uveitis in the nivolumab treatment group (extended follow-up):

- Immune-mediated uveitis where immune modulating mediation was initiated occurred in 1 (0.2%) subject in the nivolumab group and no subjects in the everolimus group.
- -The nivolumab-treated subject experienced Grade 2 iridocyclitis that was not considered an SAE.
- -This  event  did  not  lead  to  treatment  discontinuation  or  dose  delay.  The  subject  was continuing nivolumab at the time of database lock.
- -The time to onset was 34.71 weeks.
- -The subject received a topical corticosteroid (intraocular administration) for treatment of the event.
- -The event resolved (per investigator assessment) in 3.14 weeks. The subject had complete resolution (i.e., resolution with completion of immune-modulating medication).
- -The subject was re-challenged with nivolumab treatment and had a successful/negative re-challenge (i.e., no recurrence with re-treatment).

In addition events of special interest not requiring treatment with immune-modulating medication were reported (extended follow-up) in 2 nivolumab-treated subjects.

- Immune-mediated pancreatitis (not treated with immune-modulating medication) occurred in 2 (0.5%) subjects in the nivolumab group and no subjects in the everolimus group. In the nivolumab group:
- -There was 1 subject with Grade 2 pancreatitis that was not considered an SAE and was not drug-related and 1 subject with Grade 3 pancreatitis that was considered an SAE and was not drug related.
- -Neither event led to treatment discontinuation and the Grade 3 event resulted in dose delay.
- -The median time to onset was 20.29 weeks (range: 16.6 to 24.0 weeks).
- -As stated above, neither event was treated with immune-modulating concomitant medication.
- -Both  pancreatitis  events  resolved  (per  investigator  assessment),  with  a  median  time  to resolution of 16.29 weeks (range 9.1 to 23.4 weeks).

Another event of special interest observed in CA209025 was systemic inflammatory response syndrome. One subject  (CA209025-29-988) had 2 Grade 3 drug-related SAEs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome reported during the extended follow-up period (start/stop: 22-Dec-2014 to 24-Dec-2014 and 20-Jan-2015 to 29-Jan-2015). The subject was treated with systemic corticosteroids from 07-Jan-2015 to 17-Jan-2015 and 21-Jan-2015 to 23-Jan-2015, and both events resolved.

There were no events of toxic epidermal necrolysis reported in CA209025.

## Deaths - CA209025

Prior to the database lock point, fewer subjects had died in the nivolumab group (181 subjects [44.6%]) compared with the everolimus group (213 subjects [53.7%]); see Table 32.

- Disease  progression  was  the  most  common  cause  of  death  for  both  groups,  including  deaths occurring within 30 days of last dose and deaths occurring within 100 days of last dose.
- No  deaths  were  attributed  to  study  drug  toxicity  with  nivolumab,  and  2  deaths  (0.5%)  in  the everolimus group were assessed as study drug toxicity: 1 of the subjects died due to septic shock

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(Subject CA209025-118-160) and 1 of the subjects died due to acute bowel ischaemia (Subject CA209025-97-286).

- A reason for death of 'other' was reported by the investigator for 14 subjects in the nivolumab group (none  were  assessed  as  related  to  nivolumab)  and  10  subjects  in  the  everolimus  group,  and 'unknown' for 4 subjects in the nivolumab group, and 8 subjects in the everolimus group. These verbatim terms were consistent with events expected in the population under study.

## Laboratory findings

## Haematology

Haematology  was  assessed  through  laboratory  evaluation  of  haemoglobin,  platelet  count,  leukocytes, lymphocytes, and absolute neutrophils.

In  CA209025,  the  majority  of  subjects  in  the  nivolumab  group  did  not  have  on-study  worsening  in haematology. Any-grade abnormalities in haematology laboratory results relative to baseline were reported less frequently in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group (Table 33).

- The majority of haematology laboratory abnormalities reported in the nivolumab group were Grade 1-2.
- The only Grade 3-4 haematologic abnormalities reported in ≥5% of subjects in the nivolumab group was  haemoglobin  decrease  (8.4%)  and  absolute  lymphocyte  count  decrease  (6.4%).  In  the everolimus  group,  Grade  3-4  haemoglobin  decrease  (15.7%)  and  absolute  lymphocyte  count decrease (11.2%) were also reported in ≥5% of subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- No haematology laboratory abnormalities occurred in ≥10% of subjects in the nivolumab group and at a higher frequency than in the everolimus group (between-group difference of ≥5% [all grades] or ≥2% [Grades 3-4]).

A low number of nivolumab and everolimus treated subjects experienced a ≥2-grade shift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality.

## Serum Chemistry - CA209025

## Liver parameters

Liver function was assessed through serum chemistry laboratories (AST, ALT, ALP, and total bilirubin) and review of AEs related to hepatic function abnormalities.

The majority of subjects in both treatment groups did not have on-study worsening in liver function tests. Most abnormalities in liver function were Grade 1-2 in both treatment groups (Table 34).

## Renal parameters

Serum creatinine that worsened relative to baseline (any grade) was reported in 42.2% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 44.9% of subjects in the everolimus group. Changes in serum creatinine during the study were similar between the two treatment groups. Grade 3-4 abnormalities in serum creatinine were reported in 2.0% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 1.6% of subjects in the everolimus group.

It was acknowledged that GFR was not a significant covariate on nivolumab CL and had no meaningful clinical  relevance  on  nivolumab  CL  (&lt;20%  effect  on  CL).  As  renal  impairment  does  not  affect pharmacokinetics of nivolumab, it is not expected to have an impact on the safety profile. No nivolumab dose adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment.

## Thyroid function tests

The majority of subjects in both groups had normal TSH levels at baseline and throughout the treatment period (Table 36).

- The proportion of subjects with elevated TSH &gt; ULN who had TSH ≤ULN at baseline was higher in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group (19.6% and 10.5%, respectively). The proportion of subjects with TSH &gt; ULN and at least 1 FT3/FT4 value &lt; LLN was higher in the nivolumab group (13.4%) than the everolimus group (5.0%).
- The proportion of subjects with TSH &lt; LLN with at least 1 FT3/FT4 test value &gt; ULN was higher in the nivolumab group (5.0%) than the everolimus group (2.5%).
- No meaningful differences were noted between treatment groups for subjects with on treatment TSH &lt; LLN who had TSH ≥LLN at baseline.

## Electrolytes

Most subjects in both treatment groups had normal electrolyte levels during the treatment reporting period (Table  37).  Abnormalities  in  electrolytes  were  primarily  Grade  1  to  2  in  severity.  Hypercalcaemia, hyperkalaemia, and hyponatraemia occurred in ≥10% of subjects in the nivolumab group and at a higher frequency than in the everolimus group (between-group difference of ≥5% [all grades] or ≥2% [Grades 3-4]).

## Immunogenicity - CA209025

A summary of the anti-drug antibody (ADA) assessments for nivolumab subjects in CA209025 who had evaluable ADA data at baseline and on treatment is presented in Table 38.

Overall,  there  were  27  (7.3%)  subjects  who  were  ADA  positive,  of  which  only  1  (0.3%)  subject  was considered persistent positive (CA209025-31-317) and no subjects were neutralizing ADA positive. The highest titer value observed in ADA positive subjects was 256, which occurred in only 1 subject. This subject had only one ADA positive sample observed at 2 weeks after initiation of nivolumab dosing and no other ADA positive samples (subject included in the Other positive category). All other ADA positive subjects had titer values less than 16.

## Effect of Immunogenicity on Safety - CA209025

In CA209025, a total of 26 subjects experienced hypersensitivity/infusion reaction events within 100 days of last dose (extended follow-up), and all were ADA negative (Table 39). Thus, the presence of ADA was not associated with the occurrence of hypersensitivity and/or infusion related reactions. Overall, the incidence of nivolumab ADA was low and did not appear to have an effect on the safety of nivolumab.

## Integrated Immunogenicity Summary

Collectively to date, of 1408 subjects with solid tumors including RCC, NSCLC, and melanoma, who were treated  with  nivolumab  3  mg/kg  every  2  weeks  and  evaluable  for  the  presence  of  ADA,  155  subjects (11.0%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA (Table 40). Of those who were ADA positive, only 2 subjects (0.1% of the total) were persistent positive, and neutralizing antibodies were detected in only 9 subjects (0.6% of the total).

## Immunogenicity Results - CA209010

Of  the  133  nivolumab-treated  subjects  who  had  evaluable  ADA  data  at  baseline  and  postbaseline,  15 (11.3%) subjects were ADA positive at baseline. During treatment with nivolumab, ADA were detected in 21 (15.8%) subjects, of whom 3 (2.3%) subjects were considered as persistent positive; and 112 (84.2%) subjects were ADA negative. A higher percentage of subjects were ADA positive in the 0.3 mg/kg treatment group than in the 2 mg/kg treatment group, and no subjects were ADA positive in the 10 mg/kg treatment group. The decrease in immunogenicity with increasing dose level could be due to drug tolerance of the ADA assay used. The safety profile of the 3 persistent positive subjects (CA209010-18-89, CA209010-52-198, and CA209010-54-150) was no different from those seen in the general population; no new or additional AEs were  reported  in  these  subjects.  The  limited  number  of  persistent  positive  subjects  precludes  any interpretation  or  definitive  conclusion  regarding  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  nivolumab  in  these  subjects compared to ADA-negative subjects.

## Safety in special populations

## Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors - CA209025

The frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the nivolumab group for subgroups of gender, race, age,  and  region  were  similar  to  the  AE  frequencies  in  the  overall  treated  population.  Small  numerical differences  in  frequencies  of  all-causality  AEs  of  any  grade  and  Grade  3-4  AEs  were  observed  in nivolumab-treated subjects in the following subgroups: for Black/African American (n = 1) and 'other' races (n = 13), age (≥75 and &lt; 85 [n = 30], ≥85 years [n = 4]), and in the 'rest of world' regions (n = 95). These differences are of limited interpretability due to low sample sizes and event rates, and do not alter the overall safety profile of nivolumab in these subgroups.

## Age

The frequency of total AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs by MedDRA High-level Group Term (HLGT)/ Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ)/SOC appear similar for subjects &lt; 75 years vs ≥ 75 years; however, interpretation is limited by small numbers of subjects in the older subgroups, particularly for the ≥ 85 years age group (Table 41).

Overall frequencies of drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy (any grade and Grade 3-4) were lower in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group.

Any-grade drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy were reported at a lower frequency in the nivolumab group (7.6%) than the everolimus group (13.1%). In the nivolumab group, the most frequently  reported  all-grade  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  (≥1%  of  subjects)  were pneumonitis (1.2%) and ALT increased (1.0%). In the everolimus group, the most frequently reported all-grade drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation (≥1% of subjects) were: pneumonitis (3.0%), cough (1.0%), and fatigue (1.0%).

Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy were reported at a lower frequency in the nivolumab group (4.7%) than the everolimus group (7.1%). In the nivolumab group, pneumonitis (1.2%) was the only Grade 3-4 drug-related AE leading to discontinuation reported by ≥1% of subjects. In the  everolimus  group,  pneumonitis  (1.3%)  was  the  only  Grade  3-4  drug-related  AE  leading  to discontinuation reported by ≥1% of subjects.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

For the purpose of this application, the population from study CA209025 was considered the main safety dataset. Supportive data from CA209010, dose-ranging study was included.

Baseline  demographic  and  disease  characteristics  in  study  CA209025  were  well  balanced  between  the nivolumab and everolimus groups, except for the gender (male 75.4%). The patient population and baseline characteristics in CA209010 were comparable to that in CA209025.

The median duration of therapy in the nivolumab treatment group was longer at 5.54 months compared with the everolimus group at 3.71 months.

At the time of the database lock point (18-Jun-2015), 88% of subjects had discontinued study therapy (83.5% in the nivolumab group and 92.9% in the everolimus group). Across treatment groups, the most

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

common reason for discontinuation of study therapy was disease progression (70.2% and 68.8% in the nivolumab and everolimus groups, respectively). In the nivolumab group, 51.0% of subjects had at least one dose delayed, with 43.6% of subjects in the nivolumab group experiencing an AE leading to dose delay. A lower proportion of subjects discontinued study therapy due to study drug toxicity in the nivolumab group compared with the everolimus group (8.6% vs. 13.4%).

Any-grade AEs were reported in 97.8% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 97.2% of subjects in the everolimus group.

Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 53.2% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 56.4% of subjects in the everolimus group. In the nivolumab group, the only Grade 3-4 AE reported in ≥5% of subjects was anemia (5.9%).

Any-grade drug-related AEs were reported less frequently in the nivolumab group than in the everolimus group (78.6% vs 87.9%). In the nivolumab group, fatigue (33.0%) was the only any-grade drug-related AE that occurred in ≥20% of subjects. Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were also reported less frequently in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group (18.7% vs 36.5%). In the nivolumab group, fatigue (2.5%) was the only Grade 3-4 drug-related AE that occurred in ≥2% of subjects.

Any-grade SAEs were reported in 47.8% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 43.6% of subjects in the everolimus group. In the nivolumab group, the most frequently reported SAEs (≥ 2% of subjects) were malignant  neoplasm  progression  (5.4%),  pleural  effusion  (3.4%),  pneumonia  (2.7%),  hypercalcemia (2.5%), pneumonitis (2.0%), spinal cord compression (2.0%), and acute kidney injury (2.0%).

Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 36.5% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 29.2% of subjects in the everolimus group.

Any-grade drug-related SAEs were reported in 11.6% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 13.4% of subjects in the everolimus group.

The overall frequency of drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation was lower in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group for all-grade events (7.6% vs 13.1%) and Grade 3-4 events (4.7% vs 7.1%). The overall frequency of drug-related AEs was lower in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group for all-grade events (78.6% vs 87.9%) and Grade 3-4 events (18.7% vs 36.5%).

The overall frequencies of all-causality SAEs (any grade) were similar between the treatment groups.

Across  select  AE  categories,  the  majority  of  events  were  manageable,  with  resolution  occurring  when immune-modulating  medications  (mostly  systemic  corticosteroids)  were  administered.  Some  endocrine select AEs, though well-controlled with hormone replacement therapy, were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy.

Drug-related  renal  select  AEs  were  similar  between  the  2  groups:  6.9%  and  8.8%  in  nivolumab  and everolimus groups, respectively.

The most frequently reported (&gt; 10% of subjects) any grade drug-related select AE category with nivolumab treatment was skin (24.9%), followed by GI (12.6%), and hepatic (11.3%). The most frequently reported (≥ 1% of subjects) Grade 3-4 drug-related select AE categories with nivolumab treatment were hepatic (2.7%), GI (2.0%), pulmonary (1.5%); endocrine, renal and skin were each reported by 1.0% of subjects.

In the nivolumab group:

* Drug-related endocrine select AEs were reported in 9.6% subjects and the majority of the events reported were hypothyroidism (5.9%). There were 1.0% subjects with Grade 3-4 drug-related events (0.5% had adrenal insufficiency and 0.2% had a diabetic ketoacidosis drug-related SAE). One subject (0.2%) reported drug-related events of adrenal insufficiency and hypophysitis that led to treatment discontinuation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

* All drug-related GI events reported were diarrhea (12.3%) or colitis (1.7%), 7 drug-related GI select AEs were reported as SAEs; for 4 subjects, the AEs led to discontinuation of study therapy.

* Drug-related hepatic select AEs were reported in 11.3% subjects, 2.7% reported Grade 3-4 drug. One of these  subjects  reported  a  serious  drug-related  hepatic  select  event  for  autoimmune  hepatitis,  1.0% discontinued due to increased ALT, and 0.7% discontinued due to increased AST.

* Drug-related pulmonary select AEs were reported in 4.4% subjects. Pneumonitis (3.9%) and interstitial lung disease (0.5%) were the only drug-related pulmonary select AEs reported.

*Grade 3-4 drug-related renal select AEs included: increased blood creatinine (0.2%), acute kidney injury (0.7%), and tubulointerstitial nephritis (0.2%). 0.7% reported drug-related renal select SAEs.

* Drug-related skin select AEs were reported in 24.9% subjects. There was no event of toxic epidermal necrolysis reported, 0.2% had a drug-related skin select SAE (erythema multiforme), 0.2% reported an AE of rash maculo-papular, which led to study medication discontinuation. Thirty-one subjects (30.7%) with drug-related events received immune-modulating medication (2 subjects received high dose corticosteroids.

Disease progression was the most common cause of death for both groups, including deaths occurring within 30 days of last dose and deaths occurring within 100 days of last dose. In CA209025, there were fewer deaths  in  nivolumab  group  (44.6%,  181/406  subjects)  compared  with  the  everolimus  group  (53.7%, 213/397 subjects) with the majority due to disease progression in both groups. No deaths were attributed to study drug toxicity with nivolumab.

44.6% subjects treated with nivolumab died compared with 53.7% treated with everolimus.

The frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the nivolumab group for subgroups of gender, race, age, and region were similar to the AE frequencies in the overall treated population.

The majority of subjects in the nivolumab group did not have on-study worsening in haematology laboratory parameters. Any-grade abnormalities in haematology laboratory results worsened relative to baseline were reported less frequently in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group. The majority of subjects in both treatment groups did not have on-study worsening in liver function tests. Most abnormalities in liver function were Grade 1-2 in both treatment groups. Serum creatinine that worsened relative to baseline (any grade) was reported in 42.2% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 44.9% of subjects in the everolimus group. Grade 3-4 abnormalities in serum creatinine were reported in 2.0% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 1.6% of subjects in the everolimus group. The majority of subjects in both groups had normal TSH levels at baseline  and  throughout  the  treatment  period.  Most  subjects  in  both  treatment  groups  had  normal electrolyte levels during the treatment reporting period; abnormalities in electrolytes were primarily Grade 1 to 2 in severity.

A lower frequency of discontinuation for study drug toxicity regardless of causality was observed in the nivolumab group compared with the everolimus group (8.6% vs. 13.4%, respectively). In addition, there were fewer subjects who requested to discontinue study treatment in the nivolumab group compared with the everolimus group (1.2% vs. 4.5%).

All-grade  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  therapy  were  reported  in  17.7%  of  subjects  in  the nivolumab group and 20.7% of subjects in the everolimus group.

Grade  3-4  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  therapy  were  reported  in  11.1%  of  subjects  in  the nivolumab group and 11.3% of subjects in the everolimus group.

The incidence of nivolumab-treated subjects with RCC who were positive for nivolumab ADA was 7.3%, and only  1  (0.3%)  subject  was  considered  persistent  positive.  No  subjects  were  positive  for  neutralizing antibodies.  In  CA209025,  a  total  of  26  nivolumab  treated  subjects  experienced  select  AEs  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hypersensitivity/infusion  reaction  category  (within  100  days  of  last  dose)  and  all  subjects  were  ADA negative. Thus, the presence of ADA was not associated with the occurrence of hypersensitivity and/or infusion-related reactions. Overall, the incidence of nivolumab ADA was low and did not appear to have an effect on the safety of nivolumab. These findings were consistent with those from previous analyses of melanoma and NSCLC studies.

Comparative safety data from CA209025 demonstrate that nivolumab monotherapy has an acceptable safety profile as compared to everolimus, as evidenced by the lower rates of drug-related AEs (all grades and Grade 3-4) and drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation (all grades and Grade 3-4) in the nivolumab group.

There were no deaths attributed to nivolumab during the study.

In CA209010 the safety profile was generally similar across treatment groups and the types of events reported were as expected based on the mechanism of action of nivolumab and previous experience in earlier studies.

In general, the type, frequency, and severity of AEs were consistent between RCC and other tumor types (melanoma and NSCLC). Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy in RCC was consistent with previously submitted pooled data of nivolumab monotherapy in melanoma and NSCLC.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy in RCC was consistent with previously submitted pooled data of nivolumab monotherapy in melanoma and NSCLC. No new safety concerns with nivolumab monotherapy treatment were identified in RCC. Based on safety data from Phase 3 Study CA209025, the safety profile of nivolumab in advanced RCC is manageable using routine risk minimisation measures and the recommendations as stated in the SmPC.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet and the descriptions and timelines of the 'obligations to conduct post-authorisation measures' in the Annex II have been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make editorial changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet and to update the contact details of the local representative in France in the Package Leaflet.

Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], which were reviewed accepted by the CHMP.

The full PI, as a relevant example with all changes highlighted is provided as an attachment.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

Since the submitted type II variation to extend the current approved therapeutic indication for OPDIVO to include 'treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after prior therapy in adults' does not involve a relevant impact on the PIL.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Results of the predefined interim analysis from study CA209025 revealed a longer survival for patients treated with nivolumab vs everolimus (HR: 0.73 [98.52% CI: 0.57, 0.93]; stratified log-rank test p value = 0.0018). The median of OS for nivolumab group was 25 months, whereas subjects treated with everolimus achieved a median of OS of 19.55 months. This gain in OS (5.45 months) is considered clinically meaningful. The survival rate at 1 year was higher in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group (76.0% vs 66.7%). The Kaplan Meier curves were convincing, showing a clear separation between the two treatments.

The gain in OS seems to be independent of PD-L1 expression and consistent across sensitivity analyses and adjusted analyses.

Regarding the secondary endpoints, ORR was superior in the nivolumab group (25.1% vs 5.4%; 21.5% vs 3.9% with a confirmatory scan after at least 4 weeks).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

No benefit in terms of PFS has been shown (HR: 0.88 [95%CI: 0.75 to 1.03]). Reasons, when it comes to explaining this finding, are not totally clear. Treatment beyond progression, could have contributed to the observed discrepancy (non-conventional responders). The OS results are considered convincing and the lack of an effect on PFS does not have an impact on the robustness of the effect observed in terms of OS.

Only patients pretreated with antiangiogenic therapy were included in the pivotal study. However, given the available data and current knowledge, there is no reason to suspect that the efficacy of nivolumab will be different in patients treated with other prior therapies. As such, restriction of the indication was not deemed necessary. The limitations of the patient population included in the main clinical study (pivotal study only includes patients with prior antiangiogenic) are mentioned in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

Only patients with clear-cell histology were included in the pivotal study. The lack of clinical data for nivolumab in patients with non-clear cell RCC is mentioned in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Grade 3-4 AEs were reported in 53.2% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 56.4% of subjects in the everolimus group. In the nivolumab group, the only Grade 3-4 AE reported in ≥5% of subjects was anaemia (5.9%).

Any-grade drug-related AEs were reported less frequently in the nivolumab group than in the everolimus group (78.6% vs 87.9%). In the nivolumab group, fatigue (33.0%) was the only any-grade drug-related AE that occurred in ≥20% of subjects. Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were also reported less frequently in the nivolumab group than the everolimus group (18.7% vs 36.5%). In the nivolumab group, fatigue (2.5%) was the only Grade 3-4 drug-related AE that occurred in ≥2% of subjects.

Any-grade SAEs were reported in 47.8% of subjects in the nivolumab group and 43.6% of subjects in the everolimus group. In the nivolumab group, the most frequently reported SAEs (≥ 2% of subjects) were malignant neoplasm progression (5.4%), pleural effusion (3.4%), pneumonia (2.7%), hypercalcaemia (2.5%), pneumonitis (2.0%), spinal cord compression (2.0%), and acute kidney injury (2.0%).

Disease progression was the most common cause of death for both groups, including deaths occurring within 30 days of last dose and deaths occurring within 100 days of last dose. In CA209025, there were fewer deaths in nivolumab group (44.6%, 181/406 subjects) compared with the everolimus group (53.7%, 213/397 subjects) with the majority due to disease progression in both groups. No deaths were attributed to study drug toxicity with nivolumab

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Treatment with nivolumab in patients with RCC previously treated with antiangiogenic therapy has shown a longer survival than everolimus. This result is considered clinically meaningful. The uncertainties related to PFS do not decrease the value of the clinical benefit offered by nivolumab. From a safety point of view, the toxicity and tolerability of nivolumab was consistent with previously submitted pooled data of nivolumab monotherapy in melanoma and NSCLC. No new safety concerns with nivolumab monotherapy treatment were identified in RCC. There were no deaths attributed to nivolumab during the study. Furthermore, comparative safety data from CA209025 demonstrate that nivolumab monotherapy has a acceptable safety

profile as compared to everolimus, as evidenced by the lower rates of drug-related AEs (all grades and Grade 3-4) and drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation (all grades and Grade 3-4) in the nivolumab group.

## Benefit-risk balance

The benefit risk balance for nivolumab in the applied indication is positive.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy (changes underlined):

To further investigate the value of biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status at tumour cell membrane level by IHC (e.g., other methods / assays, and associated cut-offs, that might prove more sensitive and specific in predicting response to treatment based on PD-L1, PD-L2, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes with measurement of CD8+T density, RNA signature, etc.) as predictive of nivolumab efficacy. This will be provided for all the approved indications:

- Melanoma: studies CA209038 and CA209066
- RCC: studies CA209025 and CA209009

To further investigate the associative analyses between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression conducted in Study CA209066 and CA209025.

Also, the CHMP recommended that the efficacy results, of study CA209374 (on-going), for the sub-group of patients with non-clear RCC should be submitted post approval.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, II and IIIB     |

Extension of Indication to add treatment as monotherapy of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after prior therapy in adults, based on Study CA209025; a phase 3 study of nivolumab vs. everolimus in subjects with advanced or metastatic clear-cell RCC who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy, and the CA209010 addendum study report; phase 2 dose-ranging study of nivolumab in subjects with progressive advanced/metastatic clear-cell RCC who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated, and the Package Leaflet and the descriptions and timelines of the 'obligations to conduct post-authorisation measures' in the Annex II have been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make editorial changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet and to update the contact details of the local representative in France in the Package Leaflet. An updated RMP version 4.1 was agreed during the procedure.

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP is by consensus of the opinion that Opdivo is not similar to Nexavar and Torisel within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1.

## Additional market protection

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 2).

This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following amended conditions:

## · Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures

The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures:

| 4. The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of nivolumab should be further explored, specifically: 1. To continue the exploration of the optimal cut-off for PD-L1 positivity based on current assay method used to further elucidate its value as predictive of nivolumab efficacy. These analyses will be conducted in studies CA209037 and CA209066 in patients with advanced melanoma. 2. To further investigate the value of biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status at tumour cell membrane level by IHC (e.g., other methods / assays, and associated cut-offs, that might prove more sensitive and specific in predicting response to treatment based on PD-L1, PD-L2, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes with measurement of CD8+T density, RNA signature, etc.) as predictive of nivolumab efficacy.
