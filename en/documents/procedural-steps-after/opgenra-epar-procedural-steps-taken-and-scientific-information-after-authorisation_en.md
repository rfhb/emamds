The CHMP recommends that one additional five-year renewal be required. This is based on the following pharmacovigilance grounds: the clinical experience with the product in the designated indication has been very limited in the EU during the first 5-year period of marketing authorisation. Indeed, there has been a limited exposure due to a recent and limited marketing of the product (launched in the EU only in August 2011 and marketed in only few Member States). In addition, |
