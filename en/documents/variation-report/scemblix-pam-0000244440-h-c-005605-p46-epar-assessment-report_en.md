## 1. Introduction

On 26-Dec-2024, the MAH submitted in accordance with article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the final report of asciminib study CABL001A1401 as part of the post-authorisation measures.

This trial, Study A1401, was a special drug use-results surveillance study conducted in Japan to fulfil the regulatory requirement at the time of the asciminib approval in Japan. The study was conducted to access the safety and effectiveness of Scemblix tablets clinically administered in resistant or intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia.

Please note that only one paediatric patient was part of this study who was multi-resistant against dasatinib, nilotinib and ponatinib and also resistant against asciminib. Thus, information here assessed remains less informative regarding the use of asciminib in the paediatric population and reflects nearly exclusively real-world data experience in adults.

No new safety concern emerged from the paediatric patient during the short-term exposure of 83 days in this study. The study was completed on 04-Jul-2024.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The objective of this procedure is to assess data provided from Study CABL001A1401, involving a paediatric population, and any impact these data have on the Sponsor's understanding of the safety and efficacy profile of asciminib.

Asciminib (film-coated tablets 20 mg and 40 mg) was granted marketing authorization in the EU/EEA through centralized procedure on 25-Aug-2022 for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in chronic phase (CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

Asciminib (Scemblix) is also marketed in 79 countries worldwide in comparable indications. (The exact indication varies by country).

Asciminib is indicated for use as monotherapy in adults and it is available as film-coated tablet (FCT) for oral administration, with strengths equivalent to 20 mg and 40 mg asciminib.

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal or hepatic impairment receiving asciminib. However, caution should be exercised in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment receiving the 200 mg twice daily dose (BID) of asciminib. No dose adjustment is required in patients of age 65 years or above.

Safety and efficacy in the pediatric population (below 18 years) has not been established.

A multi-center, open-label study to determine the dose and safety of oral asciminib in paediatric patients Ph+ CML-CP, previously treated with one or more TKI (ASC4KIDS) is currently ongoing; thus, results from this study are not available at present.

The paediatric aspect currently triggering this procedure is restricted to one patient only.

Study CABL001A1401, entitled 'Special drug use-results surveillance of Scemblix tablets (resistant or intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia) was an observational study conducted in Japan as a postmarketing surveillance study to assess the safety and effectiveness of Scemblix tablets clinically

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administered in resistant or intolerant patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. While Scemblix is only approved in adult patients, Study CABL001A1401 enrolled only one paediatric subject aged &lt;18 years).

Thus, information and conclusions regarding paediatric population from this trial are very limited.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Asciminib is an oral, potent inhibitor of BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase with a novel mechanism of action, specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket. Asciminib functionally mimics the role of the myristoylated Gly2 residue by occupying the vacant site and restoring the negative regulation to the kinase activity. In non-clinical studies, asciminib has been shown to have activity against clinically observed point mutations in BCR::ABL1 that confer resistance to ATP-competitive TKIs. The product is available as film coated tablets of 20 mg and 40 mg dose strengths.

| Rationale                     | Asciminib hydrochloride is a potent, orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting the BCR-ABL myristoyl binding pocket with a novel mechanism of action. Asciminib does not work on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site and it remains active against cells expressing mutations that confer resistance to existing TKIs, which means asciminib is effective even in patients resistant to existing TKIs. Selectively inhibiting the ABL kinase family (ABL1, ABL2, BCR-ABL1), asciminib is safer and better tolerated than existing TKIs. A global phase III study (A2301) was conducted in resistant or intolerant CML A global phase III study (CABL001A2301, ASCEMBL) was conducted in resistant or intolerant CML patients in chronic phase (CP) previously treated with 2 or more TKIs. The primary analysis established the superiority of asciminib to bosutinib in terms of major molecular response (MMR) at Week 24 and also confirmed its efficacy, safety and tolerability in other variables. Thus, an application for marketing approval was submitted in Japan for an indication of \"resistant or intolerant CML (hereafter called, R/I CML),\" and approval was granted on 28-Mar-2022. Because CML drugs require long-term administration, it is necessary to collect data on the occurrence, severity, clinical courses of risks that affect continuous treatment with asciminib, identify factors etc. involved in occurrence and ensure that treatment is safely continued. This was the reason for the conduct of this post-marketing surveillance as an additional pharmacovigilance activity. |

| Exposure         | The overall median duration (range) of treatment with asciminib was 336 days (1 to 336 days) in Study A1401, and the mean daily dose (standard deviation) was 79.2 mg (20 to 80 mg). Asciminib treatment duration for the paediatric patient was 81 days (20 mg/twice a day for 48 days, 40 mg/twice a day for 33 days). Asciminib treatment was discontinued due to insufficient effect. No ADR's were observed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Efficacy Summary | The MMR rates (95% CI) by visit was 43.4% (38.8, 48.0) by Week 12, 55.7% (51.1, 60.3) by Week 24, 61.4% (56.8, 65.9) by Week 48. There were no noteworthy effectiveness findings in patients with special characteristics such as children, elderly, pregnant women, and patients with renal/hepatic impairments. The results demonstrated a certain level of effectiveness of asciminib in R/I CML patients in real-world clinical practice. Asciminib was not effective in the single paediatric patient treated for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Safety Summary   | The incidence rate of ADRs was 33.3% (176/529 patients), with Grade ≥ 3 occurring in 11.7% (62/529 patients). The most common ADRs (reported in ≥ 1%) were platelet count decreased occurring in 5.1% (27/529 patients), neutropenia and rash each in 2.8% (15/529 patients), electrocardiogram QT prolonged in 2.5% (13/529 patients), chronic myeloid leukaemia and malaise each in 1.7% (9/529 patients), thrombocytopenia and diarrhoea each in 1.5% (8/529 patients), and headache, hypertension, and pleural effusion each in 1.1% (6/529 patients).There were no noteworthy safety findings in patients with special characteristics such as elderly, pregnant women, and patients with renal impairment, hepatic impairment, or cardiac dysfunction. Based on the above, there were no particular safety concerns with the asciminib treatment in patients with R/I CML in real-world clinical practice. No ADRs were observed for the pediatric patient in Study. |

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

In this post-marketing surveillance, there were no particular concerns about the safety results in the targeted population of adult patients with resistant or intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia.

In addition, this surveillance demonstrated a certain level of effectiveness of asciminib in adults. This study did not provide any relevant efficacy and safety results for the paediatric population since asciminib was not effective in this subject, who was also resistant or intolerant to other previous drugs (dasatinib, nilotinib and ponatib). Unfortunately, the type of mutation is not reported.

In summary, with respect to this case alone, no conclusion on the benefit and risk of Asciminib in the paediatric population can be drawn. The negative outcome in the single patient indicates the importance

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of receiving data from the ongoing paediatric multi-center RCT as agreed in the PIP to characterise reliably efficacy and safety in CMP patients below the age of 18 years.

## 3. Overall conclusion and recommendation

Considering the limited efficacy and safety data in paediatric patients available from Study CABL001A1401, it is acknowledged that no changes to the current Scemblix Core Data Sheet and to the approved EU and UK SmPC are proposed as a result of this study.

In accordance with article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the MAH submitted the final report of asciminib study CABL001A1401 as part of the post-authorisation measures.

No regulatory action required at present.

Since only one paediatric patient was included, the relevance of this data is marginal and the assessment in the paediatric population will further depend on the ongoing paediatric multi-center trial as agreed in the PIP.
