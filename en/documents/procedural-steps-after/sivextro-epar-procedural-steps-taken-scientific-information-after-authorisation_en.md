1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

MK-1986-018 is a randomised, active controlled, investigator-blind, multicentre trial to evaluate safety and efficacy in patients from birth to less than 12 years of age. In addition, cha nges to the posology for patients ≥12 years of age are proposed. A weight-banded IV dosing regimen is proposed for all paediatric patients <35 kg of body weight, including those ≥12 years of age. To maintain alignment between the IV and oral dosing regimens, the 200 mg tablet dosing regimen is proposed for paediatric patients weighing ≥35 kg only, regardless of age. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet and to implement minor editorial corrections. Version 8.0 of the RMP is being approved with this procedure. Please refer to Scientific Discussion 'Sivextro-H-C-002846-   |

| II/0027             | Submission of the final results from Bayer study 16099, a prospective, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tedlizolid in Japanese patients with MRSA infections (skin and soft tissue infection [SSTI] and SSTI-related bacteraemia) listed as a Post-Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES) in the RMP. The MAH obligations with regard to this PAES are considered fulfilled. The updated RMP version 5.0, implementing Revision 2 of the RMP template, is adopted. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 04/10/2018 | n/a        |                        | The MAH submitted the final results from Bayer study 16099, a prospective, randomised, open-label, active- controlled, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tedlizolid in Japanese patients with MRSA infections (skin and soft tissue infection [SSTI] and SSTI- related bacteraemia). Following assessment, the CHMP identified concerns with the robustness of the safety data supporting the implementation of the proposed change to the SmPC, including differences in median body weight between the populations in study 16099 and the phase III studies, the high and relevant number of confounding factors and the relatively small data from study 16099, which has been conducted under conditions other than the ones currently recommended in the EU for the use of the product. As a result, the data is not considered to support |

| II/0019   | Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC of the concentrate for solution for infusion formulation, in order to add information from BAY119-2631/16121, a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multi-centre study comparing the efficacy and safety of intravenous to oral 6-day tedizolid phosphate and intravenous to oral 10 day linezolid for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and change the reported expected frequency of the adverse reaction 'infusion site phlebitis' from 'uncommon' to 'common'. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. An updated RMP (version 3.2) has also been submitted, proposing to collect safety information regarding tedizolid phosphate by conducting three investigator initiated studies and deleting the original proposed long term safety study. The MAH also took the opportunity to make minor editorial corrections throughout the product information. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance   | 30/11/2017   | 08/08/2018   | SmPC, Annex II and PL   | In a Phase 3 study conducted in China, the Philippines, Taiwan, and the US investigating tedizolid phosphate for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, infusion site reactions (phlebitis) were reported more frequently (2.7%) in tedizolid treated subjects than in the linezolid control group (0%) with the concentrate for solution for infusion formulation, particularly among Asian patients. The frequency of the adverse reaction 'infusion site phlebitis' was therefore revised from 'uncommon' to 'common'.   |

In addition the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes in the annexes and to update the annexes in line with the latest QRD template version 10. A revised RMP version 2.2 was agreed during the procedure. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 10/11/2016 | 16/06/2017 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | In a clinical study comparing the single dose (10 mg) pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin (Breast Cancer Resistant Protein [BCRP] substrate) alone or in combination with Sivextro (once-daily 200 mg oral dose), rosuvastatin AUC and Cmax increased by approximately 70% and 55%, respectively, when coadministered with Sivextro. Therefore, orally administered Sivextro can result in inhibition of BCRP at the intestinal level. If possible, an interruption of the co-administered BCRP substrate medicinal product (such as imatinib, lapatinib, methotrexate, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine, and topotecan) should be considered during the six days of treatment with oral Sivextro. In a clinical study comparing the single dose (2 mg) pharmacokinetics of midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) alone or in combination with Sivextro (once-daily 200 mg oral dose for 10 days), midazolam AUC and Cmax when co- administered with Sivextro were 81% and 83% of midazolam AUC and Cmax when administered alone, respectively. This effect is not clinically meaningful, and no dose adjustment for co-administered CYP3A4 substrates is |
