## 2 Scientific discussion

## 2.1 Introduction

A Centralised Procedure is followed for the proposed product Sumatriptan Galpharm 50 mg, filmcoated tablets. The product is indicated for the acute relief of migraine attacks, with or without aura. The recommended dose is a single 50 mg tablet, and 100 mg is the maximum daily dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  applicant  Galpharm  Healthcare  Ltd.  submitted  on  31  March  2010  an  application  for  Marketing Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  for  Sumatriptan  Galpharm  50  mg  Tablets, through  the  centralised  procedure  under  Article  3  (2)  (b)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The eligibility  was  based  on  demonstration  of  interest  of  patients  at  Community  level  in  view  of  the availability as non-prescription product in only two member states.

The  application  concerns  a  generic  medicinal  product  as  defined  in  Article  10(2)(b)  of  Directive 2001/83/EC and refers to the reference product Imigran, 50 mg, tablets which is indicated for acute relief of migraine attacks, with or without aura.

Sumatriptan is a selective 5-HT1 agonist indicated in acute treatment of migraine with or without aura. It is one of a number of selective 5-HT 1 agonists.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## 2.2.1 Introduction

Sumatriptan Galpharm 50 mg has been developed as immediate release film-coated tablets.

The active substance Sumatriptan succinate is described in the Ph.Eur.

The excipients used in the formulation include: mannitol, croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, purified water, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate. For the film-coating were used: Opaglos  6000 and isopropyl alcohol.

All the excipients are compendial and for the film-coating agent Opaglos, each individual ingredient is compendial.

The tablets are packed in PolyVinylChloride (PVC)/ Aclar-Aluminium blisters.

## 2.2.2 Active Substance

The active substance sumatriptan (INN) existing as Sumatriptan succinate or 3-[2-

(Dimethylamino)ethyl]-1H-indol-5-yl]-N-Methyl methane sulphonamide hydrogen butanedioate is described in the Ph. Eur.

It exists as a white to almost white powder, and Sumatriptan exhibits polymorphism (form I and form II) but the ASMF holder has been manufacturing consistently the polymorphic form I. General physicochemical properties such as solubility (freely soluble in water and alcohol), particle size and tapped density have been adequately detailed.

An Active Substance Master File Procedure was provided for sumatriptan.

The structure of sumatriptan has been satisfactorily demonstrated by Infra-Red Spectroscopy (FTIR), mass spectrometry,  Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( 1 H NMR). In addition Polymorphic form-I has been demonstrated by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC).

A comprehensive discussion on related substances including organic impurities, inorganic impurities, residual solvents was presented. The organic impurities correspond to the impurities listed in the Ph Eur monograph.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Manufacture

A flow diagram of the synthesis was presented and the synthetic route consists of two chemical steps and purification steps.

Information on the manufacturing process was provided in the restricted part of the ASMF..

## Specification

The active substance specification is in accordance with the Ph Eur monograph with additions of inhouse specifications.

Specification  applied  by  the  ASMF  holder  and  the  applicant  included  the  following  parameters: appearance,  solubility,  identification  (IR),  pH  (Ph.Eur),  absorbance  (Ph.Eur.),  related  substances (Ph.Eur.),  water  content  (Ph.Eur.),  sulphated  ash  (Ph.Eur.)  and  assay  (Ph.Eur.  )  and  additional  inhouse  tests  :  polymorph  identification  (X-Ray  and  DSC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  particle  size  (laser diffraction  method),  succinic  acid  content  (potentiometry),  tapped  density  (in-house  method)  and heavy metals (in-house method)

For the parameters specified as per the Ph Eur monograph for sumatriptan, the limits are in accordance with the monograph.. The specification has been adequately justified.

Analytical methods for control are compendial methods in accordance with the Ph Eur monograph with the exception of the test for residual solvents, polymorph identity, particle size and succinic acid content. The methods have been sufficiently outlined. The methods for solubility, identification (IR, XRPD &amp; DSC), pH, absorbance, water content, sulphated ash and heavy metals are standard analytical methods which do not require validation. Assay and related impurities are determined using the compendial methods outlined in the Ph Eur monograph and although not required, the methods have been validated. Also the in-house methods for succinic acid content, residual solvents and particle sizing have been validated.

Certificates of analysis have been provided by the ASMF and the finished product manufacturer for the same five batches of sumatriptan batches of sumatriptan. The results conform to the active substance specifications.

The active substance is packed in virgin foodgrade double polyethylene (PE) bags (inner transparent &amp; outer black) placed in a fiber drum. The polyethylene bags are individually sealed using a plastic fastener and a cellophane tape. Adequate specification including dimensions and IR identification and certificate of analysis are presented for the different packaging materials.

The primary packaging material (PE) is in accordance with the requirements from EU Directive 2002/72/EC as amended and the Guideline on Plastic Immediate Materials CPMP/QWP/4359/03, and Ph. Eur. 3.1.1 Polyolefines.

## Stability

Five production batches have been placed under ICH long-term and accelerated conditions (results available for the first three batches up to 72 months at 25C/65 % RH and 6 months at 40C/75% RH). The active substance was kept in the commercial packaging.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Samples were tested for the following stability indicating parameters: description, identification, pH, water content, related impurities and assay.

Forced degradation studies were also conducted under various conditions (high temperature, acidic, basic ,light exposure, oxidative conditions). The active substance was found to degrade under acidic, basic, oxidative and light conditions.

Based on these results the proposed re-test period can be accepted.

## 2.2.3 Finished Medicinal Product

## Pharmaceutical Development

The aim of formulation development was to develop a tablet dosage form that would be essentially similar to the reference medicinal product. The formulation development of Sumatriptan Galpharm 50 mg tablets has been adequately described.

The pharmaceutical development was satisfactorily detailed. The parameters investigated for the active substance were appearance, melting range, tapped density, pH, particle size and polymorphism.

The excipients used for the core-tablets are: mannitol (diluent), croscarmellose sodium (disintegrant), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (binder), purified water (vehicle), microcrystalline cellulose (diluent), magnesium stearate (lubricant). For the film-coating were used: Opaglos 6000 (the qualitative and quantitative composition were provided) and isopropyl alcohol (vehicle).

All the excipients are compendial and for the film-coating agent Opaglos, each ingredient is described in a Pharmacopoiea.

The excipients are commonly used for this pharmaceutical form. The concentrations are usual for an immediate release tablet formulation and can be considered safe in the proposed concentrations.

Following identification of excipients in the reference product, compatibility of admixtures of the active substance and respective excipients was investigated.

Following the choice of excipients on basis of composition of the reference medicinal product and excipient/active substance compatibility study, the quantitative composition was optimised by manufacture and assessment of trial formulations using the preferred process of wet granulation method.

Comparative physico-chemical characterisation with the reference medicinal product was performed.

Comparative dissolution profiles are presented for two batches and the reference medicinal product in three media across the physiological pH range Justification for choice of water as dissolution medium was provided and the justification was  considered acceptable. The bio-availability of the active substance is not limited by dissolution. The selected particle size profile of the active substance together with the rapidly disintegrating tablet formulation developed have demonstrated that resulting tablet dissolution rates obtained will not affect the performance of the drug product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The finished product is packed in PVC/ Aclar-Alu blisters. The PVC/Aclar packaging consists of clear, non toxic, transparent, well thermoformable PVC / PCTFE (Poly Chloro Tri Fluro ethylene) film. The Alu film consists of plain lidding foil (alu foil 20 µm), with heat seal coating. The materials are in accordance with Directive 2002/72/EC. Adequate specifications are provided for the packaging materials including IR identification tests.

## Adventitious agents

None of the excipients is of human or animal origin with the exception of magnesium stearate as well as beeswax and shellac (components of the coating mixture).

Magnesium Stearate is of animal origin and the supplier holds an up to date TSE Certificate of Suitability R1-CEP 2000-176-Rev 01, dated 15 November 2006. Shellac and beeswax are derived from insects and are not considered specific TSE risk materials.

## Manufacture of the product

The manufacturing process includes dispensing raw materials, sifting the ingredients of the pre-mix, preparation of the binder solution, mixing - granulation &amp; drying, sizing of the granules,  blending &amp; lubrication of the granules, compression and film-coating of the tablets. The manufacturing process has been validated for three full-scale baches by a number of studies for the major steps of the manufacturing process.

The batch analysis data show that the film coated tablets can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation.

## Product Specification

The release and end of shelf-life finished product specification includes the following parameters: description (visual), identification (HPLC and UV), average weight, uniformity of dosage units (PhEur. 2.9.40), water content (Karl-Fisher), dissolution, assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (HPLC), microbial contamination (PhEur)

Batch analysis results confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is under control.

## Stability of the product

Stability studies were conducted on three pilot batches and three commercial scale batches under ICH long-term conditions (up to 36 months at 25°C/60% RH) and accelerated conditions (6 months at 40°C/75% RH). The stability batches were kept in the commercial packaging (PVC/Alu blisters).

The same limits are applied at shelf life as for release testing with the exception of water content. Residual solvents are controlled in process and the limits are well within the ICH permitted daily exposure limits.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For each tablets, the following parameters were tested: description, water content, dissolution, related substances, assay and microbial contamination (tested initially and at the end of shelf life).

Analytical procedures are identical to those applied at release..

Also, the test on microbial contamination was performed after 36 months on one batch showing the results meeting the set requirements.

A photo-degradation study was performed on one batch according to the ICH Guideline. Based on the stability data, the tablets are not sensitive to light and no additional corresponding storage is required.

Based on the available long-term and accelerated stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as proposed can be supported.

## 2.2.4 Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Satisfactory information has been provided for the development, manufacture and control of the active substance sumatriptan and for the finished product. . The manufacturing process is a conventional process for the film-coated tablets and the stability has been adequately tested and demonstrated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The results of the tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 2.2.5 Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety. There are no unresolved quality issues which might have negative impact on the benefit/risk balance

## 2.3 Non- Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1 Introduction

A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SPC are in line with the SPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.

Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies were required.

## 2.3.2 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of Sumatriptan Galpharm 50 mg tablets manufactured by Galpharm  based on the anticipation that the bulk of the usage of this product will be by patients who have switched from a prescription source which is expected to represent a very small fraction of the overall usage of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sumatriptan. Therefore it is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all sumatriptan containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased.

## 2.4 Clinical Aspects

## 2.4.1 Introduction

This is an application for sumatriptan 50 mg tablets.

For the clinical assessment, Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1 is of particular relevance.

The  CHMP  requested  a  GCP  inspection  for  the  bioequivalence  study  (03-115)  initially  submitted  to support the application. The inspection revealed that the trial was not conducted in compliance with GCP  and  therefore  the  submitted  data  could  not  be  considered  supportive  for  the  Marketing Authorization Application.

A new bioequivalence trial (study 10-12-072) was submitted in support of the application. This study was pivotal for the assessment.

The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as efficacy and safety of sumatriptan based on published literature.

## Exemption

Not applicable

## Clinical studies

No new clinical studies were performed. To support the application, the applicant originally submitted one single-dose bioequivalence study (03-115). This bioequivalence study initially referred to by the Applicant was rejected due to several identified irregularities. An inspection revealed that the clinical study  was  not  conducted  in  compliance  with  GCP  and  therefore  the  submitted  data  could  not  be considered supportive for the Marketing Authorization Application.

Taking  these  findings  into  account,  the  applicant  applied  for  a  BCS-based  biowaiver.  However,  the generic product contained different excipients and even a critical excipient (mannitol), known to have a potential  to  affect  GI  transit  and  absorption,  as  compared  to  the  innovator.  Additionally,  for  other excipients  the  quantitative  composition  was  also  not  similar.  Hence  the  CHMP  considered  that  this generic did not fulfil the requirements set in the Guideline on Investigation of Bioequivalence, Appendix III  Biowaiver,  for  class  III  drugs  (i.e.  excipients  that  might  affect  bioavailability  (e.g.  sorbitol, mannitol)  should  be  qualitatively  and  quantitatively  the  same  and  other  excipients  should  be qualitatively the same and quantitatively very similar). As it could not be ruled out that absorption of sumatriptan from the generic formulation may be different from that of the innovator formulation, a BCS-based biowaiver could not be granted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In response, the applicant first submitted an interim report of a new bioequivalence study (10-12-072) performed by the same CRO, and subsequently the results of this new bioequivalence study, which is assessed below.

## 2.4.2 Pharmacokinetics

## Pharmacokinetic study 10-12-072

Study 10-12-072 was a randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, cross-over bioavailability study in 28 healthy human subjects under fasting conditions. This study was performed between  5  April  and  28  April  2011.  Bio-analysis  and  statistical  analyses  were  completed  on  4  May 2011. Clinical and bio-analytical unit was Sitec Labs Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, India.

Sumatriptan 100mg tablet of test or reference product was orally administered as a single dose with 240 ml of water after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours in each period. Water was not allowed from 1 hour pre-dose and till 2 hours post-dose. Blood samples were drawn pre-dose and at 0.17, 0.33, 0.50, 0.67, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.25, 2.50, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, and 24.00 hours post-dose. Wash-out period was at least one week.

Samples were collected through an indwelling cannula placed in a forearm vein till 12.00 hours postdose  samples.  24.00  hours  post-dose  sample  was  collected  via  direct  venipuncture.  Blood  samples were collected  after  discarding  the  first  1  ml.  The  blood  samples  were  collected  in  5ml  vacutainers containing heparin as an anticoagulant. Samples were centrifuged at 8°C - 10°C and 2500 - 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. Plasma was separated and placed in suitable stopper tubes. All plasma samples were stored upright below -70°C until the analysis of the samples.

The study protocol was approved by an independent ethics committee on 24 January 2011.

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  design  of  the  study  was  acceptable.  The  sampling  schedule  was adequate  to  estimate  PK  parameters  and  the  wash-out  period  is  long  enough  to  avoid  carry-over effect. Indeed, there were no positive pre-dose samples in the second period.

A  statement  of  completeness  of  the  report  was  signed  by  the  investigators  10  June  2011.  A  QA statement  and  which  parts  of  the  study  were  audited  were  submitted.  There  were  no  protocol violations reported, only a few deviations for the timing of blood samples were noted. These deviations were considered by the CHMP to have no consequence for the conclusions of the study.

## Test and reference products

Test  product:  Sumatriptan  100  mg  tablet  (of  Cipla  Ltd.,  India),  batch  G05936,  manufacturing  date 12/2010. Potency 99.5%

Reference  product:  Imigran  tablet  (Sumatriptan  100  mg  of  Glaxo  Wellcome,  UK),  batch  PJ1363, expiration date 8/2013. Potency 98.4%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Population(s) studied: Twenty-eight (28) healthy male volunteers with a mean age of 25 years were randomized. Twenty-two (22) subjects completed the study according to protocol. Four subjects were withdrawn because of AEs; one subject did not show up for the second period and the cannule could not be introduced.  All subjects who completed the study were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. The study population was acceptable to the CHMP.

## Analytical methods

The  plasma  samples  were  analyzed  by  a  validated  LC-MS/MS  method.  The  method  validation  was performed in human plasma in the linear range of 0.5 to 200 ng/ml. A cross validation was conducted to validate the procedure from human plasma harvested using sodium heparin plasma. Specificity and selectivity, precision, accuracy, recovery, stability and matrix effects met the acceptance criteria.

Incurred sample reanalysis was performed on 161 of the 1033 analysed samples. The % difference in concentrations obtained from the incurred samples from their initial concentration was &gt;20% in 4 out of 161 samples. The percentage of samples within acceptance criteria for sumatriptan was 97.5%.

## Pharmacokinetic Variables &amp; Statistical methods

The primary pharmacokinetic variables were Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf and the secondary variables were Tmax, K el and T1/2.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed ( α =0.05) on the untransformed and log (ln)-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-inf. The analysis of variance model included sequence, subjects nested within sequence, period and treatment as factors.

90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  difference  between  treatment,  least-square  means  (LSM)  were calculated  for  both  untransformed  and  log-transformed  C max ,  AUC0-t and  AUC0-inf .  To  be  considered bioequivalent, ratios &amp; CI should lie between acceptance range of 80-125%.

The  CHMP  considered  that  pharmacokinetic  parameter  calculation  and  statistical  methods  to  be acceptable.

AUC0-t covered  &gt;90%  of  AUC0-inf in  all  subjects.  Sequence,  formulation  and  period  effect  were  not significant  for  any  primary  PK  parameter.  No  pre-dose  concentrations  were  observed.  Coefficient  of variation for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf was similar between the Test and Reference product.

## Safety

There were 19 AEs in 11 subjects following test product and 11 AEs in 8 subjects following reference product. 14/28 subjects experienced an AE in the first period only 5/24 experienced AE in the second period. No serious adverse events were reported.

The CHMP considered that the results of study 10-12-072 indicate that sumatriptan 100 mg tablets manufactured by Cipla, India are bioequivalent with Imigran sumatriptan 100mg tablets, GlaxoSmithKline UK under fasting conditions as the 90% CI for AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax were within the acceptance range of 0.80-1.25.

The CHMP noted that the bioequivalence study was performed with a higher strength (100 mg) than marketed (50 mg). In the final response document submitted on 6 July 2011, dissolution tests for the sumatriptan  50  mg  and  100  mg  tablets  used  in  bioequivalence  study  10-12-072  showed  rapid dissolution (&gt;85% in 15 min) over the entire pH range. The criteria for a waiver according to Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 and its revision  were  met.  Thus,  the  results  of  the  100  mg  formulation  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  only strength to be authorised, i.e. 50 mg.

## Conclusions

Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  results  of  the  10-12-072  bioequivalence  study  indicated  that sumatriptan 100 mg tablets manufactured by Cipla, India are bioequivalent with Imigran, sumatriptan 100  mg  tablets,  GlaxoSmithKline  UK  under  fasting  conditions  as  the  90%  CI  for  AUCt,  AUCinf  and Cmax were within the acceptance range of 0.80-1.25. These results can be extrapolated to the only strength  of  sumatriptan  applied  for  as  part  of  this  application,  i.e.  50  mg.    Bioequivalence  could therefore be concluded.

## 2.4.3 Pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.

## 2.4.4 Post marketing experience

No post-marketing data related to this particular medicinal product were made available as part of this application.

## 2.4.5 Discussion on Clinical aspects

## Clinical efficacy

The  evidence  of  efficacy  of  50  mg  sumatriptan  is  well  known  and  for  this  application  supported  by literature  submitted  by  the  Applicant.    The  proposed  50  mg  strength  is  in  line  with  that  of  the reference product. The strength 100 mg is recommended by the reference product if patients do not get benefit from the 50mg.  However, according to recent clinical evidence, doses above 50 mg may not necessarily provide a greater effect. With this application, only 50 mg sumatriptan was applied for.

## Clinical safety

The clinical safety of sumatriptan is well-known based on 18 years of clinical experience and wide use. To further substantiate this, the Applicant submitted data from UK Drug Analysis Print (DAP) in module 5 (m5.3.6.) relating to single ingredient sumatriptan products covering the period from 24 June 1994 to 24 August 2009 of a total of 4,805 adverse drug reactions (ADRs) relating to 2,264 ADR reports. Twenty-five fatalities were reported and are listed as: blood disorders (n = 1), cardiac disorders (n = 3) one due to vascular disorder, general disorders (n= 2), injuries (n = 1), neoplasms (n = 2), nervous system disorders (n = 11), psychiatric disorders (n = 1), respiratory disorders (n = 3), overdosage (n

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

= 1). Specific details of these fatalities and the degree of causal relationship to sumatriptan treatment were not provided.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions are summarised in the table below:

| Hypoaesthesia              |                  57 |
| Malaise                    |                  55 |
| Feeling abnormal           |                  53 |

The  pattern  and  relative  incidence  of  these  reported  ADRs  match  the  known  safety  profile  of sumatriptan in the literature. The majority of these ADRs occurred when sumatriptan was available as prescription medicine with a recommended dose of 100 mg.

A  further  Drug  Analysis  Print  of  the  ADRs  reported  covering  the  period  4  December  2006  until  30 November 2009 was also provided. In this analysis there were a total of 188 ADRs from 62 reports and no  fatality  occurred.  In  the  view  of  the  Applicant,  the  ADRs  reported  did  not  reveal  significant  or untoward  safety  concerns  following  the  introduction  of  non-prescription  50  mg  sumatriptan.  The Applicant  concluded  that  the  pattern  and  relative  incidence  of  the  reported  common  AEs  are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

comparable to the safety profile of sumatriptan in the literature.

However, difficulties arose with regards to the safety implications linked to the proposed legal status of supply: the CHMP considered that the safety profile of the non-prescriptive 50 mg sumatriptan was difficult  to  assess  as  the  data  were  limited.  The  absolute  numbers of reported events are of limited value as there is no denominator (patients' exposure time) and hence the relative incidence was also not assessable. Moreover, the data presented were AEs from a mixed population (i.e. reports of all prescription  sumatriptan  strengths  25  mg,  50  mg  and  100  mg  and  non-prescriptive  prescription combined). It was not possible to compare the data of the prescription status with those of the nonprescription status.

Therefore, no conclusions could be drawn by the CHMP on the safety of non-prescription sumatriptan 50  mg.  The  safe  use  in  cardiovascular  and  cerebrovascular  compromised  subjects  had  not  been addressed.  In  the  absence  of  data,  the  CHMP  considered  that  general  safety  issues  could  not  be excluded.

However, the CHMP needs to make benefit/risk evaluations based on the data submitted and scientific knowledge, taking into account the proposed precautionary measures.

Reference to wide-spread availability of other approved non-prescription treatment options in migraine was  only  partly  accepted  as  an  argument.  In  view  of  the  Committee  a  B/R  evaluation  for  nonprescription should always be made taking into account the specific risks of the active substance (i.e. sumatriptan).

These are emphasised by the contra-indications, precautions of use, adverse events as stated in the SPC of sumatriptan. To this effect, some primary and secondary care guidelines concerning migraine place triptans as second line in their treatment recommendations after an insufficient response on an appropriate  dosed  combination  of  NSAID/antiemetic,  based  on  the  unfavourable  safety  profile  of triptans taking into account the availability of alternative treatment. The CHMP also considered that the intended intensive monitoring programme proposed by the applicant concerning correct diagnosis, first prescription by physician, monitoring of previous responses, correct use, monitoring frequency of use, etc reinforces this view. This high level of monitoring goes against and would violate the principle of patient's self management of non-prescription products.

In  addition,  this  monitoring  programme  would  need  to  be  performed  every  time  a  new  supply  is foreseen,  in  order  to  verify  whether  or  not  the  conditions  of  a  patient  have  changed.  Whether  this would occur in practice on a regular basis has not been addressed.

The precautions poorly address the change in patients' migraine characteristics  warranting  different treatment/migraine-prophylaxis,  occurrence  of  mixed  headache,  medication  overuse,  change  of medical condition with respect to cardiovascular contra-indications and warnings.

Additionally,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  risk  and  burden  of  medication  overuse  headache  (MOH) due  to  sumatriptan  use  should  not  be  underestimated.  Overall  estimates  of  MOH  prevalence  range from 0.7% to 1.7% up to 5%. However, in a study of 532 patients with episodic migraine overall 10% of  the  patients  overused  headache  medication.  Over-users  of  triptans  developed  chronic  headache faster and used fewer single dosages than over-users of analgesics. In addition, 12% of the patients in this  study  had  a  combination  of  migraine  and  tension-type  headache  and  the  1-year  incidence  of chronic headache was 14%. Hence, chronic headache in migraine patient may be due to a prolonged migraine attack, increase of tension type headache or MOH. It may not be easy to detect an early migraine  attack  amidst  chronic  headaches  in  patients  with  mixed  headaches.  Hence,  an  emerging migraine attack might not be easy to distinguish and misclassification leading to sumatriptan overuse is  likely.  Triptans  overuse  is  becoming  the  most  common cause of MOH. Triptans are more likely to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

induce MOH than simple analgesics. It is noted that overuse of analgesics and acute migraine drugs fulfil the criteria of substance abuse disorder in two third of all patients with MOH.

The proposed package size of two tablets does not form a guarantee prevention of medication overuse headache. It is the frequency of acute attacks that determines medication use, not the package size. As such, the small package size is not seen as a sufficient risk minimisation measure.

The Applicant also proposed to strengthen the Package Leaflet and to introduce Pharmacy Training, including a patient migraine questionnaire and an algorithm for managing migraine, to make it clear when  non-prescription  analgesics  may  be  suitable  for  the  customer  and  when  migraineurs  should consult their physician.

The Applicant additionally proposed to conduct a post-approval observational study, to commence at launch, to assess the safety of non-prescription supply. In the view of the Applicant, this study would address  the  concern  for  longitudinal  follow-up  by  being  conducted  over  36  months  (with  interim reports at 12 and 24) and following individuals for a period of time sufficient to monitor changes in migraineurs. The study would also specifically assess whether sumatriptan or other treatment is more suitable for the patient and whether the first diagnosis and treatment was made by the physician. True and simulated patients would be recruited. The applicant proposed that the continued approval of the MA for sumatriptan would be conditional upon a positive outcome of this study.

The CHMP questioned, however, whether the proposed observational study would adequately evaluate the appropriate use of sumatriptan in practice. The study would be performed in a highly motivated setting  which  does  not  evaluate  whether  in  practice  the  questionnaire  is  always  performed  by  a qualified  pharmacist,  longitudinal  follow-up  is  adequate  and  changes  in  patient's  characteristics  are picked up.

## 2.4.6 Conclusions on clinical aspects

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  results  of the  bioequivalence  study 10-12-072  indicated  that sumatriptan 100 mg tablets manufactured by Cipla, India are bioequivalent with Imigran, sumatriptan 100  mg  tablets,  GlaxoSmithKline  UK  under  fasting  conditions  as  the  90%  CI  for  AUCt,  AUCinf  and Cmax were within the acceptance range of 0.80-1.25. These results could be extrapolated to the only strength of sumatriptan applied for with this application, i.e. 50 mg.

However, the CHMP considered that treatment with sumatriptan needs medical diagnosis and follow-up of  the  patient  in  particular  in  view  of  the  danger  associated  with  its  significant  cardiovascular  and cerebrovascular adverse effects.

Even if a patient has been initially prescribed sumatriptan following medical diagnosis, patients may undergo  changes  in  cardiovascular  and  cerebro-vascular  risk  over  time,  as  a  patient's  condition changes. Monitoring is also necessary due to possible change in type of headache, possible medication overuse  headache  and  assessment  of  the  need  for  prophylactic  treatment  with  other  medicines. Therefore, in a Non-Prescription setting, where Sumatriptan would be used without medical supervision and follow-up, this is ' likely to present a danger either directly or indirectly, even if used correctly' , as per the first criterion of the EC 'Guideline on Changing the Classification for the Supply of a Medicinal product for Human Use' (The Rules governing Medicinal Products in the European Community, Volume 2C: Guidelines).

In considering whether this criterion applies, the CHMP took into account the following factors:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cardiovascular and cerebro-vascular adverse events are major safety concerns with sumatriptan use, as  triptans  have  been  shown  to  cause  narrowing  of  coronary  arteries  and  coronary  vasospasm. Cardiovascular  and  cerebro-vascular  risk  also  changes  over  time  as  a  patient's  condition  change. Additionally,  the  literature  shows  that  adverse  cardiovascular  events  may  occur  in  patients  with previously  unrecognized  cardiovascular  disease.  Although  previous  history  of  cardiovascular  and cerebrovascular disease are contraindicated with sumatriptan, if the non-prescription status be granted under the model proposed by the Applicant, the risks deriving from use by these patients would be greater.  This  is  of  particular  concern  with  the  use  of  sumatriptan  in  patients  with  a  previously unrecognized cardiovascular disease as the cardiovascular status/risks may change over time.

The non-prescriptive status implies that the absence of clinical supervision resulting from the change in prescription status can be covered by pharmacists or by patients themselves. The applicant proposed the following restriction to the indication '….patients who have previously been prescribed sumatriptan 50 mg tablets for their migraine'. However, the applicant did not satisfactorily demonstrate that the addition of this sentence would indeed reduce the risk of inappropriate use of the product when used in the Non-Prescription setting.

Patient's condition and headache/migraine characteristics, response to treatment, co-medications may change over time, potentially affecting the appropriateness of sumatriptan use. Using sumatriptan, for instance, some migraine patients may suffer from more frequent and more severe attacks, requiring intervention from a physician, to review, modify or suspend sumatriptan use as a consequence or to initiate prophylactic treatment with other medicines. Detection of misuse and overuse and corrective action would be delayed if patients would not have to consult a doctor anymore.

The CHMP was of the opinion that the addition of contraindications, warnings and information on the use of interacting drugs to the Sumatriptan Galpharm SPC/PL proposed by the Applicant will not be sufficient  to  address  the  concerns  in  a  non-prescription  setting.  Patients  are  likely  to  be  unable  to evaluate and distinguish between the various contraindications and warnings. Additionally, the CHMP was not  convinced  that  the  change  in  risk  for  cardiovascular  events  and  migraine  status  over  time could be fully evaluated by patients or pharmacists, thus making sumatriptan unsuitable for the nonprescription setting.

To complement the patient self-assessment, the applicant proposed a Patient Migraine Questionnaire and a Pharmacy Migraine Management algorithm as risk minimization measures. These did not address the  concerns  and  were  not  considered  acceptable  as  they  showed  a  high  level  of  complexity. Additionally,  the  pharmacist  would  have  been  required  to  take  a  general  medical  history.  These measures would be incompatible with the non-prescriptive principle.

It can not be expected that the patient is able to distinguish and evaluate the various contraindications and warnings (i.e. ischemic stroke, TIA, basilar migraine, coronary heart disease, Prinz-Metal angina, uncontrolled (=unknown) hypertension, cardiac risk profile, etc.). Whether or not the degree of cardiac risk can be fully evaluated by patients or pharmacists is questionable.

A large proportion of subjects suffer from mixed headaches, and the differential diagnosis of migraine vs. headache is not straightforward. Without medical supervision, the condition/symptoms may not be correctly assessed. Even with the proposed restriction to be given sumatriptan only further to previous medical diagnosis of migraine by a doctor, this concern was not considered resolved.

Under a non-prescription status, the risk of medication overuse headache (MOH) or misuse can not be controlled.  With  a  non-prescriptive  status,  any  patient  who  had  been  previously  diagnosed  with migraine could, in practice,  always  obtain  and  use  the  medicinal  product,  increasing  the  risk  of  the medication being overused or used incorrectly.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This  incorrect  use  of  triptans  and  risk  of  medicine  induced  headache  by  triptans  is  not  theoretical. There are reports in the literature which indicate that sumatriptan may have a higher risk of overuse than  analgesics  and  leads  to  medication-overuse  headache.  In  the  general  population,  chronic  daily headache has a prevalence of 2% -4% and MOH accounts for 50% of these cases. Triptans are the most  frequent  drugs  taken  by  patients  who  develop  MOH  and  have  the  shortest  delay  (1.7  years) between drug overuse and onset of daily headache.

The risk  and  burden  of  medication  overuse  headache  (MOH)  due  to  sumatriptan  use  should  not  be underestimated. Overall estimates of MOH prevalence range from 0.7% to 1.7% up to 5%. However, in a study of 532 patients with episodic migraine the 1-year incidence of chronic headache was 14%. Overall, 10% of the patients overused headache medication. Over-users of triptans developed chronic headache faster and used fewer single dosages that over-users of analgesics. In addition 12% of the patients  in  the  study  had  a  combination  of  migraine  and  tension-type  headache.    Hence,  chronic headache in migraine patient may be due to the late migraine attack, tension-type headache or MOH. It may be difficult to detect an early migraine attack amidst chronic headaches in patients with mixed headaches.  Thus,  an  emerging  migraine  attack  with  a  chronic  headache  might  not  be  easy  to distinguish and misclassification leading to sumatriptan overuse is likely. Triptans overuse is becoming the  most  common  cause  of  MOH.  Triptans  are  more  likely  to  induce  MOH  than  simple  analgesics. Finally,  the  overuse  of  analgesics  and  acute  migraine  drugs  fulfil  the  criteria  of  substance  abuse disorder in two third of all patients with MOH.

Detection  of  misuse  and  overuse  and  its  treatment  would  be  delayed  if  patients  would  not  have  to consult a doctor anymore.

There  is  wide  use  and  18  years  of  clinical  experience  with  the  prescription  status,  while  the  nonprescription is only approved since 2006 in the UK and since 2008 in Sweden. Thus, the mechanism of action  and  side-effects  of  sumatriptan  are  well-known,  whilst  the  safety  profile  of  non-prescription sumatriptan 50mg (in comparison to the prescription medication sumatriptan) has not appropriately been addressed by the Applicant.

Two reports of Drug Print Analysis (DAP) post-marketing safety data (both from the UK, one covering 1994-2009 and the other 2006-2009), were submitted by the Applicant to support the clinical safety of Non-Prescription  sumatriptan.  However,  these  data  were  limited,  and  the  safety  profile  of  the  NonPrescription sumatriptan 50 mg was not assessable. The absolute numbers of reported adverse events are  of  very  limited  value  as  there  is  no  denominator  (i.e.  'patient  exposure'  is  not  known).  More importantly,  the  data  presented  are  Adverse  Events  from  a  mixed  population  (i.e.  reports  of  all prescription sumatriptan strengths - 25 mg, 50mg and 100mg and 50 mg Non-Prescription combined). Thus,  it  was  not  possible  to  compare  the  data  of  the  Prescription  status  with  those  of  the  NonPrescription  status.  In  addition,  for  the  less  severe/serious  adverse  events  reporting  rates  for  NonPrescription product are unreliable (i.e. an increase in incidence may not be picked-up) as it is known that AEs reporting with Non-Prescription products is lower in comparison with those on Prescription. In conclusion, the safety data has not been presented by the Applicant in a way that provided sufficient reassurance over the potential dangers associated with the non-prescription status of sumatriptan.

The  data  submitted  were  neither  comprehensive  nor  sufficient.  Overall,  the  safety  data  was  not presented by the Applicant in a way that provided reassurance over the potential dangers associated with the non-prescription status of sumatriptan.

In conclusion, the CHMP considered monitoring to be necessary when using sumatriptan: if patients would  not  be  followed-up  by  a  doctor,  the  cardiovascular  and  cerebrovascular  risks  can  not  be controlled. Moreover, there is a potential for wide misuse (with the consequence of either medication

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

overuse headache or missing the need for switching to alternative prophylactic treatment). Therefore the CHMP did not recommend a non-prescriptive status for sumatriptan.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

In addition, the CHMP considered that in the case of a positive opinion the applicant should have taken the following minor points into consideration:

The  Applicant  was  requested  to  ensure  of  being  in  production  with  the  EMA  and  rapporteurs  for electronic submission of ICSRs before registration of the product.

On electronic reporting of ICSRs to the EMA and Rapporteur, the table of SOPs in the DDPS version 004 (dated 4 May 2011) stated that the Applicant is currently in process of conducting E2B testing with the EMA instead of being in production. Note that this would also have required an amendment of SOP 11.0.05. If the CHMP had recommended the granting of the marketing authorisations, the DDPS would have needed an amendment before marketing of the product.

## Risk Management Plan

Initially, the Applicant submitted a justification for not submitting a risk management plan (RMP). The Applicant did not expect the change to non-prescription status to result in any additional risk to the patient since non-prescription sumatriptan had been available in the UK since 2006 and safety data indicate no problems. The value of the submitted safety data was, however, questioned as stated in the clinical part of this assessment.

The Applicant further suggested that the proposed labelling, small pack size and the involvement of the pharmacist, on whose vigilance the Applicant heavily relies on, will ensure patient safety. The CHMP, however, noted that the as part of their assessment they had to consider whether for sumatriptan a non-prescription status may be approvable implying how clinical issues that are no longer covered due to the loss of prescription status can be covered by the user.

Despite the Applicant's initial reasoning not to submit a full RMP, the Applicant proposed a number of precautionary steps (see below) in order to thoroughly monitor the safety of this product and to ensure the risk benefit ratio remains favourable.

The CHMP, however, noted that the above simple precautionary measures proposed by the Applicant would  classify  as  risk  minimisation  measures  and  needed  therefore  to  be  fully  outlined  in  an  RMP. Therefore, they requested that a number of concerns identified during the assessment of the dossier would need to be addressed in a full RMP, aimed especially at the new non-prescription status, with its own specific identified and potential risks.

Additionally, the Applicant was  requested to investigate whether  their initially proposed risk minimisation measures (e.g. pharmacy educational material) were sufficient to ensure patient safety. Aspects to be taken into account include safety monitoring in PSURs with cases reported from Nonprescription  and  prescription  sales  clearly  distinguished  and  separately  analysed.  Besides  this,  the Applicant  proposed  to  perform  a  study  to  investigate  the  adherence  to  the  instructions  of  use  in practice, the protocol for which would be part of the RMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Thus, the applicant submitted a risk management plan, subsequently amended as assessment of the MAA progressed, which in its latest version (version 3, dated May 2011) included a pharmacy training manual containing key messages, as follows:

## Introduction

A migraine management algorithm to be taken into account by the dispensing pharmacist was also proposed. This algorithm was subsequently amended to include additional aspects (marked in yellow in the flowchart below):

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

The proposed RMP also included a 'customer over the counter sumatriptan questionnaire', including a question whether the patient's pattern or frequency of migraines and headache changed as well as a reminder to tell the pharmacist and physician of any changes in the risk factor areas.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant additionally proposed to further develop this document in consultation with primary care pharmacists  and  physicians  before  pilot  testing  it  with  a  controlled  group  of  real  and  'primed' pharmacist/ customer migraine consultations. The final document would have had to be tested in a proposed post-marketing study.

The various efforts and amendments to the RMP as outlined above were noted by the CHMP. However, the submitted RMP was not in an acceptable format in line with Volume 9A guidance. Furthermore, it was considered that with respect to off-label use and use in other age groups than currently allowed by the SPC this risk was not adequately addressed.

Having considered the information outlined  above,  the  CHMP  still  questioned  whether  the  proposals adequately tackled the response on alternative treatment before switching to sumatriptan and whether the risk of migraine medication overuse was sufficiently addressed. To complement the patient selfassessment, the applicant proposed Patient Questionnaire and the Pharmacy Management algorithm as risk  minimization  measures.  These  were  not  considered  acceptable  as  they  showed  a  high  level  of complexity. Additionally, the pharmacist would have been required to take a general medical history. All these measures would be incompatible with the non-prescriptive principle.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  was  of  the  opinion  that  the proposed risk minimisation activities were not able to reduce the risks to an acceptable level.

In addition, the CHMP considered that the RMP was technically considered invalid due to lack of Safety Specification (no safety concerns were put in relation to the proposed risk minimisation measures).

## 3 Benefit-Risk Balance

This application concerns a 50 mg  sumatriptan tablets. The reference product chosen for bioequivalence,  Imigran  Tablets  100  mg,  is  indicated  for  acute  relief  of  migraine  attacks,  with  or without aura. No non-clinical studies have been provided for this generic application but an adequate summary  of  the  available  non-clinical  information  for  the  active  substance  was  presented  and considered sufficient.  From  a  clinical  perspective,  this  application  does  not  contain  new  data  on  the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics nor on the efficacy and safety of the active substance.

The bioequivalence study [10-12-072] forms the pivotal basis with a randomized, two-treatment, twoperiod,  two-sequence, crossover design. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation.  Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate.

The  test  formulation  of  [applied  product]  met  the  protocol-defined  criteria  for  bioequivalence  when compared with the [reference product]. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0- , and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated.

The  application  contained,  however,  insufficient  data  with  regards  to  supply  and  use.  The  following aspects are inadequately demonstrated: Safety of the non-prescription status.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4 Recommendation

Based on their review of the data on safety and efficacy, and in line with the provisions of Art. 71 of Directive 2001/83/EC and the EC 'Guideline on Changing the Classification for the Supply of a Medicinal product for Human Use' (The Rules governing Medicinal Products in the European Community, Volume 2C: Guidelines), the CHMP considered that the safety of Sumatriptan Galpharm for the 'acute relief of migraine attacks, with or without aura' has not been sufficiently demonstrated for the non-prescription status as detailed in the grounds stated below:

First  criterion 'Medicinal  products  shall  be  subject  to  medical  prescription  when  they  are  likely  to present  a  danger  either  directly  or  indirectly,  even  when  used  correctly,  if  utilised  without  medical supervision.' , is not fulfilled.

The CHMP considered that treatment with sumatriptan needs medical diagnosis and follow-up of the patient,  in  particular  in  view  of  the  danger  associated  with  its  significant  cardiovascular  and cerebrovascular adverse effects.

Even if a patient has been initially prescribed sumatriptan following medical diagnosis, patients may undergo  changes  in  cardiovascular  and  cerebro-vascular  risk  over  time,  as  a  patient's  condition changes. Monitoring is also necessary due to possible change in type of headache, possible medication overuse headache and assessment of the need for prophylactic treatment with other medicines.

Therefore, in a non-prescription setting, where sumatriptan would be used without medical supervision and follow-up, this is ' likely to present a danger either directly or indirectly, even if used correctly, if utilised without medical supervision'' as per the first criterion of the guideline.

Cardiovascular and cerebro-vascular adverse events are major safety concerns with sumatriptan use, as  triptans  have  been  shown  to  cause  narrowing  of  coronary  arteries  and  coronary  vasospasm. Although  previous  history  of  cardiovascular  and  cerebrovascular  disease  are  contraindicated  with sumatriptan, if the non-prescription status be granted under the model proposed by the Applicant, the risks deriving from use by these patients would be greater. This is of particular concern with the use of sumatriptan in  patients  with  a  previously  unrecognized  cardiovascular  disease  as  the  cardiovascular status/risks may change over time.

Patient's condition and headache/migraine characteristics, response to treatment, co-medication may change over time, potentially affecting the appropriateness of sumatriptan use. Using sumatriptan, for instance, some migraine patients may suffer from more frequent and more severe attacks. This would require  the  intervention  of  a  physician  to  review,  modify  or  suspend  sumatriptan  use  or  to  initiate prophylactic treatment with other medicines. Detection of misuse, overuse and corrective action would be delayed if patients would not have to consult the doctor anymore.

The CHMP was of the opinion that the addition of contraindications, warnings and information on the use of interacting drugs to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet of Sumatriptan Galpharm as proposed by the Applicant, will not be sufficient to address the concerns related to a nonprescription setting. Patients are unable to evaluate and distinguish between the various contraindications and warnings. Additionally, the CHMP was not convinced that the change in risk for cardiovascular  events  and  migraine  status  over  time  could  be  fully  evaluated  by  patients  or pharmacists, thus making sumatriptan unsuitable for the non-prescription setting.

To  complement  the  patient  self-assessment,  the  Applicant  proposed  a  Patient  Questionnaire  and  a Pharmacy Management algorithm as additional risk minimization measures. These did not address the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CHMP  concerns  and  were  not  considered  acceptable  as  the  Patient  Questionnaire  was  long  and impractical while the decision tree for the pharmacist was too complex. Additionally, the pharmacist would  have  been  required  to  take  a  general  medical  history.  All  these  aspects  were  seen  as incompatible with the non-prescription principle.

There is wide use and 18 years of clinical experience with sumatriptan as a prescription product, while the non-prescription status is only approved since 2006 in two member states. Thus, the mechanism of action  and  side-effects  of  sumatriptan  are  well-known,  whilst  the  safety  profile  of  non-prescription sumatriptan 50mg (in comparison to the prescription product) has not appropriately been addressed by  the  Applicant.  The  data  submitted  were  neither  comprehensive  nor  sufficient.  In  conclusion,  the safety  data  has  not  been  presented  by  the  Applicant  in  a  way  that  provided  reassurance  over  the potential dangers associated with the non-prescription status of sumatriptan.

## Second criterion: 'Medicinal products shall be subject to medical prescription when they are frequently and to a very wide extent used incorrectly, and as a result are likely to present a direct or indirect danger to human health.'

CHMP was of the opinion that medical monitoring is necessary: if patients would not be followed-up by a  doctor,  there  is  a  potential  for  wide  misuse  with  the  consequence  of  either  medication  overuse headache or missing the need for switching to alternative prophylactic treatment. The argumentation made above for the first criterion also supports this.

The  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  first  and  second  criteria  for  medicinal  products  subject  to medical prescription under Art. 71 of the Directive 2001/83/EC, are met for sumatriptan therefore can not recommend the classification as 'medicinal product not subject to prescription'.

Having considered the above, the CHMP is of the opinion that pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No  726/2004,  the  safety  of  the  above  mentioned  medicinal  product  is  not  properly  or  sufficiently demonstrated to be authorised as product not subject to prescription.

Therefore, the CHMP recommended the refusal of the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for the above mentioned medicinal product.

## 5 Re-examination of the CHMP opinion dated 21 July 2011

Following the CHMP opinion dated 21 July 2011 recommending the refusal of the granting of the marketing Authorisation for Sumatriptan Galpharm, the Applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the grounds for refusal.

## Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant

The applicant presented their detailed grounds for re-examination in writing and at an oral explanation to the CHMP on 14 November 2011. The argumentation of the Applicant is summarised in the following five points:

1. The divergent opinion of the Committee;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2. The currently approved non-prescription triptans and the likely approval in the near future of further non-prescription sumatriptan Marketing Authorisations via National Procedures;

3. The extensive published safety data which has been peer reviewed by experts;

4. The results of the user testing of the proposed Package Leaflet in a number of EU Member States in addition to those Member States which already have non-prescription triptans approved.

5. Migraine is a pervasive and debilitating condition which is readily self-diagnosed and treated with OTC analgesics. Convenient and fast access to migraine-specific treatment is important for the quality of life of migraine sufferers.

Additionally, following a request from the applicant as part of their re-examination request, the CHMP convened  a  Scientific  Advisory  Group  (SAG)  consisting  of  Neurology  experts  and  including  General Practitioners, representatives from patient groups and from the Pharmaceutical Group of the European Union (PGEU), representing European Community Pharmacists to provide their views in relation to the marketing  authorisation  application,  taking  into  account  the  CHMP  grounds  for  refusal  and  the applicant's responses to them.

How the above Grounds for re-examination relate to aspects of the original CHMP grounds for refusal, how they were assessed by the CHMP, how the SAG input adds to the picture and aspects covered at the oral explanation to the CHMP on 14 November 2011 is described below.

In reference to the following grounds for refusal in the CHMP original assessment

-  The CHMP considered that treatment with sumatriptan needs medical diagnosis and follow-up of  the  patient  in  particular  in  view  of  its  most  significant  adverse  effects  (i.e.  cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects).
-  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  medical  monitoring  is  necessary:  if  patients  would  not  be followed-up by a doctor, there is a potential for wide misuse (with the consequence of either medication  overuse  headache  or  missing  the  need  for  switching  to  alternative  prophylactic treatment).

the Applicant commented as follows:

## Risk associated with cardiovascular disease

The applicant referred to several studies mentioned hereinafter.

Reference  was  made  to  Welch  and  Mathew  et  al.  that  investigated  the  cardiovascular  safety  of sumatriptan using a variety of approaches and study methods. The data from these studies suggest that  the  chest  symptoms  sometimes  reported  after  Sumatriptan  rarely  are  linked  to  ischaemic  ECG changes.

The study by Hall and Brown et al including a total of 63,575 migraine patients and 77,239 control subjects was also referred to by the Applicant. This study showed that triptan treatment of migraine does not increase  the  risk  of  myocardial  infarction  cardiovascular  death,  ischaemic  heart  disease  or mortality.

Velentgas and Cole et al conducted a retrospective study of 130,411 migraineurs (50,383 of whom received a triptan) and 130,411 matched non-migraineurs. This study was performed in response to speculation  that  the  use  of  triptans  or  ergot  alkaloid  drugs  might  increase  risk  of  ischaemic  events through vasoconstriction.

The study showed that there was no increased risk of myocardial infarction with current (adjusted RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.58-1.11) or recent (adjusted RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.71-1.87) triptan use.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Dodick and Lipton et al summarised the evidence reviewed by a panel (composed of an international multidisciplinary  group  of  experts  in  neurology,  primary  care,  cardiology,  pharmacology,  women's health and epidemiology) their conclusions about the evidence and their recommendations for the use of  triptans  in  the  treatment  of  migraine.  In  their  conclusion,  data  obtained  from  a  variety  of methodologies including PET, ECG and angiography demonstrate that chest symptoms occurring after use of triptans in some patients are rarely accompanied by evidence of ischaemia. This safety review panel concluded that:

1. Most (but not all) of the triptan safety data are derived from patients without known coronary artery disease.

2. Chest symptoms occurring during use of triptans are generally non-serious and are not explained by ischaemia.

3. The incidence of serious cardiovascular events with triptans in both clinical trials and clinical practice appears extremely low.

4. The cardiovascular risk-benefit profile of triptans favours their use in absence of contraindications.

The panel concluded that these data show that triptans can be confidently used by migraineurs at low risk of coronary artery disease without the need for prior cardiac status evaluation.

The CHMP noted that the Applicant presented data from the literature focused on the safety profile of sumatriptan.  No  reassurance  relative  to  the  first  ground  for  refusal  by  CHMP  i.e.  treatment  with sumatriptan needs medical diagnosis and follow-up of the patient, was, however, provided. This CHMP concern  has  therefore  not  been  addressed  by  the  Applicant.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  safety profile  of  sumatriptan  is  well-known  and  the  cardio-vascular  and  cerebro-vascular  adverse  events remained a safety issue for the CHMP.

Patients with cardiac/cerebrovascular conditions treated with sumatriptan  could experience  an increased risk for adverse events. A trial conducted on 5 patients with variant angina demonstrated coronary artery spasm when sumatriptan was injected intracoronary as opposed to 4 control patients without variant angina (Shimizu et al Intern J Cardiol 2007). This study does not, however, indicate that sumatriptan induce ischemic disorders in healthy subjects.

In addition to the above, there are several publications highlighting safety concerns with the use of triptans in general. A search in PubMed for safety concerns with the use of triptans revealed a number of publications. Notable findings are listed below:

-  Although  the  relatively  restricted  use  of  triptans  may  be  attributed  to  several  factors,  research suggests that prescribers' concerns about cardiovascular safety prominently figure in limiting their use [Dodick et al, Headache. 2004 May;44 Suppl 1:S20-30].

- Cardiovascular risk-assessment algorithms suggest that patients at low risk (1 or no risk factors) of coronary heart disease can be prescribed triptans without the need for a more intensive cardiovascular evaluation. Conversely, patients with established coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease risk equivalents should not be prescribed triptans according to the current prescribing recommendations. Patients at intermediate risk (2 or more risk factors) of coronary heart disease require cardiovascular evaluation before triptans can be prescribed. Current understanding suggests that the risk of future acute coronary events is a function of the absolute number of vulnerable plaques present, a variable that cannot be accurately determined using available technology or risk-prediction models. Cardiovascular  risk-assessment  guidelines  should  be  evaluated  in  the  context  of  this  limitation [Papademetriou, Headache. 2004 May;44 Suppl 1:S31-9].

- A recent publication [Barra et al, Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2010 Nov;11(16):2727-37 ] states that sumatriptan  administration  can  be  followed,  in  close  temporal  relationship,  by  Acute  Myocardial Infarction in young or adult migraine patients. Some of these cases have developed in subjects taking their first dose. Based on the results of prospective studies, the risk of severe cardiovascular adverse events  after  the  use  of  a  triptan  is  estimated  at  1:100,000  treated  attacks.  These  adverse  events,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

albeit  very  infrequent,  highlight  the  importance  of  careful  adherence  to  the  sumatriptan  prescribing information.

Diagnosis of migraine can be complex, and it may be difficult for the patient to distinguish migraine from  other  types  of  headache.  The  issue  raised  by  CHMP  that  treatment  with  sumatriptan  needs medical diagnosis and follow-up of the patient in order to identify those patients with cardiovascular disease, as the cardiovascular status/risks may change over time, remains therefore unresolved.

## Risk associated with cerebrovascular disease

The Applicant referred to a study by Hall and Brown et al. which provided epidemiological evidence that  there  is  no  association  between  triptan  treatment  in  migraine  and  an  increased  risk  of  stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.13; 95% CI 0.78, 1.65).

It was also pointed out by the Applicant that a retrospective study by Velentgas and Cole et al showed that migraineurs were 67% more likely to suffer a stroke than non-migraineurs (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.67,95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-2.13) and that neither current (adjusted RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.64-1.26) nor recent (adjusted RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.46-1.55) triptan use was associated with risk of stroke.

The CHMP considered that the literature data presented by the Applicant had been reviewed previously. The Committee noted a reported case of a 34-year-old woman with no previous migraine history who presented with migraine-like headache, thought to be a first attack of migraine, and who developed brainstem infarction shortly after sumatriptan administration. A detailed etiological evaluation revealed no risk factor for ischemic stroke. The authors believed that the migraine-like headache was the first symptom  of  cerebral  ischemia  and  that  sumatriptan  accelerated  the  development  of  the  infarction [Gazioglu S, Boz C, Ozmenoglu M., Neurol sci. 2011 Jun 17.]

The issue raised by CHMP that treatment with sumatriptan needs medical diagnosis and follow-up of the patient,  in  order  to  identify  those  patients  with  cerebrovascular  disease,  as  its  status/risks  may change over time, remains therefore unresolved.

## Risk  associated  with  changes  in  type  of  headache,  medication  overuse  headache  and  the  need  for prophylactic treatment

The Applicant argued that the proposed package leaflet contains all the information necessary for the safe non-prescription use of Sumatriptan Galpharm. This includes clear instructions for migraineurs to visit  their  physician  annually  to  have  their  medication  reviewed.  To  this  end,  previous  proposals  of questionnaires aiding pharmacists and patients on determining the suitability of sumatriptan treatment were not pursued during the re-examination phase.

The Applicant argued that pack size restriction to 2 tablets only constituted a sufficiently significant barrier to medication overuse.

The  CHMP  was  not  convinced  that  the  above  points  alone  would  sufficiently  address  their  concerns about changes in type of headache and medication overuse headache.

In addition, the Committee considered that there is a differentiation in the types of headache and a different management  strategy for each type (e.g. tensions headache). Such diagnosis and differentiation should be performed by an experienced physician and cannot be left to the subjective judgement of patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients  with  frequent  migraine  attacks  are  more  at  risk  of  medication  overuse  headache.  Migraine attacks sometimes increase in frequency over time. Headache experts conceptualize this process with a  model  that  envisages  transition  into  and  out  of  four  distinct  states:  no  migraine,  low-frequency episodic  migraine  (&lt;10  headaches  per  month),  high-frequency  episodic  migraine  (10-14  headaches per  month),  and  chronic  migraine  (CM,  &gt;or=15  headaches  per  month).  Transitions  may  be  in  the direction of increasing or decreasing headache frequency and are influenced by specific risk factors. Overall, population studies estimate that patients who have low-frequency episodic migraine or highfrequency episodic migraine will transition to CM at the rate of about 2.5% per year. The influence of medication is modified by both headache attack frequency and frequency of medication use [Goldman MD, Login IS, Headache 2003 Jan;43(1):85-6; author reply 86]

There  are  also  differences  in  the  clinical  practice  and  the  diagnosis  of  migraine.  There  are  several examples of misdiagnosis of migraine in the literature. A case of pituitary haemorrhage was reported [Krimsky  W,  Weiss  H,  Headache.  2002  Apr;42(4):291-3].  The  patient  presented  with  a  sudden bifrontal  headache  associated  with  vague  transient  visual  blurring  but  without  nausea  or  other associated symptoms. After a negative workup at another hospital, including an unremarkable brain computed tomography without contrast, and resolution of headache following treatment with injectable sumatriptan, he was diagnosed with \"atypical migraine.\" The patient's symptoms soon returned, and brain magnetic  resonance  imaging  revealed  an  enlarged,  cystic pituitary gland with a small intraparenchymal haemorrhage.

Clinical  approaches  to  the  patient  with  migraine  include  step  care,  whereby  all  patients  begin  on  a simple or non-specific treatment, stepping up to the next level of therapy if treatment is unsuccessful; or  stratified  care,  whereby  first-line  therapy  is  tailored  to  the  severity  of  the  patient's  pattern  of headache.  Studies  have  demonstrated  that  for  more  disabled  headache  patients,  the  stratified-care approach results in more robust headache response with less disability and greater cost-effectiveness than step care. Patient satisfaction studies demonstrate that the use of migraine-specific medications (triptans) is associated with a higher satisfaction rate than non-prescription preparations, NSAIDs, and analgesic  combinations.  Patients  who  initially  reported  satisfaction  with  the  latter  medications  also reported  a  preference  for  triptan  therapy.  Healthcare  professionals  can  assist  patients,  not  only  by choosing  the  most  appropriate  medication  but  also  by  assessing  whether  the  level  of  benefit  the patient is currently receiving could be improved [Diamond M , Cady R, Am J Med. 2005 Mar;118 Suppl 1:18S-27S].

An  example  of  Recurrent  occipital  seizures  misdiagnosed  as  status  migrainosus  has  been  reported [Italiano  D,  Grugno  R,  Calabrò  RS,  Bramanti  P,  Di  Maria  F,  Ferlazzo  E,  Epileptic  disord  2011 Jun;13(2):197-201].  Peri-ictal  headache  is  commonly  reported  in  patients  with  epilepsy  and  often exhibits migraine features. Misdiagnosis is frequent since visual seizures may often be misinterpreted as visual aura of migraine.

For  those  with  high  disability  levels,  migraine-specific  acute  therapies,  such  as  the  triptans,  are recommended  as  the  initial  treatment,  with  preventive  drugs  in  selected  patients.  A  variety  of behavioural  interventions  are  helpful.  Clinicians  have  in  their  armamentariums  an  ever-expanding variety of medications. With experience, clinicians can match individual patient needs with the specific characteristics of a drug to optimize therapeutic benefit [Bigal ME, Lipton RB, Krymchantowski AV, Am J Ther. 2004 Mar-Apr;11(2):130-40].

The existence of guidelines released by the International Headache Society [http://ihsclassification.org/en/02\\_klassifikation/05\\_anhang/13.07.01\\_anhang.html]  such  as    the  Classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders, cranial neuralgias and facial pain, is indicative of the need  for  a  step-by-step,  careful  approach  in  the  diagnosis  of  migraine  and  as  a  consequence  the prescription of the appropriate treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following is a classification of some types of headache

| A1. Migraine                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A2.Tension-typeheadache                                                                                                                             |
| A3. Cluster headache and other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias                                                                                    |
| A6.Headacheattributedtocranialorcervicalvasculardisorder                                                                                            |
| A7. Headache attributed to non-vascular intracranial disorder                                                                                       |
| A8. Headache attributed to a substance or its withdrawal                                                                                            |
| A9. Headache attributed to infection                                                                                                                |
| A10. Headache attributed to disorder of homoeostasis                                                                                                |
| A11. Headache or facial pain attributed to disorder of cranium, neck, eyes, ears, nose, sinuses, teeth, mouth or other facial or cranial structures |
| A12. Headache attributed to psychiatric disorder                                                                                                    |
| Ai3. Cranial neuralgias and central causes of facial pain                                                                                           |

Therefore,  having  considered  all  the  above,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  issues  previously  raised about the risk of sumatriptan associated with overuse leading to medication-overuse headache (MOH) and the feasibility of regular disease monitoring and treatment monitoring in a non-prescription setting remained unresolved.

## Post Marketing Safety Data

The Applicant argued that the fact that since first becoming available there have not been any major changes  to  the  safety  sections  of  the  approved  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  constitutes evidence from the Competent Authorities that there are no safety concerns for non-prescription supply.

During the CHMP discussion, the Swedish experience with triptans being available as non prescription was considered. Information concerning the safety of sumatriptan (packages each containing two 50 mg tablets) as reflected in Swedish national databases is provided below:

1. The number of questions concerning sumatriptan to the National Poison Information Center at the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden has been fairly constant during the last 10 years. No information about any deaths where sumatriptan could be part of the cause of death has been recorded.
2. The Swedish National Board of Forensic Medicine has since the beginning of 2011 the technical abilities to analyze sumatriptan. So far (October 2011) in only one subject undergoing autopsy sumatriptan was found. The subject also had a relatively severe hypokalaemia. No direct association between the death and the sumatriptan concentration could be established.
3. The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare publishes yearly statistics concerning causes of all death related to the whole population of Sweden. In their records for the last 10 years the search term 'sumatriptan' has not been found in any single entries in this database. However, the database was designed to regularly supervise only some drugs related to causes of death, e.g. paracetamol. Sumatriptan is not included among these substances.
4. The Swedish Coronarangio- and Angioplastic Registry (SCAAR) collects data related to, as the name indicates, coronarangiographic and angioplastic procedures in Sweden. In their records for the last 10 years the search term 'sumatriptan' has not been found in any single entries in any of their multiple databases.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

5. The Swedish National Adverse Reactions database collects information reported to the Swedish MPA by the Swedish Hospitals and primary care providers. No increase in reporting of either headaches and/or cardio vascular events has been reported since the OTC introduction.

In Sweden, where triptans have received non-prescription status and are purchased from shelves in the  pharmacies  and  without  mandatory  contact  with  pharmacists,  no  deaths  related  to  the  use  of sumatriptan have been recorded in any of the searchable Swedish national health care databases.

As a comparison, non-selective non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [the most common first  line  drug  class  for  treating  migraine]  use  may  account  for  nearly  34%  of  all  gastrointestinal bleeding cases in the United States, and may have resulted in over 32,000 gastrointestinal bleeding hospitalizations and 3200 gastrointestinal bleeding deaths per year in the 1990s. [Reference: Tarone RE,  Blot  WJ,  McLaughlin  JK.  Non-selective  non-aspirin  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  and gastrointestinal bleeding: relative and absolute risk estimates from recent epidemiologic studies. Am J Ther. 2004 Jan-Feb;11(1):17-25.]

The CHMP acknowledged the above argument that there have not been any significant novel safety signals  related  to  non-prescription  supply  of  sumatriptan.  However,  this  did  not  reassure  the Committee. In general terms, spontaneous report systems may miss some safety signals, especially when the adverse event is a condition prevalent in the general population (e.g. cardiovascular disease). Proactive Post Marketing Surveillance data, e.g. in the form of large scale Phase IV clinical trials and dedicated safety registries would be more appropriate tools to fully characterise the safety profile of a product.

In the view of the CHMP, the absence of additional major spontaneous reports in Member States where sumatriptan is available as non-prescription cannot be considered as a definite proof of lack of safety concerns. Reports in the literature have identified risks with the use of triptans and sumatriptan even in  the  controlled  prescription  status  (See  comments  on  safety  above).  Additionally,  the  CHMP considered that the portion of non-prescription use in the non-prescription setting is relatively small and if there had been an increase in reporting it could have not been detected.

In addition, prescription or over-the-counter NSAIDs with or without oral triptans are commonly used for  treatment  of  acute  migraine  pain.  Little  is  known  about  patients'  treatment  strategy  when  they have  had  experiences  using  NSAIDs  and  oral  triptan  co-therapy  and  the  relationship  between treatment strategy and migraine symptoms and functionality. Migraine patients frequently change their treatment regimens in response to headache profiles [Ng-Mak DS, Hu XH, Chen YT, Ma L, Headache 2008 Sep;48(8):1176-85 ] .

## Revised method of supply and risk minimisation

To  take  into  account  differences  between  EU  members  states  in  the  supply  of  non-prescription medicines the Applicant revised their proposals for method of supply to ensure that all the information needed for the migraine sufferer to make the correct informed decision about whether or not to use non-prescription Sumatriptan and how often to visit their physician is present not only at the point of every sale but later when the dose is actually taken. This necessitated developing a leaflet based on the  Bulgarian,  German,  Swedish  and  UK  experience  of  approved  non-prescription  triptans  and  then user testing the resulting proposed leaflet in additional EU members states where OTC triptans are not currently available direct to migraine sufferers. To date successful user testing of the proposed leaflet has taken place in Denmark, Poland, Portugal and Romania. Repeat user testing of the proposed leaflet also took place in Bulgaria where non-prescription Sumatriptan is already available. User testing is also nearing completion in France.

The Applicant  argued  that  in  addition  to  the  leaflet,  the  latest  proposed  front  of  pack  repeats  clear instructions regarding who the medicine is suitable for and consequently who it is not suitable for. As a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

consequence the Applicant believed that pharmacy educational material could be cut down to an aide memoire.

The Applicant also argued that the restriction of the pack size to no more than 2 tablets, as well as the products price are measures designed to significantly reduce the likelihood of medication overuse. This strategy has been shown by the German post marketing experience of non-prescription triptans to be effective. This has shown that every individually supplied pack is accompanied by correct and sufficient information to ensure it will be used properly even if a pharmacist is not involved directly in its supply and subsequent consumption. The information is presented as 'front of pack' instructions and in the user tested package leaflet, which has meant that the pharmacy information can be reduced to an aide memoire.

The CHMP considered that the information in the front of pack (strap lines) and package leaflet did not provide  reassurance  of  an  environment  without  misuse  and/or  abuse  of  the  product  by  migraine sufferers. If misuse has already been reported for migraine medications in the prescription status, it can  be  expected  that  cases  of  misuse  will  increase  in  the  non-controlled  environment  of  nonprescription status.

In conclusion, the small pack size of 2 tablets could potentially be 'by-passed' by a patients during a migraine attack (e.g. visiting more than one pharmacy shops), leading to potential overuse.

In addition to the above-described arguments, the Applicant provided additional information on ad-hoc consultations with the Danish Pharmacy Group and Danish Migraine Patient Association.

The discussion with representatives of the Association of Danish Pharmacies was acknowledged  by  the  CHMP.  The  Committee  in  addition  also  considered  the  view  of Pharmacists' Associations as part of the SAG expertise. It was considered that the view on practice in one MS cannot be representative of all Member States, and it was also noted that there are differences in pharmacy practice across the EU and that in some member states sumatriptan  is  currently  available  without  prescription,  without  safety  concerns  in  those countries. The  Committee,  however,  considered  that  even  if  it  would  be  possible  to harmonise legal supply sub-categories throughout the European Union, specifically to require a  'Pharmacy  only'  supply,  the  CHMP  would  not  be  sufficiently  reassured  about  the  safety concerns in the non-prescription setting in all states across the European Union.

The discussion with the Danish Migraine Patient Association was acknowledged by the CHMP, who also considered the view of Patient Associations as part of the SAG expertise. The above mentioned survey can however be considered as subjective and 'pain driven' from migraine sufferers, without having considered the risks associated with the use of sumatriptan in a non-prescription status and under the lack of control and follow-up of a physician.

During the Oral Explanation of 14 November 2011, as further risk minimisation measure, the Applicant expressed their intention to conduct Post-Marketing Studies that in their opinion would generate data specific to non-prescription use. No details on the nature of these studies, their size or their specificity were, however, provided to the CHMP.

## Patient Information leaflet - Readability /user testing

In order to ensure that their proposed package leaflet be suitable for non-prescription use Galpharm Ltd performed user testing in a range of EU countries.

The CHMP acknowledged that the applicant had increased the number of Users test. The results of these tests, however, did not convince the CHMP that the information provided in the package leaflet

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and in the front of the pack constituted sufficient reassurance that the issues of misuse and/or abuse of the product by migraine sufferers would be addressed.

The CHMP was of the opinion that the addition of contraindications, warnings and information on the use of interacting drugs to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet of Sumatriptan Galpharm as proposed by the Applicant will not be sufficient to address the concerns related to a nonprescription setting. Patients are unable to evaluate and distinguish between the various contraindications and warnings. Additionally, the CHMP was not convinced that the change in risk for cardiovascular events and migraine status over time could be fully evaluated by patients, thus making sumatriptan unsuitable for the non-prescription setting.

## Access to currently approved non-prescription triptans in Europe

The Applicant pointed out that non-prerscription triptans have been approved in Europe via National Procedures.  Since  2006,  a  number  of  non-prescription  triptan  Marketing  Authorisations,  including sumatriptan,  have  been  granted  within  the  European  Union.  The  Applicant  stated  that  there  are currently  several  non-prescription  triptan  Marketing  Authorisations  approved  within  the  European Union, in Germany, Bulgaria, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

The Applicant's argument that non-prescription status for triptans has already been approved within the EU was noted by the CHMP. However, the limited information on the use of sumatriptan in a small number  of  Member  States  was  not  considered  sufficient  to  extrapolate  and  grant  a  Marketing Authorisation for the whole of the EU. With regards to the argument that if a product is considered safe for non-prescription use in one Member State this would necessarily extend to other European Member States, the CHMP considered that the following potential concerns were to be addressed, not linked to the intrinsic properties of the molecule per se:

a) the complexity of the condition in relation to the accuracy of the diagnosis and the identified safety concerns;

b) the differences in the national health systems;

c) the diversity in clinical and pharmacy practices;

d) in the context of self-assessment, the subjective 'performance' of the migraine sufferer, given the variability in level of culture, tradition and education across Europe.

In  addition  to  the  above,  the  CHMP  was  concerned  that  self  medication  is  not  appropriate  in  this particular  health  condition,  as  migraine  patients  would  potentially  have  delayed  access  to  their respective Healthcare Systems with potentially detrimental effects on their health if Sumatriptan would be given a non-prescription status.

## Report from the SAG

A  Scientific  Advisory  Group  in  Neurology  (with  additional  experts  from  patient  groups  and  from  the Pharmaceutical Group of the European Union - PGEU, representing European Community Pharmacists) convened  on  27  October  2011  in  the  context  of  the  re-examination  procedure  for  Sumatriptan Galpharm, to provide advice on a specific list of questions adopted by the CHMP at its October 2011 meeting.

In this context, the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur provided the SAG with an overview of the issues to be discussed and summarised the questions to the SAG. A presentation by the Applicant followed. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

meeting ended with a summary of the discussion, and the agreement of an answer for each of the issues. The applicant was briefed about the conclusions that the SAG would communicate to the CHMP. The CHMP questions and the answers provided by the SAG as an outcome are presented below.

1. The Rapporteurs have assessed the Applicants response to the grounds for refusal in the initial opinion from CHMP. The SAG is asked to comment on the grounds for refusal and the assessments.

SAG response: This question is largely covered by the responses to questions 2-5 below. Regarding the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular safety for sumatriptan, see response to question 5. For the impact of legal status on the risk for sumatriptan overuse, see response to question 4. Regarding the assessment of the need for prophylactic treatment with other medicinal products, the SAG considered that if a patient has more than 3 migraine attacks per month, the pharmacist should refer the patient to a physician for investigation and for assessment of the need for prophylactic treatment.

2. The SAG is invited to discuss the pros and cons of sumatriptan in the proposed nonprescription setting taking into account the proposed indication for patients earlier diagnosed with migraine (i.e. 'Sumatriptan Galpharm should only be used where there is a clear diagnosis of migraine'), and the package size of two tablets.

## SAG response:

The pros of sumatriptan in the non-prescription setting would be:

- -Ease of access to a drug of proven efficacy;

-Useful in case of a 'rescue situation' (e.g. when patients run out of their prescription supply, or they go away for a short time forgetting their medication);

-No clear signal for an increased risk for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular adverse events in the adult population (between 18 and 65 years old).

The cons would be:

- -Diagnosis of migraine can be complex, and it may be difficult for the patient and pharmacist to distinguish migraine from other types of headache;
- -There are insufficient data with regard to the risk of overuse in the non-prescription setting;
- -The cardiovascular risk in patients treated long-term may change over time;
- -Patients with frequent migraine attacks are more at risk of medication overuse headache. If a patient has more than 3 migraine attacks per month, the pharmacist should refer the patient to a physician for investigation and for consideration of prophylactic treatment.

-The SAG recommended that non-prescription sumatriptan should only be dispensed under supervision of pharmacists. The SAG was concerned that the risk of misuse or abuse of sumatriptan can increase if there is no control by a pharmacist when dispensing sumatriptan, and when sumatriptan is available outside of pharmacies. This will be the case in some member states, where sales of non-prescription drugs can not be restricted to pharmacy only category. The same concern applies to the possibility that sumatriptan may be sold via internet.

## 3. The SAG is asked to comment on the following issues:

-  Differences in efficacy and safety of treatment options of migraine e.g. NSAID or e.g. sumatriptan when taken in suggested non-prescription doses.

SAG response: The SAG considered that there were no clear differences in efficacy between NSAIDs and oral sumatriptan when taken in suggested non-prescription doses. Regarding safety, for occasional migraine attacks each type of treatment has its own safety implications, but it cannot be concluded that one drug has a worse safety profile than another. If used for frequent migraine attacks, both NSAIDs and sumatriptan can give medication overuse headache (although the risk seems to be higher for the triptan class), and for NSAIDs, there is an increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Potential medical consequences/risks if sumatriptan 50 mg in pack size of two tablets are sold non-prescription in pharmacies. How likely is it and what evidence exists that a subpopulation of migraine patients would turn into long term self medication?

SAG  response: There are at present insufficient data regarding this issue. It is known that approximately 10-12 % of patients will overuse sumatriptan in the prescription-only setting. Identified risks factors for this subpopulation are a high frequency of migraine (above 10 or 12 per month) and/or psychological profile of drug abuser. However, from the available data it can not be concluded if this subpopulation of patients will increase in a non-prescription setting.

4. How does the SAG assess the impact of the legal status (prescription only or nonprescription) on the risk for sumatriptan overuse (for any type of headache)?

SAG response: In countries where sumatriptan is used as non-prescription, there are no signs that the risk for overuse of sumatriptan has increased, and the small pack-size and increased cost vs. the prescription-only medicine will not be an incentive for some patients. However, more data is needed on this topic.

5. SAG is requested to comment on the cerebrovascular and cardiovascular safety of sumatriptan and the potential impact of the legal status (prescription only or nonprescription) on these specific aspects and on the safe use of sumatriptan in general.

SAG response: It is known from the literature that there is an increased risk for cardio- and cerebrovascular disease in patients with migraine, particularly those with aura, regardless of whether they are taking triptans or not. The SAG considered that there is no significant signal of an increased risk for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular adverse events with sumatriptan use in the adult population between 18 and 65 years old, and the SAG did not see any specific concerns with regard to the legal status for sumatriptan in this age group. There are weak data suggesting that cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events may not increase in triptan abusers. However there may be an under notification in this group. The risk for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular side effects increases with age. In the elderly above 65 years, there is at present insufficient safety data, and it was noted that sumatriptan is not indicated in this patient group.

## 6 Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination

The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the applicant in writing and in an oral explanation on 14 November 2011, taking into account the views of the Scientific Advisory Group.

The Committee noted that the Applicant's arguments were similar to previously assessed proposals. The CHMP considered that the issues concerning the risk associated with potential cardiovascular and cerebrovascular  adverse  effects  of sumatriptan  as  well  as the potential for  misuse  with  the consequence  of  either  medication  overuse  headache  (MOH)  or  missing  the  need  for  switching  to alternative prophylactic treatment remained unresolved.

The CHMP noted the SAG's position, especially with regards to the extent of the possible cardiovascular risk. The Committee, however, reiterated that, due to contraindications and the adverse event profile of  the  product  (e.g.  cardio/cerebrovascular  effects)  some  primary  and  secondary  care  guidelines concerning migraine place triptans as second line in their treatment recommendations.

The  CHMP  was  furthermore  still  of  the  view  that  treatment  with  sumatriptan  requires  a  medical diagnosis of migraine and follow-up of the patient headache.

The Applicant did not comment explicitly on the risk of medication overuse headache (MOH) related to triptans  as  this  issue  was  raised  by  the  CHMP  as  an  argument  not  to  recommend  the  approval  of Sumatriptan Galpharm with non-prescription status.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP considered that Sumatriptan is indeed a useful medication for the management of migraine but concerns remained over its safety in a non-prescription setting. The switch to a non-prescription status would create a direct risk of misdiagnosing migraine and indirect risk with misuse, abuse and interactions  with  concomitant  medications.  Changing  the  classification  of  Sumatriptan  to  nonprescription, even following a previous medical diagnosis, could also result in:

-  delay or absence of assessment of coronary artery disease;
-  inappropriate treatment of mixed headaches/migraine;
-  delay in the detection of overuse with the risk of the development of triptan overuse headache (MOH);
-  delay in assessment of the need for migraine prophylaxis.

The CHMP was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation activities (including the limitation of the pack-size to two tablets and the recommendation to consult the doctor regularly) were not able to reduce the risks to an acceptable level.

Based  on  the  above,  the  first  and  second  criteria  for  medical  prescription  under  Article  71  of  the Directive 2001/83, remain not fulfilled and therefore it is not recommended to change the classification of  sumatriptan  from  'medicinal  product  subject  to  medical  prescription'  to  'medicinal  product  not subject to medical prescription'.

## Recommendations following re-examination

Based on the arguments of the applicant and all the supporting data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP re-examined its initial opinion and in its final opinion concluded by majority decision that the risk-benefit balance of Sumatriptan Galpharm in the applied indication was unfavourable and that the application  did  not  satisfy  the  criteria  for  authorisation.  The  CHMP  recommended  the  refusal  of  the granting of the marketing authorisation.

The grounds for the decision are as follows:

Based on their review of the data on safety and efficacy, and in line with the provisions of Art. 71 of Directive 2001/83/EC and the EC 'Guideline on Changing the Classification for the Supply of a Medicinal product for Human Use' (The Rules governing Medicinal Products in the European Community, Volume 2C: Guidelines), the CHMP considered that the safety of Sumatriptan Galpharm for the 'acute relief of migraine attacks, with or without aura' has not been sufficiently demonstrated for the non-prescription status as detailed in the grounds stated below:

First  criterion 'Medicinal  products  shall  be  subject  to  medical  prescription  when  they  are  likely  to present  a  danger  either  directly  or  indirectly,  even  when  used  correctly,  if  utilised  without  medical supervision.' , is not fulfilled.

The CHMP considered that treatment with sumatriptan needs medical diagnosis and follow-up of the patient,  in  particular  in  view  of  the  danger  associated  with  its  significant  cardiovascular  and cerebrovascular adverse effects.

Even if a patient has been initially prescribed sumatriptan following medical diagnosis, patients may undergo  changes  in  cardiovascular  and  cerebro-vascular  risk  over  time,  as  a  patient's  condition changes. Monitoring is also necessary due to possible change in type of headache, possible medication overuse headache and assessment of the need for prophylactic treatment with other medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Therefore, in a non-prescription setting, where sumatriptan would be used without medical supervision and follow-up, this is ' likely to present a danger either directly or indirectly, even if used correctly, if utilised without medical supervision'' as per the first criterion of the guideline.

Cardiovascular and cerebro-vascular adverse events are major safety concerns with sumatriptan use, as  triptans  have  been  shown  to  cause  narrowing  of  coronary  arteries  and  coronary  vasospasm. Although  previous  history  of  cardiovascular  and  cerebrovascular  disease  are  contraindicated  with sumatriptan, if the non-prescription status be granted under the model proposed by the Applicant, the risks deriving from use by these patients would be greater. This is of particular concern with the use of sumatriptan in  patients  with  a  previously  unrecognized  cardiovascular  disease  as  the  cardiovascular status/risks may change over time.

Patient's condition and headache/migraine characteristics, response to treatment, co-medication may change over time, potentially affecting the appropriateness of sumatriptan use. Using sumatriptan, for instance, some migraine patients may suffer from more frequent and more severe attacks. This would require  the  intervention  of  a  physician  to  review,  modify  or  suspend  sumatriptan  use  or  to  initiate prophylactic treatment with other medicines. Detection of misuse, overuse and corrective action would be delayed if patients would not have to consult the doctor anymore.

The CHMP was of the opinion that the addition of contraindications, warnings and information on the use of interacting drugs to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet of Sumatriptan Galpharm as proposed by the Applicant, will not be sufficient to address the concerns related to a nonprescription setting. Patients are unable to evaluate and distinguish between the various contraindications and warnings. Additionally, the CHMP was not convinced that the change in risk for cardiovascular events and migraine status over time could be fully evaluated by patients, thus making sumatriptan unsuitable for the non-prescription setting.

There is wide use and 18 years of clinical experience with sumatriptan as a prescription product, while the non-prescription status is only approved since 2006 in a limited number of member states. Thus, the mechanism of action and side-effects of sumatriptan are well-known, whilst the safety profile of non-prescription sumatriptan 50mg (in comparison to the prescription product) has not appropriately been addressed by the Applicant. The data submitted were neither comprehensive nor sufficient. In conclusion,  the  safety  data  has  not  been  presented  by  the  Applicant  in  a  way  that  provided reassurance over the potential dangers associated with the non-prescription status of sumatriptan.

## Second criterion: 'Medicinal products shall be subject to medical prescription when they are frequently and to a very wide extent used incorrectly, and as a result are likely to present a direct or indirect danger to human health.'

CHMP was of the opinion that medical monitoring is necessary: if patients would not be followed-up by a  doctor,  there  is  a  potential  for  wide  misuse  with  the  consequence  of  either  medication  overuse headache or missing the need for switching to alternative prophylactic treatment. The argumentation made above for the first criterion also supports this.

The  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  first  and  second  criteria  for  medicinal  products  subject  to medical prescription under Art. 71 of the Directive 2001/83/EC, are met for sumatriptan therefore can not recommend the classification as 'medicinal product not subject to prescription'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Having considered the above, the CHMP is of the opinion that pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the safety of the above mentioned medicinal product is not properly or sufficiently demonstrated to be authorised as product not subject to prescription.

## 7 Appendix

## DIVERGENT POSITIONS

The following members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP's Opinion on the Re-examination of the marketing authorisation application for Sumatriptan Galpharm 50mg (EMA/H/C/002140) taken on 14 November 2011, for the following reasons:

Sumatriptan is an effective treatment for migraine symptoms and has been widely used as a non-prescription  medicine  for  a  number  of  years  in  several  member  states,  without additional safety concerns arising. More than 30% of the total population of the European Union currently has access to non-prescription triptans for the treatment of migraine. There is  clear  scientific  justification, underpinned by a substantial evidence base, for concluding that a positive benefit/risk profile has been established for non-prescription sumatriptan. There  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  non-prescription  availability  presents  a  danger,  either directly  or  indirectly,  nor  that  existing  non-prescription  products  are  frequently  used incorrectly.

## Migraine is a well established non-prescription condition

Many existing non-prescription medicines are licensed, throughout the EU, for use in the treatment of migraine: there is no evidence that the availability of these medicines interferes with patients seeking medical advice in relation to prophylaxis of migraine. Patients and pharmacists are used to managing migraine  in  the  non-prescription  setting,  with  no  evidence  of  a  significant  risk  of  inappropriate treatment.

Migraineurs are sufficiently knowledgeable about their condition to realise when their symptoms are changing.  The patient information leaflet includes clear advice to talk to your doctor if symptoms have changed.

## Non-prescription  supply  is  not  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  cardiovascular  or cerebrovascular side effects

There  is  no  evidence  of  any  difference  in  the  risk  of  adverse  events  with  non-prescription  use compared with POM sumatriptan, as shown by reference to both registry data and spontaneous reports. The Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) considered that there is no significant risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events in the adult population between 18 and 65 years old and the SAG did not have any specific concerns with regard to non-prescription availability for Sumatriptan in this age group on safety grounds.

Many OTC medicines are contraindicated for patients with conditions which may develop over time (for example, aspirin and kidney disease). Detailed patient information would enable safe and effective use of sumatriptan in the non-prescription setting by highlighting the key warnings and contra-indications, and the importance of seeking advice from a healthcare professional when appropriate.

## Non-prescription supply is not associated with an increased risk of inappropriate use leading to medication overuse headache (MOH)

There are no signs that the risk of overuse of sumatriptan is increased in countries where sumatriptan is  available without prescription, and this was noted by the SAG.  No recent scientific data show an increased risk of MOH when migraine is managed with triptans compared with other medication such as analgesics. Small pack size (two tablets) and relevant patient information are effective measures to manage the risk of MOH. Patients are very aware of their condition and would notice any change in their symptom profile: there are no increased safety concerns associated with sumatriptan in relation to inappropriate self-treatment.

## Measures to ensure safe use in the non-prescription setting

The proposed carton label and patient information leaflet provide clear information about who can use the product, when not to use it, how to use it, and when to seek advice from a doctor or pharmacist if in doubt.

Further risk minimisation was provided by Sumatriptan Galpharm 50mg being proposed for use only by patients who have already been diagnosed with migraine and previously treated with Sumatriptan.

## Significant public health benefits for migraine sufferers

As sumatriptan is most effective if taken at onset of an attack, rapid access to 2 tablet pack, without the need to seek a prescription, there is a clear benefit to enabling sufferers to treat and manage their condition effectively without unnecessary delay.

The following CHMP Members therefore consider that the benefit/risk ratio of sumatriptan with nonprescription  legal  status  is  positive  and  would  justify  the  granting  of  a  marketing  authorisation  for Sumatriptan Galpharm 50mg .
