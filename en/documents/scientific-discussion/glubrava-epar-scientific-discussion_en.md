## 1. Introduction

This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.

Therefore, consent from the MAH of the Competact application, which had been submitted as a full application under Art 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, has been given allowing access to Module  2  to  Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any  subsequent  postmarketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved.

Competact is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, particularly overweight patients, who are unable to achieve sufficient glycaemic control at their maximally tolerated dose of oral metformin alone. This formulation combines two antihyperglycaemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: pioglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinedione class and metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class. Thiazolidinediones  act  primarily  by  reducing  insulin  resistance  and  biguanides  act  primarily  by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production. Quality,  safety  and  efficacy  of  Pioglitazone/Metformin  hydrochloride  Takeda  15  mg/850  mg  filmcoated tablets are identical to the up to date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Competact. The application for Pioglitazone/Metformin hydrochloride Takeda 15 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets consists only of Module 1 information. The  approved  indication  is:  treatment  of  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  patients,  particularly  overweight patients, who are unable to achieve sufficient glycaemic control at their maximally tolerated dose of oral metformin alone. 2. Quality aspects Since this application is an informed consent of the Competact application, the quality data in support of the Pioglitazone/Metformin hydrochloride Takeda 15 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets application are identical  to  the  up-to-date  quality  data  of  the  Competact  dossier  which  have  been  assessed  and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 3. Non-clinical aspects Since this application is an informed consent of the Competact application, the non-clinical data in support  of  the  Pioglitazone  /  metformin  hydrochloride  Takeda  15  mg/850  mg  film-coated  tablets application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Competact dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 4. Clinical aspects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · User Consultation

Consultation  with  target  patient  groups  has  not  been  undertaken  for  Pioglitazone  /  metformin hydrochloride Takeda 15 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets. However as part of a follow up measure for the reference product Competact, readability testing was performed and reviewed by the CHMP. The updates to the Competact Package Leaflet in view of the assessment of this follow up measure have also been taken into account in the Pioglitazone/Metformin hydrochloride Takeda 15 mg/850 mg filmcoated tablets package leaflet.
