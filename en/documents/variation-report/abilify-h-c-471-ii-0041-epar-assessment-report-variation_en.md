## 1. Introduction

Acutely agitated patients with neuropsychiatric illness risk harming themselves or others. Psychomotor  agitation  is  defined  in  the  Diagnostics  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) as 'excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension.'

Patients experiencing agitation may manifest a range of disturbed behaviours that interfere with their diagnosis and care (e.g. threatening behaviours, escalating or urgently distressing behaviours, or selfexhausting behaviour) requiring clinicians to use intramuscular antipsychotic medications to achieve immediate control of the agitation.

Treating patients during the first few hours of agitation is most important in emergency and critical care situations. Because such patients may be unable or unwilling to take oral antipsychotic drugs, it may be necessary to use an alternative route of administration to treat them.

Currently,  a  limited  choice  of  rapid  acting  intramuscular  (IM)  formulations  of  antipsychotics  is available for agitated patients with neuropsychiatric illness.

In  this  type  II  variation,  the  MAH  applied  for  an  extension  of  indication  of  Abilify  7.5mg/ml  as follows (the new indication is underlined):

'Aripiprazole is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia  or  in  patients  with  manic  episodes  in  Bipolar  I  Disorder,  when  oral  therapy  is  not appropriate.'

## 2. Non Clinical aspects

## Environmental risk assessment (ERA)

The MAH predicted that based on available forecasts the approval of this formulation and use will not significantly increase the use of aripiprazole in the EU.

Overall,  given  the  latest  ERA  submitted  and  related  commitments  made  by  MAH  in  the  type  II variation  EMEA/H/C/471/II/39,  the  CHMP  considered  the  available  information  to  date,  to  be acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3 Clinical aspects

## 3.1 Clinical efficacy

The  development  program  completed  to  support  this  extension  of  indication  consisted  of  one randomised,  double-blind  study (CN138013) comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  aripiprazole intramuscular (IM), lorazepam, or placebo in the treatment of acutely agitated patients diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder, manic or mixed.

Study CN180013 was conducted in accordance with GCP as stated by the MAH.

## METHODS

## Study design

It is a randomised, double-blind, IM study comparing 2 fixed doses of aripiprazole (10 and 15 mg) and 1 dose of lorazepam (2mg) with placebo over 24 hours in patients with bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed and acute agitation with a PEC (positive and negative syndrome scale excited component): at least 2 components ≥ 4 and sum of 5 components ≥ 15 but ≤ 32.

## Primary and Secondary Objectives

The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of IM aripiprazole versus placebo in the treatment of acutely agitated patients with a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder, manic or mixed. This was assessed by the mean change from baseline to 2 hours post first IM injection using the PEC scale.

Secondary objectives were:

- -to compare the efficacy of IM aripiprazole versus placebo in the treatment of acute agitation in patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  Bipolar  I  Disorder,  manic  or  mixed,  as  assessed  by  the  Clinical Global Impressions Improvement Scale (CGI-I), Clinical Global Impressions Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S), Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES), and Corrigan Agitated Behavior Scale (CABS).
- -to compare the effects in this study of IM lorazepam, a known active therapy and standard of care in the treatment of acutely agitated patients with Bipolar I Disorder, manic or mixed, versus placebo.
- -to determine the safety and tolerability of IM aripiprazole in the treatment of acutely agitated patients with Bipolar I Disorder, manic or mixed. This was assessed by the mean change from baseline  to  each  specified  observation  time  in  the  Simpson-Angus  Scale  (SAS)  and  Barnes Akathisia  Rating  Scale  (Barnes).  Safety  and  tolerance  was  evaluated  by  reports  of  adverse events (AEs) and clinically significant changes in electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and laboratory tests.

## Efficacy Endpoints

The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline to 2 hours post first IM injection in PEC Score. Efficacy rating scales completed during this study included PEC, ACES, CGI-I, CGI-S, CABS, PANSS, and Y-MRS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

The planned sample size of 260 evaluable patients (65 per treatment group) would yield 90% power to differentiate between placebo and at least 1 of the 2 aripiprazole treatment groups (10 mg or 15 mg), when the true difference in the mean changes from baseline in PEC score was 3.4. This assumed a standard  deviation  of  5.4  and  a  2-sided  test  at  the  0.025  level  of  significance  (adjusted  for  2 comparisons versus placebo to ensure an overall probability of type 1 error ≤ 0.05).

For  the  subgroup  of  non  sedated  patients  (defined  on  the  basis  of  the  ACES  Score),  statistically significant differences versus placebo in the primary efficacy measure were observed in favour of the 10-mg and 15-mg aripiprazole groups, as well as for the lorazepam group.

## Secondary endpoints and other efficacy measures

Aripiprazole  10-mg  and  15-mg  were  statistically  superior  to  placebo  on  all  secondary  efficacy measures at 2 hours post first IM injection (LOCF data set, see Table 5).

The mean CGI-I Score, and the mean change from baseline in the CGI-S, ACES, and CABS Score showed  statistically  significant  comparisons  versus  placebo  in  favour  of  the  10-mg  and  15-mg aripiprazole  groups.  Furthermore,  statistically  significantly  higher  rates  of  PEC  response  were observed for 10-mg and 15-mg aripiprazole than for placebo. Lorazepam was statistically superior to placebo on these secondary outcome measures.

Statistically significantly higher rates in terms of CGI response were observed for all active treatment groups  at  all  timepoints.  Patients  in  the  10-mg  and  15-mg  aripiprazole  groups  were  more  likely  to respond and/or to respond sooner in terms of PEC response than patients in the placebo group during the 2-hour period post first IM injection.

Furthermore, patients in the placebo group were more likely to require and/or require sooner a second or  third  injection  than  patients  in  the  10-mg  and  15-mg  aripiprazole  groups,  as  well  as  in  the lorazepam group (see Table 6).

Aripiprazole 10-mg and 15-mg, as well as lorazepam, were statistically superior to placebo for the mean change in the PEC Score from predose (ie, immediately prior to second IM injection) to 2 hours post second IM injection.

For the subgroup of patients who were non responders to the first IM injection (defined as a patient who received a second injection within 4 hours of the first and who was not a PEC responder in the evaluation just prior to the second injection), statistically significant differences versus placebo were observed  in  the  mean  change  from  predose  in  favour  of  the  10-mg  and  15-mg  aripiprazole  and lorazepam  groups.  In  addition,  aripiprazole  10-mg  and  lorazepam  also  showed  superiority  over placebo at the 60 minute time point. Following the third IM injection, 10-mg aripiprazole appeared to be similar in effect as lorazepam for the mean change in the PEC Score from baseline (ie, immediately prior to first IM injection).

## DISCUSSION ON CLINICAL EFFICACY

The repeated  measures  analysis  on  the  PEC  Score  through  2  hours  post  first  IM  injection  showed improvement  over  time  for  all  treatment  groups.  The  improvement  was  statistically  significantly greater for the 10-mg and 15-mg aripiprazole and lorazepam groups than placebo.

The PEC score has not been formally validated in bipolar patients with acute mania. However, results from  all  secondary  efficacy  measures  are  reassuring  and  support  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  for study CN138013.

Overall, the CHMP recommended to reflect the results of this study in section 5.1 of the SPC. 'In one short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder presenting

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with  agitation  and  disturbed  behaviours,  aripiprazole  solution  for  injection  was  associated  with statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to the reference arm lorazepam. The observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for lorazepam, and 8.7 for aripiprazole. In subpopulation analyses on patients with mixed episodes or on patients with severe agitation, a similar pattern of efficacy to the overall population was observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced sample size.'

Furthermore, inclusion of the approved information for oral aripiprazole related to this indication has been made into section 5.1 of the SPC.

## 3.2 Clinical safety

## Patient Exposure

The  safety  sample  comprised  1214  patients:  795  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or schizophreniform disorder (CN138012, CN138050), 291 patients with a diagnosis of  bipolar  I  disorder,  manic  or  mixed  (CN138013),  and  128  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  dementia (additional  safety  study  CN138131  conducted  in  elderly  patients  and  provided  by  the  applicant). A total of 660 patients received aripiprazole as initial treatment, 240 patients received haloperidol, 69 patients  received  lorazepam,  and  245  patients  received  placebo.  In  addition,  62  placebo-treated patients received 10-mg aripiprazole as a third injection and 27 placebo-treated patients received 15mg aripiprazole as a third injection. Therefore, from the 4 IM placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 studies a total of 749 patients received IM aripiprazole. This safety sample was already evaluated by CHMP at the  time  of  the  opinion  for  the  extension  of  the  marketing  authorisation  to  IM  aripiprazole (EMEA/H/C/471/II/15 and X/16).

## Adverse events

Aside from those events that are associated with the method of administration (e.g. injection site pain), the profile of AEs reported with IM aripiprazole was generally similar to those observed with oraltablet aripiprazole (Table 7).

## Deaths and other serious adverse events

There were 2 reports of death in patients who received study medication in the IM Phase 2/3 clinical program. These were not considered related to study treatment.

There were no SAEs reported in Studies CN138016 and CN138017. One SAE was reported in the Study CN138132: a 40-year old black female, experienced Grade 3 neutropenia that began on Day 27 after aripiprazole 15-mg treatment and lasted for 91 days.

Thirty-two  of  the  1214  patients  in  the  IM  safety  Sample  (CN138012,  CN138050,  CN138013, CN138131) experienced SAEs. One SAE for a patient in the placebo group occurred after the third injection, which was 15-mg aripiprazole. Most events were related to patients' underlying psychiatric diseases,  and  only  one  report  event  of  dystonia  with  6.5  mg  haloperidol  was  considered  by  the investigators to be related to study medication.

## Other safety findings

In the pooled schizophrenia studies (CN138012, CN138050), a higher incidence of increased fasting serum glucose in aripiprazole- and haloperidol-treated patients than placebo-treated patients following injection with study medication was reported.

When QT intervals were evaluated uncorrected and using other correction methods (QTcB, QTcN, and QTcF), there were no clinically meaningful differences across treatment groups.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Eight of the 1214 patients discontinued from the studies because of an AE during the IM phase. Five aripiprazole-treated  patients  discontinued  and  only  1  of  these  patients  (10-mg)  discontinued  due  to possible drug related events (agitation and musculoskeletal stiffness). None of the 89 placebo-treated patients  who  received  a  third  IM  injection,  which  was  either  10-mg  or  15-mg  aripiprazole, discontinued from the studies because of an AE.

## DISCUSSION ON CLINICAL SAFETY

The  safety  profile  of  aripiprazole  using  the  IM  formulation  was  similar  to  that  of  the  oral-tablet formulation. Based on data collected to date the IM formulation appears favourable. There was only a small number of SAEs, and very few AEs led to discontinuation. There were no important clinical concerns regarding laboratory, vital sign, or ECG findings. Section 4.8 of the SPC has been updated to reflect the safety information, already approved for oral aripiprazole at the time of the type II variation EMEA/H/C/471/II/39.

## 4. Risk Management Plan

Reference  is  made  to  the  Risk  Management  Plan  version  3.0  submitted  in  the  type  II  variation EMEA/H/C/471/II/39, which was considered acceptable by CHMP.

## 5. Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  benefit-risk  for Abilify 7.5 mg/ml solution for injection in the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar I disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate, is favourable and recommended the variation to the marketing authorisation.
