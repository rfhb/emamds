## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Topotecan hydrochloride, the active substance of 'Topotecan Eagle 3 mg/ml concentrate for solution for  infusion',  is  a  cytotoxic  agent.  The  drug  substance  belongs  to  the  pharmacological  class  of 'antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents' ATC-Code: L01XX17.

The  drug  product  'Topotecan  Eagle  3  mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion'  is  designed  for intravenous use only after dilution with either 0.9% w/v sodium chloride intravenous infusion or 5% w/v glucose intravenous infusion in the recommended basic solutions for infusion between 25 and 50 microgram/ml in final concentration. The pharmaceutical form of the drug product is a clear yellow to orange liquid. The vials contain 3 mg and 15mg respectively of topotecan (as hydrochloride). Topotecan  hydrochloride  is  a  topoisomerase  I  inhibitor.  Topoisomerase  I  relieves  torsional  strain  in DNA by inducing reversible single strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents relegation of these single strand breaks. The cytotoxicity of topotecan is thought to be due to double strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis, when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topotecan, topoisomerase I, and DNA. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks. The drug product is intended for the treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the ovary after failure  of  first-line  or  subsequent  therapy  and  for  patients  with  relapsed  small  cell  lung  cancer  for whom re-treatment with the first-line regimen is not considered appropriate. Topotecan in combination with cisplatin is indicated for patients with carcinoma of the cervix recurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IVB disease. Patients with prior exposure to cisplatin require a sustained treatment free interval to justify treatment with the combination. The  reference  medicinal  product  is  'Hycamtin  1  and  4  mg  Powder  for  concentrate  for  solution  for infusion'  with  its  first  authorisation  on  1996-11-12.  The  difference  compared  to  this  reference medicinal  product  is  a  change  in  the  pharmaceutical  form,  which  results  in  the  non  inclusion  of mannitol  and  tartaric  acid.  Topotecan  Eagle  is  a  hybrid  application  and  it  has  different  strength (3mg/ml) compared to the reference product. Any potential issues related to the safe handling and the administrations of the product are extensively addressed in the RMP. Bioequivalence testing with the reference product is not required under the provisions of the Guideline on  the  investigation  of  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1)  since the  product  is  to  be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance in the same concentration as the currently authorised product . 2.2.

The crystal form of topotecan hydrochloride is very sensitive to the re-crystallisation conditions and exhibits at least 11 polymorphs, from A to K.  The LogP of topotecan hydrochloride is -2.81. Chemical name: (S)-10-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-4-ethyl-4,9-dihydroxy-1Hpyrano[3´,4´:6,7]indolizino[1,2-b]quinoline-3,14(4H,12H)-dione hydrochloride Manufacture The ASMF is used for information on the drug substance. The synthesis of Topotecan hydrochloride is well described. The structure of Topotecan hydrochloride has been adequately proven and its physicochemical properties sufficiently described. Specification The drug substance specification include tests for appearance (visual), identification (FT-IR and HPLC), Assay (HPLC), water content (Karl Fisher), residual solvents (GC headspace), heavy metals (Ph Eur), sulphated ash (Ph Eur), specific rotation and bacterial endotoxins (Ph Eur) Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Forced degradation studies/stress studies have been performed to identify the potential degradation products.  The  stability  program  of  topotecan  hydrochloride  is  designed  and  conducted  following  the ICH Q1A (R2) and EMEA Guidance on Stability Testing.

24  months  stability  data  at  long  term  condition,  and  six  month  at  accelerated  conditions  for  two batches were provided. No significant changes in any parameters were observed. Based on the stability data presented a justified retest period has been accepted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.3. Medicinal product

## Pharmaceutical development

The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  formulate  a  medicinal  product  stable  at  room temperature. The topotecan HCl concentrate for solution for infusion contains 3 mg/ml of topotecan free base and presented in two fill vial presentations, 5 ml and 1 ml fill vials.

The  concentrated  solution  meets  the  antimicrobial  preservative  effectiveness  test  requirements; therefore the 5 ml fill vial is for multiple dose use. The solution product should be diluted with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection for infusion.

The finished product specification include appropriate test for description (visual), Clarity of solution(Ph Eur),  Identification(UV,  HPLC),  Assay  (HPLC),  Related  substance  (ICH),  pH,  particulate  matter  (Ph Eur), Volume in container (Ph Eur), Bacterial endotoxin (Ph Eur)and sterility (Ph Eur)

Formulation  development  studies  confirm  that  topotecan  is  very  stable  in  dilute  hydrochloric  acid solutions from 0.01 to 0.1N. Because of a pH less than 2 the product is very stable (chemically and microbiologically)  and  therefore  results  in  an  acceptable  pharmaceutical  quality.  It  is  noted  that  an insoluble  degradant  is  formed,  10-hydroxycampothecin  (10-HCPT).  This  is  a  known  impurity  in Topotecan hydrochloride, it is  well  controlled  in  the  specification  and  fulfils  the  criteria  for  specified impurities. Due to a significant loss of active substance, terminal sterilization by autoclaving was unsuitable for sterilization  and  an  alternate  sterile  filtration/aseptic  process  procedure  was  required.  A  study  was conducted to select an appropriate sterilizing membrane filter compatible with a low pH solution; Topotecan concentrate for solution for infusion will be marketed with a 5 ml fill in 6-ml vials and a 1 ml fill in 2 ml vials. The container closure systems consist of a type-I tubular flint glass vial, a butyl rubber stopper laminated with Fluoropolymer film, and an aluminium seal with a polypropylene flip-off cap. The vials are closed with rubber stoppers and white seals. Adventitious agents Not applicable. Manufacture of the product The manufacturing methods are satisfactory described. A flow-chart of the process including in process control has been submitted. The commercial product is manufactured in 1 ml and 5 ml presentations of identical formulation and concentration. The sterilization process is carried out through a sterile filtration/aseptic process. The production process is performed in compliance with the principle of Good Manufacturing Practices, and it is adequately controlled by appropriate in process control tests. Product specification Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Batch analysis results confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is capable of producing finished product of the intended quality in a reproducible manner.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Stability of the product

Three registration batches of Topotecan concentrate for solution for infusion 3 mg/ml for each of the two  vial  presentations  (1ml,  5ml),  were  manufactured  in  accordance  with  cGMPs  and  Standard Operating  Procedures.  Samples  in  the  primary  packaging  components  were  placed  in  the  stability chambers. The samples were analyzed at selected time points in accordance with the ICH requirement. 24 months stability data at long term condition for the 5ml vial and 9 month for the 1ml vials were provided. Studies at accelerated condition were also performed.

2.3.

The  stability  results  of  the  samples  stored  at  accelerated  and  long-term  conditions  for  Topotecan concentrate for solution for infusion are well within all parameters of the drug product specification. Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 2.3.1. Introduction Topotecan Eagle 3 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion is a new formulation of the marketed product  Hycamtin  1mg  and  4  mg  powder  for  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion,  the  reference medicinal  product  for  this  submission.  Hycamtin  (topotecan  hydrochloride),  as  manufactured  by SmithKline Beecham plc, is available as a lyophilised injectable formulation and as an oral formulation. Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection, as produced by Eagle, is a liquid formulation of the same active ingredient.  Furthermore, it  differs  from  Hycamtin by  the  absence  of  the  inactive  ingredients  tartaric acid and mannitol, and by the pH. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Non- clinical aspects

Topotecan  Eagle  3  mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  is  diluted  to  a  final  concentration between 0.012 to 0.06 mg/ml. For comparison, the fully diluted Hycamtin has a concentration of 0.01 to 0.06 mg/ml which has a pH of 3.11 to 3.58.

Although the pH of Eagle's Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection overlaps with the pH of Hycamtin (pH 3.11 to 3.58), the pH of Eagle's Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection is slightly lower. To determine any potential  adverse  effect  of  the  formulation's  pH  at  the  final  concentration  after  dilution,  Eagle

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pharmaceuticals has evaluated their Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection in one in vitro and two whole animal models:

Study 700001: a rat nociception study to determine whether intraplantar injection produced behavioural responses indicative of unconscious response to painful stimuli.

Study 700002: a  rabbit  acute  intravenous  irritation  study  to  determine  whether  Eagle's  Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection produced adverse effects at or near the site of injection.

Study 2101: an  in  vitro  haemolysis  study  to  assess  the  potential  for  the  low  pH  of  Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection, as well as Hycamtin and controls, to produce adverse effects.

## Pharmacology Study 700001: Assessment of Nociception Following a Single Hindlimb Intraplantar Injection of EAGLE TPT in Male Rats

Comments on compliance with GLP Studies were conducted in accordance with the V.S. Food and Drug Administration's Good Laboratory Practice Regulations 21 CFR Part 58. 2.3.2. Pharmacology Topotecan is a semi-synthetic analogue of camptothecin that is water soluble in the lactone form and binds  less  strongly  to  plasma  proteins.  It  undergoes  a  reversible  pH-dependent  hydrolysis  of  its pharmacologically active closed-ring lactone form into an inactive hydroxycarboxylate open-ring form. The lactone form predominates at acidic pH and the carboxylate form at neutral and alkaline pH. The lactone form is a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I. The DNA topoisomerases are nuclear enzymes that relieve the torsional strain in supercoiled DNA by inducing  reversible  single  strand  breaks.  This  action  enables  selected  regions  of  DNA  to  become sufficiently exposed and relaxed to facilitate essential cellular processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription to occur. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and inhibits the induction of these single strand breaks.  The  cytotoxicity  of  topotecan  is  thought  to  be  due  to  double  strand  DNA  damage  produced during  DNA  synthesis,  when  replication  enzymes  interact  with  the  ternary  complex  formed  by topotecan, topoisomerase I, and DNA. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks and the cells die. Topotecan is therefore an S phase-specific drug. The activity of topotecan has been demonstrated in vitro and efficacy in vivo has been demonstrated in a broad range of mouse tumour models. The synergistic effect in combination with cisplatin has been shown in vitro in a number of cell lines including those derived from human cervix uteri. In vivo this synergistic effect has been shown in an IGROV-1 tumour xenograft model. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  potential  nociceptive  response  following  a  single intraplantar injection of the test article [Eagle's Topotecan liquid concentrate (3 mg/mL); also known as SciDose TPT] or comparator article [Hycamtin] in male Sprague Dawley rats. A positive control was 5% buffered formalin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The test article was administered once as an intraplantar injection to 2 groups (Groups 4 and 5) of Crl:CD(SD) rats at dose levels of 1.5 and 3 μ g/animal. Concurrent control (Group 1), positive control (Group 2) and comparator article (Group 3) groups received the vehicle, positive control article (5% buffered  formalin)  and  comparator  article  (3 μ g/animal  Hycamtin),  respectively,  on  a  comparable regimen.  Animals  were  approximately  8  weeks  old  at  the  time  of  dose  administration.  Each  group consisted of 5 males. The dose volume was 50 μ L/animal for all groups.

Rat licked or bit the injected paw.

There was no pain response elicited in the test article-treated and comparator article-treated groups. However, the expected nociceptive response was exhibited in the positive control-treated animals, as evidenced by higher pain ratings during the first 9 minutes following injection when compared with the vehicle control group.

a = The vehicle control was 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP. Prior to dose administration on study day 0, there were no significant clinical observations noted and mean body weights were similar across all groups. Following acute dose administration, observation of each rat was conducted by a technician who did not know the group assignment of the animals (i.e., blind). Each rat was observed for a 12-minute period immediately following dose administration. The  occurrence  of  paw  lick  and  lift  response  was  recorded  for  each  rat  over  a  12-minute  period (consisting of four 3-minute intervals). All animals were euthanized and discarded without macroscopic examination following completion of the 12-minute observation period. The responses for each rat were categorized on a scale of 0 to 3 as described in the following table: Pain Intensity Categories 0 No response (both rear paws were placed on the floor, weight was evenly distributed on both rear paws and during locomotion there was no discernible favouring of the injected paw) 1 Rat rested the injected paw lightly on the floor or on some part of its body with little or no weight placed on its paw and/or showed a slight limp during locomotion. 2 Rat elevated the injected paw to avoid contact with any surface and/or showed an obvious limp during locomotion. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

There was no indication of an aversive response to the comparator article or to either concentration of the test article through 12 minutes following subplantar injection. All animals in the comparator articleand test article-treated groups had pain ratings of 0.00 (the lowest recordable pain intensity category). The positive control article, 5% buffered formalin, exhibited the expected nociceptive response.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic properties of Topotecan are well known.

The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  topotecan  by  various  routes  of  administration  has  previously  been evaluated in rodents (mouse and rat) and non-rodents (rabbit, dog and non-human primates).

Studies were performed in both normal and tumour-bearing animals.

As Topotecan is a widely used, well-known active substance, the applicant has not provided additional studies and further pharmacokinetic studies are not required. 2.3.4. Toxicology Single dose toxicity Single dose toxicity has been studied in mice, rats and dogs following intravenous administration of topotecan. The minimum lethal doses in mice, rats and dogs were 56, 148 and 74 mg/m 2 , respectively. Target organs of toxicity were bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, gastrointestinal tract and ovaries. Repeat dose toxicity Repeat-dose toxicity following intravenous administration of topotecan has been investigated in mice (5  days),  rats  (up  to  1  month),  rabbits  (3  days19  and  13  days14)  and  dogs  (up  to  6  months).  In addition,  repeat  dose  toxicity  has  been  studied  in  rats  and  dogs  following  oral  administration  of topotecan for up to 6 and 3 months, respectively. It is evident that the primary dose-limiting toxicity in all these species due to topotecan treatment was myelosuppression consisting of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and anaemia. Histopathological  damage  associated  with  myelosuppression  was  also  seen  including  bone  marrow hypocellularity  and  cellular  depletion  of  the  spleen,  thymus  and  lymph  nodes.  Damage  to  the gastrointestinal tract was rare and usually only in long-term studies of oral dosing. In some studies, repeat-dosing resulted in hepatic toxicity, characterised by increases in serum ALT and AST, and mild renal damage was inferred by transient changes in urinalysis parameters. Toxicities in these species were not progressive and were reversible. Genotoxicity Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Topotecan was not genotoxic in the bacterial reverse-mutation assay. However, as predicted based on its pharmacologic activity, genotoxic effects were observed in mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo. In the mouse in vitro lymphoma assay, topotecan caused a significant increase in the mutation frequency. Genotoxic  effects  were  also  seen  in  the  in  vitro  chromosomal  aberrations  assay  which  used  human peripheral blood lymphocytes. In this assay topotecan significantly elevated the number of structural chromosome aberrations. In vivo analysis in mouse bone marrow cells demonstrated that topotecan caused a significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes and it also decreased the polychromatic/normochromatic  erythrocyte  ratio  indicating  bone  marrow  toxicity.  Topotecan  also significantly induced chromosomal aberrations in a dose-dependent manner.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Carcinogenicity

There  are  no  published  nonclinical  study  data  available  regarding  the  carcinogenicity  of  topotecan. However, topotecan is known to be genotoxic to mammalian cells.

## Reproduction toxicity

Topotecan  caused  embryonic  and  foetal  death  in  rats  and  rabbits  and  caused  significant  maternal toxicity. Topotecan is therefore contraindicated in pregnant women.

<!-- image -->

In reproductive toxicity studies in rats, there was no effect on male or female fertility. However, super-ovulation and slightly increased pre-implantation loss were observed in females. In  dogs,  topotecan  dosing  appeared  to  cause  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  multinucleated spermatogonial giant cells in the testes. Studies in rats suggest that topotecan and/or its metabolites are actively secreted in breast milk so breast-feeding should be discontinued at the start of therapy. Toxicokinetic data Not applicable Local tolerance As  there  are  no  published  nonclinical  studies  available  in  the  scientific  literature  regarding  the  local tolerance of topotecan and since the pH of Eagle's Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection in its fully diluted state,  just  prior  to  administration  to  patients,  was  slightly  lower  than  that  of  Hycamtin,  a  local tolerance study in albino rabbits was performed: Study Number 700002 , Title: Acute Intravenous Irritation Study of Eagle TPT in Albino Rabbits The objective of the study was to determine the irritative potential of Eagle's Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection; following a single intravenous infusion to groups of six male albino rabbits. Groups (each group consisted of 6 males New Zealand White rabbits) Groups 1 and 2: test agents (Eagle TPT) dose of 0.12 mg/kg dose concentrations were 0.03 (Volume 4ml/kg) and 0.06 mg/mL (Volume 2ml/kg) comparator test article, Hycamtin dose concentrations were 0.06 mg/mL (Volume 2 ml/kg) Medicinal Product no longer authorised

A positive control group

10% glucose solution (Volume 4 ml/kg)

New Zealand White rabbits were treated with the test agents in the right ear while the left ear served as  a  vehicle  control  (0.9%  saline,  4  mL/kg).  Eagle  TPT  was  administered  in  a  single  dose  of  0.12 mg/kg by intravenous injection to two groups of male New Zealand White rabbits at 0.03 and 0.06 mg/mL (Groups 1 and 2). The comparator, Hycamtin, was administered at 0.06 mg/mL to Group 3 and

Group 4

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

a positive control group (Group 4) received 10% glucose solution with its titrateable acidity adjusted to 12 mEq/L (pH 4.4).

The  dose  volumes  were  4,  2,  2  and  4  ml/kg  for  Groups  1  to  4,  respectively.  All  animals  were euthanized after a 48 hour observation period.

All injection sites were examined macroscopically and microscopically.

There were no deaths, remarkable body weight changes or gross findings observed at the injection sites during necropsy. Dermal observations of slight erythema at the injection sites were noted in all groups but this included control ears injected with vehicle.

However the incidence of erythema increased for sites injected with positive control article. Microscopic changes at the injection sites included epidermal surface exudate, necrosis, ulceration, sub-epidermal degeneration,  acute  inflammation  (phlebitis)  of  the  marginal  vein,  venous  thrombosis,  interstitial oedema and subacute and granulomatous inflammation. The occurrence and nature of these changes were not substantially different between negative control sites and the test article treated sites. Sites administered  positive  control  article  had  an  increased  incidence  and  severity  of  minimal  to  mild interstitial oedema and subepidermal degeneration. Based on the results of this study, the irritation potential at the intravenous infusion sites in rabbits administered negative control, 0.03 or 0.06 mg/ml Eagle TPT or 0.06 mg/ml Hycamtin was comparable and considered less irritating relative to the positive control. The  Applicant, following the request  of the CHMP,  evaluated  the  local  irritation potential of Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection for unintended parenteral routes of administration,  (Study report : 20008606 'Acute Irritation Study of Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection by Intra-arterial Infusion and Paravenous Injection in Rabbits') as tolerance testing should be determined at sites that come into contact with the formulations as a result of the method of administration, and also at the sites that might come into contact through accidental or unavoidable exposure of the formulations, e.g. intraarterial, or paravenous administration. The objectives of this study were to determine the potential local irritation of Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection when given as a single dose by intra-arterial infusion and paravenous injection to rabbits, and to compare the effects of Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection to a comparator (Hycamtin).  To this end, Topotecan Hydrochloride  Injection  or  Hycamtin  for  Injection,  diluted  in  0.9 %  Sodium  Chloride  for Injection to 0.06 mg topotecan/ml, was administered once via intra-arterial infusion (approximately 30 minutes) into the central media ear artery (with negative control article administered in a contralateral vessel) and once via paravenous injection (approximately 30 seconds) into the space surrounding the marginal ear vein (with negative control article administered in a contralateral space) to determine the potential local irritation. The study concluded that intra-arterial infusion and paravenous injection of Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection and Hycamtin, administered as a single dose, was well tolerated in rabbits at doses of 0.12 mg/kg (intra-arterial) or 0.03 mg (paravenous).  Dermal irritation was noted surrounding  the  treatment  site  and  was  comparable  among  treatment  groups  with  no  biologically meaningful differences between the Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection and Hycamtin.

## Other toxicity studies

To evaluate the compatibility of Eagle's Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection with blood, an in vitro study in rabbit whole blood was performed:

-  Study Number 2101,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Title: Assessment of the Hemolytic Properties of Test and Reference Formulations of Topotecan Hydrochloride for Intravenous Infusion Using an In Vitro Test Method in Rabbit Whole Blood

The haemolytic properties of Eagle's Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection and Hycamtin comparator were assessed using a static, in vitro system comprised of undiluted rabbit whole blood.

Each formulation was diluted to 0.060, 0.03 and 0.012 mg/ml with saline.

An aliquot (30, 60 or 150 μ L) of each formulation was added separately to 10 ml aliquots of blood. These solutions were mixed and then each split into two samples. One sample was tested immediately and  the  other  incubated  at  37°C  for  30  minutes.  All  samples,  including  a  vehicle  blank  (0.1N  HCl) prepared  in  the  same  way,  were  centrifuged  at  3000  rpm  (2095  x  g)  for  10  minutes.  Positive  and negative  controls  consisted  of  whole  blood  prepared  with  water  and  normal  saline  respectively.  All samples were prepared in triplicate.

An environmental risk assessment is not provided as there is no expected increase in the exposure of the environment to the active substance, topotecan hydrochloride.

The plasma supernatants were analysed by spectrophotometric detection at 540 nm for the detection of  haemoglobin.  The  absorbance  from  the  negative  control  was  subtracted  from  the  corresponding sample to correct for absorbance attributable to plasma background. After correction for the dilution factor, the percent haemolysis was determined from a standard curve. Results showed that the ratio of 30, 60 and 150 μ L of test solution added to 10 ml of blood had little or no haemolytic impact. In all the test, reference, blank and control samples, the percent haemolysis was ≤ 0.5%. 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment No  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  was  submitted.  This  was  justified  by  the  applicant  as  the introduction  of  Topotecan  Eagle  manufactured  by  Eagle  Laboratories  Ltd.  is  considered  unlikely  to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all topotecan containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects The non-clinical overview provides an adequate overview of the pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological aspects of topotecan. In general, the provided non-clinical studies are of good quality and were produced and compiled in accordance with the V.S. Food and Drug Administration's Good Laboratory Practice Regulations 21 CFR Part 58. Regarding the difference in the pH at the final concentration after dilution, Eagle Pharmaceuticals has evaluated their Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection in one in vitro and two whole animal models. Minor issues raised during the assessment have been resolved adequately. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

The CHMP agrees that no changes in the environmental risks that are not already known for topotecan, are to be anticipated for Topotecan Eagle 3 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion.

As the drug substance has been authorized in the EU for more than 10 years any possible risks for environment  arising  from  use,  storage  and  disposal  of  the  medicinal  product  are  covered  by  the instructions/measures that are included in Summary of product Characteristics.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The non-clinical information provided additionally to the existing knowledge of topotecan adequately covers any issues arising from the assessment of topotecan Eagle and provided an adequate overview of the pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological aspects of topotecan.

No further amendments to the product information were needed from a preclinical point of view.

The applicant adequately justifies why there is no need to generate new clinical data.

The recommended dosage, for patients with carcinoma of the cervix recurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IV-B disease, is 0.75 mg/m 2 /day of Eagle's Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection, 3 mg topotecan per ml, administered as a 30 minute intravenous infusion on days 1, 2 and 3 of each cycle.  Cisplatin  is  administered  after  Eagle's  Topotecan  Hydrochloride  Injection  as  an  intravenous infusion on day 1 at a dosage of 50 mg/m 2 /day. Treatment should be repeated every 21 days for six cycles or until disease progresses.

2.4. Clinical aspects 2.4.1. Introduction This  is  an  application  for  Topotecan  Eagle  3  mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  containing topotecan. Since topotecan is administered intravenously it was not necessary to demonstrate bioequivalence. The clinical overview refers 46 publications from 1988 up to year 2010. Therapeutic indications Topotecan Eagle monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of:  patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer [SCLC] for whom re-treatment with the first-line regimen is not considered appropriate. Topotecan Eagle  in  combination  with  cisplatin  is  indicated  for  patients  with  carcinoma  of  the  cervix recurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IVB disease. Patients with prior exposure to cisplatin require a sustained treatment free interval to justify treatment with the combination. Posology and method of administration The  recommended  dosage  and  method  of  administration  of  the  generic  product  Topotecan  Eagle  3 mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  is  the  same  as  that  recommended  for  the  reference medicinal product Hycamtin 1 mg/ml, from GlaxoSmithKline in the UK. The recommended dose of Eagle's Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection, 3 mg topotecan per ml, for the treatment of patients with SCLC for whom re-treatment with the first-line regimen is not considered appropriate,  is  1.5  mg/m 2 by  intravenous  infusion  over  30  minutes  daily  for  5  consecutive  days, starting on day 1 of a 21 day cycle. In the absence of tumour progression, a minimum of four cycles is recommended because tumour response may be delayed. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

## Pharmacological classification

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents ATC-code: L01XX17.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Exemption

The pharmaceutical form of Topotecan Eagle is a 'Concentrate for Solution for Infusion'. This differs from the reference product, which is a 'Powder for Concentrate for Solution for Infusion'. The Applicant developed  the  solution  product  eliminating  the  initial  reconstitution  step  in  the  preparation  of  the product  prior  to  administration.  As  a  consequence  of  the  change  in  pharmaceutical  form,  the formulation of the proposed and reference products is different.

Both Topotecan Eagle and reference products are administered as an intravenous infusion. Topotecan Eagle has been proposed for SCLC and carcinoma of the cervix indications. Comparative testing has confirmed  that  the  innovator  and  proposed  products  are  pharmaceutically  equivalent  and  have  a comparable impurity profile.

Topotecan is rapidly eliminated from the systemic circulation. Topotecan was rapidly hydrolyzed in vivo to a less active, open-ring form. Only 20% to 35% of the total drug in plasma is found to be in the active lactone form. Elimination of the lactone form appears to result mainly from rapid hydrolysis to the  caboxylate  species  followed  by  renal  excretion,  with  30%  to  40%  of  the  administered  dose excreted in the urine within 24 hours.

As the innovator and proposed products are intended for intravenous administration, Bioequivalence testing with the reference product is not required under the provisions of the Note for Guidance on the investigation of Bioequivalence and Bioavailability (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1): 'The applicant is not required to submit a bioequivalence study if the product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance in the same concentration as the currently authorised product'. Clinical studies No further clinical studies have been performed with topotecan Eagle and this is considered justified (as above). 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of topotecan are well known. The  peak  plasma  concentrations  and  the  area  under  the  plasma  concentration-versus-time  curves (AUC) show linear relationship with increasing dosages. No evidence of drug accumulation is seen with daily 30-minute infusions for 5 consecutive days. Following intravenous administration of topotecan in adults with solid tumours, at doses of 0,5 to 1,5 mg/m 2 ,  as  a  30-minute  infusion,  daily  for  five  days,  mean  peak  serum  topotecan  (lactone) concentration was 73 to 78 nmol/l (hydroxy acid 45 nmol/l at 20 minutes). Topotecan has a volume of distribution  of  approximately 130 l. Mean plasma clearance for topotecan  was approximately 1,000 ml/min, with a plasma half-life of 2 to 3 hours. The binding of topotecan to plasma proteins was low (35%) and distribution between blood cells and plasma was fairly homogeneous. The  elimination  of  topotecan  has  only  been  partly  elucidated  in  humans.  No  recovery  study  with radiolabelled topotecan has been conducted. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Renal clearance is an important determinant of topotecan elimination.

No new pharmacokinetic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

The anti-tumour activity of topotecan involves the inhibition of topoisomerase I, an enzyme intimately involved in DNA replication as it relieves the torsional strain introduced ahead of the moving replication fork. Topotecan inhibits topoisomerase ¬I by stabilising the covalent complex of enzyme and strandcleaved DNA which is an intermediate of the catalytic mechanism. The cellular sequela of inhibition of topoisomerase  ¬I  by  topotecan  is  the  induction  of  protein-associated  DNA  single-strand  breaks. Although single strand breaks are not sufficient to produce cell death, the drug-enzyme-DNA complex ultimately  results  in  double  strand  breaks.  Mammalian  cells  cannot  efficiently  repair  these  double strand breaks and this process results in subsequent apoptosis and cell death.

Topotecan in combination with cisplatin, is indicated for treatment of patients with carcinoma of the cervix  recurrent  after  radiotherapy  and  for  patients  with  Stage  IV-B  disease.  Patients  with  prior exposure to cisplatin require a sustained treatment free interval to justify treatment in combination. The marketing authorisation for Hycamtin in combination with cisplatin, in this indication was granted by the EMEA for intravenous therapy on 22 November 2006.

No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 2.4.4. Clinical efficacy The  applicant  has  provided  an  up  to  date  review  (with  46  publications  from  1988  to  2010)  of  the current state of knowledge concerning the clinical use of topotecan in the following claimed indications:. Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) The marketing authorisation for Hycamtin as a monotherapy for patients with relapsed SCLC for whom re-treatment with the first-line regimen is not considered appropriate was granted by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) on 1 February 2006 for intravenous (i.v.) therapy. The  efficacy  and  safety  of  topotecan  in  patients  with  recurrent  SCLC  have  been  demonstrated  in  a number of Phase II studies. These studies demonstrated a higher response rate and prolonged median survival  in  chemosensitive  compared  to  chemorefractory  SCLC.  Topotecan  has  produced  overall response rates (ORRs) of 14 to 38% in chemotherapy-sensitive SCLC and 2 to 11% in chemotherapyresistant SCLC, with an additional 20 to 36% of patients developing stable disease (SD). Findings from these studies were confirmed in a randomized, multicentre, phase III trial conducted by von Pawel et al of topotecan versus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine (CAV) combination chemotherapy regimen. The results of this large randomized controlled trial indicate that topotecan used, as a single agent, is at least as efficient as the combination chemotherapy regimen CAV in the treatment of patients with recurrent SCLC. Regarding safety, topotecan showed some clinical benefit in improving quality-of-life in patients  with  recurrent  small-cell  lung  cancer,  resulted  in  improved  palliation  of  several  symptoms, including dyspnoea, anorexia, fatigue, hoarseness and interference with daily activities. Carcinoma of the cervix Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Multiple combination regimens have been studied in patients with advanced disease.

Cisplatin has proven to be the most effective single cytotoxic agent for the treatment of advanced or recurrent cervical cancer. However, the response rate is about 23%, and most of the responses are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

brief. Hence, more effective chemotherapeutic strategies for this disease are clearly needed. Topotecan and  cisplatin  combination  have  produced  higher  survival  and  progressive  free  survival  rates  in  the management of these patients.

A statistically significant survival advantage for cisplatin in combination with topotecan over cisplatin alone in women with Stage IV-B recurrent cervical cancer has been demonstrated in an open-label, randomised, prospective Phase III trial.

As  chemotherapy  in  this  setting  is  considered  palliative,  quality  of  life  (QoL)  assessments  were incorporated  into  the  trials  endpoints.  Despite  the  significantly  higher  incidence  of  toxicity  in  the combined cisplatin/topotecan arm, there was no perceived difference in QoL compared with cisplatin alone.

Together these data demonstrate that topotecan improves response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival when added to cisplatin in treating metastatic and recurrent cervical cancer. Regarding safety, topotecan in combination with cisplatin is well-tolerated although myelosuppression is greater than with the individual agents alone. When topotecan is used in conjunction with cisplatin at doses at or below 50 mg/m 2  resulting neutropenia is both reversible and noncumulative. As summarised above, topotecan hydrochloride has a well-recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety in the indications claimed for Topotecan Eagle and no additional clinical studies are needed. Topotecan Eagle 3 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion is a new formulation of the marketed product  Hycamtin  1mg  and  4  mg  powder  for  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion,  the  reference medicinal product for this submission. The rationale for the development of this formulation was based on the advantage compared to the reference  medicinal  product  Hycamtin  that  for  Topotecan  Eagle  no  additional  reconstitution  step  is needed, and therefore Eagle's Topotecan is easier to use than the originator product and assures safer handling for personnel (pharmacists, nurses and clinicians). Another advantage is the 'multiple-use 6 ml glass vials'. As the product is self-preserving, and any remaining product in the vial can be used over several days, wastage is therefore eliminated. Furthermore, Topotecan Eagle 3 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion differs from Hycamtin by the absence of inactive ingredients tartaric acid and mannitol, and by the pH. The proposed dosage regimens are identical to those currently registered for the originator product. Eagle's Topotecan Hydrochloride Injection, 3 mg/ml, is a concentrated solution. Just like the reference medicinal  product,  it  is  to  be  diluted  with  either  0.9%  Sodium  Chloride  Injection  or  5%  Dextrose Injection  prior  to  infusion.  It  is  diluted  to  a  final  concentration  between  0.01  to  0.06  mg/ml.  For comparison, the fully diluted Hycamtin has a concentration of 0.01 to 0.06 mg/ml which has a pH of 3.11 to 3.58. Topotecan Eagle 3 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion meets the requirements on safety and efficacy for a marketing authorisation application under Article 10(3) 'hybrid', and no further data are required.

## Additional data

None

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Post marketing experience

No post-marketing data are available. The generic medicinal product has not been marketed in any country.

## 2.4.5. Clinical safety

The  clinical  safety  of  the  reference  product  is  well  documented.  Topotecan  hydrochloride  has  an acceptable level of safety in the indications claimed and no additional clinical studies are needed.

Topotecan  is  generally  well  tolerated.  The  dose-limiting  toxicity  of  topotecan  is  myelosuppression consisting of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenic fever and anaemia. Neutropenia is noncumulative and reversible. Myelosuppression can be managed by dose reductions, treatment delays and granlocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration. Non-haematological adverse effects are generally mild and include nausea, vomiting, rashes, fatigue, diarrhoea and alopecia. However,  the  proposed  product  has  a  higher  concentration  (3  mg/ml)  than  the  currently  available topotecan products on the market. Consequently, there is an important risk of medication error during product preparation and dilution which may result in patients receiving an overdose with potentially serious and life-threatening consequences. Measures to eliminate / reduce the risk of medication errors are discussed with the CHMP and are in place  by  the  Applicant.  These  measures  include  warning  statements  in  the  labelling,  dilution instructions, boxed warnings in the product information, a unique vial collar and educational material agreed with the CHMP. 2.4.6. Post marketing experience No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 2.4.7. Discussion on clinical aspects Topotecan is a cytotoxic anti-cancer agent, a semisynthetic analogue of the alkaloid camptothecin. Topotecan  is  exerting  its  activity  by  the  inhibition  of  the  nuclear  enzyme  topoisomerase  I  that  is involved in DNA replication. The inhibition is due to stabilisation of the intermediate covalent complex of  enzyme  and  strand-cleaved  DNA.  As  a  result,  DNA  damage  induces  apoptotic  cell  death predominantly in replicating cells such as tumour cells. Bioequivalence testing with the reference product is not required under the provisions of the 'Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence' (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98): 'The applicant is not required to submit a bioequivalence study if the product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance in the same concentration as the currently authorised product'. Medicinal Product no longer authorised

There  are  currently  several  versions  of  topotecan  for  intravenous  use  available  for  use  in  the  EU, presented as powder for reconstitution and dilution or as concentrate for dilution, as either 1 mg/ml or 4 mg/ml vials.

Topotecan  Eagle  concentrate  contains  3  mg/ml  of  topotecan,  which  is  a  higher  initial  concentration than found in other topotecan products for intravenous infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Topotecan Eagle presents some practical advantages such as being a liquid formulation without the need for reconstitution, its ease of administration and storage at room temperature.

There are no concerns with Topotecan Eagle from a clinical efficacy point of view.

However, the difference in the strength of the product before the preparation of solution for infusion poses a risk of medication error and is discussed in detail below. The Applicant introduced a number of measures agreed with the CHMP to minimize the risk of medication errors.

2.4.8. Conclusions on clinical aspects A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of topotecan hydrochloride was provided and in accordance with the relevant guideline, no additional clinical studies were considered necessary. However,  the  proposed  product  has  a  higher  concentration  (3  mg/ml)  than  the  currently  available topotecan products on the market. Consequently, there is an important risk of medication error during product preparation and dilution which may result in patients receiving an overdose. Due to the proposed risk minimisation measures, it is expected that the risk of medication errors will be  low.  If  a  medication  error  occurs  on  a  single  dosing  day,  the  consequences  are  predictable  and manageable  and  the  overdose  given  will  be  within  the  dose  range  previously  tested  in  published efficacy  and  safety  studies  of  topotecan.  In  principle,  this  seems  to  be  supported  by  the  published literature. 2.5. Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative  requirements  and  provides  adequate  evidence  that  the  applicant  has  the  services  of  a qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country. Risk Management Plan The applicant submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan. SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN: Medicinal Product no longer authorised

Women of childbearing potential Topotecan has been shown to cause embryo- foetal lethality and malformations in preclinical studies (see section 5.3). As with other cytotoxic medicinal products, topotecan may cause foetal harm and therefore women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant during therapy with topotecan. Pregnancy If topotecan is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during therapy with topotecan, the patient must be warned of the potential hazards to the foetus.

| Interactions with BRCP and P-gp inhibitors, cyclosporine A, and platinum Medicinal | Routine pharmacovigilance via spontaneous ADR reporting with 6-monthly initial PSUR schedule. Product | SPC: 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction In combining topotecan with other chemotherapy agents, reduction of the doses of each medicinal product may be required to improve tolerability. However, in combining with platinum agents, there is a distinct sequence-dependent interaction depending on whether the platinum agent is given on day 1 or 5 of the topotecan dosing. If either cisplatin or carboplatin is given on day 1 of the topotecan dosing, a lower dose of each agent must be given to improve tolerability compared to the dose of each agent which can be given if the platinum agent is given on day 5 of the topotecan dosing. When topotecan (0.75 mg/m 2 /day for five consecutive days) and cisplatin (60 mg/m 2 /day on Day 1) were administered in 13 patients with ovarian cancer, a slight increase in AUC (12 %, n = 9) and C max (23 %, n = 11) was noted on day 5. This increase is considered unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Note: Information regarding the potential risk of interactions with BRCP and P-gp inhibitors, as well as cyclosporine A is currently only included in the SPC for the oral presnentation of the reference product, Hycamtin and not for intravenous topotecan. Therefore, it is not proposed in the Topotecan Eagle SPC. no longer authorised |

The audience is healthcare professionals and hospital pharmacies dealing with oncology agents. The SmPC  will  be  distributed  via  usual  means  (mail  shot,  sales  force,  on  MAH  web  site).  A  safety information Communication letter will be issued prior to marketing. The need and timing of follow-up reminder  Safety  information  Communication  letters,  as  well  as  distribution  of  these  letters  will  be discussed and agreed prior to launch with each concerned National Competent Authority. The purpose of  the  communication  is  to  alert  to  difference  in  concentration  and  risk  of  medication  errors  with potential life-threatening consequences, to draw attention to vial collar as visual reminder (must not be removed at any time), to inform of anticipated effects of overdose (e.g. bone marrow suppression) and

The listing of important identified and potential risks as well as missing information is in accordance with  the  listing  included  in  the  EU-RMP  of  the  reference  product  Hycamtin,  which  is  currently authorised as 1 mg and 4 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, and also as 0.25 mg and 1 mg hard capsules. However the EU-RMP exists only for the oral formulation (0.25 mg and 1.0 mg capsules). No additional risk minimisation activities are proposed for these oral formulations beyond the presentation of risks in the Product Information and routine pharmacovigilance activities. In  comparison  to  the  EU-RMP  of  the  reference  product,  the  EU-RMP  for  Topotecan  Eagle  has  been amended  with  the  risk  of  medication  errors  resulting  in  overdose  due  to  the  different  strength  of Topotecan Eagle, which is unique when compared to other topotecan products in the European market. The potential risk of overdose which is included in the EU-RMP of the reference product Hycamtin is covered by the identified risk of medication error in the EU-RMP of Topotecan Eagle. Although no cases concerning medication errors with Topotecan Eagle have been reported so far, it is acceptable to classify medication errors as important identified risk, as topotecan was the third most common drug where medication errors occurred according to a published study which examined the errors in prescriptions of antineoplastic agents. In order to minimise the risk of medication error the Applicant has implemented bolded, black boxed statements  in  SmPCs  and  PILs  introduced  by  'Concentration  must  be  noticed  or  life-threatening overdose may occur'. The same information appears on the outer packaging. Each vial receives a vial ring collar with the information 'Caution: notice concentration 3 mg/ml', respectively 'Caution: notice concentration  15  mg/5ml  (3  mg/ml).'  Furthermore  tables,  which  provide  precise  instructions  for dilution, have been included in the SmPC as well as in the PL (information for medical or healthcare professionals). The objective of the 'Communication Plan' is to alert and educate healthcare professionals and hospital pharmacies dealing with oncology agents about the different concentration with Topotecan Eagle and to  increase  awareness  of  the  potential  for  medication  errors  due  to  confusion  with  other  topotecan products.

also  to  encourage  reporting  of  actual  medication  errors  and  any  safety  events  that  might  be  a consequence  of  a  medication  error  -  ADR  form  included  in  the  Safety  Information  Communication letter for this purpose.

The Communication Plan, as currently proposed by the Applicant in the EU-RMP for Topotecan Eagle, is acceptable.

The  EMA/CHMP  consulted  different  health  care  professional  organisations  such  us  The  European Association of Hospital Pharmacists and The European Oncology Nursing Society in order to know how the different strength of Topotecan Eagle 3mg/ml could cause medication errors and/or be confusing for health care professionals when preparing the product to be administered.

A structured test will be conducted on the SPC, the instructions given in the PL section 'The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only', and the labelling using the actual cartons  and  vials.  A  different  set  of  participants  will  be  used  for  each  test.  Each  participant  will  be given  either  the  SPC,  the  PIL,  or  the  carton/vial  for  Topotecan  Eagle.  A series  of  questions  will  be developed  aimed  at  testing  each  participant's  understanding  of  the  totality  of  the  labelling  and packaging with a focus on the higher concentration compared to other topotecan products, the risk of medication errors and overdose, and the preparation and dilution instructions in the SPC. In addition, testing  will  check  on  understanding  of  the  following:  the  'opened  on'  field  on  the  vial  label  for  the

Considering  the  concerns  discussed  and  the  feedback  received  from  consultation  with  Healthcare professional Organisations, the following additional risk minimisation activities were required: The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) should ensure that, at launch, all Healthcare Professionals who are  expected  to  use  and/or  prescribe  Topotecan  Eagle  are  provided  with  a  Safety  Information Communication. In summary, the Safety Information Communication should contain the following:  The risk of medication error due to the higher concentration than the dilution concentration of the originator, with potentially life-threatening consequences.  Reference to the vial collar as visual reminder of this difference and the instruction that it must not be removed at any time.  The anticipated effects of overdose (e.g. bone marrow suppression).  An encouragement of reporting of actual medication errors and any safety events that might be a consequence of a medication error.  A form to report medication errors. PSUR submission The PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should follow a half-yearly cycle until otherwise agreed by the CHMP. User consultation The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. Furthermore,  as  part  of  the  Risk  minimisation  measures  and  as  a  way  to  verify  the  success  of  the proposed 'Communication Plan', a testing will be conducted prior to first market launch, and 6 months after market launch in the top 5 countries by prescription volume. A  total  of  30  healthcare  professionals  (physicians,  oncology  nurses,  pharmacists)  who  are  routinely preparing oncology agents for intravenous administration will be identified in each of the countries.

15 mg/5 ml vial and carton, and instructions for sterile handling and storage, including storage times and conditions for the 15 mg/5 ml vial after first use.  For re-testing, a fresh set of participants for each test will be used.

## 3. Benefit-risk balance

Pharmacovigilance System

The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1 of the marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.

The  application  contains  adequate  quality  and  non  clinical  data  and  sufficient  clinical  data  from published  literature.  Bioequivalence  testing  with  the  reference  product  is  not  required  under  the provisions  of  the  Guideline  on  the  investigation  of  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98/Rev.1) since the product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance in the same concentration as the currently authorised product A benefit/Risk balance comparable to the reference product Hycamtin can therefore be concluded. The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 4. Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Topotecan Eagle in the treatment of :  patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer [SCLC] for whom re-treatment with the first-line regimen is not considered appropriate. (as monotherapy)  (in combination with cisplatin) patients with carcinoma of the cervix recurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IVB disease. Patients with prior exposure to cisplatin require a sustained treatment free interval to justify treatment with the combination is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.2).
