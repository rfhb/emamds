## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

This application has been submitted in accordance with Council Regulation 726/2004, by the applicant sanofi-aventis recherche et développement on behalf of Genzyme Europe B.V. , a Sanofi Company, for an Informed  Consent  Marketing  Authorization  Application  for  Sevelamer  carbonate  Zentiva  (sevelamer carbonate), as per Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC.

In  February  20th,  2014,  the  EMA  confirmed  that  this  application  was  eligible  for  submission  for  a Community Marketing Authorisation under 'automatic access' for duplicate applications.

During the February CHMP meeting, the Rapporteur Dr Bart Van der Schueren was appointed.

The  reference  product,  Renvela  (EMEA/H/C/000993),  which  was  first  authorised  in  the  Community through the Centralised Procedure on 10 June 2009, is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis with serum phosphorus &gt; 1.78 mmol/L.

This marketing authorization application contains a Module 1 only. For the quality, pre-clinical and clinical data, reference is made to the documentation approved for the reference product, Renvela.

A  letter  of  Informed  Consent  was  annexed  to  the  application  form  (annex  5.2).  In  this  annex  the Marketing Authorisation Holder, Genzyme Europe B.V., provides the applicant, sanofi-aventis recherche et développement, full consent to access all data contained in the Renvela Marketing Authorisation for the purpose of this Informed Consent Application.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

As Sevelamer carbonate Zentiva is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC, only module 1 is provided and module 3 of the duplicate dossier cross-refers to the up-to-date module 3 of the original dossier (Renvela), which have been assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Since this application is an informed consent of the Renvela application, the non-clinical data in support of the Sevelamer carbonate zentiva application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Renvela dossier, which have been assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures.

## 2.3.2. Environmental risk assessment

In accordance with the scope described in the CHMP guideline, given that this application is for products that are already authorized, the absence of a phased approach ERA as specified in the guideline, is considered justified in that the total quantity of the drug substance sevelamer carbonate is not expected

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to increase upon approval of this marketing authorization. Consequently, marketing approval would not add to the environmental impact.

## 2.3.3. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

In this informed consent application, there are no issues related to the non-clinical data, which have been assessed for Renvela application and adequately reflected in the Product Information.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

As Sevelamer carbonate Zentiva is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC, only module 1 is provided and module 2 of the duplicate dossier cross-refers to the up-to-date module 2 of the original dossier (Renvela), which has been assessed and approved. No new clinical data is provided.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

RMP version 6 was provided with this submission.

This RMP version 6 being strictly identical to the RMP approved for the reference product Renvela at the end of the Renewal Procedure (EMA/H/C000993/R/0027), no further assessment of the present RMP is deemed necessary.

The MAH was requested to replace 'Renvela' by the correct Product Name 'Sevelamer carbonate Zentiva' throughout the RMP.

Below is a short overview of the content of the Risk Management Plan which is identical to Renvela:

## 2.6. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## 2.7. Risk Management Plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 6 is acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

This Marketing Authorisation application for Sevelamer Carbonate Zentiva has been submitted by Genzyme Europe BV as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2011/83/EC, as amended.

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Sevelamer Carbonate Zentiva medicinal product are identical to the up-to-date quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of Renvela. The application for Sevelamer Carbonate Zentiva concerns the identical strengths to those approved for Renvela and consists of only Module 1. Information on the scientific discussion can be found on the Renvela CHMP assessment reports and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website.

Consequentially, and in line with the assessment of data undertaken in the framework of the Renvela initial marketing authorisation application as well as within all post-autorisation procedures, the CHMP considers that the benefit/risk balance for Sevelamer Carbonate Zentiva is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Sevelamer Carbonate Zentiva in the treatment for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Sevelamer carbonate Zentiva is also indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis with serum phosphorus &gt; 1.78 mmol/L.  Sevelamer carbonate Zentiva should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplement, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to control the development of renal bone disease.

Is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.

## Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

## •

- Periodic Safety Update Reports

The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and  published on the European medicines web-portal.

- •

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product Risk management system (RMP)

- The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

updates of the RMP.

An updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
- Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.
- When the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they should be submitted at the same time.
