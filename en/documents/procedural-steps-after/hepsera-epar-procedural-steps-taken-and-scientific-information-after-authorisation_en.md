| II/0064 | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) to inform prescribers that long term treatment with Hepsera may increase the risk of renal impairment and to strengthen the monitoring of the renal function, as requested by the CHMP, following the evaluation of the last PSUR and to address a post-authorisation measure on this topic also requested following evaluation of the PSUR. Additionally, the MAH proposed to update the PI to reflect QRD version 9 and to update the PL with the details of the local representatives for Croatia and the Czech Republic. The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling, Package Leaflet and Annex A. C.I.3.b - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL intended to implement the outcome of a procedure concerning PSUR or PASS or the outcome of the assessment done under A 45/46 - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH Medicinal Product | 20/03/2014 11/02/2015 no longer | The safety data included in the last Hepsera PSUR showed a significant increase in the reporting of renal proximal tubulopathy. Furthermore, published literature concerning long term renal impact of Hepsera and time to onset for renal events suggested a possible progressive alteration of the renal function in patients receiving long-term adefovir dipivoxil therapy. Based on these data the CHMP recommended the strengthening of the recommendations on renal monitoring. Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC were updated to mention the negative long term impact of ADV therapy on renal function and to revise the recommendations for the renal monitoring in line with Viread SmPC. This included the addition of the monitoring of serum phosphate and more frequent monitoring of the renal function during the first year (every 4 weeks). |

| IB/0061       | Update of sections 4.1 and 4.2 to reflect the evolving standard of care for HBV patients, namely that Hepsera treatment should only be initiated when the use of an alternative antiviral agent with a higher genetic barrier to resistance is not available or appropriate, and the need for combination therapy in patients with decompensated liver disease. This follows from assessment of FUM 062. Moreover, the obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 'Submission of 5-year long-term data from Study GS-00-494 (an NIH study) evaluating the safety, antiviral activity and clinical benefit of the combination of adefovir 10 mg and lamivudine 100 mg once daily in adefovir treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis B' was fulfilled with submission of FUM 062 and therefore deleted from Annex II.

| II/0047   | Update of section 4.5 of the SPC to reflect available data on the co-administration of adefovir dipivoxil and pegylated interferon and of section 4.2 to align the recommendations for treatment discontinuation with those for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. These changes were requested by the CHMP further to the assessment of the respective follow-up measures. Furthermore, minor amendments to the Czech, Finnish, German and Latvian version of the annexes are being made. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 29/05/2009         | 30/06/2009 no | SmPC longer | A pharmacokinetic interaction study between adefovir and pegylated interferon showed that the pharmacokinetics for adefovir remained unchanged. However, increased serum concentrations of pegylated interferon were observed. Due to the high variability of the data, the lack of other relevant available information and considering that significant interactions between these two agents are unlikely given their different metabolic pathways, it was not possible to reach a conclusion on the issue. Caution is however recommended when adefovir and pegylated interferon are given concomitantly. The recommendation for treatment discontinuation with Hepsera were updated in section 4.2 of the SPC in line with the ones for tenofovir i.e treatment should be administered for at least 6-12 months after HBe seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA loss with anti-HBe detection) is confirmed. authorised |

| II/0039 | Update sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SPC to reflect the impact of the rtA181T mutation on the clinical response to adefovir dipivoxil. This change was agreed by the CHMP in July 2008. The PL is updated on section 6 to better describe the possible presentations of the silica gel desiccant. The MAH took this opportunity to make minor linguistic amendments to German version of the Annexes, as relevant. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 18/12/2008 | 27/01/2009           | SmPC and PL | Lamivudine-refractory patients and patients harbouring HBV with evidence of resistance to lamivudine (mutations at rtL180M, rtA181T and/or rtM204I/V) should not be treated with adefovir dipivoxil monotherapy in order to reduce the risk of resistance to adefovir. Adefovir may be used in combination with lamivudine in lamivudine-refractory patients and in patients harbouring HBV with mutations at rtL180M and/or rtM204I/V. However, for patients harbouring HBV that contains the rtA181T mutation, consideration should be given to alternative treatment regimens due to the risk of reduced susceptibility to adefovir. authorised |

| II/0037   | Update sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.7 and 4.8 of the SPC in line with the SPC guideline, as agreed at the time of the renewal of the Marketing Authorisation. The contact details of the local representatives in Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden are updated in section 6 of the PL. In addition, minor linguistic amendments are introduced in some EU languages versions of the Annexes, as relevant. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 26/06/2008         | 13/08/2008 no | SmPC and PL longer | Further to the renewal of the marketing authorization of Hepsera, the MAH was requested to submit a type II variation to update the interactions section, the effects on the ability to drive and the undesirable effects sections of the SPC to be in line with the SPC guideline. The lack of interactions between adefovir and paracetamol, ibuprofen and trimethoprime/sulfamethoxazole have been removed from the SPC as well as interaction data on the use of adefovir at higher doses than the recommended 10 mg dose. Consequently, the warnings section (4.4) was updated to reflect theses changes. Section 4.7 is amended to include a specific statement that adefovir is expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and operate machines. The undesirable effects section includes now a single table listing the adverse drug reactions reported for adefovir during clinical studies, post-marketing studies and spontaneous reporting. A general description of the most serious and/or most frequently adverse reactions reported in patients with compensated disease and in patients with decompensated disease is included in section 4.8 of the SPC. authorised |

Furthermore, patients with a confirmed increase of ? 0.3 mg/dl by week 48 were at a significant higher risk of a subsequent confirmed increase in creatinine of ? 0.5 mg/dl. Consequently, the warnings on the monitoring of renal function in patients at risk of renal were amended. Finally, hypophosphatemia and decrease in carnitine concentrations reported in these patients were also included in the SPC. authorised                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| II/0033 | Update of sections 4.2 , 4.4 and 5.1 of the SPC with resistance information including in lamivudine-resistant patients and of section 4.8 to add renal failure, proximal tubulopathies and associated muscular and bone disorders to the list of adverse drug reactions to adefovir. These amendements were requested by the CHMP in September 2007 following the assessments of FU2 045.1 and PSUR 6 (covering the period from 21.9.05 to 20.9.06). The PL is updated under sections 2 and 4 in line with the SPC amendments. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Medicinal Product | 21/02/2008 01/04/2008 SmPC no longer | PL Further to a cumulative safety review of renal events associated with adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), the CHMP requested for the adverse events renal failure, proximal renal tubulopathy, Fanconi syndrome, hypophosphatemia, myopathy and osteomalacia to be added in section 4.8 of the SPC, with a frequency not known. The package leaflet has been updated accordingly. Cases of hepatic decompensation involving resistance to adefovir dipivoxil were reviewed: All 8 cases reviewed involved lamivudine-resistant HBV and in 6 of the 8 cases, the patient had a history or evidence of diminished hepatic reserve at baseline. Based on this review, a warning entitled 'Resistance' has been added in Section 4.4 of the SPC with that respect.

The CHMP is therefore of the opinion that the renewal can be granted with unlimited validity. However in the context of the evolving therapeutic management of hepatitis b, and given the increased risk of resistance (25% at 5 years) the benefit of Hepsera is tending to decrease over time. There are also remaining uncertainties pertaining to the long term safety data in particular renal events and impact on the bone due to progressive loss of phosphate. The CHMP therefore considers that the MAH should continue to submit PSUR on a yearly basis, and in particular to closely monitor the renal safety and the emergence of resistance. |

| II/0027 | Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SPC with regards to patients with renal impairment and of section 5.1 with regards to HIV/HBV coinfected patients, as requested by the CHMP following the assessment of available data from clinical studies. PL was updated in accordance and in line with the readability testing results. Furthermore the SPC, Labelling and PL, as relevant were amended to reflect the MAH new post code, EMEA website address, and minor linguistic changes including adaptation with latest version of the EMEA/QRD templates for all EU languages except English and Maltese. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet Product | 20/09/2007 | 23/10/2007 no | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL longer | Based on the clinical data available in renal impaired patients the recommended dosing interval adjustments in the varies degrees of impairment were reviewed and amended. Adefovir dipivoxil should not be use in patients with a creatinine clearance lower than 30 ml/min or in patients on dialysis. However, if the treatment is judged strictly necessary in these patients, the dosing should be adjusted as mentioned in section 4.2 of the SPC. This dosing guidance is based on very limited data and a closely monitoring of these patients is required. Furthermore, the definition of the moderate renal impairment was reviewed and the lower cut-off changed to 30 ml/min. Therefore, patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 ml/min should take 1 tablet of Hepsera every 48 hours. This information is reflected in section 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SPC. As regards HBV/HIV coinfected patients with lamivudine-resistance, further available data from a clinical study is now reflected in section 5.1 of the SPC. Although the data is very limited for a formal conclusion to be drawn, this study can be regarded as complementary to substantiate the efficacy and safety of adefovir in HBV/HIV coinfected patients. The PL is amended in accordance and in line with the results of the readability testing conducted with target patients groups. authorised |

| II/0021   | Update of section 4.8 and section 5.1 of the SPC in view of the efficacy, safety and resistance data from a study evaluating adefovir dipivoxil for the treatment of patients with presumed precore mutant chronic hepatitis B virus infection with open label long term follow up. Furthermore, resistance data in section 5.1 is organised to accommodate the status of patients (e.g. lamivudine resistant, nucleoside naïve patients). The PL has been updated accordingly. The MAH has also taken this opportunity to amend the SPC, Annex II, labelling and the PL in line with the Medicinal Product | 28/06/2006   | 04/08/2006 SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | One hundred and twenty five HBeAg negative patients who had completed the first 96 weeks of study and had received adefovir treatment during weeks 49-96 were included in the open label treatment phase with adefovir for up to 240 weeks. Efficacy, safety and resistance data from 96 weeks of the study treatment were included in the SPC/PL for Hepsera in 2004 (see below summary for II/002). The final results including data for up to 240 weeks of adefovir treatment showed that the long-term treatment results in sustained reduction in serum HBV DNA and ALT levels as well as continued histological improvement.

| II/0011 | Update section 5.1 of the SPC, to reflect the results of an integrated resistance summary from several clinical studies which includes patients treated with Hepsera, for up to 192 weeks. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet 27/07/2005 15/09/2005 Medicinal Product | SmPC, Labelling and PL The resistance surveillance results (12 patients genotyped out of 67 patients included for assessment by week 192), confirmed that both mutations rtN236T and rtA181V could be defined as adefovir associated resistance mutations. The rtN236T mutation demonstrated a phenotypic resistance in vitro and also in patients with a serum HBV DNA rebound. The in vitro and in vivo data suggests that the rtN236T mutant HBV remains susceptible to lamivudine. The rtA181V mutation is associated with adefovir resistance in clinics but the in vitro phenotypic resistance is moderate. Preliminary data, both in vitro and in patients, suggests that the rtA181V mutant HBV may confer a reduced susceptibility to lamivudine. Further surveillance data will be submitted to |

| II/0013 | Update section 4.4 of the SPC, to clearly state that in patients with decompensated liver disease or cirrhosis treatment cessation is not recommended and to add \"rash\" and \"pruritus\" in section 4.8 as requested by the CHMP following the assessment of the 4th PSUR covering the period 21.03.04 to 20.09.04. Relevant sections of the PL are updated in accordance. Minor linguistic changes were introduced in the SPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL for some of the EU languages, as relevant. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet Medicinal Product | 27/07/2005 | 13/09/2005 no | and Although the relationship is currently unknown, post-treatment exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred especially within 12 weeks after discontinuation of treatment with adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg. The SPC adequately reflects the hepatic adverse events associated with adefovir dipivoxil on-treatment or following discontinuation in patients with compensated liver disease. However, patients with decompensated liver disease remain a cause of concern as severe, or even fatal, hepatitis events were almost exclusively reported in this population. Even though no new major safety concern arose from the assessment of a cumulative review of hepatic events reported up to 20 September 2004, the CHMP agreed that the warnings in section 4.4 of the SPC could be strengthened by highlighting the fact that treatment cessation is not recommended in patients with decompensated liver disease or cirrhosis as already mentioned in section 4.2. In addition, and based on the safety data provided in the 4th PSUR namely the cumulative cutaneous adverse reactions reported during the treatment with adefovir dipivoxil, the CHMP concluded that \"rash\" and \"pruritus\" should be included in section 4.8 of the SPC as adverse reactions associated with the adefovir dipivoxil treatment. Sections 2 and 4 of the PL have been updated accordingly. longer |

| II/0004 | Update of section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC, , to implement the results of the pharmacokinetic drug-interaction study that investigates the potential interactions of adefovir dipivoxil with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. The list of the local representatives in the PL is being completed with the contacts of the new European Member Strates. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet               | 24/03/2004         | 25/05/2004 no | SmPC and PL longer | This was an open-label, fixed sequence, drug-drug interaction study of multiple doses of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovoir DF) and single doses of adefovir dipivoxil. Tenofovir DF was provided as one 300 mg tablet for oral administration with food once daily (QD) on study days 2 through 8, whilst adefovir dipivoxil was given as one 10 mg tablet for oral administration with food QD on study days 1 and 8 only. Regular blood samples were collected to measure adefovir, tenofovir and tenofovir prodrug species. Results showed that the co-administration of single dose of ADV with multiple doses of TDF did not lead to clinically relevant drug-drug interaction with regard to pharmacokinetics. No conclusion in term of safe use for the adefovir/tenofovir co-administration could be derived from the present study. Additional clinical data would be required to recommend concomitant use of both medicinal products through a long period in clinical practice.

At week 96, patients continuing on adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg had sustained suppression of serum HBV with maintenance of the reduction seen at week 48. In over two thirds of patients suppression of serum HBV DNA was associated with normalisation of ALT levels.

N/0003

section 5.1 of the SPC with regard to an integrated resistance summary, which includes genotypic and phenotypic analysis of serum HBV DNA from several clinical studies, and to include details of the rtN236T mutation as requested by the CPMP following the assessment of the 1st Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR), covering the period of 20.09.02 to 20.03.03. Section 5.1 is amended to describe all mutations in the HBV polymerase using the international consensus nomenclature.Two typographical errors have been corrected in section 5.2..

The MAH has also taken this opportunity to include in section 5.1, the full ATC code for Hepsera, as assigned by World Health Organisation Collaboration Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology.The MAH is also proposing to amend the current text in section 5.1 to describe all mutations in the HBV polymerase using the international consensus nomenclature.Two typographical errors have been highlighted in section 5.2 (Pharmacokinetic properties) and corrections proposed.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics

This notification relates to changes in addresses of the local representative holders in Italy and Austria as well as typographical and consistency corrections. Other changes include the re-ordering of the Belgium local representative title in order to correct the PL template and a minor change in the Greek address following adefovir dipivoxil, serum HBV DNA and ALT levels returned towards baseline.  Treatment with adefovir dipivoxil resulted in improvement in the liver fibrosis (from 0-96 weeks therapy) when analysed using the Ishak score (median change: D= -1), but not when analysed using the Knodell fibrosis score. In an open-label study in chronic lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B patients co-infected with HIV.  Adefovir dipivoxil 10mg was added to ongoing lamivudine therapy.  Of the 35 patients initially enrolled, 29 completed 144 weeks treatment.  They showed progressive reductions in serum HBV DNA levels and ALT levels throughout the course of treatment.

Resistence: genotypic analyses were performed in the 87 patients with detectable HBV DNA out of 238 treated for 96 weeks from several clinical studies.  A novel conserved site mutation was identified in the D domain of the HBV polymerase gene (rtN236T), which conferred clinical resistance to adefovir dipivoxil.  This mutation has been observed in &lt; 2 % (4/238) of patients treated for up to 96 weeks and is associated with reduced susceptibility to adefovir in vitro and with a progressive rebound in viral load in vivo. In addition, mutation rtA 181V was observed in 2 patients but could not be undoubtedly associated with resistance to adefovir dipivoxil.
