Therefore section 4.8 of the SmPC and section 4 of the package leaflet for colesevelam have been updated to include intestinal obstruction as an adverse reaction. |

Co-administration of colesevelam and metformin extended release (ER) tablets increases the exposure of metformin. Colesevelam binds to glimepiride and reduces glimepiride absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. No interaction was observed when glimepiride was taken at least 4 hours before colesevelam. Co-administration of colesevelam and glipizide decreases the exposure of glipizide. In this group of variations the product information for colesevelam has been updated in order to include this safety information.   |

|           | Package Leaflet. This type II variation concerns an update of sections 4.2 and 4.5 of the SmPC, upon request by the CHMP following the assessment of PSUR 10, to add information on the posology of Cholestagel in relation to co-administered drugs in general and ursodeoxycholic acid in particular. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet |              |              |               | 4.2 and 4.5 of the SmPC to add information on the timing of Cholestagel intake at least four hours before or after concomitantly administered medication. With respect to the interaction with ursodeoxycholic acid, the SmPC was amended with a statement to take Cholestagel at least four hours after the intake of concomitant medicinal products. When a drug interaction cannot be excluded with a concomitant medicinal product for which minor variations in the therapeutic level would be clinically important, Cholestagel should be administered at least four hours before or at least four hours after the concomitant medication in order to minimize the risk of reduced absorption of the concomitant medication (see section 4.5). Cholestagel may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. Therefore when a drug interaction cannot be excluded with a concomitant medicinal product for which minor variations in the therapeutic level would be clinically important, Cholestagel should be administered at least four hours before or at least four hours after the concomitant medication to minimize the risk of reduced absorption of the concomitant medication. For concomitant medications which require administration via divided doses, it should be noted that the required dose of Cholestagel can be taken once a day. Ursodeoxycholic acid Cholestagel predominantly binds hydrophobic bile acids. In a clinical study Cholestagel did not affect the faecal excretion of endogenous (hydrophilic) ursodeoxycholic acid. |
