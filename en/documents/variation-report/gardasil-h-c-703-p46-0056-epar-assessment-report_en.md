-  Description
-  Methods
- Objective(s)

To observe the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a 3 -dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV Vaccine in healthy females 9 to 15 years of age in India.

- Study design

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This  was  an o pen -label, nonrandomized,  multicenter immunogenicity  and  safety study in preadolescent  and  adolescent  females  aged  9  to  15  years  old.  For  each  subject  enrolled,  the duration of the study was approximately 7 months.

## · Study population /Sample size

This study was planned to prove that rate of serious vaccine -related adverse experiences in Indian population would be &lt;3.3% with 95% probability. 110 healthy female were enrolled in this study to achieve this objective

## · Treatments

Participants received a total of 3 intramuscular injections of Gardasil/Silgard, the  quadrivalent HPV VLP Vaccine (HPV types 6/11/16/18) which contained 20/40/40/20 mcg in a 0.5 mL dose. Vaccine was administered at time 0, Month 2 and Month 6.

Serological response using the competitive Luminex Immunoassay was measured at Month 7.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

The main immunogenicity measurements used to address this objective were:

1. Among subjects who were baseline naïve to HPV 6, HPV 11, HPV 16, and/or HPV 18, the proportion who became seropositive to the relevant vaccine HPV type by Month 7.

2. Geometric mean anti -HPV 6, anti -HPV 11, anti -HPV 16, and anti -HPV 18 serum cLIA levels at Month 7.

The quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) competitive Luminex immunoassay (cLIA) was used to detect antibody to HPV virus-like particles (VLPs), serotypes 6, 11, 16, 18 before and after vaccination with the HPV quadrivalent vaccine. The seropositivity cutoffs for the HPV 6, 11,  16,  and  18  cLIAs  are  20  mMU/mL,  16  mMU/mL,  20  mMU/mL,and  24  mMU/mL, respectively.

Serum samples were to be collected from all subjects at Day 1 and Month 7.

Safety  was  assessed  by  injection  site  reactions,  systemic  adverse  reactions  (up  to  14  days after each injection), and serious adverse events.

## · Statistical Methods

Continuous  variables  were  summarized  using  mean,  standard  deviation,  median,  minimum, and  maximum,  while  categorical  variables  were  summarized  using  proportions  (counts  and percentages).

Data on subject disposition (number of subjects enrolled, number of dropouts, and reasons for dropout), demographics (gender, age, weight, height and BMI), and other baseline characteristics were summarized.

The seroconversion rates and geometric mean titers (GMTs) to each of HPV type 6, 11, 16, and 18  were  summarized  by  time -point  with  95%  confidence  intervals.  Exact  95%  confidence intervals were provided for the seroconversion rates. For the GMTs, 95% confidence intervals were provided based on the asymptotic t -distribution.

Overall  summary  of  safety  of  quadrivalent  HPV  Vaccine,  for  safety  measures  such  as  the proportion of subjects reporting: (1) any adverse experiences, (2) any injection -site  adverse experiences,  (3)  any  systemic  adverse  experiences,  and  (4)  any  vaccine -related  adverse experiences that occurred throughout the study were summarized.

##  Results

## · Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 110 subjects were enrolled for participation at 7 investigative sites. One hundred and eight subjects who had follow-up data were included in the safety analyses. Two subjects did not complete  the vaccination  regimen.  One  subject  had  month  7  serum  sample  for Immunogenicity collected outside the acceptable day range and one subject received non -study vaccine (Tetanus toxoid) during the study. Hence 106 subjects were eligible for Immunogenicity analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Out  of  the  106  subjects  eligible  for  immunogenicity  analysis  at  baseline,  the  number  of subjects evaluable for Immunogenicity per protocol for each HPV type was as follows:

## · Immunogenicity results

Table  3  presents  a  summary  of  the  percentages  of  subjects  who  seroconverted  for  each vaccine  HPV  type  at  4  weeks  postdose  3,  in  different  age  groups,  in  the  per-protocol immunogenicity  group.  Estimated  seroconversion rates and  associated  95%  confidence intervals  are  shown for each vaccine HPV type. Overall, &gt;96% of subjects seroconverted by Week  4  Postdose 3, for each of the 4 HPV  types summarized  in the per-protocol immunogenicity  group.  Therefore,  GARDASIL®  induced  acceptable  anti-HPV  6,  11,  16,  18 responses in females 9 to 15 years of age in India.

Table 4 presents a summary of anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 GMTs measured 4 weeks Postdose 3 in the per-protocol immunogenicity group. Analysis per age group revealed that GMTs in younger subjects (9 to 12 years of age) were more robust than those in older subjects (13 to 15 years of age).

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Among  healthy  subjects  between  the  ages  of  9  years  and  15  years  in  India  who  received GARDASIL®, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. The administration of a 3-dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine to 9 to 15 year old female induces over 96% seroconversion rate for antiHPV 6, anti- HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18.
2. The administration of a 3-dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine to 9 to15 year old female induces robust geometric titers for anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18.
3. The administration of a 3-dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine to 9 to 15 year old female is generally well tolerated.

##  Description

##  Methods

## Objective(s)

To observe the safety and tolerability of quadrivalent HPV Vaccine in healthy females 9 to 26 years of age in China.

## Study design

This  was  an open -label,  single-dose,  one-centre  safety  study,  devided  in  two  stages,  in preadolescent and adolescent females aged 9 to 26 years old.

The  two  strata  included  2  periods:  20  females  aged  18-26  years  receive  test  vaccine  and adverse events and serious adverse events at injection site and systemic adverse events and serious adverse events were observed. Based on no serious side reaction was observed after vaccinations in stage I, another 20 cases of healthy females aged 9-17 years were selected, and a dose of test  vaccine  was  intramuscularly  administrated.  Local  and  systemic  reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

during  this  observation  period  were  recorded  on  diary  cards.  For  each  subject  enrolled,  the duration of the study was approximately 14 days.

## · Study population /Sample size

This study was planned to prove that rate of serious vaccine -related adverse experiences in Chinese population. Forty healthy female subjects were enrolled in this study, in two strata, twenty 9-17 years old and twenty 18-26 years old.

## · Treatments

Participants received one intramuscular injections of Gardasil/Silgard, the quadrivalent HPV VLP Vaccine (HPV types 6/11/16/18) which contained 20/40/40/20 mcg in a 0.5 mL dose. Vaccine was administered at time 0.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

Safety was assessed by injection site reactions, systemic adverse reactions (up to 14 days after each injection), and serious adverse events.

## · Statistical Methods

Only descriptive statistics for safety results were given for this phase I study.

Overall  summary  of  safety  of  quadrivalent  HPV  Vaccine,  for  safety  measures  such  as  the proportion of subjects reporting: (1) any adverse experiences, (2) any injection -site  adverse experiences,  (3)  any  systemic  adverse  experiences,  and  (4)  any  vaccine -related  adverse experiences that occurred throughout the study were summarized.

##  Results

## · Recruitment/ Number analysed

All  40  subjects were included in the safety set. Generally, during the whole observation period (14-day follow up), 21 subjects occurred at least 1 monitored adverse experience (local and/or systemic), 10 subjects in Group 1 (50%), 11 subjects in Group 2 (55%).

## · Safety results

During 14 days follow up, the rate of observed local and systemic adverse reaction was 52.50%, and the rate of adverse events related to vaccine was 40.00%. All adverse events were expected common reactions, mild in intensity, and medical treatments were not required.

No  serious  adverse  experiences  or  vaccine-related  adverse  experiences  occurred  during  study period, none of severe local or systemic adverse experiences was observed. No acute allergic was observed within 30 minutes after first dosage in two groups. In one subject in group aged 9-17, occurred mild fever, there was no reaction in other subjects. The systemic adverse experiences incidence  rate  was  43%,  the  incidence  rate  of  all  systemic  adverse  experiences  related  to vaccination was 18%. Generally all systemic adverse experiences were mild. Table 1 presents a summary of adverse experience.
