## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pemetrexed, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed and considering in vitro studies indicated that pemetrexed is actively secreted by organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) and IC50 values for proton pump  inhibitors,  the  PRAC  considers  a  drug-drug  interaction  between  proton  pump  inhibitors  and pemetrexed is at  least  a  reasonable  possibility.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product  information  of products containing pemetrexed should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pemetrexed the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pemetrexed is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
