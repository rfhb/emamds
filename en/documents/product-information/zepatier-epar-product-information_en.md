| 1a            | ZEPATIER for 12 weeks ZEPATIER for 16 weeks plus ribavirin A should be considered in patients with baseline HCVRNAlevel >800,000 IU/mL and/or the presence ofspecific NS5A polymorphisms causing at least a 5-fold reduction in activity ofelbasvir to minimise the risk oftreatment failure (see section 5.1). |
| 1b            | ZEPATIER for 12 weeks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4             | ZEPATIER for 12 weeks ZEPATIER for 16 weeks plus ribavirin A should be considered in patients with baseline HCV RNA level >800,000 IU/mL to minimise the risk oftreatment failure (see section 5.1).                                                                                                            |

A In the adult clinical studies, the dose of ribavirin was weight-based (&lt; 66 kg = 800 mg/day, 66 to 80 kg = 1,000 mg/day, 81 to 105 kg = 1,200 mg/day, &gt; 105 kg = 1,400 mg/day) administered in two divided doses with food.

For specific dosage instructions f or ribavirin, including dose modif ication, refer to the ribavirin Summary of Product Characteristics.

Patients should be instructed that if vomiting occurs within 4 hours of dosing, an additional tablet can be taken up to 8 hours before the next dose. If vomiting occurs more than 4 hours after dosing, no further dose is needed.

In case a dose of ZEPATIER is missed and it is within 16 hours of the time ZEPATIER is usually taken, the patient should be instructed to take ZEPATIER as soon as possible and then take the next dose of ZEPATIER at the usual time. If more than 16 hours have passed since ZEPATIER is usually taken, then the patient should be instructed that the missed dose should NOT be taken and to take the next dose per the usual dosing schedule. Patients should be instructed not to take a double dose.

## Elderly

No dose adjustment of ZEPATIER is required for elderly patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Renal impairment and end stage renal disease (ESRD)

No dose adjustment of ZEPATIER is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (including patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment of ZEPATIER is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). ZEPATIER is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).

The safety and efficacy of ZEPATIER have not been established in liver transplant recipients.

## Paediatric population

No dosage adjustment of ZEPATIER is required in paediatric patients 12 years of age and older who weigh at least 30 kg (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

The safety and efficacy of ZEPATIER in children aged less than 12 years have not been established.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

For oral use.

The film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole and may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2).

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Co-administration with inhibitors of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B (OATP1B), such as rif ampicin, atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, cobicistat or ciclosporin (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

Co-administration with inducers of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), such as efavirenz, phenytoin, carbamazepine, bosentan, etravirine, modafinil or St.  John's  w ort ( Hypericum perforatum ) (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## ALT elevations

The rate of late ALT elevations during treatment is directly related to the plasma exposure to grazoprevir. During clinical studies with ZEPATIER with or without ribavirin, &lt; 1 % of subjects experienced elevations of ALT from normal levels to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), (see section 4.8). Higher rates of late ALT elevations occurred in females (2 % [11/652]), Asians (2 % [4/165]), and subjects aged ≥ 65 years (2 % [3/187]) (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). These late ALT elevations generally occurred at or after treatment week 8.

Hepatic laboratory testing should be performed prior to therapy, at treatment week 8, and as clinically indicated. For patients receiving 16 weeks of therapy, additional hepatic laboratory testing should be performed at treatment week 12.

- Patients should be instructed to consult their healthcare prof essional without delay if they have onset of fatigue, weakness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice or discoloured faeces.
- Discontinuation of ZEPATIER should be considered if ALT levels are confirmed to be greater than 10 times the ULN.
- ZEPATIER should be discontinued if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inf lammation or increasing conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, or international normalised ratio (INR).

## Genotype-specific activity

The efficacy of ZEPATIER has not been demonstrated in HCV genotypes 2, 3, 5 and 6. ZEPATIER is not recommended in patients infected with these genotypes.

## Retreatment

The efficacy of ZEPATIER in patients previously exposed to ZEPATIER, or to medicinal products of the same classes as those of  ZEPATIER (NS5A inhibitors or NS3/4A inhibitors other than telaprevir, simeprevir, boceprevir), has not been demonstrated (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Interactions with medicinal products

Co-administration of ZEPATIER and OATP1B inhibitors is contraindicated because it may signif icantly increase grazoprevir plasma concentrations.

Co-administration of ZEPATIER and CYP3A or P-gp inducers is contraindicated because it may signif icantly decrease elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations and may lead to a reduced therapeutic effect of ZEPATIER (see sections 4.3, 4.5 and 5.2).

The concomitant use of ZEPATIER and strong CYP3A inhibitors increases elbasvir and grazoprevir concentrations, and co-administration is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## HCV/HBV (hepatitis B virus) co-infection

Cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should therefore be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines.

## Use in diabetic patients

Diabetics may experience improved glucose control potentially resulting in symptomatic hypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic patients initiating DAA therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the first 3 months, and their diabetic medication modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the diabetic care of the patient should be informed when DAA therapy is initiated.

## Paediatric population

ZEPATIER is not indicated for use in children under 12 years of age.

## Excipients

ZEPATIER contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.

ZEPATIER contains 69.85 mg sodium per tablet, equivalent to 3.5 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Potential f or other medicinal products to aff ect ZEPATIER

Grazoprevir is a substrate of OATP1B drug transporters. Co-administration of ZEPATIER with medicinal products that inhibit OATP1B transporters is contraindicated because it may result in a signif icant increase in the plasma concentration of grazoprevir (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Elbasvir and grazoprevir are substrates of CYP3A and P-gp. Co-administration of inducers of CYP3A or P-gp with ZEPATIER is contraindicated because it may decrease elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations, which may lead to reduced therapeutic effect of ZEPATIER (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Co-administration of ZEPATIER with strong CYP3A inhibitors increases elbasvir and grazoprevir plasma concentrations, and co-administration is not recommended (see Table 2 and section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Co-administration of ZEPATIER with P-gp inhibitors is expected to have a minimal effect on the plasma concentrations of ZEPATIER.

The potential for grazoprevir to be a breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) substrate cannot be excluded.

## Potential f or ZEPATIER to affect other medicinal products

Elbasvir and grazoprevir are inhibitors of the drug transporter BCRP at the intestinal level in humans and may increase plasma concentrations of co-administered BCRP substrates. Elbasvir is not a CYP3A inhibitor in vitro and grazoprevir is a weak CYP3A inhibitor in humans. Co-administration with grazoprevir did not result in clinically relevant increases in exposures of CYP3A substrates. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required for CYP3A substrates when co-administered with ZEPATIER.

Elbasvir has minimal intestinal P-gp inhibition in humans, and does not result in clinically relevant increases in concentrations of digoxin (a P-gp substrate), with an 11% increase in plasma AUC. Grazoprevir is not a P-gp inhibitor based on in vitro data. Elbasvir and grazoprevir are not OATP1B inhibitors in humans. Based on in vitro data, clinically signif icant interactions with ZEPATIER as an inhibitor of other CYP enzymes, UGT1A1, esterases (CES1, CES2, and CatA), OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2 are not expected. Based on in vitro data, a potential f or GZR to inhibit BSEP cannot be excluded. Multiple-dose administration of elbasvir or grazoprevir is unlikely to induce the metabolism of medicinal products metabolised by CYP isoforms based on in vitro data.

## Patients treated with vitamin K antagonists

As liver function may change during treatment with ZEPATIER, a close monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended.

## Impact of DAA therapy on drugs metabolized by the liver

Grazoprevir's weak inhibition of  CYP3A may increase levels of  CYP3A substrates. In addition, the plasma concentrations of  drugs that are CYP3A substrates may be decreased by improvement in liver function during DAA therapy, related to clearance of HCV. Therefore, close monitoring and potential dose adjustment of CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors) may be required during therapy, as drug levels may change (see Table 2).

## Interactions between ZEPATIER and other medicinal products

Table 2 provides a listing of assessed or potential medicinal product interact ions. An up '↑' or down '↓' arrow represents a change in exposure that requires monitoring or a dose adjustment of that medication, or the co-administration is not recommended or contraindicated. No clinically relevant change in exposure is represented by a horizontal arrow '↔'.

The medicinal product interactions described are based on results from studies conducted with either ZEPATIER or elbasvir (EBR) and grazoprevir (GZR) as individual agents, or are predicted medicinal product interactions that may occur with elbasvir or grazoprevir. The table is not all-inclusive.

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

If  ZEPATIER is co-administered with ribavirin, the information for ribavirin with regard to contraception, pregnancy testing, pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility also applies to this combination regimen (refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for the co-administered medicinal product for additional information).

## Women of childbearing potential / contraception in males and females

When ZEPATIER is used in combination with ribavirin, women of childbearing potential or their male partners must use an effective form of contraception during treatment and for a period of time after the treatment has concluded.

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with ZEPATIER in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate harmful eff ects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Because reproduction

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

animal studies are not always predictive of human response, ZEPATIER should be used only if the potential benefit justif ies the potential risk to the f etus.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether elbasvir or grazoprevir and their metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available pharmacokinetic data in animals has shown excretion of elbasvir and grazoprevir in milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from ZEPATIER therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

No human data on the effect of elbasvir and grazoprevir on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate harmful effects of elbasvir or grazoprevir on fertility at elbasvir and grazoprevir exposures higher than the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

ZEPATIER (administered alone or in combination with ribavirin) is not likely to have an effect on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed that f atigue has been reported during treatment with ZEPATIER (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety of ZEPATIER was assessed based on 3 placebo-controlled studies and 7 uncontrolled Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies in approximately 2,000 subjects with chronic hepatitis C infection with compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis).

In clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (greater than 10%) were fatigue and headache. Less than 1 % of subjects treated with ZEPATIER with or without ribavirin had serious adverse reactions (abdominal pain, transient ischaemic attack and anaemia). Less than 1 % of subjects treated with ZEPATIER with or without ribavirin permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. The frequency of serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in subjects with compensated cirrhosis were comparable to those seen in subjects without cirrhosis.

When elbasvir/grazoprevir was studied with ribavirin, the most frequent adverse reactions to elbasvir/grazoprevir + ribavirin combination therapy were consistent with the known safety profile of ribavirin.

## Tabulated summary of adverse reactions

The following adverse reactions were identified in patients taking ZEPATIER without ribavirin for 12 weeks. The adverse reactions are listed below by body system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are def ined as f ollows: very common (≥ 1/10),  common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000) or very rare (&lt; 1/10,000).

†

ULN: Upper limit of normal according to testing laboratory.

## Serum Late ALT elevations

During clinical studies with ZEPATIER with or without ribavirin, regardless of treatment duration, &lt; 1 % (13/1,690) of subjects experienced elevations of ALT from normal levels to greater than 5 times the ULN, generally at or after treatment week 8 (mean onset time 10 weeks, range 6-12 weeks). These late ALT elevations were typically asymptomatic. Most late ALT elevations resolved with ongoing therapy with ZEPATIER or after completion of therapy (see section 4.4). The frequency of late ALT elevations was higher in subjects with higher grazoprevir plasma concentration (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2). The incidence of late ALT elevations was not affected by treatment duration. Cirrhosis was not a risk f actor f or late ALT elevations. Less than 1% of subjects treated with ZEPATIER with or without ribavirin experienced ALT elevations &gt;2.5 -5 times the ULN during treatment; there were no treatment discontinuations due to these ALT elevations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety assessment of Zepatier in paediatric patients aged 12 years and older is based on data from a Phase 2b, open-label clinical study that enrolled 22 patients who were treated with Zepatier for 12 weeks.The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical studies of Zepatier in adults.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Human experience of overdose with ZEPATIER is limited. The highest dose of elbasvir was 200 mg once daily for 10 days, and a single dose of 800 mg. The highest dose of grazoprevir was 1,000 mg once daily for 10 days, and a single dose of 1,600 mg. In these healthy volunteer studies, adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity to those reported in the placebo groups.

In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

Haemodialysis does not remove elbasvir or grazoprevir. Elbasvir and grazoprevir are not expected to be removed by peritoneal dialysis.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, Direct acting antivirals, Antivirals for treatment of HCV infections, ATC code: J05AP54.

## Mechanism of action

ZEPATIER combines two direct-acting antiviral agents with distinct mechanisms of action and nonoverlapping resistance profiles to target HCV at multiple steps in the viral lifecycle.

Elbasvir is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, which is essential for viral RNA replication and virion assembly.

Grazoprevir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease which is necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins) and is essential for viral replication. In a biochemical assay, grazoprevir inhibited the proteolytic activity of the recombinant NS3/4A protease enzymes from HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 3 and 4a with IC50 values ranging from 4 to 690 pM.

## Antiviral activity

The EC50 values of elbasvir and grazoprevir against full-length or chimeric replicons encoding NS5A or NS3 sequences from reference sequences and clinical isolates are presented in Table 5.

## Resistance

## In cell culture

HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to elbasvir and grazoprevir have been selected in cell culture for genotypes 1a, 1b and 4.

For elbasvir, in HCV genotype 1a replicons, single NS5A substitutions Q30D/E/H/R, L31M/V and Y93C/H/N reduced elbasvir antiviral activity by 6- to 2,000-fold. In genotype 1b replicons, single NS5A substitutions L31F and Y93H reduced elbasvir antiviral activity by 17-fold. In genotype 4 replicons, single NS5A substitutions L30S, M31V, and Y93H reduced elbasvir antiviral activity by 3to 23-fold. In general, in HCV genotype 1a, 1b or 4 combinations of elbasvir resistance-associated substitutions further reduced elbasvir antiviral activity.

For grazoprevir, in HCV genotype 1a replicons, single NS3 substitutions D168A/E/G/S/V reduced grazoprevir antiviral activity by 2- to 81-f old. In genotype 1b replicons, single NS3 substitutions F43S, A156S/T/V, and D168A/G/V reduced grazoprevir antiviral activity by 3- to 375-fold. In genotype 4 replicons, single NS3 substitutions D168A/V reduced grazoprevir antiviral activity by 110to 320-fold. In general, in HCV genotype 1a, 1b or 4 replicons, combinations of grazoprevir resistance-associated substitutions further reduced grazoprevir antiviral activity.

## In clinical studies

In a pooled analysis of subjects treated with regimens containing elbasvir/grazoprevir or elbasvir + grazoprevir with or without ribavirin in Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, resistance analyses were conducted for 50 subjects who experienced virologic failure and had sequence data available (6 with on-treatment virologic failure, 44 with post-treatment relapse).

Treatment-emergent substitutions observed in the viral populations of these subjects based on genotypes are shown in Table 6. Treatment-emergent substitutions were detected in both HCV drug targets in 23/37 (62 %) genotype 1a, 1/8 (13 %) genotype 1b and 2/5 (40 %) genotype 4 subjects.

## Cross-resistance

Elbasvir is active in vitro against genotype 1a NS5A substitutions, M28V and Q30L, genotype 1b substitutions, L28M/V, R30Q, L31V, Y93C, and genotype 4 substitution, M31V, which confer resistance to other NS5A inhibitors. In general, other NS5A substitutions conferring resistance to NS5A inhibitors may also confer resistance to elbasvir. NS5A substitutions conferring resistance to elbasvir may reduce the antiviral activity of other NS5A inhibitors.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Grazoprevir is active in vitro against the following genotype 1a NS3 substitutions which confer resistance to other NS3/4A protease inhibitors: V36A/L/M, Q41R, F43L, T54A/S, V55A/I, Y56F, Q80K/R, V107I, S122A/G/R/T, I132V, R155K, A156S, D168N/S, I170T/V. Grazoprevir is active in vitro against the following genotype 1b NS3 substitutions conferring resistance to other NS3/4A protease inhibitors: V36A/I/L/M, Q41L/R, F43S, T54A/C/G/S, V55A/I, Y56F, Q80L/R, V107I, S122A/G/R, R155E/K/N/Q/S, A156G/S, D168E/N/S, V170A/I/T. Some NS3 substitutions at A156 and at D168 confer reduced antiviral activity to grazoprevir as well as to other NS3/4A protease inhibitors.

The substitutions associated with resistance to NS5B inhibitors do not affect the activity of elbasvir or grazoprevir.

## Persistence of resistance-associated substitutions

The persistence of elbasvir and grazoprevir treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in NS5A, and NS3, respectively, was assessed in genotype 1-infected subjects in Phase 2 and 3 studies whose virus had treatment-emergent resistance-associated substitution in the drug target, and with available data through at least 24 weeks post-treatment using population (or Sanger) sequencing.

Viral populations with treatment-emergent NS5A resistance-associated substitutions were generally more persistent than NS3 resistance associated substitutions. Among genotype 1a-infected subjects, NS5A resistance-associated substitutions persisted at detectable levels at follow-up week 12 in 95% (35/37) of subjects and in 100% (9/9) of subjects with follow-up week 24 data. Among genotype 1binfected subjects, NS5A resistance-associated substitutions persisted at detectable levels in 100% (7/7) of subjects at f ollow-up week 12 and in 100% (3/3) of subjects with follow-up week 24 data.

Among genotype 1a-infected subjects, NS3 resistance-associated substitutions persisted at detectable levels at f ollow-up week 24 in 31% (4/13) of subjects. Among genotype 1b-infected subjects, NS3 resistance-associated substitutions persisted at detectable levels at f ollow-up week 24 in 50% (1/2) of subjects.

Due to the limited number of genotype 4-infected subjects with treatment emergent NS5A and NS3 resistance associated substitutions, trends in persistence of treatment emergent substitutions in this genotype could not be established.

The long-term clinical impact of the emergence or persistence of virus containing ZEPATIER resistance-associated substitutions is unknown.

## Effect of baseline HCV polymorphisms on treatment response

In pooled analyses of subjects who achieved SVR12 or met criteria for virologic failure, the prevalence and impact of NS5A polymorphisms (including M28T/A, Q30E/H/R/G/K/D, L31M/V/F, H58D, and Y93C/H/N) and NS3 polymorphisms (substitutions at positions 36, 54, 55, 56, 80, 107, 122, 132, 155, 156, 158, 168, 170, and 175) that confer greater than 5-fold reduction of elbasvir and grazoprevir antiviral activity respectively in vitro were evaluated. The observed treatment response differences by treatment regimen in specific patient populations in the presence or absence of baseline NS5A or NS3 polymorphisms are summarised in Table 7.

Clinical study in subjects with advanced chronic kidney disease with genotype 1 CHC infection In the C-SURFER study, overall SVR was achieved in 94 % (115/122) of subjects receiving EBR + GZR for 12 weeks.

## Paediatric population

The efficacy of ZEPATIER was evaluated in an open-label clinical study in 22 paediatric subjects 12 years to less than 18 years of age who received ZEPATIER for 12 weeks. HCV GT1a infected subjects with one or more baseline NS5A resistance-associated substitutions were excluded from study participation.

In this study, treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced subjects 12 years to less than 18 years of  age with genotype 1 or 4 CHC, without cirrhosis, were treated with ZEPATIER for 12 weeks. The median age was 13.5 years (range: 12 to 17); 50 % were female; 95 % were White; the weight range was 28.1 kg to 96.5 kg; 95.5 % had genotype 1 and 4.5 % had genotype 4; 63.6 % were treatment-naïve, 36.4 % were treatment-experienced; 45.5 % had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than 800,000 IU/mL. The overall SVR12 rate was 100 % (22/22). The saf ety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy observed in this study were comparable to those observed in adults.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Following administration of elbasvir/grazoprevir to HCV-infected subjects, elbasvir peak plasma concentrations occur at a median Tmax of 3 hours (range of 3 to 6 hours); grazoprevir peak plasma concentrations occur at a median Tmax of 2 hours (range of 30 minutes to 3 hours). For elbasvir, the absolute bioavailability is estimated to be 32%. For grazoprevir, the absolute bioavailability after a 200 mg single dose ranged from 15 -27% and after multiple 200 mg doses ranged from 20 -40%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of  elbasvir/grazoprevir with a highfat (900 kcal, 500 kcal f rom fat) meal to healthy subjects resulted in decreases in elbasvir AUC 0-inf and Cmax of approximately 11 % and 15 %, respectively, and increases in grazoprevir AUC0-inf and Cmax of approximately 1.5-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively. These differences in elbasvir and grazoprevir exposure are not clinically relevant; therefore, elbasvir/grazoprevir may be taken without regard to food.

Elbasvir pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy subjects and HCV-infected subjects. Grazoprevir oral exposures are approximately 2-fold greater in HCV-infected subjects as compared to healthy subjects. Based on the population pharmacokinetic modeling in non-cirrhotic, HCV-infected subjects, the geometric mean steady-state elbasvir AUC0-24 and Cmax  at 50 mg were 2,180 nM·hr and 137 nM, respectively, and the geometric mean steady-state grazoprevir AUC0-24 and Cmax  at 100 mg were 1,860 nM·hr and 220 nM, respectively. Following once daily administration of elbasvir/grazoprevir to HCV-infected subjects, elbasvir and grazoprevir reached steady state within approximately 6 days.

## Distribution

Elbasvir and grazoprevir are extensively bound (&gt; 99.9 % and 98.8 %, respectively) to human plasma proteins. Both elbasvir and grazoprevir bind to human serum albumin and /uniF061 1-acid glycoprotein. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

## Elimination

The geometric mean apparent terminal half-life (% geometric mean coefficient of variation) is approximately 24 (24 %) hours at 50 mg elbasvir and approximately 31 (34 %) hours at 100 mg grazoprevir in HCV-infected subjects.

## Metabolism

Elbasvir and grazoprevir are partially eliminated by oxidative metabolism, primarily by CYP3A. No circulating metabolites of either elbasvir or grazoprevir were detected in human plasma.

## Excretion

The primary route of elimination of elbasvir and grazoprevir is through f aeces with almost all (&gt; 90 %) of the radiolabeled dose recovered in f aeces compared to &lt; 1 % in urine.

## Linearity/non-linearity

Elbasvir pharmacokinetics were approximately dose-proportional over the range of 5-100 mg once daily. Grazoprevir pharmacokinetics increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner over the range of 10-800 mg once daily in HCV-infected subjects.

## Pharmacokinetics in special populations

## Renal impairment

In non-HCV-infected subjects with severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) who were not on dialysis, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUC values were increased by 86 % and 65 %, respectively, compared to non-HCV-infected subjects with normal renal function (eGFR &gt; 80 mL/min/1.73 m2). In non-HCV-infected subjects with dialysis-dependent, severe renal impairment, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUC values were unchanged compared to subjects with normal renal function. Concentrations of elbasvir were not quantif iable in the dialysate samples. Less than 0.5 % of grazoprevir was recovered in dialysate over a 4-hour dialysis session.

In population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUCs were 25 % and 10 % higher, respectively, in dialysis-dependent patients and 46 % and 40 % higher,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

respectively, in non-dialysis-dependent patients with severe renal impairment compared to elbasvir and grazoprevir AUC in patients without severe renal impairment.

## Hepatic impairment

In  non-HCV-infected  subjects  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  A [CP-A],  score  of   5-6), elbasvir  AUC0-inf was  decreased  by  40%  and  grazoprevir  steady-state  AUC0-24  was  increased  70 % compared to matched healthy subjects.

In non-HCV-infected subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B [CP-B], score of 7-9), and  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  C  [CP-C],  score  of   10-15)  elbasvir  AUC  decreased  by 28 %  and  12%,  respectively,  while  the  grazoprevir  steady-state  AUC 0-24 was  increased  5-f old  and 12-fold respectively, compared to matched healthy subjects (see sections 4.2 and 4.3).

Population PK analyses of HCV-infected patients in Phase 2 and 3 studies demonstrated that grazoprevir steady-state AUC0-24 increased by approximately 65 % in HCV-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis (all with CP-A) compared to HCV-infected non-cirrhotic patients, while elbasvir steady-state AUC was similar (see section 4.2).

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of elbasvir and grazoprevir have been evaluated in 22 paediatric subjects 12 years of age and older who received a daily dose of ZEPATIER (50 mg elbasvir/100 mg grazoprevir). Elbasvir and grazoprevir exposures in paediatric subjects were comparable to those observed in adults.

In paediatric subjects 12 years of age and older, the geometric mean steady-state elbasvir AUC0-24 and Cmax at 50 mg were 2,410 nM·hr and 190 nM, respectively, and the geometric mean steady-state grazoprevir AUC0-24 and Cmax at 100 mg were 1,450 nM·hr and 246 nM, respectively.

## Elderly

In population pharmacokinetic analyses, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUCs are estimated to be 16 % and 45 % higher, respectively, in subjects ≥ 65 years of age compared to subjects less than 65 years of age. These changes are not clinically relevant; therefore, no dose adjustment of elbasvir/grazoprevir is recommended based on age (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Gender

In population pharmacokinetic analyses, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUCs are estimated to be 50 % and 30 % higher, respectively, in females compared to males. These changes are not clinically relevant; therefore, no dose adjustment of elbasvir/grazoprevir is recommended based on sex (see section 4.4).

## Weight/BMI

In population pharmacokinetic analyses, there was no effect of weight on elbasvir pharmacokinetics. Grazoprevir AUC is estimated to be 15 % higher in a 53 kg subject compared to a 77 kg subject. This change is not clinically relevant for grazoprevir. Theref ore, no dose adjustment of elbasvir/grazoprevir is recommended based on weight/BMI (see section 4.4).

## Race/Ethnicity

In population pharmacokinetic analyses, elbasvir and grazoprevir AUCs are estimated to be 15 % and 50 % higher, respectively, for Asians compared to Whites. Population pharmacokinetics estimates of exposure of elbasvir and grazoprevir were comparable between Whites and Black/African Americans. These changes are not clinically relevant; therefore, no dose adjustment of elbasvir/grazoprevir is recommended based on race/ethnicity (see section 4.4).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development with grazoprevir or elbasvir. Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. Carcinogenicity studies for grazoprevir and elbasvir have not been conducted.

## Embryo fetal and post natal development

## Elbasvir

Elbasvir was given to rats and rabbits without eliciting adverse eff ects on embryof etal or post natal development at up to the highest doses tested (approximately 9- and 17-fold above human exposure in rats and rabbits, respectively). Elbasvir has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and rabbits. Elbasvir was excreted into the milk of lactating rats with concentrations 4-fold that of the maternal plasma concentrations.

## Grazoprevir

Grazoprevir was given to rats and rabbits without eliciting adverse eff ects on embryofetal or post natal development at up to highest doses tested (approximately 79- and 39-fold above human exposure in rats and rabbits, respectively). Grazoprevir has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and rabbits. Grazoprevir was excreted into the milk of lactating rats with concentrations &lt; 1-fold of the maternal plasma concentrations.

## 1. What ZEPATIER is and what it is used for

## What ZEPATIER is

ZEPATIER is an antiviral medicine that contains the active substances elbasvir and grazoprevir.

## What ZEPATIER is used for

ZEPATIER is used to treat long-term hepatitis C infection in adults and children aged 12 years and older who weigh at least 30 kilograms.

## How ZEPATIER works

Hepatitis C is a virus that infects the liver. The active substances in the medicine work together by blocking two different proteins that the hepatitis C virus needs to grow and reproduce. This allows the infection to be permanently removed from the body.

ZEPATIER is sometimes taken with another medicine, ribavirin.

It is very important that you also read the leaflets for the other medicines that you will be taking with ZEPATIER. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## 2. What you need to know before you take ZEPATIER

## Do not take ZEPATIER if :

- you are allergic to elbasvir, grazoprevir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- you have certain moderate or severe liver problems
- you are taking any of the following medicines:
- o rif ampicin, usually given f or tuberculosis
- o HIV protease inhibitors such as atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir
- o efavirenz or etravirine f or HIV
- o elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide f or HIV

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o ciclosporin to stop organ transplant rejection or to treat serious inf lammatory illnesses of eyes, kidney, joints or skin
- o bosentan for pulmonary arterial hypertension
- o carbamazepine or phenytoin, mainly used for epilepsy and seizures
