1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

3  SmPC (Summary of Product Characteristics), Annex II, Labelling, PL (Package Leaflet).

A literature review was performed and no significant new efficacy or effectiveness information was identified that could possibly alter the effectivess of this agent for the authorized indications and treatment regimen. The beneficial effect of clopidogrel remains in line with that of the originator product, and is considered positive. The CHMP therefore recommended that the Marketing Authorisation for Grepid can be renewed with unlimited validity. |
