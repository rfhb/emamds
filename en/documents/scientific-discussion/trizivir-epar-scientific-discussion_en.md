## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of Trizivir. For information on changes after approval please refer to module 8.

## 1. Introduction

Trizivir is a fixed dose combination tablet containing 300 mg abacavir (as abacavir sulphate), 150 mg lamivudine  and  300 mg  zidovudine  in  each  tablet  for  the  treatment  of  Human  Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults. Trizivir is a new combination of previously known active substances. Zidovudine  300 mg  tablets  were  first  registered  as  Retrovir  in  1995  via  the  Mutual  Recognition procedure. Lamivudine 150 mg tablets (Epivir) were registered via the Centralised procedure in 1996, and  a  combination  tablet  (Combivir)  consisting  of  lamivudine  150 mg  and  zidovudine  300 mg  was approved  via  the  Centralised  procedure  in  March  1998.  Finally,  abacavir  300 mg  tablets  were approved via the Centralised procedure in July 1999 as Ziagen tablets. Retrovir, Epivir, Combivir and Ziagen are all indicated in antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV infection.

Because of the high pill burden associated with one of the current standard triple therapy regimens including  a  protease  inhibitor  (PI),  which  may  eventually  lead  to  non-adherence  to  treatment,  other potent antiretroviral regimens without a PI could be an alternative option for treatment of HIV infected patients.  Adherence  of  patients  is  indeed  a  crucial  point,  as  non-adherence  to  treatment  has  been identified  as  a  predictive  factor  of  failure  to  achieve  viral  suppression.  A  triple  nucleoside  therapy could provide a simpler treatment for the patient to take long term in terms of adherence and dosing regimen  (pill  burden,  rhythm  of  administration,  impact  of  food,  pharmacokinetic  interactions).  In addition,  triple  nucleoside  therapy  may  provide  an  effective  therapeutic  option  preserving  protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in future treatment strategies.

The recommended dose of Trizivir in adults is one tablet twice daily.

Currently, insufficient data are available to recommend the use of Trizivir in children or adolescents.

## 2. Chemical, pharmaceutical aspects

## Composition

The  film-coated  tablet  is  a  conventional  immediate  release  formulation  containing  the  three  active substances together with microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycollate Type A and magnesium stearate as excipients. The film-coating aqueous suspension contains Opadry Green.

The film-coated tablets are packaged in high-density polyethylene bottles with a child-resistant closure or in a PVC/Aclar blister pack with push-through foil lidding.

Tablets identical to the commercial product were used in the clinical trials.

## Active substance

The three active substances have been already authorised as active ingredients of other dosage-forms, and  are  already  on  the  EU  market  with  the  same  specifications  and  methods  of  synthesis.  The compatibility between these three active substances has been correctly studied.

The active substance abacavir sulphate is a carbocyclic nucleoside derivative synthesised via a well controlled, reproducible, high yielding, three stage process which has been adequately described. The active substance specification was justified with regard to satisfactory purity (assay &amp; impurity levels) and  in  general  the  test  methods  and  qualitative  limits  applied  are  considered  to  provide  adequate control  of  the  quality  of  the  active  substance.  The  batch  analytical  data  presented  confirmed reproducible and consistent synthesis, and the data were in agreement with the proposed specification. Control methods were adequately described and are generally well validated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lamivudine is (2R, cis)-4-amino-1-(2hydroxymethyl 1,3-oxathiolan-5S-yl)-(1H)-pyrimidin2-one and has not yet been described in any pharmacopoeia. The (-) enantiomer of lamivudine, which was shown to  be  less  cytotoxic  than  the  (+)  enantiomer  or  the  racemate  is  selected  for  the  manufacture  of  the finished  medicinal  product.  Two  polymorphic  forms  I  (partial  hydrate)  and  II  were  identified. Manufacture  of  lamivudine  involves  a  four-step  synthesis,  which  includes  isolation  of  the  desired stable crystalline form (II). Evidence of structure was appropriate and complete, and an identification test  ensures  that  only  form  II  is  used  for  the  manufacture  of  the  finished  product.  Test  results  for production  batches  show  that  values  for  each  of  the  single  related  impurities  and  total  related impurities are nearly constant. The validation of the test methods used (determination of contents for lamivudine,  enantiomer  and  impurities,  and  lamivudine  identification)  was  considered  sufficiently documented.

Zidovudine (3'azido-3'deoxythymidine) is controlled according to the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) requirements.

For abacavir sulfate a retest period of 2 years when stored below 30°C is approved.

For lamivudine a retest period of 3 years when stored between 2°C - 30°C is approved.

For zidovudine a retest period of 3 years when stored up to 50°C is approved.

## Other ingredients

The excipients selected for Trizivir are microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycollate Type A, magnesium stearate and Opadry film-coating concentrate. All the ingredients are European Pharmacopoeial grade with the exception of Opadry Green for which the qualitative and quantitative composition has been adequately provided.

## Product development and finished product

Pharmaceutical development and evaluation of Trizivir has been relatively straightforward, considering the fact that similar formulations with the active substances mentioned above are already authorised in the EU.

The main development objective was to design a conventional immediate release formulation, able to deliver the three active ingredients in a form that is physically and chemically stable and is convenient for administration to facilitate patient compliance.

Direct compression was selected as the preferential method of manufacturing.

The  active  substances  have  the  same  quality  characteristics  as  those  common  to  the  single  entity products, commercially available.

The excipients used are the same as in the individual single entity tablet formulae, excluding PVP, a component  used  as  binder  in  the  wet  granulation  manufacturing  process  for  Retrovir.  The  use  of colloidal silicone as inert glidant (used in the direct compression for Ziagen) was not required in the combination tablet formula.

The particle size of the product blend, as derived from the particle sizes of the 4 main constituents (3 active  ingredients  and  microcrystalline  cellulose),  indicated  that  acceptable  blend  uniformity  of cores, dissolution and assay were obtained.

The combination tablet has been designed to exhibit rapid dissolution while also being bioequivalent to the single entity tablets. In general the dissolution profiles are very similar and the active substances are  almost  completely  released  from  the  combination  tablet  after  30  minutes.  The  dissolution  data provided for release and stability batches are consistent, showing systematically individual values of more than 85% after 30 minutes.

In addition the results of the bioequivalence study prove that each active substance in the combination tablet is bioequivalent to its relevant single entity tablet (see clinical assessment report).

## Stability of the Product

Three  batches  (two  of  40.5  kg  and  one  of  405  kg)  each  in  two  different  packaging  configurations (PVC/Aclar and HDPE bottles) have been monitored for long term stability (12 months at 30°C/60% RH) and during accelerated conditions (6 months at 40°C/75% RH).

2/16

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The stability results gained show that the Trizivir tablets remained in conformity with the proposed end  of  shelf  life  specifications  and  remained  practically  unchanged  when  compared  to  the  initial quality  at  release  for  the  major  quality  parameters  investigated  (content,  dissolution,  appearance, moisture).

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable.

## 3. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

The  CPMP  Note  for  Guidance  on  Fixed  Combination  Medicinal  Products  (CPMP/EWP/240/95) allows  for  the  absence  of  new  data  from  non-clinical  investigations  on  the  combination  when extensive clinical experience with the combination exists.  The CPMP concluded that no toxicological investigations with the triple combination, Trizivir were necessary. This decision was taken, firstly, as the  triple  combination  merely  represents  the  physical  combination  of  two  centrally  authorized medicinal products prescribed together and with substantial reassurance from the clinical use of the individual  products  used  in  combination.  Secondly,  toxicity  testing  would  require  usage  of  animals unjustified by the low value of information that would be generated, in the light of extensive clinical experience.

In  summary,  Abacavir,  lamivudine  and  zidovudine  are  nucleoside  analogue  reverse  transcriptase inhibitors  with  potent  anti-HIV  activity.  No  antagonistic  antiviral  activity  is  expected  for  the combination of all three compounds. An extensive programme of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion studies has been carried out with abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine in the species of animals used in the toxicity studies. In general, the similarity between the kinetics and metabolism of the three compounds in man and that defined in the animal species used for toxicology indicates that the  species used were appropriate for predicting the safety of the compounds and their metabolites. Nonclinical  interaction  studies  showed  that  there  is  a  very  low  potential  for  pharmacokinetic  and metabolic  interactions  between  lamivudine  and  zidovudine  and  between  abacavir  and  other  drugs. Clinical  data  indicate  the  lack  of  a  clinically  relevant  interaction  between  abacavir,  lamivudine  and zidovudine administered together.

Single  dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  mice  indicate  that  all  three  compounds  have  a  low  acute toxicity  following  oral  or  intravenous  administration.  Repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  identified  the haemopoietic system as the most sensitive target organ for all three compounds. Other potential target organs included the liver and testis for abacavir, and the gastrointestinal tract for lamivudine.

Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rats, but not rabbits, showed that the administration of abacavir or zidovudine at maternally toxic doses resulted in fetal abnormalities. All three  compounds  showed  some  evidence  of  early  embryofoetal  toxicity.  In  view  of  this,  the  triple combination tablet is not recommended for use in pregnancy.

Lamivudine shows activity in genetic toxicity tests in  vitro and  abacavir  and  zidovudine  in  tests in vitro and in  vivo .  This  activity  is  consistent  with  other  marketed  nucleoside  analogues  and  is considered to reflect the loss of selectivity  for  viral  versus  mammalian  inhibition  of  DNA polymerisation at high (toxic) concentrations.

In  long-term  carcinogenicity  studies,  lamivudine  showed  no  evidence  of  carcinogenic  potential.  In similar  studies  with  zidovudine,  treatment-related  effects  were  limited  to  late-appearing  vaginal neoplasms. It is considered that these tumours were the result of chronic local exposure of the vaginal epithelium to high concentrations of zidovudine in the urine. Metabolic, biological and physiological differences between rodents and humans suggest that a similar carcinogenic risk in humans is unlikely. Carcinogenicity studies with abacavir are in progress.

## 4. Clinical aspects

No  specific  clinical  efficacy  studies  have  been  performed  with  the  fixed  dose  combination  tablet, although reference is made to the clinical studies, which are part of the marketing authorisation for

3/16

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

abacavir. Those studies particularly focus on the relevant triple combination of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine in the same doses as for the fixed combination (Trizivir) and have been reviewed by the CPMP  during  the  assessment  of  Trizivir.  In  addition,  the  clinical  submission  comprises pharmacokinetic studies performed with the fixed dose combination tablet (Trizivir) and bioequivalence  studies  with  the  fixed  combination  tablet  against  single  components  abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine.

## The approved indication is:

'Trizivir is indicated for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected adults. This fixed  combination  replaces  the  three  components  (abacavir,  lamivudine  and  zidovudine)  used separately  in  similar  dosages.  The  choice  of  this  fixed  combination  should  be  based  not  only  on potential  adherence  criteria,  but  also  mainly  on-expected  efficacy  and  risk  related  to  the  three nucleoside analogues.

The  demonstration  of  the  benefit  of  Trizivir  is  mainly  based  on  results  of  studies  performed  in treatment naive patients or moderately antiretroviral experienced patients with non-advanced disease. In  patients  with  high  viral  load  (&gt;100,000  copies/ml)  choice  of  therapy  needs  special  consideration (see 5.1. Pharmacodynamic properties)'.

## Clinical Pharmacology

## Pharmacodynamics

Zidovudine, lamivudine and abacavir are potent selective inhibitors of HIV-1 and HIV-2.

The mutation pattern of these three NRTI is well identified in vitro .

Substantial genotyping and phenotyping analysis have been performed in clinical trials with patients receiving  the  3  NRTI  in  several  studies,  through  the  development  program  of  abacavir.  Resistance data  obtained  from  naive  patients  receiving  first  line  treatment  with  ABC+ZDV+3TC  and  in virological  failure,  are  highly  suggestive  of  the  main  role  of  M184V,  the  3TC  associated  mutation (approximately 70%) in viral rebound.

According to data from intensification  therapy with abacavir in NRTI experienced  patients (mainly ZDV+3TC),  M184V  alone  does  not  seem  to  have  any  impact  on  response  to  an  antiretroviral combination  therapy  including  ABC.  However,  this  response  is  significantly  decreased  in  patients with viruses harbouring one or more NRTI specific mutations (including M184V). Indeed correlation between genotypes and phenotypes demonstrates that when M184V is present with NRTI associated mutation resistance (frequent in clinical practice), the virus sensitivity to ABC is reduced in more than 50% of patients.

Consequently, virological data from clinical studies favour early use of the NRTI triple combination therapy.

## Pharmacokinetics

## Abacavir Disposition Summary

Abacavir  has  excellent  bioavailability  (~83%)  with  rapid  absorption.  The  apparent  volume  of distribution after intravenous administration is approximately 0.8 l/kg. Binding to plasma proteins is moderate (~ 49%). Abacavir is extensively metabolised with less than 2% excreted unchanged in the urine. Metabolism is primarily via two pathways, UDP-glucuronyl transferase and alcohol dehydrogenase resulting in the 5'-glucuronide and the 5'-carboxylic acid which account for about 66% of the metabolites in the urine. The mean plasma elimination half-life of abacavir is about 1.5 hours.

## Lamivudine Disposition Summary

Lamivudine  absorption  is  rapid  and  the  bioavailability  of  oral  lamivudine  in  adults  is  normally between  80  and  85%.  The  apparent  volume  of  distribution  after  intravenous  administration  is approximately  1.3  l/kg.  Binding  of  lamivudine  to  human  plasma  proteins  is  low  (&lt;36%  to  serum albumin in vitro ). The observed elimination half-life is 5 to 7 hours. The mean systemic clearance of lamivudine  is  approximately  0.32  l/h/kg,  with  predominantly  renal  clearance  (&gt;70%  of  unchanged drug)  via  glomerular  filtration  and  active  tubular  secretion.  Hepatic  metabolism  of  lamivudine  is limited (5-10%).

4/16

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Zidovudine Disposition Summary

Zidovudine  absorption  is  rapid  with  a  bioavailability  of  60-70%.  After  intravenous  zidovudine administration,  the  mean  terminal  plasma  half-life  is  1.1  hours,  the  mean  systemic  clearance  is 27.1 ml/min/kg  (or  1.6 l/h/kg)  and  the  apparent  volume  of  distribution  is  1.6 l/kg.  Plasma  protein binding is  low  (34  to  38%).  Renal  clearance  of  zidovudine  exceeds  creatinine  clearance,  indicating that active tubular secretion occurs. The inactive 5'-glucuronide of zidovudine is the major metabolite in both plasma and urine, accounting for approximately 50-80% of the administered dose eliminated by  renal  excretion.  3'-amino-3'-deoxythymidine  (AMT)  has  been  identified  as  a  metabolite  of zidovudine following intravenous dosing.

## Concurrent Administration of Abacavir, Lamivudine and Zidovudine

There have been several studies of the concurrent administration of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine in man.

The pharmacokinetics of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine as single doses administered alone or concurrently has been studied in 15 HIV infected subjects (CNAA1002).

This was a 7-period, crossover, randomized study. The pharmacokinetics of zidovudine, lamivudine and  abacavir  were  assessed  after  single  administration  of  drugs,  alone  or  2  drugs  combined  or coadministration  of  the  3  drugs.  It  was  demonstrated  that  abacavir  pharmacokinetics  remained unchanged  when  coadministered  with  either  zidovudine,  or  lamivudine  or  both.  Zidovudine  and lamivudine  pharmacokinetics  remained  unchanged  when  coadministered.  In  contrast  addition  of abacavir led to slight alteration of zidovudine and lamivudine concentrations:

decrease in ZDV Cmax (-20%) and increase in GZDV AUC (+40%)

decrease in lamivudine Cmax (-35%) and AUC (-15%)

This was considered to be related to interaction at absorption sites and renal excretion and not to be clinically significant.

The  lack  of  interaction  between  abacavir  and  zidovudine  was  also  observed  in  multiple-dose  trials (CNAA2001 and  CNAB2002,  submitted  in  the  abacavir  dossier)  indicating  the  lack  of  interaction between abacavir and compounds that are metabolised by glucuronidation via UDPglucuronyltransferase. The lack of a clinically significant interaction between abacavir and lamivudine is consistent with their different routes of elimination.

Given the results  of  these  investigations  and  based  on  the  pharmacokinetic  disposition  of  abacavir, lamivudine,  and  zidovudine,  no  dosage  adjustment  is  necessary  when  the  three  compounds  are administered in combination.

## Drug Interactions

As the triple combination tablet contains abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine, any interactions that have been identified with these agents individually may occur, as detailed in the individual SPCs for Ziagen,  Epivir,  and  Retrovir.  A  recent  study  has  investigated  the  potential  interaction  between abacavir  and  methadone  (CNAA1012).  Co-administration  of  600 mg  abacavir  twice  daily  and methadone showed a 35% reduction in abacavir Cmax and a 1 hour delay, but AUC was unchanged. The  changes  in  abacavir  pharmacokinetics  are  not  considered  clinically  relevant.  In  this  study, abacavir increased methadone systemic clearance by a median of 22%. This change is not considered clinically relevant for the majority of patients, however occasionally methadone dose re-titration may be required. Based on this study, a statement has been added to section 4.5 of the SPC for the triple combination tablet.

## Bioequivalence Studies

These studies were performed according to internationally accepted guidelines.

Bioequivalence of a combined formulated tablet compared to Epivir and Retrovir administered concurrently and the effect of food on absorption (Study Protocol Number NZTA1001).

5/16

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  assess:  (1)  the  bioequivalence  of  a  single  tablet  composed  of lamivudine  150 mg  and  zidovudine  300 mg  (Combivir)  and  the  marketed  tablets  EPIVIR  150 mg (lamivudine) and RETROVIR 300 mg (zidovudine), (2) the effect of food on the absorption of the new combination formulation. This was a single-centre, open-label, randomized, three-way cross-over study in 24 healthy male and female subjects between the ages of 19 and 36 years. Each subject was assigned  to  receive  one  of  the  following  three  treatments  during  each  study  period,  and  all  three treatments during the study, in a randomized fashion:

- treatment A: lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg as a combined formulation following an overnight fast,
- treatment B: EPIVIR 150 mg tablet + RETROVIR 300 mg tablet swallowed simultaneously and following an overnight fast,
- treatment C: lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg as a combined formulation 5 minutes following a standardised breakfast.

Serial  blood  samples  were  obtained  during  each  treatment  period  for  evaluation  of  lamivudine  and zidovudine AUC, Cmax and tmax. Plasma samples were assayed for lamivudine by a validated HPLCUV method and for zidovudine by a validated RIA method.

The  mean ± SD  (AUC  and  Cmax)  and  median  and  range  (tmax)  for  lamivudine  and  zidovudine  are summarized in the following tables:

## lamivudine

| Parameter          | Treatment A      | Treatment B     | Treatment C      |
|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| C max (ng/ml)      | 1620.3 ± 519.6   | 1742.2 ± 616.3  | 1367.6 ± 403.9   |
| AUC 0- ∞ (ng.h/ml) | 6137.6 ± 1234.0  | 6374.2 ± 1607.4 | 6035.4 ± 1160.6  |
| t max (h)          | 0.75 (0.5 - 2.0) | 1.0 (0.5 - 2.0) | 1.5 (0.5 - 4.05) |

## zidovudine

| Parameter          | Treatment A      | Treatment B      | Treatment C      |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| C max (ng/ml)      | 2008.3 ± 809.9   | 1992.6 ± 636.1   | 1139.2 ± 587.8   |
| AUC 0- ∞ (ng.h/ml) | 2398.2 ± 705.8   | 2390.9 ± 553.1   | 2147.6 ± 664.6   |
| t max (h)          | 0.5 (0.25 - 2.0) | 0.5 (0.25 - 2.0) | 1.0 (0.25 - 2.0) |

The 90% CI for AUC and Cmax were as follows:

## lamivudine

| Parameter   | A vs B      | C vs A      |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| C max       | 0.84 - 1.06 | 0.76 - 0.96 |
| AUC         | 0.92 - 1.02 | 0.94 - 1.04 |

## zidovudine

| Parameter   | A vs B      | C vs A      |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| C max       | 0.82 - 1.15 | 0.46 - 0.65 |
| AUC         | 0.91 - 1.07 | 0.83 - 0.97 |

## The results of these studies show that:

- the combined lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg tablet is bioequivalent to the EPIVIR 150 mg tablet + RETROVIR 300 mg tablets administered simultaneously to fasting volunteers,
- the extent of absorption of lamivudine and zidovudine is unchanged but the rate of absorption is slowed when the lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg combined formulation is administered with food,

6/16

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- the combined lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg tablet may be administered with or without food as there was no significant difference in extent of absorption (AUC) following a meal and no clinical significance of the slowed absorption (Cmax, tmax) is expected.

An  evaluation  of the bioequivalence of  a  combined  formulated  tablet  (300/150/300  mg abacavir/lamivudine/ zidovudine) compared  to Ziagen (abacavir) 300 mg  tablet, Epivir (lamivudine) 150 mg tablet, and Retrovir (zidovudine) 300 mg tablet administered concurrently and the effect of food on absorption in healthy volunteers (Protocol No. AZL10001).

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  demonstrate  bioequivalence  between  a  single  tablet composed  of  300  mg  abacavir,  150  mg  lamivudine  and  300  mg  zidovudine  (Trizivir)  versus  the reference formulations ZIAGEN (abacavir) 300 mg tablet, EPIVIR (lamivudine) 150 mg tablet and RETROVIR  (zidovudine)  300  mg  tablet  swallowed  sequentially.  A  secondary  objective  was  to evaluate the effect of food on the absorption of the new combination formulation. This was a singlecentre, open-label, randomized, three-way cross-over study in 24 healthy subjects. Each subject was assigned  to  receive  one  of  the  following  three  treatments  during  each  study  period,  and  all  three treatments during the study, in a randomized fashion:

treatment A: triple combination tablet containing abacavir 300 mg, overnight fast,

```
lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg following an treatment B: ZIAGEN (abacavir) 300 mg tablet, EPIVIR (lamivudine) 150 mg tablet and RETROVIR (zidovudine) 300 mg tablet swallowed sequentially and following an overnight fast, treatment C: triple combination tablet containing abacavir 300 mg, lamivudine 150 mg and zidovudine 300 mg 5 minutes following a standardised (high fat)  breakfast.
```

Serial  blood  samples  were  obtained  during  each  treatment  period  for  evaluation  of  abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine AUC, Cmax and tmax. Plasma samples were assayed for abacavir by HPLCUV, and for lamivudine and zidovudine by LC-MS-MS.

The mean ± SD (median and range for tmax) AUC and Cmax values are summarized in the tables below:

2.        Administration  of  the  abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine  combination  tablet  with  food  results  in slightly lower Cmax and slightly longer tmax values; these changes are not clinically relevant, thus the  abacavir/lamivudine/  zidovudine  combination  tablet  may  be  administered  without  food restrictions.

Steady-state pharmacokinetics of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine following administration of  a  combined  formulated  tablet  (300/150/300 mg  abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine)  versus Ziagen (abacavir) (300 mg tablet) and Combivir (150/300 mg lamivudine/zidovudine) administered in subjects with HIV-1 infection (Protocol no. AZL10002).

The  objectives  of  the  study  were  to  examine  the  pharmacokinetics  of  abacavir,  lamivudine  and zidovudine  at  steady-state  following  administration  of  a  combination  tablet  composed  of  300 mg abacavir,  150 mg  lamivudine  and  300 mg  zidovudine  (Trizivir)  versus  treatment  with  300 mg ZIAGEN (abacavir) tablets and COMBIVIR (lamivudine 150 mg, zidovudine 300 mg) tablets in HIV infected patients. This was an open-label, multiple dose, and descriptive study. Twelve subjects were enrolled in the study. They all received both treatments:

treatment A: current treatment including COMBIVIR and ZIAGEN, followed by

treatment B: triple combination tablet bid for at least 7 days.

Steady-state  pharmacokinetic  evaluations  were  obtained  during  each  treatment.  Abacavir  serum concentrations  were  determined  using  a  validated  HPLC-UV  method.  Lamivudine  and  zidovudine serum concentrations were determined by HPLC-MS-MS.

The results are summarized in the following tables (mean ± SD for AUCss, Cmaxss and t1/2, median and range for tmaxss ):

Steady-state  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  abacavir,  lamivudine  and  zidovudine  were  similar following multiple dose administration of the reference formulations  COMBIVIR/ZIAGEN, administered simultaneously, and the administration of the triple combination product.

Based on the results of these three studies it can be concluded that:

- -the abacavir (300 mg)/lamivudine (150 mg)/zidovudine (300 mg) combination tablet (Trizivir) is bioequivalent to the reference formulations ZIAGEN 300 mg tablets, EPIVIR 150 mg tablets and RETROVIR 300 mg tablets administered simultaneously,
- -administration  of  the  abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine  combination  tablet  with  food  results  in slightly lower Cmax and slightly longer tmax values; these changes are not clinically relevant and the combination tablet can therefore be administered without food restrictions,
- -steady-state-plasma concentrations of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine are similar following  multiple  dose  administration  of  the  combination  product  compared  to  the  multiple dose  administration  of  ZIAGEN  (abacavir  300 mg)  and  COMBIVIR  (lamivudine  150 mg, zidovudine 300 mg) tablets in 12 patients with HIV-1 infection.

## Clinical Efficacy

No  specific  clinical  efficacy  studies  have  been  performed  with  the  fixed  dose  combination  tablet, although reference is  made to the clinical  studies  which  are  part  of  the  marketing  authorisation  for abacavir. Those studies particularly focus on the relevant triple combination of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine in the same doses as for the fixed combination (Trizivir) and have been reviewed by the CPMP  during  the  assessment  of  Trizivir.  In  addition,  the  clinical  submission  comprises pharmacokinetic studies performed with the fixed dose combination tablet (Trizivir) and bioequivalence  studies  with  the  fixed  combination  tablet  against  single  components  abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine.

The  approved  indication  is:    'Trizivir  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  Human  Immunodeficiency Virus  (HIV)  infected  adults.  This  fixed  combination  replaces  the  three  components  (abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine) used separately in similar dosages. The choice of this fixed combination should  be  based  not  only  on  potential  adherence  criteria,  but  mainly  on  expected  efficacy  and  risk related to the three nucleoside analogues.

The  demonstration  of  the  benefit  of  Trizivir  is  mainly  based  on  results  of  studies  performed  in treatment naive patients or moderately antiretroviral experienced patients with non-advanced disease. In  patients  with  high  viral  load  (&gt;100,000 copies/ml)  choice  of  therapy  needs  special  consideration (see 5.1. Pharmacodynamic properties)'.

Data from a total of 9 clinical studies using the combination of abacavir, zidovudine and lamivudine and supportive of the triple combination tablet are available; Combivir was used in six of the studies. Studies CNAAB3003, CNAAB3005 and CNAB3002 are considered pivotal to the submission whilst the remainder of the studies are considered supportive. The studies were conducted in Europe, North

## Dose-response studies and Main Clinical studies

## Main studies

## Antiretroviral naive patients

The demonstration of the antiviral activity of the triple combination (abacavir+zidovudine+lamivudine) has been clearly established through the development program of abacavir. The CPMP has previously concluded on a potent and sustained antiviral activity of abacavir in combination with zidovudine and lamivudine.

This  conclusion  has  been  mainly  drawn  from  results  of  two  pivotal  studies performed  in  naive patients (CNAAB 3003 and CNAAB 3005).

## CNAAB 3003

In  this  study  patients  were  randomized  in  a  double-blinded  way  into  2  treatment  arms,  either ABC/3TC/ZDV or ABC placebo/3TC/ZDV, to compare safety and efficacy. Superiority of the triple combination was shown in terms of durability of the plasma HIV RNA response following 48 weeks of treatment using the Kaplan-Meier methodology (74% vs. 31% respectively remained event free).

Due to the fact that change to open label ABC was not analysed similarly in the 2 groups, no clear conclusions can be drawn from the ITT, switch=failure analysis. The switch included analysis shows similar reductions in HIV RNA levels and a similar CD4 cell response at week 48 for those in the 3TC/ZDV  arm  who  added  ABC  from  week  16  onwards  and  those originally assigned to ABC/3TC/ZDV,  showing  that  the  response  is  not  impacted  by  the  delay  in  addition  of  ABC. According to results expressed by baseline viral load strata, the impact on viral load was limited in patients with viral load &gt; 5 log copies/ml.

An open label triple combination arm was also added during the study period

## CNAAB 3005

This  study  is  of  particular  interest  since  it  compares  the  triple  NRTI  combination  with  an  HAART therapy including indinavir (a PI regimen).

This phase III, randomized, double blind, parallel group study performed in 562 patients,  compared the antiviral effect at 24 and 48 weeks of ABC+ZDV+3TC versus IDV+ZDV+3TC.

- -At 24 weeks, abacavir had a quite similar antiviral impact with indinavir (respectively for ABC and IDV percentage of patients with undetectable viral load: ITT: 66% versus 65%;  as treated 85%  versus  86%/  and  viral  load  median  change  from  baseline  (-2.06  versus  -2.04  log copies/ml).
- -At  48  weeks,  the  antiviral  impact  of  these  two  combinations  was  of  the  same  magnitude (ITT missing=failure;  percentage  of  patients  with  undetectable  viral  load  47%  (ABC)  versus 49% (IDV); As treated population: 86% (ABC) versus 94%(IDV). This is also supported by the results expressed in terms of viral load median change from baseline (-2.04 (ABC) versus -2.02 log copies/ml (IDV) with a threshold limit at 400 copies/ml).

However, the impact of abacavir as compared to indinavir is lower in the subset of patients with high viral  load  at  baseline  (&gt;100  000  copies/ml)  and  when  using  the  ultrasensitive  method  with  lower detection threshold (&lt;50 copies/ml).

Moreover, although the confidence interval of the difference, in terms of percentage of patients with undetectable  viral  load  between  both  regimens,  was  in  accordance  with  the  initial  equivalence hypothesis (12%) for the ITT population, it was not the case for the 'as treated population' (both are required to demonstrate equivalence).

It  is  important  to  emphasise  that  the  interpretation  of  these  long-term  data  is  difficult  especially considering the particular design of this equivalence study allowing the possibility of switch. Indeed, patients  were  allowed  to  change  their  randomised  treatment  if  they  met  the  virological  endpoint, therefore 42% of patients discontinued study prior to week 48.

Hence,  no  formal  conclusion  could  be  drawn  at  long  term  on  the  equivalence  between  these  two regimens at 48 weeks. These findings are reflected in the pharmacodynamic section 5.1 of the SPC.

11/16

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The rate of clinical disease progression was also lower in the IDV containing arm compared to ABC (3%  vs.  6%).  Hence,  it  could  be  anticipated  that  the  durability  of  the  antiviral  effect  may  be  less marked than with a protease inhibitor regimen.

On the  other  hand,  the  criteria  of  adherence,  which  is  a  crucial  factor  when  considering  benefit  of treatment, should be taken into account when comparing these two regimens. It is worth noting that the triple NRTI combination given as TRIZIVIR will only require administration of one tablet twice daily without dietary requirement in comparison with HAART including indinavir, which involves a three times daily regimen, the intake of at least 8 tablets and dietary requirements.

## Antiretroviral experienced patients

Study  CNAB  3002  was  designed  as  a  double  blind  study  to  compare  ABC  versus  placebo  as  an intensification therapy on top of stable background therapy (SBG). A significantly higher proportion of subjects in the ABC-containing group achieved HIV RNA levels ≤ 400 copies/ml at week 48 (25% vs.5%,  respectively)  and  this  effect  was  independent  of  prior  3TC  use  and  duration  of  prior  ART. Although median plasma HIV-1 RNA AAUCMB over 48 weeks was significantly better in the ABCcontaining group (-0.49 vs.0.05 log10 copies/ml) this effect was modest. Median change of viral load from baseline was also modest (-0.64 log10 copies/ml) and not different from the control group (-0.59 log10 copies/ml). There was no difference in CD4 cell count response between the 2 groups.

Patients in this study were only moderately antiretroviral experienced (more than 90% having had less than 18 months prior ART of whom more than 75% only received a combination of 2 NRTI's) and had to be stable under their SBG for at least 16 weeks. Besides, virological response was better in patients with  a  low  viral  load.  Therefore,  results  of  this  study  do  not  allow  conclusions  to  be  drawn  for  a different population where ABC would serve as part of a salvage regimen

It is important to note that clinical studies are currently planned or ongoing with the triple combination tablet:

. AZL 30002: this  48  week, randomised, open label study performed in 200 patients is designed to compare the antiviral effect and the durability of response of patients with undetectable viral load (&lt;50 copies/ml)  who  remain  on  their  current  first  antiretroviral  combination  regimen  (2NRTI+1PI  or 2NRTI+1 NNRTI or 3NRTI) with those in patients who switch to the triple combination tablet.

. ESS 40005 :  this  open label study will enrol 230 patients who are currently receiving therapy with regimens  that  include  abacavir,  lamivudine  and  zidovudine  and  have  undetectable  viral  load  (&lt;400 copies/ml). Patients will be randomised to remain on abacavir plus Combivir (plus a PI or NNRTI if part of their baseline regimen) or receive the triple combination tablet.

. Simplified  Maintenance  therapy  (CH-96-06) :  the  study  protocol  is  being  amended  to  allow patients currently in the Combivir and abacavir arm to be treated with the triple combination tablet.

## Clinical studies in special populations

It  is  recommended  that  the  separate  preparations  of  abacavir,  lamivudine,  and  zidovudine  be administered rather than the triple combination tablet when any of the components are contraindicated or dose adjustments are necessary, as detailed in the individual Summaries of Product Characteristics (SPCs) for Ziagen, Epivir, and Retrovir.

## Renal dysfunction

Whilst no dosage adjustment of abacavir is necessary in patients with renal dysfunction, lamivudine and  zidovudine  concentrations  are  increased  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  due  to  decreased clearance. Therefore as dosage adjustments of these agents may be necessary it is recommended that separate preparations of abacavir, zidovudine and lamivudine be administered to patients with reduced renal function (creatinine clearance ≤ 50 ml/min).

## Hepatic dysfunction

There are no data available on the use of the triple combination tablet in hepatically impaired patients. Limited data in patients with cirrhosis suggest that accumulation of zidovudine may occur because of decreased glucuronidation. Data obtained in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment show that  lamivudine  pharmacokinetics  are  not  significantly  affected  by  hepatic  dysfunction.  Abacavir  is

12/16

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

primarily metabolised by the liver. Analysis of safety data supports the use of abacavir 300 mg twice a day in patients with mild impairment. However, as there is limited data available on administration of abacavir to hepatically impaired patients, the triple combination tablet is not recommended for use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.

## Supportive studies

## In treatment naive patients

- -The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  to  further  address  the  comparability  of  the  triple  NRTI combination  with  HAART  has  implemented CNAF3007 .  This  currently  ongoing  open  label study  performed  in  195  antiretroviral  naive  patients  aims  to  compare  Combivir+ABC  with Combivir  +  nelfinavir  (NFV).  Preliminary  16  weeks  results  of  this  study  are  in  favour  of  a comparability  of  both  regimens  in  terms  of  antiviral  impact  (ITTswitch  =  failure;  threshold 400/50 copies/ml: 65%/54% of patients had undetectable viral load in ABC versus 63%/51% in the NFV group). The median change from baseline was approximately - 2 log copies/ml in both groups Forty eight weeks data are awaited.
- -Study CNAF 3008 is an open label pilot study evaluating safety and efficacy of the quadruple regimen ABC/CBV/EFV. This quadruple combination therapy without protease inhibitor shows an  important  effect  on  viral  load  after  24  weeks  of  treatment.  However,  due  to  the  noncomparative design of the study and the small number of patients included, it will be difficult to draw substantial conclusions.
- -Study CNAB 2002 which  was  initially  a  blinded  dose-ranging  study,  amended  afterwards  to switch to open label ABC 300mg BID in combination with 3TC and ZDV, for a total duration of  120  weeks. The results of this study show that the durability of the antiviral effect of this ABC-containing  regimen  is  sustained  after  120  weeks  of  therapy,  despite  initially  having received ABC monotherapy.

## In treatment experienced patients

- -In the open label study CNAB 3009 the addition of ABC to previous limited ZDV/3TC use was evaluated.  Intensification  with  ABC  showed  an  extra  benefit  in  terms  of  viral  load  and  CD4 cells. However, patients had already a low baseline viral load and a high CD4 cell count before entering this study, which on one hand might underestimate the effect of ABC but on the other hand does not allow extrapolation of these results to a more advanced population.
- -In  another  open  label  study NZTA  4005 ABC  in  combination  with  CBV  was  used  as  a switch/intensification  therapy  in  previously  NRTI-experienced but PI-naive subjects. Subjects only  received  prior  single  or  double  NRTI  therapy  with  no  concurrent  ZDV.  There  was  a sustained suppression of viral load at 48 weeks in this population where one third had already &lt;400 copies/ml at baseline, and a rather modest change in viral load (-0.52 log10 copies/ml) and in CD4 cells (+66 cells/mm 3 ). Results in this study were only descriptive.
- -The design of study CH-96-06 is  interesting  because  it  evaluates  if  a  simplified  combination therapy  of  ABC  in  combination  with  CBV  can  maintain  the  viral  load  below  the  limit  of quantification in patients with already undetectable plasma HIV RNA as a result of a previous PI-containing regimen. Interim results show a similar proportion of subjects with &lt;50 copies/ml in both groups (90% vs 87% in the PI-containing arm and CBV/ABC arm, respectively) and a similar proportion of failure (4% vs 6%, respectively). However, failures occurred earlier in the CBV/ABC arm than in the PI-containing arm. Long-term results in a larger patient group are warranted before conclusions can be made.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

Globally, the durability of the antiviral affect of the ABC/3TC/ZDV combination has been shown in antiretroviral naive patients, with a response that is not impacted if the addition of ABC is delayed (as shown in study CNAAB3003) or conversely, if ABC has been given as monotherapy for a while (as shown in study CNAB2002). Although no formal conclusion at long term on the equivalence could be drawn, results of the pivotal trial CNAAB3005 indicate a similar effect between this triple nucleoside regimen and a regimen containing the protease inhibitor indinavir , although the impact of abacavir as

compared to indinavir is lower in patients with high viral load at baseline (&gt;100 000 copies/ml) and when using the ultrasensitive method with lower detection threshold (&lt;50 copies/ml).

The experience in antiretroviral experienced patients is more limited since patients in the submitted studies,  except  in  study  CH-96-06,  were  only  moderately  pre-treated  with  prior  therapy  consisting mainly of double NRTI therapy for a short period. It is important to realise that the modest changes in viral load which were found in these studies after addition of ABC or switching to ABC+CBV cannot be extrapolated to heavily pre-treated patients at an advanced stage of their HIV infection. Therefore the  role  of  ABC  (+CBV)  as  part  of  a  salvage  treatment  is  not  defined  yet.  In  study  CH-96-06 preliminary results show a possible role of ABC/CBV in maintaining an aviremic status in patients who became aviremic as a result of a protease inhibitor containing regimen, which could be beneficial for improved compliance.

However, it should be underlined that except for preliminary data in study CNAF 3008, no data are available of ABC/3TC/ZDV in combination therapy with other drug categories, namely NNRTI and PI, and therefore neither the efficacy nor the safety of these combinations is currently known.

## Clinical Safety

## Patient exposure

Safety  data  are  available  for  972  subjects  from  the  nine  studies  including  subjects  who  switched therapy to the triple combination. The safety population includes all subjects who received at least one dose of the triple combination ABC/3TC/ZDV and CNAAB 3003 group B subjects who received open label ABC/3TC/ZDV. A total of 495 of these subjects have received the triple combination for over 48 weeks. Analyses focus primarily on the three pivotal studies CNAAB 3003, CNAAB 3005 and CNAB 3002 because they include comparative data. In addition, an estimated 3174 subjects have received the triple combination regimen in the market support studies and expanded access programmes. Serious adverse  event  data  is available for  all  subjects  enrolled  in  ongoing  studies,  both  Marketing Authorisation Holder sponsored and collaborations with external agencies and investigators. To date the safety profile of the combination product Trizivir has not been assessed in clinical trials.

## Adverse events and serious adverse events/deaths

The most common adverse events of the triple combination of ABC/3TC/ZDV were gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea with or without vomiting, and diarrhoea) together with malaise and fatigue, and headache. A pooled analysis of data from the 3 pivotal comparative studies showed no difference in incidence of adverse events between the ABC/3TC/ZDV arm and control groups, except for a higher incidence  of  fever  and/or  chills  in  the  triple  therapy  arm,  probably  related  to  the  hypersensitivity reaction  to  ABC.  The  incidence  of  most  common  AE  did  not  seem  to  increase  with  increasing exposure to study drugs but is on the contrary more likely to diminish with time (as shown in study CNAB 2002).

The  most  important  safety  problem  with  this triple combination  tablet is -as expected-  the hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) to abacavir, with a safety profile that is consistent with the current profile  in  ABC  hypersensitivity  cases.  In  all  these  studies  the  incidence  of  HSR  was  around  the previously  described  3%,  except  for  study  CNAAB  3005  where  the  incidence  was  much  higher (7.3%). It  is  important  to  remain  vigilant  because  it  is  possible  that  it  will  become  clear  that  more symptoms may be involved in the HSR (e.g. the recently reported respiratory symptoms) and that the true incidence therefore has been underestimated so far.

During the post-marketing phase of Ziagen (abacavir) respiratory symptoms have been recognised as an  important  part  of  the  hypersensitivity  reaction  in  approximately  20%  of  HSR-patients.  These symptoms  may  include  dyspnoea,  pharyngitis  or  cough  in  the  initial  presentation.  Deaths  have occurred among patients initially thought to have acute respiratory diseases (pneumonia, bronchitis, or flu-like illness) who were only later recognised to have had a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir that included respiratory symptoms. In cases where there was a fatal outcome respiratory symptoms were present in approximately 80% of the patients. A delay in diagnosis of hypersensitivity can result in Ziagen being continued or re-introduced, leading to more severe hypersensitivity reactions or to death.

To avoid a  delay  in  diagnosis  and  minimise  the  risk  of  a  life-threatening  hypersensitivity  reaction, Abacavir must be discontinued if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g. respiratory diseases, flu-like illness, gastroenteritis, or reactions to other medications). If reintroduction is judged necessary it must be done in a hospital setting.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hypersensitivity reactions  with rapid  onset,  including  life-threatening  reactions,  have  occurred  after re-starting  abacavir  in  patients  who  had  only  one  of  the  key  symptoms  of  hypersensitivity  reaction (skin rash, fever, gastrointestinal, respiratory or constitutional symptoms such as lethargy and malaise) prior to stopping abacavir containing regimen. On very rare occasions hypersensitivity reactions have been  reported  in  patients  who  have  re-started  therapy,  and  who  had  no  preceding  symptoms  of  a hypersensitivity reaction.

Strong measures have been taken regarding the risk of fatal rechallenge after the occurrence of HSR due  to  ZIAGEN.  The  overall  measures  concerning  HSR  due  to  ZIAGEN  (recommendation, information of prescribers and patients, committments of the Marketing Authorisation Holder) should be applied for TRIZIVIR. If a decision is made to re-start abacavir in patients who had only one of the key symptoms of hypersensitivity or no symptoms prior to stopping abacavir, this must be done in a setting where medical assistance is readily available. This information is conveyed in the SPC.

Furthermore,  when  this  triple  NRTI  combination  will  be  associated  with  drugs  from  other  classes (NNRTI or PI),  which  can  give  similar  side  effects  as  an  HSR,  extra  caution  will  be  necessary  to distinguish  these  side  effects  from  a  true  HSR.  Appropriate  recommendations  for  the  use  of  ABC (alone  or  combined)  should  be  provided  by  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  to  avoid  or  clarify such clinical situations.

Currently the mechanism of the hypersensitivity reaction is unknown. A programme to investigate this is  underway but results are not yet available. In addition no risk factors have been identified which may predict the occurrence or severity of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir but intermittent therapy with abacavir may increase the risk of developing a state of hypersensitivity.

Another  particular  concern  is  that  of  mitochondrial  toxicity  of  this  triple  NRTI  combination. Considering that  mitochondrial toxicity  is  a  NRTI  class  effect,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder has explored this particular issue through a review of the literature. The mitochondrial toxicity of this triple  NRTI  combination  is  difficult  to  assess  through  this  literature  review  of in  vitro studies consisting of a ranking of NRTIs. No specific in vitro study with the fixed triple NRTI combination has  been  performed  by  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder,  which  could  have  been  much  more contributive to address this issue. The mitochondrial toxicity of NRTI is a complex topic, which is currently  the  subject  of  an  active  research  to  better  understand  the  mechanism,  to  propose  an appropriate  clinical  monitoring  and  therapeutic  management.  The  recommendation  of  a  close monitoring  of  patients  (clinical  and  biological)  should  be  reinforced.  The  Marketing  Authorisation Holder should be asked to further explore this topic through in  vitro and in  vivo data  (in  view  of  a better understanding of this toxicity and a better monitoring of patients).

## 5. Overall Conclusion and benefit risk assessment

## · Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder will provide stability data including the 24-month time point and demonstrate the specificity of the HPLC method used for the determination of the related substances in the finished product with regard to the impurities of abacavir.

## · Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology

The  extensive  non-clinical  evaluations  carried  out  on  abacavir,  lamivudine  and  zidovudine  provide sufficient evidence to support the use in a triple combination tablet. This is in line with the approved uses of Combivir and Ziagen.

The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  has  committed  to  further  explore  the  issue  of  mitochondrial toxicity for this triple combination by performing both in vitro and in vivo studies

## · Efficacy and Safety

Regarding efficacy, this triple drug combination has demonstrated a significant antiviral effect after 48 weeks  of  treatment  in  antiretroviral  naive  patients.  The  experience  in  antiretroviral-experienced patients is rather limited with only modest results at 48 weeks. The efficacy of the combination tablet

15/16

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in heavily pre-treated and in failing patients or in patients with advanced disease (&lt;50 CD4 cells/mm 3 ) has not been documented. There are also insufficient data on combination therapy with NNRTI and PI. This is highlighted in the SmPC. The Marketing Authorisation Holder has committed to submit final reports of studies currently ongoing with the triple combination tablet

Regarding safety, the profile is considered acceptable with the exception of hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir, which remain important safety concerns. The same strict conditions already required for the marketing authorisation of Ziagen will be fully implemented.

## Benefit/Risk Assessment

During an oral explanation before the CPMP in June 200 the applicant addressed the issues relating to the  wording  of  the  indication  highlighting  that  Trizivir  replaces  the  individual  components.  It  was argued that this triple NRTI fixed dose combination has a substantial antiviral impact and facilitates the  dosage  administration  (only  one  tablet  twice  daily);  patient's  adherence  to  appropriate  and effective HIV/AIDS drug regimen is a central factor in predicting long term benefit of treatment. The CPMP pointed out that the choice of this fixed combination should be based not only on potential adherence criteria, but mainly on expected efficacy and risk related to the three nucleoside analogues.

The results of the antiviral effect as demonstrated in study CNAAB 3005 were discussed. The high dropout rate did not allow definitive conclusions on equivalence between the abacavir and indinavir containing  regimens.  Although  a  similar  antiviral  effect  was  observed  between  the  abacavir  and indinavir  containing  regimens  in  terms  of  proportion  of  patients  with  undetectable  viral  load  ( ≤ 400 copies/ml), results favoured the indinavir combination, particularly in the subset of patients with high viral  load  (&gt;  100  000  copies/ml)  at  baseline.  Information  on  this  pivotal  trial  is  made  available  in relevant parts of the SPC.

Following the urgent safety restriction for Ziagen (abacavir) on 10 August 2000, the applicant (i.e., the marketing  authorisation  holder  for  Ziagen)  gave  an  oral  explanation  before  the  CPMP  at  the September CPMP meeting. This again related to the risk of hypersensitivity reactions and the proper management of patients treated with the triple combination.

The CPMP recommended that due to uncertainties on the optimal use of Trizivir in relation to the risk for hypersensitivity reactions and to help ensure that physicians and patients were aware that Trizivir contains abacavir, starting treatment with Trizivir should be delayed 6-8 weeks until some reassurance of  the  safe  use  of  the  combination  of  the  individual  components  alone  had  been  achieved.  This recommendation is conveyed in section 4.1. of the SPC. The CPMP thus revised its previous opinion giving considerations to the new safety information on Ziagen as relevant for the opinion on Trizivir.

Relevant parts of the product information were thus revised.

The overall benefit/risk assessment is considered positive since:

- This triple  NRTI fixed dose combination has a substantial antiviral impact and facilitates the dosage administration (only one tablet twice daily).
- Patient's adherence to appropriate and effective HIV/AIDS drug regimens is a central factor in predicting long-term benefit of treatment.

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk profile of Trizivir was favorable for the following indication 'Trizivir is indicated for  the  treatment of  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected adults. This fixed combination replaces  the  three  components  (abacavir,  lamivudine  and  zidovudine)  used  separately  in  similar dosages.  It  is  recommended  that  treatment  is  started  with  abacavir,  lamivudine,  and  zidovudine separately for the first 6-8 weeks (see section 4.4. Special Warnings and Precautions). The choice of this fixed combination should be based not only on potential adherence criteria, but also mainly onexpected efficacy and risk related to the three nucleoside analogues.  The demonstration of the benefit of Trizivir is mainly based on results of studies performed in treatment naive patients or moderately antiretroviral  experienced  patients  with  non-advanced  disease.  In  patients  with  high  viral  load (&gt;100.000  copies/ml)  choice  of  therapy  needs  special  consideration  (see  5.1.  Pharmacodynamic properties).'
