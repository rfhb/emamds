## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Dacogen, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows: Based on the cumulative reviews of 'fungal infections' and 'cellulitis' with Dacogen, fungal infections, including fatal fungal infections, and cellulitis were considered to be adverse drug reactions associated with the use of decitabine. Regarding fungal infections, the search retrieved 104 cases reporting fungal infections in patients treated with decitabine. Of the 104 cases, 12 were spontaneously reported and 92 originated from clinical trials. Eleven spontaneous cases were classified as serious and 43 clinical study cases were considered to be causally related to decitabine. Twenty cases were fatal. With regard to cellulitis, the search retrieved 94 cases. Of the 94, 88 were received from clinical trials. The large majority of the cases (93/94) were serious, and 13 cases had a fatal outcome. Twenty six clinical study cases were considered to be related to decitabine. Frequencies of 63% and 39% for 'all other infections' all grades and grades 3-4 respectively were calculated using the clinical data from 293 decitabine-treated patients with AML to be consistent with other ADR terms. Therefore, in view of available data regarding fungal infections and cellulitis, the PRAC considered that changes to the Product Information were warranted to reflect that patients receiving Dacogen are at increased risk for severe infections (due to any pathogen such as bacterial, fungal and viral), with potentially fatal outcome. Patients should therefore be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated promptly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Dacogen, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance DECITABINE is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.
