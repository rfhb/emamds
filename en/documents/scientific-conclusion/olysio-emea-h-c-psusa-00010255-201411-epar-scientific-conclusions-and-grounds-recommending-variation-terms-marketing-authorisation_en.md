## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for simeprevir, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure, including fatal cases, have been reported post-marketing in  patients  treated  with  simeprevir  in  combination  with  peginterferon  alfa  and  ribavirin  and  in combination with sofosbuvir. Although causality is difficult to establish due to background advanced liver  disease,  a  potential  risk  cannot  be  excluded.  Therefore,  a  warning  on  the  risk  of  hepatic decompensation  and  hepatic  failure  has  been  included  in  the  product  information  for  simeprevir, indicating  that  liver  function  tests  should  be  monitored  before  and  as  clinically  indicated  during simeprevir combination therapy in patients who are at high risk for hepatic decompensation or hepatic failure. Two cases of bradycardia have been observed when simeprevir is used in combination with sofosbuvir and  concomitant  amiodarone.  Cases  are  potentially  life  threatening;  therefore,  warnings  have  been included in relevant sections in the product information providing recommendations should concomitant use of simeprevir and amiodarone be considered necessary. Therefore, in view of available data regarding simeprevir, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation On the basis of the scientific conclusions for simeprevir the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing simeprevir is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.
