| II/0016/G   | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include OS interim results from MONARCH 3 study, a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled phase 3 study in women with HR positive, HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had not received prior systemic therapy in this disease setting. In addition, the MAH is updating the ATC code in the SmPC. The MAH is also taking the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet in line with the QRD template 10.2.

| II/0008             | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC to include the results of the interim OS analysis from study MONARCH 2, a randomised, double-blind, placebo- controlled, phase 3 study of fulvestrant with or without abemaciclib, for women with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 16/01/2020 | 17/12/2020 | SmPC | Overall survival (OS) analysis in the ITT population in study MONARCH 2 showed a statistically significant improvement in patients receiving Verzenios plus fulvestrant compared with those receiving placebo plus fulvestrant. The median OS was 46.7 months in the Verzenios plus fulvestrant arm versus 37.3 months in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm (HR=0.757 (95% CI (0.606, 0.945), p-value=0.0137). Analyses for OS by stratification factors showed OS HR of 0.675 (95% CI: 0.511, 0.891) in patients with visceral disease, and 0.686 (95% CI: 0.451, 1.043) in patients with primary endocrine resistance. |
