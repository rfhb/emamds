## 1. Introduction

On 17 April 2025, the MAH submitted a completed adult study including adolescents for Jivi, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that the PREDICT Study (CSP 21924, CSR B003604) is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The pharmaceutical formulation being used in this study is a powder and solvent for solution for injection. The powder formulation is available as Jivi 250 IU; Jivi 500 IU; Jivi 1000 IU; Jivi 2000 IU and Jivi 3000 IU. In June 2025, the additional strength 4000 IU was approved.

This formulation has an MAA for the use in children from 12 years and older.

Jivi is for intravenous use, and dosing is dependent on the child's weight, factor activity level as well as current bleeding episode or the risk of bleeding.

It is found that this formulation is suitable for the use in children

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- PREDICT (CSP 21924, CSR B003604)

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Clinical study

## PREDICT (CSP 21924, CSR B003604)

## Description

A multicenter, prospective, open-label, clinical study to assess the effect of using a new risk score approach to select the most appropriate prophylaxis regimen for reaching a favorable outcome, when hemophilia A patients switch from standard half-life products to Jivi.

The PREDICT study is a Phase 4 study to assess a new risk score approach utilizing the best known phenotypic and biologic variables to select the most appropriate prophylaxis regimen for reaching a favorable outcome when switching treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Study participants

Participants were ≥ 12 years of age with congenital haemophilia A who had a documented history of at least 150 exposure days with any FVIII product. All participants had received prophylaxis with a licensed standard half-life FVIII product with a stable dosing regimen for at least 6 consecutive months within the previous 12 months prior to the screening visit.

## Treatments

All eligible participants were assigned a risk score at baseline and started treatment 2x/week (40 IU/kg/dose) with Jivi for 4 weeks.

At baseline, participants' total risk scores were determined based on 5 individually weight variables: pre-study bleeding phenotype, previous treatment frequency, number of active target joints, vWF levels and physical activity (Table 1).

Prophylactic treatment : Treatment was then continued based on their assignment to 1 of the 3 following prophylaxis regimens:

- Participants with a high-risk score (&gt; 4) continued on prophylaxis 2x/week (40 IU/kg/dose)
- Participants with a medium risk score (2 to 4) were to switch after 4 weeks to prophylaxis every 5 days (50 IU/kg/dose)
- Participants with a low risk score (&lt; 2) were to switch after 4 weeks to prophylaxis every 5 days (50 IU/kg/dose) and then after 4 weeks to a less frequent (e.g. every 7 days) regimen (60 IU/kg/dose)

Abbreviations: PK = pharmacokinetics; Q5D = every 5 days; Q7D = every 7 days; SHL = standard half-life: vWF = von Willebrand factor.

6-month study, then the protocol recommends assigning the participant to the next highest frequency regimen. Per protocol, the treating investigator reserves the right to change aparticipant's regimen at any timeif they perceive the risk scoredetermined regimen is not well-suited for the participant.

Treatment of bleeds: All bleeding events that occur in participants receiving prophylactic infusion after the start of treatment will be treated with Jivi (prescribing information provided).

## Objective(s)

It is important to emphasize that the objective of this study is to assess a treatment tool (a risk score) for the use in dose selection of Jivi. The treatment already holds a market authorization for this indication and in this age group.

## Sample size

Initially it was planned to enrol a maximum of 70 participants such that approximately 60 evaluable participants would complete the study. This turned out not to be feasible (slower recruitment than expected). Twenty-one patients were included in the PREDICT study.

Three patients &lt; 18 years were included in the PREDICT study and treated with Jivi.

## Statistical Methods

The study is not designed to test any predefined hypothesis. All analyses will be descriptive or exploratory. Confidence intervals, 95%, two-sided, will be reported for the primary endpoint and for selected secondary endpoints, assessed as occurrence rates, mean scores or counts, and change from baseline.

## Recruitment

Slower than expected recruitment  led to 'Protocol amendment 3' (2. October 2023), protocol version 4.0 with a change in inclusion criteria and amendment back to recruitment in a single country (United states). Of the three patients &lt; 18 years who were included in the 'PREDICT study', two were enrolled before protocol amendment 3 and one after this amendment.

## Safety results

One reported adverse event in the three patients &lt; 18 years who were included in the PREDICT study: one patient presented mild headache starting 3 months after enrolment which resolved after 3 months without change in dose and any remedial therapy.

There were no unexpected safety outcomes during the study.

## 2.3.2. Discussion on clinical aspects

The aim of the presented PREDICT study was to assess the use of a clinical tool for the conversion of treatment and dose-adjustment in patients with congenital haemophilia A and receiving prophylactic treatment with a FVIII product. The applied risk score is an approach to select the most appropriate prophylaxis regimen for reaching a favorable outcome, when switching from standard half-life products to Jivi.

The treatment applied in the study is within the SmPC current at the time the study was conducted which holds the following indication and posology:

Indication: Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in previously treated patients ≥ 12 years of age with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).

Posology: The dose and duration of substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Under the current posology test, the dose is decided based on Factor VIII activity in plasma and clinical judgement based on individual patient characteristics and treatment response (including bleeding episodes). It is the same elements that are included in the 'risk score'-calculation applied in the PREDICT Study in a standardized way.

The SmPC states 'On demand and prophylactic treatment dosing in adolescent patients is the same as for adult patients.'

Three participants &lt; 18 years of age are included in the study. All participants are &gt; 12 years of age. Therefore, the treatment exposure is within the MA for Jivi current at the time the study was conducted. The number of adolescents treated is too low to extract specific new treatment recommendations in this age group, but there are no safety or efficacy data in this study that lead to concerns that could affect the benefit-risk ratio for Jivi in patients under 18 years of age. Nor are there findings that suggest changes in the current SmPC.
