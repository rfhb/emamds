## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is reported to be the most common mood disorder, with a lifetime prevalence  of  about  15%  and  as  high  as  25%  in  women.  Despite  the  availability  of  effective treatments, many persons with depressive disorders are disabled, and risk of suicide is considerable. Depressive disorders tend to be chronic and both relapse and recurrence are seen frequently.

A  number  of  options  are  currently  available  for  the  treatment  of  MDD,  including  psychological therapies  such  as  cognitive  behavioural  therapy  and  psychoanalytic  psychotherapy,  antidepressant medications, and electro-convulsive therapy.

Initial  treatment  objectives  in  the  treatment  of  depression  include:  1)  Symptom  remission  (acute phase),  2)  Prevention  of  relapse  (continuation  phase)  and  3)  Prevention  of  recurrences,  or  new episodes in patients with recurrent depressions (maintenance phase).

The  presumed  mechanism  of  action  of  the  majority  of  antidepressants  in  the  treatment  of  MDD  is thought to be via inhibition of neuronal reuptake of monoamines (mainly serotonin and noradrenaline),  with  a  resultant  increase  in  monoamine  neurotransmission  in  the  central  nervous system  (CNS).  The  major  classes  of  medicinal  products  used  to  treat  depression  are  the  tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, e.g., fluoxetine and sertraline), selective  noradrenaline  reuptake  inhibitors  (NRIs,  e.g.  reboxetine),  serotonin  and  noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, e.g. venlafaxine, duloxetine), heterocyclics (e.g., bupropion), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, and a few other compounds such as mirtazapine and mianserin. No single antidepressant medication is clearly more effective than another and no single medication results in remission for all patients. In many occasions the choice of the medication is made looking at the side effect profile.

A significant percentage of patients develop sexual side effects after several weeks or months of SSRI and  SNRI  therapy,  especially  a  decreased  ability  to  have  an  orgasm.  In  addition,  these  medicinal products  exert  a  negative  influence  on  paradoxical  sleep,  thereby  modifying  sleep  architecture  in treated  patients.  A  withdrawal  syndrome  may  also  occur  upon  cessation  of  treatment.  Another inconvenience  with  SSRIs  and  SNRIs  are  that  they  are  generally  considered  to  be  less  potent  than tricyclics for the treatment of severe depression. Furthermore, with all antidepressant drugs currently available,  only  60-70%  of  depressed  patients  improve.  Finally,  another  major  limitation  in  the therapeutic value of MAOIs, tricyclics as well as SSRIs and SNRIs is the 3-4 weeks latency which unavoidably  elapses  from  starting  treatment  with  any  one  among  these  medicinal  products  to appearance  of  the  first  convincing  signs  of  clinical  improvement.  This  delay  in  their  therapeutic efficacy is often a difficult period for the clinician to manage because of the behavioural disinhibition that these medicinal products can induce before raising mood. In particular, for depressed patients with suicidal  ideas,  suicide  attempts  can  actually  occur  during  the  very  first  weeks  of  antidepressant treatment.

For  all  these  reasons,  it  is  obvious  that  there  is  still  a  need  for  new  antidepressants  which  would preserve  the  quality  of  life  and  whose  therapeutic  action  would  be  more  efficient  than  that  of medicinal products currently available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## About the product

Agomelatine is  a  new  chemical  entity  intended  for  treatment  of  major  depressive  disorder  (MDD). Agomelatine has a new pharmacological mechanism of action, which combines melatonin MT1 and MT2 agonist properties with a serotonin 5-HT2C antagonist effect. The 5-HT2C receptors are considered a relevant target with regard to antidepressant therapy, as several currently used antidepressant drugs are endowed with 5-HT2C receptor antagonist properties (e.g. mianserin and mirtazapine).

The proposed posology is one oral 25 mg tablet taken in the evening. After two weeks of treatment, if further clinical improvement was required, the dose may be increased to 50 mg once daily, taken as a single dose of two tablets in the evening.

The clinical development programme focused on providing evidence for efficacy of agomelatine 25 mg  and  50  mg  in  the  major  depression  disorder  indication.  Supportive  studies  were  performed  to demonstrate efficacy in the elderly and clinical safety.

The applicant  obtained  scientific  advice  from  the  EMEA  on  30  July  1999  (CPMP/1807/99)  on  the following issues concerning the clinical development: The investigation of a higher dosage than the 25mg dose and the designs of studies  evaluating  this  higher  dose  of  50mg,  and  a  specific  efficacy study in elderly patients. This advice was partly taken into account in the design of subsequent studies.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

The product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 25 mg of agomelatine as active substance.

The manufacturing process is carried with adequate in-process controls. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents, have been presented.

Batch analysis data is provided on 16 batches produced with the defined synthetic route, and the batch analysis data show that the active substance can be manufactured reproducibly.

- Specification

The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  solubility  (Ph  Eur.),  identification (IR, LC), assay (potentiometric titation), chemical purity (LC), loss on drying (Ph Eur), sulphated ash (Ph Eur), heavy metals (Ph Eur), particle size distribution, residual catalyst content. The specifications reflect all relevant quality attributes of the active substance. The analytical methods used in the routine controls  are  suitably  described  and  validation  studies  are  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  Guidelines. Impurity limits in the specifications are justified by toxicology studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Stability

Three  industrial-sized  batches  of  agomelatine  synthesized  according  to  the  synthesis  process  were placed under ICH storage conditions and at 30°C under 70% relative humidity for up 3 years. The results  indicate  that  agomelatine  drug  substance  is  stable,  and  a  practical  re-test  period  has  been established.

## Drug Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The  intrinsic  physico-chemical  properties  of  the  active  substance  were  taken  into  account  for  the development of an oral solid formulation. A conventional immediate release tablet was selected as the dosage form and the excipients were selected based on compatibility testing of a number of excipients with the drug substance.

Several formulations were developed during clinical trials phases and judged to be bioequivalent. The excipients  lactose  monohydrate,  macrogol  6000,  magnesium  stearate,  maize  starch,  povidone, colloidal anhydrous  silica, sodium  starch glycolate (type A), stearic acid meet  the Ph  Eur specifications.

Lactose monohydrate is the only excipient of animal origin, derived from milk sourced from healthy animals in the same conditions as milk collected for human consumption.

Aluminium/polyvinylchloride blister are used as primary packaging. The materials comply with the Ph Eur and are adequate to support the stability and use of the product.

## · Manufacture of the Product

A conventional wet granulation process is used. The in process controls are adequate for this filmcoated preparation.

The batch analysis data show that the film-coated tablets can be manufactured reproducibly according to the defined finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation.

Physical and chemical parameters tested did not show significant signs of modifications in relation to the initial controls and comply with the shelf-life specifications.

The available stability data allow a practical shelf life and storage conditions to be defined.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Regarding safety pharmacology, studies of cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal safety were generally  conducted  in  accordance  with  Good  Laboratory  Practice  (GLP)  standards,  while  studies assessing  CNS  safety  and  follow-up  studies  did  not  fully  comply  with  the  GLP  standards.  The majority  of  the  pharmacokinetic  studies  and  all  pivotal  toxicology  studies  were  conducted  in accordance with GLP standards.

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics

Agomelatine is  a  melatonin  agonist  with  high  affinity  binding  to  human  melatonine  MT1  and  MT2 receptors.  Agomelatine  is  also  a  serotonin  antagonist  at  the  5-HT2C  receptor  from  man  and  several animal species, although with low affinity. Two of the three main metabolites of agomelatine showed some  pharmacological  activity  at  the  melatonin  receptors,  while  a  third  metabolite  (dihydrodiolagomelatine,  DHDP)  was  not  pharmacologically  active  at  either  receptor  families.  In  particular, 3H7DP  (3-hydroxy-7-desmethyl  agomelatine),  the  major  metabolite  in  man,  and  also  present  in monkey and possibly in rat, showed low affinities for both human melatonin and serotonin receptors. In addition, due to the high degree of conjugation, 3H7DP may have minimal pharmacological effect in vivo.

Agomelatine had anti-depressive like activity in a number of animal models of depression (depression induced by stress, i.e. the despair test, the learned helplessness test, the model of unavoidable aversive light stimulus, the prenatal stress model, and the chronic mild stress which is a model of anhedonia; the antidepressant activity was also studied in models related to a hyperactivity of the hypothalamuspituitary-adrenals  axis).  The  anti-depressant  effect  was  related  both  to  activation  of  melatonin receptors  and  inhibition  of  5-HT2C  receptors,  and  putatively  to  increased  levels  of  extracellular noradrenaline and dopamine.

The pharmacological effects of agomelatine seemed to be related to the time of dosing, and highest effect levels were seen at dosing in the evening (light/dark transition), in accordance with the circadian fluctuation of endogenous melatonin, and with the applied clinical posology.

- Secondary pharmacodynamics

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Agomelatine showed chronobiotic activity related to the melatonin activity, and anxiolytic effects while no indication of antipsychotic properties was seen.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

Safety pharmacology studies carried out in mouse, rat and monkey with the dose up to 1024 mg/kg showed that agomelatine and the metabolite 7DP (7-desmethyl-agomelatine) caused significant CNS depression at high doses and induced slight-to-moderate sedation in several models.

In dog isolated cardiac Purkinje fibres, in the presence of agomelatine (10 -6 M and 10 -5 M), there was a small, but dose dependent and significant decrease in action potential duration, while in Cynomolgus monkey treated with agomelatine a prolongation of QT interval was observed, although QTc remained unchanged. No significant effect on recombinant HERG current was observed. In vivo agomelatine did not modify QTc in spontaneously breathing monkey up to a high intravenous dose and in human at doses up to 4-fold the therapeutic doses. Furthermore, the high concentrations used in the dog Purkinje fibres study largely exceeded the therapeutic concentrations.

No  biologically  relevant  effects  were  seen  on  renal  function  or  respiratory  system.  Agomelatine resulted  in  a  slightly  increased  gastrointestinal  motility.  Endocrine  studies  in  rat  showed  that agomelatine  reduced  basal  and  stress-related  prolactin  and  LH  levels  in  males  and  the  surge  of prolactin  and  LH  in  potentially  pro-oestrus  females,  and  corticosterone  in  both  genders.  Equivocal effects  were  observed  on  ACTH,  GH,  TSH.  Further,  during  a  28-day  endocrine  study,  exposure  to agomelatine was in the range of the exposure in the carcinogenicity study, showing adequate exposure to demonstrate the lack of prolactine and oestradiol increase at the high dose of the carcinogenicity study in the rat.

Conventional studies of drug discrimination and self-administration (cocaine discrimination, diazepam discrimination, self-administration) in rats and monkeys did not indicate any dependence potential of agomelatine.

## Pharmacokinetics

An LC-Fluorescence assay was validated in animal plasma samples from several species and human plasma samples, and used for all toxicokinetic analyses and for the first clinical studies. A sensitive LC/MS-MS technique  was  developed  later  and  mainly  used  for  analysis  of  agomelatine  in  human plasma and saliva samples.

## · Absorption

Agomelatine was rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral  administration,  but  with  a  low absolute  bioavailability  caused  by  a  high  level  of  first-pass  metabolism;  following  both  single  and repeated oral dosing, agomelatine exhibited non-linear kinetics in the oral dose range 2.5-750 mg/kg and 10-720 mg/kg for the rat and monkey, respectively, as both Cmax and AUC increased more than dose  proportionally.  This  non-linearity  was  related  to  saturation  of  the  first-pass/  pre-systemic metabolism at higher doses. (Table 1 below)

*unlessindicatedotherwise

The exposure levels of unchanged agomelatine in plasma, especially in monkey, were characterised by a  high  inter-  and  intra-individual  variability.  The  underlying  mechanisms  explaining  most  of  the observed variability in plasma levels could be saturation of the solubility of the drug at high doses, as well as a high and saturable hepatic first-pass effect. The level of dissolution and saturation of firstpass metabolism could vary depending on the individual gastrointestinal status (stomach and gut fluid content, food, gut motility, etc.) at feeding time.

The  single  dose  absorption  studies  were  performed  on  males  only,  thus  a  gender-related  effect  on single  dose  pharmacokinetics  was  not  assessed.  In  the  repeated  dose  studies  both  genders  were represented. In rats the exposure levels tended to be higher in females than in males, while in monkeys the exposure levels tended to be higher in males than in females .

## · Distribution

Distribution studies were performed in the rat. Agomelatine and/or its metabolites were rapidly and extensively distributed throughout the body, with a rather moderate volume of distribution (2l/kg in rat, 1L/kg in monkey), in accordance with the lipophilic properties of agomelatine. The levels in the CNS  were  low  and  quickly  eliminated.  Initially,  there  were  high  levels  of  radioactivity  in  organs related to excretion, in adrenal glands, and in the uveal tract indicating possible affinity to melanin. The binding to melanin was considered weak (half life: 6-10h) and rapidly reversible in comparison of melanin turn-over measured in years. At late sampling times (48-96 h), highest levels were seen in the gastrointestinal  system  and  this  was  explained  by  gastric  secretion.  In  pregnant  rats,  agomelatine passed into placenta and foetuses. The level of radioactivity in maternal uterus was higher than plasma levels at 72 h post dosing.

The  plasma  protein  binding  of  agomelatine  and  its  4  main  metabolites  (7DP;  3HP,  3-hydroxyagomelatine; DHDP; and DAPACID, desacetamide-agomelatine-carboxylic acid) was moderate (7585%)  in  different  species,  and  the  unbound  fraction  was  independent  of  agomelatine  plasma concentration. The in vitro blood to plasma concentration was close to 1 in rat, 0.9 in monkey and 0.7 in man, indicating an almost equal distribution of agomelatine in blood (erythrocytes) and plasma in rat  and  monkey,  but  slightly  more  distributed  to  plasma  in  man.  In  an  in  vitro  blood-brain  barrier model, agomelatine and 7DP crossed at a high grade, 3HP at an intermediate and DAPACID at a low grade.

## · Metabolism, excretion

The main routes of metabolism in rat, monkey and man were as 3-hydroxylation, 7-desmethylation and  oxidation  of  the  naphtyl  moiety  at  position  7,  leading  to  the  main  metabolites  3HP,  7DP,  and DHDP. The combination of 3-hydroxylation and 7-desmethylation lead to formation of the 3H7DP, a major metabolite in man, a moderate metabolite in monkey and a minor metabolite in rat. DHDP was most likely formed after hydrolysis of a 3,4-epoxide-agomelatine intermediate. Both rat and monkey were found to be representative toxicological species, and the metabolites identified in humans were found in at least one of these species.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Enzyme induction was observed to different degrees in rodent and monkey at oral doses ≥ 125 mg/kg, with a subsequent decrease in exposure of unchanged agomelatine. Agomelatine caused a time and dose-related induction of CYP2B, CYP1A, CYP3A and UGT in rodents. In monkey, only a minimal induction  of  CYP2B  and  CYP3A  was  observed,  while  CYP2C  and  CYP4A  was  slightly  downregulated.  The  enzyme  induction  was  associated  with  a  dose-dependent  increase  in  liver  weight  in rodents. There was a dose-dependent increase in monkey liver weight (up to 40%), and the total P450 levels  and  microsomal  hepatic  protein  concentration  in  the  monkey  were  slightly  increased  at  high doses.

The  metabolites  of  agomelatine  were  conjugated  and  excreted  via  urine  and  faeces,  and  only  low levels of unchanged agomelatine were excreted. About 80 % of the administered dose was excreted after  120  and  168  h  for  low  and  high  oral  doses  (2.5  and  100  mg/kg,  respectively).  In  rats, approximately 50-75 % of administered radioactive agomelatine was recovered in the urine and 20-40 % in faeces, while in monkey a larger proportion (60-80 %) was excreted in urine, similar to man. In general, the urinary excretion was slightly increased at high oral doses, and slightly higher in female than male rats. Studies performed in bile-cannulated rats demonstrated that most of the radioactivity detected  in  faeces  was  due  to  biliary  excretion.  Agomelatine  and/or  its  metabolites  was  readily excreted into rat milk.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

Single-dose toxicity was studied in mouse (465-1157 mg/kg po; 46-150mg/kg iv), rat (804-2000mg/kg po; 72-150mg/kg iv) and monkey (500-1500mg/kg po).

The studies indicated a rather low acute toxicity. All studies showed dose-related sedative effects. In rodents,  the  lowest  maximal  non-lethal  dose  was  465  mg/kg,  while  in  monkeys  no  mortality  was observed up to the highest dose of 1500 mg/kg. After iv administration to rodents, the maximal nonlethal dose was 59-72 mg/kg; cause of death was most likely due to excessive CNS depressive effect.

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Repeat-dose toxicology was studied in rats (4-, 13-, 26-week studies; 25-750mg/kg po or 4-60mg iv) and monkeys (4-, 13-, 26- and 52-week studies; 60-720 mg/kg po or 2-32 mg/kg iv). In all studies a body weight reduction was observed without change on the feed intake.

In  rat,  there  was  a  dose-related  incidence  of  reduced  body  weight  gain,  CNS  depression  and  liver discoloration  from  the  lowest  dose.  Enlarged  livers  were  seen  in  both  males  and  females.  Liver enzyme  levels  were  only  assessed  in  males,  showing  P450  induction  in  accordance  with  reduced exposure levels for agomelatine. In addition, thyroid findings in males were observed and related to hepatic  enzyme  induction.  Also  discoloration  of  urine,  increased  protrombin  and  activated  partial thromboplastin time were seen.

In  monkey,  dose-related  emesis,  enlarged  livers  and  increased  urinary  levels  of  porphyrins  were observed. The effect on liver and porphyrinuria was likely related to the induction of hepatic enzymes. Single cases of loss of conscience occurred at all dose levels in the 13 weeks repeated dose toxicity studies  immediately  or  shortly  after  dosing,  causing  2  deaths;  due  to  lack  of  dose-relationship, unchanged  ECG  and  blood  pressure,  and  lack  of  similar  findings  in  other  monkey  studies  these episodes, were considered related to misdosing based on necropsy data.

Toxicokinetic  data  were  presented  from  all  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  in  rat  and  cynomolgus monkey. There was considerable  inter-individual  variability  in  exposure  in  both  rats  and  monkeys. The monkeys also demonstrated a considerable intra-individual variability. In monkey, there was subproportional relation between dose and exposure at low doses, while a marked increase in exposure

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and increased tmax was observed with the highest doses. A time and dose related reduction in exposure was seen, which is in accordance with an enzyme induction.

In rat, there was a rather proportional relation between the lower doses and exposure, while at high doses the exposure level was sub-proportional to dose. This sub-proportionality was more pronounced in  longer  studies,  and  most  likely  reflected  the  increased  metabolism  due  to  enzyme  induction. Exposure levels for agomelatine were reduced after repeated dosing, especially at the highest doses.

In Table 2 the exposure levels to agomelatine at NOAEL in the different repeated dose toxicity studies have been presented together with the human exposure after 4 weeks repeated daily administration of the intended clinical dose (50 mg/day). Exposure levels in animals are presented as mean and range AUC24, unless otherwise noted.

## · Genotoxicity

The genotoxic potential of agomelatine was evaluated in a battery of tests including multiple bacterial reverse mutation assays, mouse lymphoma cell gene mutation assays, cytogenetic assays on peripheral human lymphocytes and in vivo bone marrow micronucleus and Unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assays  performed  either  after  single  or  repeated  oral  dosing,  as  mechanistic  experiments  for carcinogenicity  studies.  All  studies  were  conducted  with  concomitant  positive  controls.  In  vivo,  no genotoxic potential of agomelatine was found. However, equivocal results were obtained in a mouse lymphoma  assay  in  vitro,  without  performing  an  additional  assay  to  clarify  the  equivocal  results. Positive  results  at  cytotoxic  doses  were  seen  in  a  chromosomal  aberration  assay  with  human lymphocytes. The applicant performed under CHMP request an additional mouse lymphoma assay, which was negative.

## · Carcinogenicity

The carcinogenic potential of agomelatine was studied in mice (125-2000 mg/kg/day) and rats (40-360 mg/kg/day) by oral administration of a dietary admixture for 104 weeks after 13-weeks dose-finding toxicity and toxicokinetic studies in both species. A summary of the pivotal studies and their major findings are presented in Tables 3 and 4.

In mice, the males in the highest dose group had significantly increased number of intra-abdominal masses. Both sexes had increased occurrence of hepatocellular adenomas (at ≥ 500 mg/kg for females and  at  2000  mg/kg  for  males)  and  carcinomas  (at  2000  mg/kg  for  both  sexes),  associated  with basophilic and eosinophilic cell foci and hepatocellular hypertrophy (Table 3).

In  rats,  males  had  increased  occurrence  of  hepatocellular  adenomas  ( ≥ 120  mg/kg)  and  carcinomas (360 mg/kg), associated with increased incidences of foci of hepatocellular alterations and hepatocellular  hypertrophy.  At  the  highest  dose,  both  sexes  had  increased  incidences  of  mammary gland fibroadenomas (Table 4 below).

Due to the high extent of the first-pass metabolism seen in both rodents and humans, calculations of safety margins based on dose (mg/kg) were justified for the agomelatine-induced hepatic tumours: the safety margins (expressed as dose, mg/kg) for the rodent tumours were 150- and 50-fold in the mouse and rat, respectively.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Reproduction  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  rat  (15-240  mg/kg)  and  rabbit (50-450  mg/kg).  Adequate  paternal  and/or  maternal  toxicity  was  confirmed  in  the  high  dose. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that agomelatine and/or its metabolites pass the placenta and are excreted into rat milk, resulting in exposure in utero and through lactation. Agomelatine had no teratogenic  potential,  and  no  adverse  effects  on  sperm  count  or  viability,  fertility,  embryo-foetal development or pre- or postnatal development at doses up to 640 mg/kg/day in rat and 450 mg/kg/day in rabbit, although maternal toxicity was seen at the high doses in all studies.

## · Other toxicity studies

## Immunotoxicity

The 4 weeks immunotoxicity study in rat with doses 25-625 mg/kg/day was performed. Agomelatine at doses ≥ 125 mg/kg/day caused significant decrease in T-helper cell counts and a slight decrease in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the cytotoxic T-cells in females, lower spleen weight without affecting the T-cell dependent immune response.  In  males,  there  was  a  significant  increase  in  B-cells  without  any  histomorphological correlate. The long-term biological relevance of these effects, especially in females, is not known.

## Mechanistic studies

Agomelatine revealed tumorigenic potential in rodents, leading to hepatic tumors in rats and mice and mammary benign fibroadenomas in rats (see above). Set of mechanistic studies were carried out to address this. Toxicokinetic studies showed that males were exposed higher than females, especially at 104  weeks.  The  gender-related  differences  in  occurrence  of  hepatic  tumours  could  be  related  to gender-related differences in exposure. Overall the results allowed to confirm a liver enzyme induction profile  for  agomelatine  in  rats,  with  some  concordance  with  liver  enlargement  and  the  expected thyroid  changes.  However,  a  major  increase  in  the  level  of 32 P  incorporation  in  DNA  bases  was observed  following  28  days  agomelatine  exposure  in  rat  in  vivo  at  exposure  levels  8-fold  human therapeutic exposure at 50 mg/day. The relevance and the meaning of these DNA adducts is unknown.

Although studies indicated that neither agomelatine nor its metabolites were forming DNA adducts in vitro, the identity of the in vivo adducts was not established. The applicant speculated that the DNA modifications  might  be  related  to  the  enzyme  induction,  without  presenting  any  supporting  data. Further  evidence  was  considered  necessary  to  demonstrate  the  proposed  mechanism  of  adduct formation. Furthermore, elucidation of the adduct nature should also be performed. The applicant has planned to carry out a dietary study in Fisher rats to address the possible adduct formation after single and  28-day  repeated  administration  of  agomelatine.  If  formed  after  single  dose  administration,  the adducts  characterisation  would  be  also  performed.  Overall,  the  potential  clinical  relevance  of  these findings remained unknown.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) in surface water was calculated to be 0.25 µg/l. This was above the action limit of 0.01 µg/l, and a phase II tier A assessment was therefore performed.

In  the  phase  II  tier  A  assessment  the  acute  toxicity  of  agomelatine  to  fish  and  daphnids,  and  the inhibition of growth of algae, were determined and a predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) was calculated  based  on  the  most  sensitive  species.  The  ratio  PECSURFACE  WATER:  PNECAQUATIC  was determined to be 0.33. Since the ratio was below 1, agomelatine was unlikely to represent a risk for the aquatic environment. The effect of agomelatine on micro-organisms present in sewage treatment plant was determined, and PNEC was calculated. The ratio PECMICRO-ORGANISMS: PNECMICRO-ORGANISMS was determined to be 0.0001875. Since the ratio was below 1, agomelatine was unlikely to represent a risk for sewage treatment plants. No further assessment in a phase II tier B was therefore required.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

Methods for the analysis of agomelatine in human samples involved liquid or solid phase extraction followed by reverse phase liquid-chromatography (LC) and native fluorescence detection, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry method (LC/MS-MS). The  LC/MS-MS method was adapted for the simultaneous determination of agomelatine and some of its metabolites in human  plasma  (3-OH-A,  3,4-dihydrodiol-A  and  7-O-desmethyl-A).  Metabolite  identification  was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

achieved  by  comparison  with  authentic  reference  compounds  and  using  on-line  LC/MS-MS  and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

## · Absorption

In  vitro the  intestinal  transport  of  agomelatine  across  a  Caco-2  cell  monolayer  was  high  through passive  diffusion  and  corresponded  to  a  predicted in  vivo human rapid  and  total  absorption  of  the compound. In vivo , as reflected by the urinary recovery of radioactivity following oral administration of [3H]-agomelatine and [14C]-agomelatine gastrointestinal absorption was at least 81 ± 4.2% of the dose,  and  rapid  (Tmax  &lt;  1h).  Agomelatine  was  rapidly  and  well  ( ≥ 80%)  absorbed  after  oral administration.

No formal bioavailability study with oral and i.v. administration of agomelatine in the same subject was  performed.  Absolute  bioavailability  was  estimated  to  be  (by  a  population  pharmacokinetic approach on pooled phase I data from oral and i.v. administration) 3.4% with high variability (160%) and  influenced  by  covariates  (sex,  dose  and  time  of  administration).  The  peak  concentration  was reached within 1 to 2 hours after administration.

Food intake did not modify the extent of bioavailable agomelatine for elderly subjects but it increased the delay and possibly decreased the rate of absorption as compared with administration of the drug under fasted conditions. In young volunteers a slight decrease of mean Cmax (20%) between fasted and  fed  conditions  without  modification  in  AUC  was  observed.  However,  this  decrease  was  not clinically  relevant,  taking  into  account  the  variability  of  agomelatine  pharmacokinetics.  Therefore agomelatine can be administered with or without meals.

## · Distribution

Steady-state  volume  of  distribution  (Vss)  was  determined  as  about  35L  after  i.v.  administration  of agomelatine and was dose independent.

Agomelatine was bound to plasma proteins at 95% mainly to serum albumin (about 35%) and alpha1acid glycoprotein (about 36%).

## · Elimination

Agomelatine  was  mainly  catalysed  by  CYP1A2;  CYP2C9  and  CYP2C19,  at  equal  levels,  also participated in elimination, but as minor secondary enzymes. CYP1A1 (mainly extrahepatic in human) was also shown to metabolise agomelatine.

Agomelatine  was  a  relatively  potent  competitive  CYP1A2  inhibitor,  but  40-fold  less  potent  than fluvoxamine.

The potential  of  induction  by  agomelatine  of  CYP1A2,  CYP2C9  and  CYP3A4  was  also  compared with known inducers (rifampicin and dioxin). Agomelatine was not an inducer of the CYP450-related monoxygenase  activities  tested:  acetanilide  hydroxylase  (CYP1A2),  tolbutamide  4-hydroxylase (CYP2C9) and cyclosporin A oxidase (CYP3A4).

Overall,  dihydrodiol  metabolite  formation,  3-hydroxy-7-desmethylation  and  3-hydroxylation  were found  to  be  the  major  circulating  metabolic  pathways  of  agomelatine  in  human  with  respectively 28.3%, 27.5% and 10.3% of the circulating radioactivity.

The non conjugated metabolites having some pharmacological activity (3-hydroxy (S 21540) and 7desmethyl (S 21517) were  not detected in plasma at therapeutic doses.

Urinary  excretion  of  unchanged  agomelatine  was  negligible  (0.01%  of  an  intravenous  dose). Following  oral  administration,  urine  was  the  main  route  of  excretion  of  metabolites  (mainly glucuronides):  80.6  ±  3.6%  of  the  [14C]-agomelatine  dose  (PKH-012)  and  78  ±  4.7%  of  the  [3H]agomelatine dose. Elimination of agomelatine was rapid with a mean Cl ~1100mL/min and a mean t1/2 ~1h, thus accumulation is not foreseeable.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

A clear dose dependency was observed for oral doses above 50 mg, consistent with saturation of the first pass effect. Upon repeated dose administration, no accumulation effect was observed, consistent with the short terminal half-life of agomelatine.

The  inter-individual  variability  of  agomelatine  exposure  was  large  (CV  between  40  and  160%), probably due to the individual variation of CYP 1A2 activity. The intra-individual variability was also large (123%) probably due to the variation of the first-pass effect.

There was no difference between healthy volunteers and patients pharmacokinetic parameters.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Special populations

Impaired  renal  function:  In  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters Cmax and AUC were slightly higher than in healthy subjects. However, due to the high interindividual variability  (90%  Confidence  Intervals  for  Cmax  and  AUC  were  0.397  -  5.02  and  0.407  -  3.78, respectively) of agomelatine pharmacokinetics, this result was  not clinically relevant. Renal impairment did not affect the protein binding of agomelatine.

Impaired hepatic function: Following a single oral dose of 25mg agomelatine in patients with hepatic impairment,  Cmax  increased  by  a  factor  of  ~60  and  ~110,  while  AUC  increased  by  ~70-times  and ~140-times, in mild (Child-Pugh score of 5 or 6) and moderate (Child-Pugh score of 7 to 9) hepatic impairment,  respectively.  Both  mild  and  moderate  liver  impairment  increased  the  half-life  of agomelatine by a factor of ~3. The unbound fraction of agomelatine was also increased in subjects with  hepatic  insufficiency.  The  interindividual  variability  decreased  with  mild  hepatic  impairment, with  a  further  decrease  in  moderate  hepatic  impairment,  suggesting  a  progressive  saturation  of  the hepatic  first-pass  effect.  Agomelatine  should  therefore  be  contraindicated  in  patients  with  hepatic insufficiency.

Gender, smoking and age: No significant difference in exposure was shown between the young and the elderly as well as between males and females. Nevertheless, females were more exposed than men. A 3.7-fold  decrease  in  mean  exposure  was  observed  in  heavy  smokers;  this  decrease  was  larger  in young volunteers (factor 7-9.5) than in elderly ones (factor 1.3-2.4) suggesting that cigarette smoke could induce CYP 1A2 involved in the metabolism of agomelatine.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

The use of specific inhibitors of various CYP450 isoenzymes in human liver microsomes showed that CYP1A  and  CYP2C  were  the  main  enzymes  responsible  for  the  metabolism  of  agomelatine.  In human,  the  principal  isoenzymes  were  CYP1A2  together  with  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19  and  CYP1A1 (extrahepatic) to a lesser extent.

Based  on in  vitro results,  pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies  in  human  volunteers  were  performed with  fluvoxamine,  theophylline  paroxetine,  fluconazole,  lorazepam  lithium  and  ethanol.  The  only significant  interaction  found  was  with  fluvoxamine,  which  was  a  strong  inhibitor  of  agomelatine metabolism, increasing the plasma Cmax and AUC of agomelatine by 47-fold and 61-fold, respectively and by a factor of 2.5 for t1/2.

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

Agomelatine  is  a  potent  agonist  of  melatonin  (MT1  and  MT2)  receptors  with  5-HT2C  antagonist properties. It is also a 5-HT2B antagonist. Agomelatine does not interact with adenosine, adrenergic, dopamine, GABA, muscarinic, nicotinic, histamine, excitatory amino acid, benzodiazepine and sigma receptors, nor with sodium, potassium or calcium channels.

Through its 5-HT2C antagonist effect, agomelatine increases dopamine and noradrenaline release specifically in the prefrontal cortex.

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

The rationale for the use of agomelatine in major depression is based not only on melatonin agonist properties of agomelatine but also on its 5-HT2C antagonist properties. A pure melatoninergic action is not necessarily antidepressant and the combination with the 5-HT2C antagonist action in agomelatine may  be  needed. Agomelatine  showed  only minor biological effects in the phase I and II pharmacodynamic studies. Sleep EEG indicated a possible sleep improvement and an advance in sleep onset at low doses of agomelatine. Wake EEG after morning administration of agomelatine pointed towards  a  mild  sedative  effect.  The  results  of  wake  EEG  after  evening  administration  were inconclusive. Different subjective rating scales indicated no powerful sedative or activating effect in healthy volunteers. As an adverse event, sedation was observed in healthy volunteers independently of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administration time (morning or evening). For the core body temperature, a slight, but not consistent temperature  decrease  was  seen.  Comparing  venlafaxine  and  agomelatine  with  regard  to  sexual function and sexual dysfunction, there was a numerical trend in favour of agomelatine on all scores; only some of the secondary measures showed statistically significant differences.

## Clinical efficacy

The  efficacy  and  safety  of  agomelatine  in  major  depressive  disorder  were  studied  in  a  clinical development programme in which agomelatine was administered to more than 2400 patients and 400 healthy volunteers in 25 countries in Europe, Africa, South America, Australia and North America. The development programme for short-term efficacy consisted of one pilot study (CL2-007) and six short-term  placebo-controlled  efficacy studies in MDD [one dose-finding study (CL2-014) and five other  studies  (CL3-022,  -023,  -024,  -042  and  -043)].  One  placebo-controlled  study  in  an  elderly population (CL3-026) and one dose response study in partial responders (without placebo) (CL3-025) were also performed. Long-term efficacy was examined in a relapse prevention study (CL3-021), and three double-blind placebo-controlled extensions of short-term studies (CL3-022, -023, -024 extensions).

Long-term safety was investigated for 1-year treatment exposure in three studies, one double-blind, placebo-controlled (CL3-021) and two open-label (CL3-025 and CL3-029) and, for 6-month treatment exposure in five placebo-controlled studies (CL3-022, -023, -024, -026 and -027).

Five  clinical  studies  were  designed  to  evaluate  particular  aspects  of  safety.  Three  studies  were performed in healthy volunteers, two assessed safety on gonadotrophic function (CL1-032, CL1-034) and one cardiovascular safety (CL1-033). Two active controlled studies investigated specific aspects of  safety  in  MDD  patients i.e. possible  discontinuation  syndrome  (CL3-030)  and  impact  on  sexual function (CL3-036). Two other pilot studies which aimed at evaluating agomelatine in largely resistant hospitalised  depressed  patients  (CL3-027)  and  Bipolar  I  depressed  patients  (CL3-029)  were  also conducted.

Five studies in MDD were on-going at the time of submission: an active-controlled study evaluating the efficacy on subjective sleep (CL3-035), an open polysomnography study (CL3-038), two doubleblind 46-week agomelatine extension studies (CL3-042, CL3-043 extensions) and a relapse prevention study (CL3-041). In addition, a recurrence prevention study in seasonal affective disorder (CL3-037) and a pilot study in generalised anxiety disorder (CL2-040) were ongoing at the time of submission.

In  the  early  agomelatine  development  programme,  studies  in  patients  with  other  diseases,  such  as sleep/wake disorders (delayed sleep phase syndrome, primary insomnia, sleep/wake disorders in blind patients or in demented patients) and schizophrenia as add-on therapy, were performed. A pilot open study was also performed in children suffering from Smith-Magenis syndrome, a rare genetic disease of which a characteristic feature is an inversion of melatonin rhythm (CL2-044).

## METHODS

## Treatments

The treatments in different studies are presented in Table 5 above.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Objective of all the main studies was to study efficacy and safety of agomelatine in the treatment of major depressive disorder (or related areas, like sleep, sexual function).

## Study Participants

Patients entering the placebo-controlled efficacy studies on agomelatine were required to satisfy the DSM-IV  diagnostic  criteria  for  Major  Depressive  Disorder  (MDD),  single  or  recurrent  episode (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). A minimum severity of depression on the HAM-D (17-item HAM-D total score ≥ 22) was defined for entry into all protocols except for the study in elderly (CL3026)  where  a  severity  was  defined  on  the  MADRS  (MADRS  total  score ≥ 24).  In  addition  in  two studies (CL2-014 and CL3-022) patients were required to have a minimum severity of ≥ 4 (moderate severity of illness) on the clinical global impression severity scale (CGI-S). Patients with a significant risk  of  suicide  judged  by  the  clinician  were  excluded  from  all  studies  and,  in  most  of  the  placebocontrolled  studies  patients  with  a  score  of  three  or  more  on  the  HAM-D  suicide  item  were  also excluded. A washout was required for patients treated previously with psychotropic medications that were  contra-indicated  in  the  protocols.  Concomitant  treatment  with  drugs  thought  to  interfere  with study evaluations (central α blockers, systemic corticosteroids and exogenous melatonin) was also not allowed.  Stabilized  (at  least  one  month)  benzodiazepines  (BZDs)  were  allowed  at  limited  doses  in most studies except study CL3-043 where the use of any BZDs was contra-indicated. Short-term use of an occasional limited dose (single tablet) of hypnotics (zolpidem or zopiclone) was allowed for the first two weeks of most studies.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy outcome measure was the 17-item HAM-D total score for all protocols, except for  protocol  CL3-026  where  the  MADRS  total  score  was  used  to  avoid  an  overrating  of  somatic complaints in elderly patients. Secondary efficacy outcome measures for depression were the MADRS and HAM-D total scores (where they were not used as primary) except for studies CL3-042 and CL3043, and the clinical global impression of severity (CGI-S) and improvement (CGI-I). StudiesCL3-036 and CL3-035 addressed sexual and sleep functions, respectively.

## Statistical methods

Different patients sets were defined according to ICH E9 Guideline (CPMP/ICH/363/96, 1998). The definitions of the main patients sets were mainly the same in all the studies:

- Randomised set (RS): all patients included and randomised.

-  Full  analysis  set  (FAS)  (in  accordance  with  the  intention-to-treat  principle  (CPMP/ICH/363/96, 1998)): Randomised patients having taken at least one dose of study medication and having at least one post-baseline value for the primary efficacy criterion (for any efficacy criterion for studies CL3042 and CL3-043) over the mandatory double-blind period.

Details of the statistical methods used are given in Table 6 below.

## RESULTS

- Dose response studies

Study CL2-007: Pilot double-blind, randomised, non-placebo-controlled, parallel group study on safety  and  efficacy  of  agomelatine  at  a  dose  of  5mg  or  100mg  once  a  day  for  one  month  in patients with a Major Depressive Episode.

Repeated  administration  of  agomelatine  5mg  or  100mg  once  daily  for  four  weeks  had  similar antidepressant activity, with no impairment of the vigilance and performances. Both doses were well tolerated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study  CL2-014:  Dose-finding  study.  Efficacy  and  safety  of  3  doses  of  agomelatine  (1,  5  and 25mg) given  orally  once  a  day  for  8  weeks  versus placebo  in  patients  with  Major  Depressive Disorder  or  bipolar  depression  (bipolar  II).  Double-blind,  placebo  controlled  study  (using paroxetine 20mg as positive control).

## Baseline data

No relevant between-group differences were observed at baseline. The mean age of the patients was 42.3 years [19-65]; two thirds of them were female patients. They had a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder according to DSM-IV criteria, single (31.1%) or recurrent episode (67.1%) or a diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder according to DSM-IV criteria (1.8%). They had a mean number of 2.7 MDE and the mean duration of their current episode was 5.0 months. At selection, 19.3% of the patients were hospitalized.

## Outcomes and estimation

There was a statistically significant difference between the 25mg agomelatine dose and placebo (p &lt; 0.034), as well as between paroxetine and placebo in the HAM-D total score (see Table 7 below). No difference was seen with the doses of 1 and 5mg.

The 25 mg dose was the best dose, although dose response relationship was not clear: the 1 mg had some markers of efficacy, while the 5 mg had none.

- Main studies

Study CL3-022: Efficacy and safety of fixed dose agomelatine (25mg) given orally once a day for 6 weeks versus placebo in patients with Major Depressive Disorder. A randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled  3  parallel  group  study  (using  fluoxetine  20mg  as  positive  control)  with  a further 18-week double-blind extension treatment period.

The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of agomelatine comparing to placebo using the HAM-D rating Scale in patients with MDD treated for 6 weeks. Secondary objective was to assess the safety on long-term use of agomelatine.

## Baseline data

No relevant between-group differences were observed for demographic data or baseline characteristics. The mean age of the patients was 42.4 years [19-60]; two thirds of them were female. They  had  a  mean  of  2.7  MDE  and  the  median  duration  of  their  current  episode  was  72  days.  At selection,  13.4% of the patients were hospitalised. About 50% of the patients received concomitant benzodiazepine treatment during the acute period.

## Outcomes and estimation

Short-term efficacy results: There was no statistically significant difference between the agomelatine and  the  placebo  groups  on  the  HAM-D  total  score.  There  was  a  statistically  significant  difference between the agomelatine and the placebo groups on the CGI-I. There were no statistically significant differences  between  agomelatine  and  placebo  groups  with  respect  to  MADRS  total  score,  response (53% versus 47%, respectively) or remission (14% versus 16%, respectively) rates.

There was a statistically significance difference between the fluoxetine and the placebo group on the HAM-D total score, CGI-I and MADRS total score. There were no statistically significant differences between  the  fluoxetine  and  the  placebo  groups  with  respect  to  response  (58%  versus  47%, respectively) and remission (19% versus 16%, respectively) rates.

Efficacy results of the extension period: A total of 299 patients entered the extension period (73% of FAS patients). Among them, 198 patients (66.2%) were responders at the end of the acute period. The mean final HAM-D total score over the W6-W24 period were 10.0 ± 8.4, 10.7 ± 8.5 and 8.4 ± 6.5 in the agomelatine, placebo and fluoxetine groups, respectively.

Sustained response analysis: Among acute period responders in extension period 19.0%, 36.1% and 20.3% in the agomelatine, placebo and fluoxetine groups, respectively, had a loss of response over the W6-W24 period, and the survival curve analysis showed a statistically significant difference in favor of  agomelatine  compared  to  placebo  (p  =  0.033).  Fluoxetine  was  also  significantly  different  from placebo on this analysis (p = 0.039).

Relapse analysis: Among acute period responders in extension period with HAM-D total &lt; 16 at W6, 14.3%,  33.3%  and  17.8%  in  the  agomelatine,  placebo  and  fluoxetine  groups,  respectively,  had  a relapse  over  the  W6-W24  period,  and  the  survival  curve  analysis  of  the  time  to  relapse  showed  a statistically  significant  difference  in  favour  of  agomelatine  (p  =  0.017)  and  fluoxetine  (p  =  0.045) compared to placebo.

Study CL3-023: Efficacy and safety of fixed dose agomelatine (25mg) given orally once a day for 6  weeks  versus  placebo  in  patients  with  Major  Depressive  Disorder.  A  randomised,  doubleblind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups study (using paroxetine 20mg as positive control) with a further 18-week optional double-blind treatment period.

## Baseline data

No relevant between-group differences were observed for demographic or baseline characteristics. The mean age of the patients was 40.9 years [18-60]; 75% were female. They had a mean of 3.0 MDE and the mean duration of their current episode was 4.4 months. At selection, 12.0% of the patients were hospitalised. About 22% of patients received concomitant benzodiazepine treatment during the acute period.

## Outcomes and estimation

Both agomelatine and the active control paroxetine failed to show statistically significant differences from  placebo  over  the  6-week  acute  period  on  the  primary  outcome  criterion.  Over  the  18-week extension period (with 289 patients of which 208 were responders at the end of the acute period) no difference in maintenance of response could be shown between either agomelatine or paroxetine and placebo.

Study  CL3-024:  Efficacy  and  safety  of  fixed  dose  agomelatine  (25mg  and  50mg)  given  orally once  a  day  for  6  weeks  versus placebo  in  patients  with  Major  Depressive  Disorder.  A randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel  group  study  (using  fluoxetine  20mg  as positive control), with a further optional 18-week double-blind extension period.

## Baseline data

No  relevant  between-group  differences  were  observed  for  the  main  demographic  or  baseline characteristics. The mean age of the patients was 40.9 years [18-65]; 72.5% of patients were female. The mean number of Major Depressive Episodes was 3.0 and the mean duration of the current episode was  3.3  months.  At  selection,  3.6%  of  the  patients  were  hospitalised.  About  25%  of  the  patients received benzodiazepines during the acute period.

## Outcomes and estimation

Both  agomelatine  25mg  or  50mg,  and  the  active  control  fluoxetine  failed  to  show  a  statistically significant difference from placebo over the 6-week acute period on the primary outcome criterion. Over the 18-week extension period (with 449 patient of which 327 were responders at the end of the acute  period),  there  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  either  of  the  doses  of agomelatine or fluoxetine and placebo at maintaining response in acute period responders and placebo was associated with very low relapse rate.

Study CL3-042: Efficacy and safety of fixed dose agomelatine (25mg with double-blind potential adjustment  at  50mg)  given  orally  once  a  day  for  6  weeks  in  patients  with  Major  Depressive Disorder. A randomized flexible dose double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study.

## Baseline data

No relevant between-group differences were observed regarding demographic or baseline characteristics. The mean age of the patients was 45.0 years [18-65]; 73.5% of them were female. The mean number of Major Depressive Episodes was 2.7 and the mean duration of the current episode was 3.9 months. The majority (95%) of the patients were out-patients. Treatment duration over the W0-W6 period was on average 39.0 days in the randomized set (RS), with a median of 42 days (range from 1 to 56 days) and no relevant differences between groups were observed. A total of 66 patients (27.7% of the RS) received benzodiazepine during treatment.

Most agomelatine patients remained with the initial 25mg dose. In patients with poor improvement after 2 weeks with agomelatine 25mg who had a dose increase to 50mg, the improvement at endpoint was better than in patients on placebo.

Study CL3-043: Efficacy and safety of fixed dose agomelatine (25mg with double-blind potential adjustment  to  50mg)  given  orally  once  a  day  for  6  weeks  in  patients  with  Major  Depressive Disorder. A randomised flexible dose double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study.

## Baseline data

No relevant between-group differences were observed for demographic or baseline characteristics. The mean age of the patients was 42.5 years [18-65]; 59.9% of them were female. The mean number of Major Depressive Episodes was 2.6 and the mean duration of the current episode was 6.0 months. All patients were ambulatory. Treatment duration over the W0-W6 period was on average 40.3 days, with a median of 42 days (range from 1 to 48 days).

## Outcomes and estimation

There was a statistically significant difference in favor of agomelatine, as compared to placebo, on the primary outcome criterion, HAM-D total score in the FAS, see Table 11 below.

The results on the HAM-D total score were confirmed on the analysis of the response rate and CGISeverity  of  illness  score,  which  showed  statistically  significant  differences  in  favor  of  agomelatine. There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  agomelatine  and  placebo  groups  with respect  to  remission  rates  (20.8% versus 13.3%,  respectively).  Most  agomelatine  patients  remained with the initial 25mg dose; in patients with poor improvement after 2 weeks with agomelatine 25mg who had a dose increase to 50mg, the improvement at endpoint was better than in patients on placebo.

Study CL3-021: Maintenance therapy with agomelatine (25mg) given orally once a day for the prevention  of  relapse  in  patients  with  recurrent  depression.  A  randomised  double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 6-month study following a 2-month open treatment with an optional 4-month double-blind extension period .

## Baseline data

No relevant between-group differences in demographic or baseline characteristics were observed. The mean age of the patients of the RS was 45.7 years [19-67]; 77.9% of them were female. They had a mean  number  of  4.4  MDE  (including  the  current  episode)  and  the  mean  duration  of  their  current episode was 2.5 months. At selection, 3.1% of the patients were hospitalised. A total of 26.2% of the patients  received  a  psychotropic  treatment  at  least  once  during  mandatory  double-blind  period.  The mean baseline (W8) HAM-D total score was 6.1 ± 2.9  in  the  agomelatine group and 6.4 ± 3.4 in the placebo group. Treatment duration ranged from 1 to 226 days with a mean of 149.4 days over the W8W34 period.

## Outcomes and estimation

Open period results (8 weeks): The mean HAM-D total score decreased from 26.3 ± 2.9 at baseline to 8.4 ± 6.1  at  W8.  A  total  of  85.3%  of  patients  showed  response  to  treatment  (decrease  of  baseline HAM-D total score ≥ 50%) at W8. The majority of patients (83.3%) also met the protocolled criterion for randomization (HAM-D total score ≤ 10 at W8).

Relapse prevention results: In the main analysis, the treatment periods W8-W34 and W10-W34 were considered,  the  latter  allowing  distinguishing  rapid  discontinuation  signs  or  rebound  phenomenon from early depressive relapse. 25.9% and 23.5% of patients had a relapse on agomelatine and placebo, respectively;  the  time  to  relapse  showed  no  statistical  difference  between  groups  over  the  W8-W34 period. (See Table 12 below.)

E:Estimate;SE:Standard Error;RR:relative risk

Optional double-blind extension period (4 months) results: A total of 225 patients entered the optional double-blind extension period (118 on agomelatine and 107 on placebo). The secondary analyses of the primary criterion over the W8-W52 period did not show significant differences between treatment groups in the total population: 54 (29.2%) patients had a relapse in the agomelatine group versus 51 (28.5%) in the placebo group. In an additional analysis in the subgroup with baseline HAM-D total score &gt; 25 and CGI-S score ≥ 5 (169 patients: 89 agomelatine, 80 placebo), the difference observed on time to relapse over W8-W52 between agomelatine and placebo was statistically significant (Logrank, p = 0.046; Cox RR = 1.749).

Overall,  this  relapse  prevention  study  failed  to  show  a  significant  effect  of  agomelatine  25mg compared to placebo on the primary criterion in the total population.

- Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

The efficacy of agomelatine in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) was evaluated primarily on shortterm in six randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies in adults using the 17item HAM-D total score as pre-specified primary endpoint (CL2-014, CL3-022, -023, -024, -042 and 043).  One  additional  specific  randomised  double-blind  placebo-controlled  study  evaluated  the antidepressant efficacy of agomelatine on short-term in elderly patients, using the MADRS total score (CL3-026).

Meta-analyses were conducted on three different pools of placebo-controlled adult studies in order to examine the overall effect of agomelatine, to evaluate the efficacy of agomelatine on specific criteria (anxiety and sleep items of HAM-D, CGI scores) or in subpopulations and to evaluate the effect of agomelatine on sleep symptoms using the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ).

The  antidepressant  efficacy  of  agomelatine  25  or  25-50mg  was  investigated  in  three  placebocontrolled  studies  (CL2-014,  CL3-042,  -043),  that  showed  statistically  significant  differences  from placebo on the primary outcome criterion HAM-D total score and consistent results across secondary criteria  (see  Tables  13-16).  Two  studies  (CL-023,  CL-024)  were  inconclusive  studies  (also  positive control failed), and in CL-022 agomelatine failed to show efficacy whereas fluoxetine showed positive effect.

In the pool of all placebo-controlled studies (positive, negative and failed studies), including all tested agomelatine doses, treatment effects were in favour of agomelatine (heterogenicity test, p = 0.131) and the meta-analysis demonstrated a significant difference of 1.55 (95% CI [0.61; 2.48]) in favour of agomelatine on the primary outcome criterion HAM-D total score.

In the positive placebo controlled studies at therapeutic doses (25, 50 mg, see table 14) the treatment effects were in favour of agomelatine. The meta-analysis demonstrated a significant difference of 2.86 (95% CI [1.75; 3.97]) in favour of agomelatine on the primary outcome criterion HAM-D total score, as well as on secondary efficacy criteria compared to placebo (see Tables 15 and 16).

The efficacy  of  agomelatine  in  the  elderly  was  evaluated  in  comparison  with  placebo  in  the  metaanalysis performed on data from the elderly patients aged 60 and above in three placebo-controlled studies (CL2-014, CL3-042 and CL3-043). Agomelatine revealed significantly greater efficacy than placebo in the elderly subgroup, as measured on the primary HAM-D measure. The magnitude of the agomelatine placebo difference in the elderly was 4.50 points (p=0.033).

- Clinical studies in special populations

Study CL3-026: Efficacy and safety of fixed dose agomelatine (25mg) given orally once a day for 6 weeks in elderly (&gt;60 years) patients with Major Depressive Disorder. A randomised doubleblind,  placebo-controlled parallel groups study with a further 18-week double-blind extension period.

Short-term efficacy results: No  statistically significant difference was  observed between the agomelatine  and  the  placebo  groups  on  primary  outcome  criterion  MADRS  total  score,  nor  in  the secondary  efficacy  criteria  HAM-D  total  score,  CGI  scores  or  MADRS  secondary  expressions (responder and remission rates).

Efficacy  results  of  the  double-blind  extension  period:  A  total  of  127  patients  entered  the  extension period; 94 (74.0%) were responders at the end of the acute period. The mean final MADRS total score over the W6-W24 period were 10.6 ± 9.4 in the agomelatine group and 9.6 ± 8.7 in the placebo group.

Study CL3-025: Efficacy and safety of agomelatine 50mg/day in patients with Major Depressive Disorder with partial response to 4-week treatment with agomelatine 25mg/day. A randomised double-blind,  parallel  groups,  4-week  study,  with  a  further  4-month  double-blind  extension period and with a 12-month open study for responder patients.

## Baseline data

The  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  of  partial  responder  patients  randomised  in  the  acute double-blind period showed no relevant between-group differences. The mean age of the patients was 43.8 years [18-69] and 75.0% were female.

Additional  long-term  data  became  available  during  the  procedure  from  two  6-month  venlafaxine comparative studies:

Study CL3-035: Efficacy of agomelatine (25 mg with potential adjustment at 50 mg) given orally for 6 weeks versus venlafaxine on subjective sleep evaluation of patients with Major Depressive Disorder. A randomized double-blind parallel group study, with an optional continuation for 18 weeks.

## Baseline data

No relevant  between-group  differences  were  observed  for  the  main  demographic  data  and  baseline characteristics. The mean age ± SD was 40.1 ± 10.5 years and 71.1% of the patients were female. On average 2.2 ± 1.9 depressive episodes, including the current one, were reported; the median duration of the current episode was 2.8 months.

## Outcomes and estimation

The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that agomelatine improved subjective sleep faster than venlafaxine in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. The mean LSEQ getting off  to  sleep  score  decreased  over  the  week  0  -week  6  period  in  both  treatment  groups  showing  a continuing  improvement  in  the  patients'  falling  asleep.  From  the  week  1  the  mean  score  was statistically significantly lower in agomelatine group than in venlafaxine group and remainedlower up to week 6 visit as well as the last value (p=0.008).

In the analyses of the long-term efficacy (secondary objective), agomelatine 25-50 mg was shown to be superior to venlafaxine 75-150mg (p=0.025) over 6 months. The magnitude of the difference on CGI-I  in  favour  of  agomelatine  at  6  months  (0.32  points)  was  similar  to  the  difference  observed between  agomelatine  and  placebo  in  the  meta-analysis  of  the  three  pivotal  short-term,  placebocontrolled  studies  (CL2-014,  CL3-042,  CL3-043). This result was supported by trends in favour of agomelatine in the long-term analysis on the remitters (60.0% versus 50.3% respectively, p=0.076).

Study CL3-036: Sexual function after 3 months of treatment with agomelatine (50 mg/day) in stable remitted depressed patients. A  3-month, randomised, double-blind study, versus venlafaxine (150 mg/day) with an optional period of additional 3 months.

## Baseline data

No relevant  between-group  differences  were  observed  for  the  main  demographic  data  and  baseline characteristics. The mean age ± SD was 40.9 ± 10.2 years and 71.8% of the patients were female. On average 2.4 ± 1.4 depressive episodes, including the current one, were reported; the median duration of the current episode was 3.0 months.

## Outcomes and estimation

The primary objective of the study was to compare the global sexual function, assessed by the Sex Effects scale (SEX FX total core) of remitted depressed patients treated with agomelatine 50 mg with that  of  remitted  depressed  patients  treated  with  venlafaxine  150  mg  from  baseline  to  week  12.  The dose  of  venlafaxine  was  raised  in  all  patients  from  75mg  to  150mg  at  2  weeks  but  the  dose  of agomelatine was fixed from the beginning of the study. The SEX FX-results are presented in Table 18 below.

In the analyses of the long-term efficacy (secondary objective), agomelatine 50mg was not inferior to venlafaxine  150mg  (p=0.006)  over  6  months  using  -2  points  on  the  total  MADRS  as  the  noninferiority margin.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

The clinical development programme of agomelatine was large and well-conducted, and also GCPcompliant according to the applicant.

The demonstration of efficacy of agomelatine in the treatment of major depression was not conclusive. The issues identified were the following:

The dose-finding process for agomelatine was not optimal. In the overall clinical program it was difficult  to  distinguish  greater  efficacy  with  the  dose  of  50  mg  in  comparison  to  the  initial recommended dose 25 mg, although a fraction of the patients improved from this dose increase.

Demonstration  of  short-term  efficacy:  At  short-term  (6  weeks)  three  trials  (including  the  dosefinding one) were able to discriminate agomelatine from placebo. In the flexible dose design trials the rate of responders in agomelatine was superior to placebo. Out of these 3 trials only one (CL2014)  had  an  active  comparator  arm  (paroxetine  20  mg).  The  effect  size  of  agomelatine  and paroxetine were in the same range. Four other trials including the trial on elderly patients failed to discriminate from placebo. One of these trials had assay sensitivity because fluoxetine, used as a comparator, did discriminate from placebo, which suggests that the effect size of agomelatine was smaller than fluoxetine 20 mg. It is noteworthy that in all trials fairly severe patients were enrolled excluding the explanation that the failure was due to a 'flooring effect'. The effect size measured

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from baseline to endpoint was large in both active- and placebo-treated groups. Taken together, the  data  from  the  short-term  efficacy  trials  could  indicate  that  agomelatine  25  to  50  mg  in  the treatment of major depression exerted a clinical effect the magnitude of which could not lead to firm conclusion of clinical efficacy.

Demonstration  of  long-term  efficacy: There  was  only  one  pivotal  long-term  trial  (relapse prevention  trial)  and  this  failed  to  discriminate  agomelatine  from  placebo.  Data  on  long-term efficacy could also be derived from a) a double-blind extension of a short-term trial and b) two double-blind venlafaxine-controlled trials conducted in MDD patients to study sleep disturbances or  sexual  dysfunction.  However,  even  though  the  applicant  analysed  all  the  available  data  in various  ways,  and  even  though  these  data  may  have  pointed  towards  maintenance  of  efficacy, none of these analyses were conclusive (studies were not primarily designed to evaluate long-term efficacy). Further, the data from venlafaxine-controlled trials had major methodological shortcomings,  e.g.  they  did  not  have  depression  as  the  primary  variable,  and  the  evaluation  of depression was based only on CGI score in CL3-035 and on MADRS score in CL3-036-study. Thus, these data were suggestive of a beneficial effect of agomelatine in the long-term treatment of major depression, but could not be considered conclusive.

## Clinical safety

The safety of agomelatine was investigated in 51 completed studies and 6 on-going studies at the time of submission. Among these studies, 26 studies were conducted in healthy or patient volunteers.

## · Patient exposure

A  total  of  3476  patients  were  exposed  to  agomelatine.  Of  these,  2757  were  suffering  from  Major Depressive Disorder. 200 patients received agomelatine 25 mg for 350 days or more.

The short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled, MDD Safety Set included 1120 patients receiving agomelatine  at  25/50  mg  doses.  The  long-term,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  MDD  Safety  Set included 511 depressed patients treated up to 24 weeks with agomelatine 25/50 mg.  273 patients in the MDD population were 60 years or older.

includingbipolar and largely resistant hospitalisedpafients in addition, 9 children with Smith-Magenis Syndrome exposed to agomelatine and 33 patients ofcross-over shudies who have not received agomelatine in fhefirst treatment period were not taken into account,according to OSA rules

## · Adverse events

The short-term, double-blind placebo-controlled MDD safety set.

The commonly reported adverse events (&gt; 1%) in the pooled group of agomelatine 25/50 mg, placebo and active comparators are detailed in Table 22.

Of  the  most  commonly  reported  adverse  events,  dizziness  (exc  vertigo)  was  observed  with  a significantly higher frequency in the agomelatine 25/50 mg group than in the placebo group. Other frequently reported emergent adverse events were nausea, dry mouth, somnolence, diarrhoea NOS and abdominal pain upper.

In  addition,  the  following  less  commonly  reported  adverse  events  had  a  higher  incidence  in  the agomelatine 25/50 mg group than in the placebo group: paraesthesia NEC, migraine NOS, sweating increased,  blurred  vision,  anxiety  NEC,  pruritus  NOS,  abnormal  dreams,  aggravated  anxiety, irritability.

Agomelatine at the 50 mg dose appeared to cause a slightly higher rate of AEs than at the 25 mg dose.

In the short-term double-blind placebo-controlled MDD studies, the most frequent emergent adverse events  on  agomelatine  25/50mg  occurred  mainly  within  the  first  2  weeks  of  treatment,  with  a secondary peak of frequency after 3 to 4 weeks of treatment for diarrhoea and upper abdominal pain. Therefore,  the  majority  of  patients  experienced  emergent  adverse  events  within  the  first  month  of treatment.

The long-term double-blind placebo-controlled MDD safety set.

Adverse events reported by at least 1% of patients are listed in Table 21.

%: (n/N) x 100

Of the most common emergent adverse events ( ≥ 1% in the agomelatine group) reported over the longterm treatment period, insomnia NEC and sinusitis were observed with a significantly higher frequency in the agomelatine 25/50 mg group compared to placebo. Other AEs with a higher reporting rate in the agomelatine group were headache NOS and back pain.

In addition, the following less common adverse events had also a higher incidence in the agomelatine 25/50  mg  group  than  in  the  placebo  group:  anxiety  NEC,  nausea,  aggravated  depression,  gammaglutamyl transferase increased, abdominal pain upper, constipation, diarrhoea, abdominal pain NOS, liver function tests NOS abnormal.

- Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Deaths: In the Overall Safety Set there were a total of 26 deaths, of which 9 occurred in the All MDD set and 17 in studies in other indications. In the All MDD set all deaths on agomelatine and placebo were due to suicide.

Other Serious Adverse Events: The most common SEAEs in the agomelatine group were:

- suicide attempt (0.6% vs 0.4% in the placebo group),
- depression aggravated (0.5%, same rate as in the placebo group),
- fall (0.4 % vs 0.2% in the placebo group).

placebo results are not displayed in this table since the \"all MDD set\" includes double-blind non-placebo-controlled and open shudies,making comparison difficult to interpret the 4additional suicide aftempts in the all agomelatine doses group as compared to the 25/5Omg group occurred in patients treated with subtherapeutic doses ofagomelatine (l under Img and 3 under 5mg)

The  frequency  of  suicides  in  the  agomelatine  treated  patients  appeared  similar  to  that  of  the comparator drugs. Data from the total database was somewhat higher than in the placebo group. In the MDD  group,  however,  the  rates  were  similar  in  the  placebo  and  agomelatine  groups.  The  small number of deaths makes it difficult to judge the real rates, and suicides/suicidality should be specially monitored  in  post-marketing  surveillance.  In  view  of  the  recent  referral  of  paroxetine  and  the recommendations of the CHMP, patients should be closely monitored during initial treatment.

## · Laboratory findings

## Vital signs

No difference between agomelatine 25mg, 50mg and placebo was observed in respect of the mean changes  in  heart  rate,  systolic  or  diastolic  blood  presssure  from  baseline.  No  obvious  influence  of agomelatine dose on orthostatic hypotension was observed.

## ECG

Five cases of QT interval prolongation were reported as emergent adverse events on agomelatine in the Overall Safety Set: in 2 cases the existence of concomitant ECG abnormalities (bigeminy, flat T waves) prevented a reliable evaluation; in one case, the baseline ECG had shown a prolonged QT and Bazett correction overcorrected the QTc interval; in one case the direct assessment of the tracings did not confirm the existence of a prolongation; in one case, the patient was treated with antiarrhythmic drugs prone to induce QT disorders.

Specific  study  on  QT-interval:  the  study  CL1-033  was  performed  in  young healthy male or female volunteers  to  study  the  effect  of  agomelatine  at  supratherapeutic  doses  (100  and  200mg,  single administration) on QT interval. This was a placebo controlled study using a latin square design. The  administration  of  100  or  200mg  of  agomelatine  did  not  significantly  prolong  the  ventricular repolarisation time in healthy volunteers. Agomelatine-induced variations of QTc interval were similar to  those  observed  during  the  placebo  period.  None  of  the  subjects  reported  a  change  in  QTc  from baseline &gt; 60 ms.

## Blood biochemistry

No  relevant  differences  between  agomelatine  doses  and  placebo  were  observed  as  regards  the incidence of patients with emergent out-of-reference range values.

## Gonadotrophic hormonal safety

Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled Phase I studies were specifically designed to assess the influence of agomelatine on gonadotrophic function, one in males (CL1-032) and one in females (CL1-034). The studies showed that chronic administration (3-4 months) of agomelatine 50mg did not modify the hypothalamo-hypophyseal axis in male and female healthy volunteers.

## Urinary Porphyrins

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Urinary  porphyrin  measurements  were  carried  out  in  two  clinical  studies;  no  clinically  relevant changes over time and no dose-related changes in urinary porphyrin excretion were observed.

## Changes in Body Weight

A low percentage of patients presented clinically significant weight gain of at least 7% during longterm treatment period, without major differences between treatment groups: 3.7% in the agomelatine 25/50mg  group  versus  4.5%,  5.9%  and  7.6%  in  the  placebo,  fluoxetine  and  paroxetine  groups, respectively.

Results were similar for weight loss &lt; 7%: 3.2% in the agomelatine 25/50mg group versus 4.5%, 3.7% and 2.7% in the placebo, fluoxetine and paroxetine groups, respectively.

## · Special safety assessments

## Emergent symptoms after treatment discontinuation

Study CL3-030 was specifically designed to compare, in outpatients with remitted depression after a 12-week treatment  period,  the  total  number  of  discontinuation-emergent  symptoms  assessed  by  the DESS Check-list,  occurring  during  a  2-week  agomelatine  25mg  treatment  discontinuation  with  the number occurring in patients having carried on agomelatine treatment.

Results showed the absence of discontinuation symptoms after abrupt agomelatine cessation. In the same conditions,  clear  discontinuation  symptoms  were  observed  in  patients  previously  treated  with paroxetine 20mg, stating the assay sensitivity of the study.

## Hepatic effects

There was a trend towards an increase in transaminases from baseline to the last value under treatment in the agomelatine 50mg group, whereas no change was detected in the placebo and the agomelatine 25mg groups. This increase was likely to be due to the high values observed in three patients treated with agomelatine 50mg.

One case of sustained potentially clinically significant values in liver parameters was reported: a 24 year-old  male  volunteer  developed  elevated  liver  enzyme  concentrations  (ALAT  at  1.7  x  ULN  and ASAT  at  1.5  x  ULN)  after  8  treatment  weeks  with  agomelatine  50mg . In  addition,  during  the procedure  a  new  case  was  seen  in  a  clinical  study:  a  57-year  old  man  had  been  treated  with agomelatine for circa 10 weeks and had increased ALT-value at 230 IU/l and AST 124 IU/l.

## Effects on skin and subcutaneous tissue

The higher frequency of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders in the agomelatine 25/50mg group (5.7%) as compared to the placebo group (4.0%) was mainly related to a higher frequency of pruritus NOS (1.1% versus 0.5%, respectively) and sweating increased (1.3% versus 0.9%, respectively).

## Overdose

From studies in healthy volunteers, it was shown that agomelatine was well tolerated up to 800mg/day orally. Clinical studies were conducted, even in the elderly, with doses up to 100mg/day. During the clinical development of agomelatine 7 cases of intentional overdose were reported under agomelatine.

## · Safety in special populations

## Hepatic Impairment

Compared with healthy subjects, the systemic exposure to agomelatine was increased by 71-fold in mild  liver  failure  and  140-fold  in  moderate  failure;  however,  a  single  oral  dose  of  25mg  of agomelatine was not associated with unusual pattern of adverse events in subjects with liver failure.

## Renal Impairment

The open study, carried out in 8 volunteers with severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance &lt;  30  mL/min)  and  8  healthy  matched  volunteers,  showed  that  mean  exposure  to  agomelatine  was slightly  greater  in  patients  with  impaired  function  than  in  healthy  volunteers.  Nevertheless,  this increase was within the range of the inter-individual variability.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy and lactation

During the clinical development of agomelatine, 9 pregnancies occurred under agomelatine, including 1 pregnancy in a phase I study and 1 pregnancy in an ongoing study. Pregnancies were followed by induced abortion in 6 patients. In the three other patients, pregnancy and delivery were normal and newborns were in good health with no dysmorphic features.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No clinically relevant interactions were identified.

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

Percentages  of  patients  having  reported  at  least  one  emergent  adverse  event  leading  to  premature discontinuation of study drug were comparable in the agomelatine and placebo groups: In the shortterm  double-blind  placebo-controlled  MDD  set,  there  were  61  (5.4%)  patients  with  such  adverse events on 25/50mg agomelatine and 15 (1.1%) on 1/5mg. There was no obvious dose effect among agomelatine groups on the percentage of patients with EAE leading to treatment discontinuation: 5.5% on 25mg vs 5.2% on 50mg.

Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation in the short-term MDD safety set, analysed by organ class are presented in Table 23.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Agomelatine  is  a  melatonin  agonist  with  high  affinity  binding  to  human  melatonin  MT1  and  MT2 receptors.  Agomelatine  is  also  a  serotonin  antagonist  at  the  5-HT2C  receptor  from  man  and  several animal species, although with low affinity. Agomelatine had anti-depressive like activity in a number of animal models of depression. The anti-depressant effect was related both to activation of melatonin

Safety pharmacology  studies showed  that agomelatine and the metabolite  7DP  caused  significant  CNS  depression  at  high  doses  and  induced  slight-to-moderate sedation in several models. No biologically relevant effects were seen on renal function, respiratory system or cardiovascular system.

the  body; inetics were non-linear. The main routes of metabolism were 3-hydroxylation, 7-desmethylation and Agomelatine  and/or  its  metabolites  were  rapidly  and  extensively  distributed  throughout k oxidation;  the  metabolites  of  agomelatine  were  conjugated  and  excreted  via  urine  and  faeces. Agomelatine passed into the placenta and foetuses of pregnant rats.

## Efficacy conclusions

significant difference between agomelatine and placebo treated patients. On the short-term efficacy data of agomelatine controversy arouse regarding its actual The  short-term  antidepressant  efficacy  of  agomelatine  25  or  25-50mg  was  investigated  in  three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies in adults, that showed statistically significant differences from placebo on the HAM-D total score and consistent results across secondary criteria.  Two  additional  studies  were  inconclusive  (also  positive  control  failed),  and  in  one  study agomelatine failed to show efficacy whereas fluoxetine showed positive effect. In addition, the study in elderly patients failed to show statistically effect  size  and  how  it  compared  with  alternative  therapies;  arguments suggested that the effect size was in line with the expectations in the field.

e the studies were not primarily designed to valuate long-term efficacy on depression. In fact no depression score was obtained during the followe CL335 study and from MADRS score in the CL3-036 study. The  long-term  efficacy  was  studied  in  a  relapse  prevention  trial,  which  failed  to  discriminate agomelatine  from  placebo.  Data  on  long-term  efficacy  could  also  be  derived  from  a  double-blind extension  study:  two  of  the  three  double-blind  extension  studies  failed  to  discriminate  agomelatine from  placebo,  whereas  in  one  study  some  secondary  analyses  were  positive.

From  a linical point of view, this is an unfavourable aspect of a medicinal product implying an unpredictable Oral  bioavailability  of  agomelatine  was  low  and  th c therapeutic response. In addition, bioavailability was increasing non-proportionally with dose, which contributed further to therapeutic unpredictability.

The con demonstration  of  efficacy  of  agomelatonine  in  the  treatment  of  major  depression  was  not clusive. The issues identified were the following:

he dose-finding T process for agomelatine was not optimal. In the overall clinical program it was difficult  to  distinguish  greater  efficacy  with  the  dose  of  50  mg  in  comparison  to  the  initial recommended dose 25 mg, although a fraction of the patients improved from this dose increase.

Demonstration of short-term efficacy: At short-term (6 weeks), three trials (including the dosefinding one) were able to discriminate agomelatine from placebo. In the flexible dose design trials the rate of responders in agomelatine was superior to placebo. Out of these 3 trials only one (CL2014)  had  an  active  comparator  arm  (paroxetine  20  mg).  The  effect  size  of  agomelatine  and paroxetine were in the same range. Four other trials including the trial on elderly patients failed to discriminate from placebo. One of these trials had assay sensitivity because fluoxetine, used as a comparator, did discriminate from placebo, which suggests that the effect size of agomelatine was smaller than fluoxetine 20 mg. It is noteworthy that in all trials fairly severe patients were enrolled excluding the explanation that the failure was due to a 'flooring effect'. The effect size measured from baseline to endpoint was large in both active- and placebo-treated groups. Taken together, the CHMP concluded that data from the short-term efficacy trials could indicate that agomelatine 25 to 50 mg in the treatment of major depression exerted a clinical effect the magnitude of which could not lead to firm conclusion of clinical efficacy.

Demonstration  of  long-term  efficacy: There  was  only  one  pivotal  long-term  trial  (relapse prevention  trial)  and  this  failed  to  discriminate  agomelatine  from  placebo.  Data  on  long-term efficacy could also be derived from a) a double-blind extension of a short-term trial and b) two double-blind venlafaxine-controlled trials conducted in MDD patients to study sleep disturbances or  sexual  dysfunction.  However,  even  though  the  applicant  analysed  all  the  available  data  in various  ways,  and  even  though  these  data  may  have  pointed  towards  maintenance  of  efficacy, none of these analyses were conclusive (studies were not primarily designed to evaluate long-term efficacy). Further, the data from venlafaxine-controlled trials had major methodological shortcomings,  e.g.  they  did  not  have  depression  as  the  primary  variable,  and  the  evaluation  of depression was based only on CGI score in the CL3-035 study and on MADRS score in the CL3036 study. Thus, these data were suggestive of a beneficial effect of agomelatine in the long-term treatment  of  major  depression,  but  could  not  be  considered  conclusive.  Based  on  the  available

data, the CHMP was of the opinion that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the longterm efficacy of agomelatine.

Overall the safety profile of agomelatine did not pose particular concerns; increases in liver enzyme values could have been addressed by a risk management plan.

aking  all  that  above  into  consideration,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  for aldoxan in the proposed indication is unfavourable, especially given that the long-term efficacy was T V not demonstrated.
