Each vial contains 1 mL extractable volume of suspension containing 5×10 9 plaque forming units (PFU) of beremagene geperpavec.

After mixing 1 mL of the suspension with the gel, Vyjuvek contains 5×10 9 PFU in 2.5 mL. Extractable volume is 2.0 mL (4×10 9 PFU).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3 PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Suspension and gel for gel.

The suspension is opalescent yellow to colourless following thaw from its frozen state.

The gel is a clear viscous gel following thaw from its frozen state.

## 4 CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Vyjuvek is indicated for the treatment of wounds in patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) with mutation(s) in the collagen type VII alpha 1 chain (COL7A1) gene, from birth.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Vyjuvek should be initiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the management of patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.

## Posology

Vyjuvek is applied cutaneously to wound(s) once a week in small droplets in a grid-like pattern, approximately 1-cm by 1-cm apart. All wounds may not be possible to be treated at each treatment visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The recommended total maximum weekly dosing for children from birth up to 3 years old is 1 mL (2×10 9 PFU). The recommended total maximum weekly dosing for children above 3 years of age, adolescents, and adults is 2 mL (4×10 9 PFU).

Vyjuvek should be applied to wounds until they are closed before selecting new wound(s) to treat. Weekly treatment of previously treated wounds should be prioritised if they re-open. If no wounds are present, Vyjuvek should not be administered.

The table below provides a reference on dose per approximate size of the wound in children, adolescents, and adults.

Table 1.  Dose by wound area

| Wound area (cm 2 )*   | Dose (PFU) a         | Volume (mL)   |
|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| < 20                  | < 4×10 8             | < 0.2         |
| 20 to < 40            | 4×10 8 to < 8×10 8   | 0.2 to < 0.4  |
| 40 to 60              | 8×10 8 to < 1.2×10 9 | 0.4 to < 0.6  |
| 60 to < 200           | 1.2×10 9 to < 4×10 9 | 0.6 to < 2    |

PFU= plaque forming units.

a:  The maximum dose in children below 3 years of age is 1 mL (2×10 9 PFU)

If a dose is missed, Vyjuvek should be administered as soon as possible, and weekly dosing should be resumed thereafter.

## Special populations

## Elderly population

No dose adjustment is required in patients ≥ 65 years old.

## Method of administration

## Precaution to be taken before manipulating or administering the product

This medicine contains genetically modified organisms (see section 4.4). During preparation, administration, and disposal, appropriate precautions must be taken. Personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, mask, and eye protection) should be worn when handling Vyjuvek.

Pregnant women should not prepare or administer Vyjuvek and should avoid direct contact with the treated wounds, or dressings from the treated wounds (see section 6.6).

## Administration

For cutaneous use on wounds only.

Prior to cutaneous use the suspension and gel must be thawed, and the suspension must be mixed into the gel in a pharmacy setting. For detailed instructions on preparation, shelf life after mixing, administration, measures to take in case of accidental exposure, logistics, and disposal of Vyjuvek, see sections 6.3 and 6.6.

A health care professional (HCP) should apply Vyjuvek, either at a healthcare professional setting (e.g., clinic) or the home setting. If deemed appropriate by the healthcare professional, trained patients or caregivers may also apply Vyjuvek.

Wounds should be gently cleaned prior to cutaneous administration using a product that does not contain a virucidal agent. Medicinal products and ointments at the wound area should be removed and the wound should be cleansed prior to Vyjuvek administration to ensure no reduction in its activity (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 2 . Steps for administration

<!-- image -->

| Step 1. The Vyjuvek syringe should be primed prior to the initial application by pulling the plunger down and pushing it upwards, so that a small droplet of Vyjuvek forms at the tip of the syringe.                                                                                                                                    | Step 1. The Vyjuvek syringe should be primed prior to the initial application by pulling the plunger down and pushing it upwards, so that a small droplet of Vyjuvek forms at the tip of the syringe.   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 2. Vyjuvek should be applied to the selected wound, in small droplets approximately 1-cm by 1-cm apart (width of a fingertip) with only the droplet touching the wound. Only the gel should contact the skin. The tip of the syringe should not touch the skin to prevent the contamination of the gel in the syringe.              |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Step 3. Once Vyjuvek has been administered to the wound, a hydrophobic dressing should be applied. The dressing should be cut to a size slightly larger than the wound but may vary upon patient preference. Once the Vyjuvek droplets are covered by the hydrophobic dressing, a thin even layer of Vyjuvek will form within the wound. |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Step 4. The standard dressing should be cut to a size larger than the hydrophobic dressing. The standard dressing will be placed over the hydrophobic dressing to prevent dissemination of the gel to other areas of the body or close contacts.                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The dressing should be left in place for approximately 24 hours after Vyjuvek application. Once the Vyjuvek dressings are removed, the patient may continue with their standard of care.

Vyjuvek should continue to be administered weekly until the wounds are closed. If previously treated wounds re-open, Vyjuvek should be applied again. If no wounds are present, Vyjuvek should not be administered.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of the biological medicinal product, the name and the batch number of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Squamous cell carcinoma

Vyjuvek should not be applied to wounds with a confirmed or suspicious diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Vyjuvek may still be applied to other wounds in patients who develop SCC.

## Transmission of an infectious agent

Beremagene geperpavec will not replicate in cells and does not integrate into or otherwise interact with the native DNA.

Although beremagene geperpavec is tested for sterility, a risk of transmission of infectious agents exists. Healthcare professionals administering Vyjuvek must, therefore, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infections after treatment and treat appropriately, if needed.

Individuals handling beremagene geperpavec or assisting with dressing changes should wear protective equipment (see section 6.6).

Pregnant women should not handle dressing waste. Carers or HCPs applying the gel should comply with the requirement to cover wounds with dressings. Patients should also be advised to avoid touching or scratching wound sites to avoid contamination of other areas of the body or close contacts.

## Long-term follow-up

Patients are expected to enroll in a non-interventional multi-country study, to assess the long-term safety of beremagene geperpavec in a real-life setting.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been conducted with Vyjuvek. Interactions with topical medicinal products have not been investigated in clinical trials. Other topical medicinal products should not be concomitantly administered with Vyjuvek.

The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following Vyjuvek treatment has not been studied. There is no data to suggest that Vyjuvek may interfere with the body's ability to appropriately respond to a live virus vaccines.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of beremagene geperpavec in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

The use of Vyjuvek is not recommended during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether beremagene geperpavec is excreted in human milk.

A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.

A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Vyjuvek therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

No nonclinical or clinical studies have been performed to evaluate the effect of beremagene geperpavec on fertility.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Vyjuvek has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Eighteen patients (58%) in the clinical trial reported at least one adverse reaction. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were chills (9.7%) and pruritus (9.7%)..

No adverse reactions led to discontinuation.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Unless otherwise stated, the frequencies of adverse reactions are based on all causal adverse event frequencies identified in 31 patients exposed to beremagene geperpavec during a median duration of 25 weeks in the Phase 3 randomised, intra-subject placebo-controlled study. See section 5.1 for information on the main characteristics of patients in clinical trial.

In the following table, adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class (SOC), preferred term, and by frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Table 3.  Adverse reactions

## Paediatric population

Of the 31 subjects in the Phase 3 study, 19 (61%) were paediatric subjects (17 years of age or less), including 3 (9.7%) aged 3 years or less. Of the 19 paediatric subjects, 8 were female (42%).

Given the identity of the product, and its route of administration and localized containment, frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be the same as in adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunogenicity

There was minimal evidence of systemic vector exposure after cutaneous application of Vyjuvek. Antibodies against the viral vector (HSV-1) and transgene protein (COL7) were evaluated in a subset of subjects in the randomised, intra-subject placebo-controlled clinical study. A total of 64% of evaluated subjects (14/22) were anti-HSV-1 antibody positive at baseline. Six of the 8 anti-HSV-1 seronegative subjects seroconverted by week 26 following treatment with Vyjuvek. For subjects with available matched baseline and end-of-study serum samples, anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to COL7 were detected in 72% (13/18) of subjects treated with Vyjuvek for up to 26 weeks. Neutralizing immunity was not observed at first or repeated Vyjuvek exposure. The impact of seroconversion on maintenance of treatment effect is unknown as data are not available after 26 weeks.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No case of overdose of Vyjuvek has been reported. Symptomatic and supportive treatment, as deemed necessary by the treating healthcare professional, is advised in case of overdose.

## 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Preparations for the treatment of wounds and ulcers, cicatrizants, ATC code: D03AX16

## Mechanism of action

Beremagene geperpavec is a gene therapy based on an engineered, replication-defective herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encoded with COL7A1 gene, addressing the underlying genetic cause of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. The HSV-1 vector belongs to the human herpes virus (HHV) family of double-stranded DNA viruses. Upon cutaneous application to the wounds, beremagene geperpavec can transduce both keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Following entry of beremagene geperpavec into the cells, the vector genome is deposited in the nucleus without integrating into, or otherwise disrupting, host cell DNA. Once in the nucleus, transcription of the encoded human COL7A1 is initiated. The resulting transcripts allow for production and secretion of COL7 by the cell in its mature form. These COL7 molecules arrange themselves into long, thin bundles that form anchoring fibrils. The anchoring fibrils hold the epidermis and dermis together and are essential for maintaining the integrity of the skin.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy of Vyjuvek in subjects one year of age and older with DEB with mutation(s) in the COL7A1 gene was evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. All study subjects had DEB with genetically confirmed mutation(s) in the COL7A1 gene. Two comparable wounds in each subject were selected and randomised to receive either cutaneous application of beremagene geperpavec or placebo (gel only) weekly for 26 weeks. The total maximum weekly dose was defined based on age category: subjects ≥ 6 months to &lt; 3 years received 1.6×10 9 PFU/week, subjects ≥ 3 years to &lt; 6 years received 2.4×10 9 PFU/week, and subjects ≥ 6 years received 3.2×10 9  PFU/week.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study enrolled 31 subjects (20 males and 11 females), including 30 subjects with autosomal recessive DEB and one subject with autosomal dominant DEB. The size of the beremagene geperpavec-treated primary wounds ranged from 2 to 57 cm 2 , with 74% of wounds &lt; 20 cm 2  and 19% from 20 to &lt; 40 cm 2 . The size of the placebo gel-treated wounds ranged from 2 to 52 cm 2 , with 71% of wounds &lt; 20 cm 2  and 26% from 20 to &lt; 40 cm 2 . The largest size secondary wound treated was ≥ 130 cm 2 . The mean age of the subjects was 17 years (1 year to 44 years), including 61% paediatric subjects (n=19, age 1 to &lt; 17 years) and 9.7% subjects less than 3 years. Sixty-four percent of subjects were White; 19% were Asian, and the remainder were American Indian or Alaska Native.

Efficacy was assessed on the basis of improved wound healing defined as the difference in the proportion of complete (100%) wound closure at 24 weeks confirmed at two consecutive study visits 2 weeks apart, assessed at weeks 22 and 24 or at weeks 24 and 26, between the beremagene geperpavec -treated and the placebo gel-treated wounds. Efficacy was also assessed by the difference in the proportion of complete wound closure assessed at weeks 8 and 10 or at both weeks 10 and 12 between the beremagene geperpavec-treated and the placebo gel-treated wounds. Complete wound healing was defined as 100% wound closure from the exact wound area selected at baseline, specified as skin reepithelialization without drainage, evaluated at two consecutive visits two weeks apart. The efficacy results are summarised in Table 4.

- *The primary and key secondary end points were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Multiple-imputation methods were used to account for missing data. Fractional counts are due to the multiple-imputation procedure used for analysis. Hypothesis testing was performed with the use of exact McNemar's test.

†Primary wounds were assessed at weeks 22 and 24 or weeks 24 and 26.

‡Primary wounds were assessed at weeks 8 and 10 or weeks 10 and 12.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

In the confirmatory trial, systemic exposure assessments were conducted at weekly clinical site visits via quantification of beremagene geperpavec genomes in blood and urine samples (vector shedding) using a validated qPCR assay. All blood samples and all but one urine sample collected throughout the study were below the limit of detection/quantification for all subjects, indicating no significant systemic exposure of the subjects to the vector.

## Clinical pharmacokinetics and shedding

Biodistribution and vector shedding studies were supportive and indicated a lack of systemic exposure after localised, cutaneous administration of beremagene geperpavec.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose administration in toxicology studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Animal developmental and reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted.

No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of beremagene geperpavec on carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility.

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient, or carer

## Vyjuvek 5×10 9  Plaque Forming Units/mL suspension and gel for gel beremagene geperpavec

- This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

If you are the carer of a patient who will receive Vyjuvek, when 'you' appears in this package leaflet, it refers to your charges except where it says otherwise.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Vyjuvek is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you are given Vyjuvek
3. How Vyjuvek is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How Vyjuvek is stored
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1 What Vyjuvek is and what it is used for

Vyjuvek is a modified viral gene therapy. It contains the active substance beremagene geperpavec, a genetically modified virus encoding for the human protein COL7.

Vyjuvek is used to treat wounds in patients with a rare genetic disorder called dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) with mutation(s) in the collagen type VII alpha 1 chain (COL7A1) gene, which primarily affects the skin. It can be used from birth onward. DEB is caused by a faulty gene that affects the production of the COL7 protein, which glues the skin layers together. If this protein is missing or does not function appropriately, the layers of the skin will not join properly. This makes the skin very fragile and likely to blister.

Vyjuvek has been modified to make the virus contain working copies of the faulty gene found in patients with DEB. The medicine delivers these working copies of the gene into the cells of the wound to help the skin heal. The modified virus and genetic material in this medicine do not change your own DNA.

## 2 What you need to know before you are given Vyjuvek

## You must not be given Vyjuvek:

- -if you are allergic to beremagene geperpavec or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you administer or you are administered Vyjuvek if you have a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. Vyjuvek should not be applied to wounds with a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

confirmed or suspected diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. In people who develop squamous cell carcinoma, Vyjuvek may still be applied to wounds on skin that has no confirmed or suspected squamous cell carcinoma.

## Accidental contact with Vyjuvek

This medicine contains genetically modified organisms. Although it will not integrate with your own DNA, accidental exposure of area's other than wounded skin should be avoided.

You and/or your doctor or nurse should:

- Avoid direct contact with treated wounds (e.g., touching or scratching) and dressings of treated wounds for approximately 24 hours following treatment.
- Your doctor or nurse and your carer should wear personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, mask, eye protection) when administering Vyjuvek and assisting with changing wound dressings and handling their disposal (e.g., gloves), see section 3 'How Vyjuvek is given'.

## Long-term follow-up

Patients taking this medicine may take part in a study that looks at the long-term safety of this medicine. Talk to your doctor or nurse about this study and how you can participate.

## Other medicines and Vyjuvek

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines.

There is no information on how Vyjuvek could react with other medicines applied to your wounds. Do not apply other medicines to your wounds along with Vyjuvek. Once Vyjuvek has been cleaned from the wounds, routine care may resume.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine with other medicines, ask your doctor or nurse.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or nurse for advice before being treated with Vyjuvek or handling Vyjuvek.

The effects of this medicine on pregnancy and the unborn child are not known. The use of Vyjuvek is not recommended while you are pregnant.

Vyjuvek has not been studied in breast-feeding women. It is not known whether it passes into breast milk. It is important to tell your doctor or nurse if you are breastfeeding or plan to do so. They will then help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking Vyjuvek, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Vyjuvek to you.

## Driving and using machines

Vyjuvek is expected to have little to no effect on the ability to drive or use machines.

## 3 How Vyjuvek is given

Vyjuvek is for cutaneous use on wounds only. Vyjuvek is given once a week by a doctor or nurse either in a clinic or at home. If your doctor or nurse considers it appropriate, you or your carer may also apply the medicine after you/your carer have been properly trained.

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you. Check with your doctor or nurse if you are not sure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The maximum recommended weekly dose of Vyjuvek for children less than 3 years is up to 1 mL (2×10 9 PFU).

The maximum recommended weekly dose of Vyjuvek for adults and children aged 3 years and above is up to 2 mL (4×10 9 PFU).

| Wound area (cm 2 )*   | Volume (mL)   |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| < 20                  | < 0.2         |
| 20 to < 40            | 0.2 to < 0.4  |
| 40 to 60              | 0.4 to < 0.6  |
| 60 to < 200           | 0.6 to < 2    |

PFU=plaque forming units

*Vyjuvek should be applied to the selected wound, in small droplets approximately 1-cm by 1-cm apart (width of a fingertip).

All wounds may not be possible to be treated at each treatment visit. Vyjuvek should be applied to wounds until they are closed before selecting new wound(s) to treat. Weekly treatment of previously treated wounds should be prioritised if they re-open. If no wounds are present, Vyjuvek should not be administered.

## How to apply Vyjuvek

Your pharmacist will prepare Vyjuvek for you. Vyjuvek will be supplied to you in capped syringes. Make sure you have the correct number or syringes according to your recommended posology.

## Wound preparation

The wounds should be gently cleaned before applying Vyjuvek.

- Gently remove any medicines and ointments at the wound area.
- Do not use products that may contain anti-viral agents. If you are unsure if something you use contains these agents, ask your doctor or nurse.

## Syringe preparation

The Vyjuvek syringes will be dispensed from the pharmacy in a plastic bag within an appropriate insulated container for transport to the setting of administration (e.g., to the clinical setting or home setting) (see section 5 How Vyjuvek is stored).

After you receive the insulated container, you must store the container in a secure, room-temperature location that is clean and free from potential contamination.

- Only the person responsible for the administration should open the container.
- The person responsible for the administration should check that the container is intact and there are no signs of leakage before use.

Pregnant women should not prepare or give Vyjuvek and should avoid direct contact with the skin where the medicine is applied or with dressings that have been in contact with the medicine.

Personal protective equipment e.g., gloves, mask, and eye protection) should be worn when handling Vyjuvek.

## Get the syringe ready.

- With each new syringe, before initial use, begin by pulling the plunger of the syringe down slightly, then gently pushing the plunger upwards toward the tip of the syringe.
- A small droplet of Vyjuvek should form at the tip of the syringe.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Apply Vyjuvek to the selected wound, in small droplets approximately 1-cm by 1-cm apart (width of a fingertip) with only the Vyjuvek droplet touching the wound.

The tip of the syringe should not touch the skin to prevent the contamination of the gel in the syringe.

The resulting droplet pattern should loosely resemble a grid.

The amount of Vyjuvek applied may vary as the wound decreases or increases in size.

Once Vyjuvek has been administered to the wound, cover the wound with a nonabsorbent, water-repellent dressing (a dressing that will not absorb Vyjuvek). The dressing should be cut to a size slightly larger than the wound but may vary upon your preference.

Once the Vyjuvek droplets are covered by the water-repellent dressing, a thin even layer of Vyjuvek will form within the wound.

The standard wound care dressing should be cut to a size larger than the non-absorbent, water-repellent dressing. Cover the nonabsorbent dressing with the standard dressing.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Leave the dressing for approximately 24 hours after treatment.

Avoid touching or scratching treated wound areas or dressings.

Following the Vyjuvek dressing change, your routine care may resume.
