## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for dengue tetravalent vaccine (live, attenuated) [Dengue virus, serotype 2, expressing Dengue virus, serotype 1, surface proteins, live, attenuated / Dengue virus, serotype 2, expressing Dengue virus, serotype 3, surface proteins, live, attenuated / Dengue virus, serotype 2, expressing Dengue virus, serotype 4, surface proteins, live, attenuated / Dengue virus, serotype 2, live, attenuated.], the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on thrombocytopenia and petechia from clinical trial(s), the literature and spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between dengue tetravalent vaccine (live, attenuated) [Dengue virus, serotype 2, expressing Dengue virus, serotype 1, surface proteins, live, attenuated / Dengue virus, serotype 2, expressing Dengue virus, serotype 3, surface proteins, live, attenuated / Dengue virus, serotype 2, expressing Dengue virus, serotype 4, surface proteins, live, attenuated / Dengue virus, serotype 2, live, attenuated.] and thrombocytopenia and petechia is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for dengue tetravalent vaccine (live, attenuated) [Dengue virus, serotype 2, expressing Dengue virus, serotype 1, surface proteins, live, attenuated / Dengue virus, serotype 2, expressing Dengue virus, serotype 3, surface proteins, live, attenuated / Dengue virus, serotype 2, expressing Dengue virus, serotype 4, surface proteins, live, attenuated / Dengue virus, serotype 2, live, attenuated.] the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing dengue tetravalent vaccine (live, attenuated) [Dengue virus, serotype 2, expressing Dengue virus, serotype 1, surface proteins, live, attenuated / Dengue virus, serotype 2, expressing Dengue virus, serotype 3, surface proteins, live, attenuated / Dengue virus, serotype 2, expressing Dengue virus, serotype 4, surface proteins, live, attenuated / Dengue virus, serotype 2, live, attenuated.] is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
