- Pursuant to Article 13(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2309/93 as amended and Part 4G of Annex to Council Directive 75/318/EEC, the MAH submitted to the EMEA on 31 October 2000 additional  efficacy  and  safety  data  as  stated  in  Annex  IIC  to  Commission  Decision,  which formed the basis of the 1 st annual re-assessment of the risk/benefit profile of Remicade (results from ACCENT I and ACCENT II clinical trials, new safety data). The procedure started on 26 January 2001. During the procedure, following the submission and the assessment of the second periodic safety update report (PSUR) for Remicade covering the period from 24 August 1998 to 23 August 2000, the CPMP decided during its February meeting to perform a full reassessment of  the  safety  profile  of  Remicade  in  both  indications  in  the  framework  of  the  annual reassessment procedure. On 29 March 2001, the CPMP agreed that the risk/benefit profile of Remicade remained favourable and that the MA should remain under exceptional circumstances until all the specific obligations are fulfilled. During this meeting the CPMP adopted an opinion on the annual re-assessment of the specific obligations and the risk/benefit ratio, stating that no amendments of Annexes I and III to the Community Marketing Authorisation were necessary. The Annex II has been updated. Corresponding Commission Decision was issued on 31 July 2001.
