PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Powder for solution for infusion The powder is white to off-white. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications ATryn is indicated for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in surgery of adult patients with congenital antithrombin deficiency. It is normally given in association with heparin or low molecular weight heparin. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with congenital antithrombin deficiency. Posology Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Due  to  differences  in  pharmacokinetics  of antithrombin  alfa  and  plasma -derived  antithrombin,  treatment should follow the specific dose  recommendations described below. In the treatment of congenital antithrombin deficiency, the dose and duration of treatment should be individualised for each pati ent taking into account the family history with regard to thromboembolic events, the actual clinical risk factors, and the laboratory assessment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the

The therapeutic goal of treatment with antithrombin alfa is to increase to, and maintain antithrombin activity between 80 - 120% of normal (0.8 - 1.2 IU/ml) for the duration of treatment. Initial treatment starts with a loading dose targeting an antithrombin activity level of 100%. This initial loading dose is based on body weight and on the pretreatment antithrombin activity level. The required loading dose is determined using the following formula: Loading dose (IU) = [(100 - patient's pre-treatment AT activity level in %) /2.28] x Body Weight in kg The usual loading dose in surgical patients (baseline AT activity 50%, bodyweight 75 kg) with congenital antithrombin deficiency in clinical risk situations is 20-25 IU/kg bodyweight. The loading dose should be given as a 15 minute infusion immediately followed by initiation of the maintenance infusion. The required maintenance dose for surgical patients is given as a continuous infusion and is determined using the following formula: Maintenance dose (IU/hour) = [(100 - patient's pre-treatment AT activity level in %) /10.22] x Body Weight in kg The usual maintenance dose in surgical patients with congenital antithrombin deficiency in clinical risk situations is 4-5 IU/kg/h. During consumptive states (e.g. major surgery, concomitant use of heparin) the actual dose may be higher. See therapeutic monitoring and dose adjustment recommendations below. Treatment should be continued until the risk for venous thromboembolisms is reduced and/or when effective follow-on anticoagulation has been established. Therapeutic Monitoring and Dose Adjustment The dose should be adjusted on the basis of laboratory measurements of antithrombin activity. Response may vary in individual patients, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and different half-lives. Frequent antithrombin activity assessments and dosing adjustments may be necessary when starting treatment and just after surgery. After the start of the maintenance dose infusion, blood for AT activity levels should be drawn at 45 minutes after the start of the loading dose infusion.  In case the AT activity level is between 80% and 120% (0.8 - 1.2 IU/ml), no dose adjustment is needed. In case the AT activity level is less than 80%, increase the maintenance infusion rate by 50%. In case the AT activity level is greater than 120% decrease the infusion rate by 30%. Check AT activity level 30 minutes after any change in infusion rate, or four hours after a value within the target range. Subsequently, antithrombin activity should be checked 1-2 times a day and dose adjustments made accordingly. The antithrombin activity level should be maintained above 80% for the duration of the treatment, unless clinical particulars would indicate a different effective level.

The  number  of  units  of  antithrombin  alfa  administered  is  expressed  in International  Units  (IU),  which  is related  to  the  current  WHO  standard  for  antithrombin  concentrate.  Antithrombin  (AT)  activity  in  plasma  is expressed either as a percentage (relative to human plasma) or in International Units (relative to International  Standard  for  antithrombin  in  plasma).  One  International  Unit  (IU) of  antithrombin  activity  is equivalent to that quantity of antithrombin  in  one  ml  of  normal  human  plasma.  The  calculation  of  the required dosage of antithrombin alfa is based on pre -treatment plasma antithrombin activity and  b ody weight.

It is possible that the surgical procedure will influence AT activity levels.  Therefore, an additional check of the AT activity level should be done after the surgery. In case the activity level is below 80% a 15 minutes bolus infusion of AT can be given to quickly restore the AT activity level.  The dose can be calculated utilizing the post-surgical AT activity in the loading dose formula above.

## Paediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety and efficacy of ATryn in children and adolescents (&lt;18 years) have not been established.  No data are available.  Paediatric antithrombin levels may be different from adult levels, particularly in neonates.

## Method of administration

## For intravenous use.

The loading dose should be given as a 15 minute infusion immediately followed by initiation of the maintenance infusion.

For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Hypersensitivity to goat proteins or goat milk components. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Hypersensitivity reactions As with any intravenous protein product, a llergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Patients must be  closely  monitored  and  carefully  observed  for  any  symptoms  throughout  the  infusion  period.  Patients should  be  informed  of  the  early  signs  of  hypersensitivity  reactions including  hives,  generalized  urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur after administration, they should contact their physician. In case of shock, standard medical treatment should be administered. Patients treated with  this medicine   should be monitored for possible clinical immunological reactions. Antibody status should be monitored and reported. The experience from repeated treatment with this medicine  is very limited. Close surveillance with r egard to immunological reactions is especially important in such situations. Pregnancy Due  to  differences  in  pharmacokinetic  characteristics  of  ATryn  in  pregnant  versus  non -pregnant  patients, recommendations for dosing in pregnancy or in the peripartum period cannot be given. Use of concomitant anticoagulation Clinical and biological surveillance when antithrombin is used together with heparin, low molecular weight heparin or other anticoagulants which potentiate the anticoagulant activity of antithrombin: -In  order  to  properly  adjust  the  dose  of  the  anticoagulant  and  to  avoid  excessive  hypocoagulability, controls of the extent of anticoagulation (APTT, and where appropriate anti-Factor Xa activity) should be performed regularly, at close intervals and in particular in the first minutes/hours following the start of antithrombin use. Antithrombin  levels should  be  measured  daily,  in  order  to  adjust  the  individual  dose.  The  risk  of diminution  of  antithrombin  levels  by  prolonged  treatment  with  a  nonfractionated  heparin  should  be taken into account. Sodium content This medicinal product contains 1.65 mmol (or 37.9 mg) sodium per vial. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Antithrombin replacement during administration of anticoagulants that potentiate the anticoagulant activity of antithrombin (e.g., heparin, low molecular weight heparin), may increase the risk of bleeding. The half-life of recombinant antithrombin may be altered with concomitant treatment with these anticoagulants due to an altered antithrombin turnover. Thus, concurrent administration of antithrombin with heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or other anticoagulants that potentiate the anticoagulant activity of antithrombin to a patient with increased risk of bleeding must be monitored clinically and biologically.

4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Limited clinical data are available on the use of  antithrombin alfa in pregnant women. Available data do not suggest  harmful  effects  to  the  mother  or  infant.  Animal  studies  performed  in  rats  did  not  indicate  harmful effects on parturition, embryonal/foetal and post -natal development. However due to the difference in pharmacokinetic characteristics of this medicine in pregnant v ersus non-pregnant patients no recommendation  for  dosing  in  pregnancy  can  be  given  at  this  time  (see  section  4.4). Antithrombin  alfa should therefore not be used in pregnant women. Breast-feeding It is unknown whether antithrombin alfa or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast -feeding or discontinue/abstain from ATryn therapy taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. Fertility No information is available on the possible effects of antithrombin alfa on male and female fertility. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Not relevant. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The most commonly reported adverse reactions observed in clinical trials are dizziness, headache, haemorrhage, nausea, venipuncture site haemorrhage, post procedural haemorrhage and wound secretion. The most serious reported adverse reactions observed in clinical trials are haemorrhage and post procedural haemorrhage. Tabulated list of adverse reactions In clinical trials involving congenital antithrombin deficient patients (n=35) one mild undesirable effect of 'application site pruritis' was reported as related to treatment with ATryn. In other clinical trials with acquired antithrombin deficient cardiac surgery patients (n=118) and healthy volunteers (n=102), undesirable effects reported to be related to treatment with ATryn that were observed more than once are listed by System Organ Class in the table below.

No antibodies to antithrombin alfa have been detected up to 90 days following treatment with ATryn. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting  suspected  adverse  reactions  after  authorisation  of  the  medicinal  product  is  important.  It  allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Antithrombotic agents: heparin group; ATC code: B01AB02. Mechanism of action Antithrombin, a 58 kD, 432 aminoacid glycoprotein, belongs to the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) superfamily. It is one of the most important natural inhibitors of blood coagulation. The factors most strongly inhibited  are  thrombin  and  Factor  Xa,  but  also  factors  of  contact  activation,  intrinsic  system  and  the  Factor VIIa/tissue factor com plex. Antithrombin activity is greatly enhanced by heparin and the anticoagulant effects of heparin depend on the presence of antithrombin. Antithrombin contains two functionally important domains. The first contains the reactive centre provides  a  cle avage  site  for  proteinases  such  as  thrombin,  a  prerequisite  for  forming  a  stable  proteinase -inhibitor  complex.  The  second  is  a  glycosaminoglycan  binding  domain  responsible  for  the  interaction  with heparin and related substances, which accelerates the inhib ition of thrombin. The inhibitor -coagulation enzyme complexes are removed by the reticulo-endothelial system. Normal  antithrombin activity in adults is 80 -  120% (0.8- 1.2 IU/ml) and levels in neonates are about 40 - 60 % (0.4-0.6 IU/ml ). Clinical efficacy and safety In  a  formal  clinical  trial  employing  serial  Duplex  ultrasound  examinations,  antithrombin  alfa  was  shown  to be effective in the prevention of thromboembolic events in fourteen congenital antithrombin patients in clinical high risk situations. Some additional data have been obtained from a number of patients in a compassionate use programme. Medicinal product no longer authorised

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you. -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What ATryn is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you use ATryn 3. How to use ATryn 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store ATryn 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What ATryn is and what it is used for ATryn contains antithrombin alfa which is similar to the naturally occurring human antithrombin. In the body, antithrombin blocks thrombin, a substance that plays a central role in the process of blood clotting. If you have an inborn deficiency of antithrombin, your blood level of antithrombin is lower than normal. This may result in a higher tendency to form clots in your blood vessels. This may be in the vessels of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) or in other vessels of your body (thromboembolism). Around major surgical procedures this tendency to clot is even more increased. Therefore, it is important that your antithrombin blood level be maintained at sufficient levels in these situations. This medicine is used in patients who have 'congenital antithrombin deficiency' (inherited low levels of the protein antithrombin). It is used when the patients are having surgery, to prevent problems due to the formation of blood clots in the vessels. It is normally given in association with heparin or low molecular weight heparin (another medicine that helps to prevent blood clots). 2. What you need to know before you use ATryn Do not use ATryn: -if you are allergic to antithrombin alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). -if you are allergic to goat products as antithrombin alfa is produced in the milk of transgenic goats by recombinant DNA technology (rDNA).

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: http://www.ema.europa.eu. The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: This medicine is intended for single use only. Reconstitution/dilution Vials  should  be  brought  at  temperature  not  above  25°C  prior  to  reconstitution.    The  powder  should  be reconstituted  with  10  ml  of  water  for injections  (WFI)  injected  along  the  side  wall  of  the  vial  and  gently swirled (not shaken) to prevent foaming. The  reconstituted solution should  be  inspected  visually  for  particulate  matter  and/or  discolouration  prior  to administration. The solution should be slightly yellow, clear to slightly opalescent.  Do not use solutions that are cloudy or have deposits. The vials should be used immediately and no longer than 3 hours after reconstitution. Normal sodium chloride solution 9 mg/ml (0.9%) may be added to dilute to a concentration convenient for administration. Administration Upon complete dissolution, the reconstituted product may be drawn up into a sterile disposable syringe. The reconstituted product should be administered by intravenous infusion using a sterile disposable syringe or an infusion bag with a 0.22 micron pore size inline filter. The contents of the syringes should be administered immediately and no longer than 3 hours after reconstitution.  If diluted, the solution prepared in infusion bags should  be  administered  immediately  and  no  longer  than  8  hours  after  dilution.  Compatibility  with  PVC infusion lines with in-line filters has been established. Disposal Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. The therapeutic goal of treatment with antithrombin alfa  is to increase to, and maintain antithrombin activity between 80 - 120% (0.8 - 1.2 IU/ml) for the duration of treatment. Initial treatment starts with a loading dose targeting an antithrombin activity level of 100%. This initial loading dose is based on body weight and on the pretreatment antithrombin activity level. The required loading dose is determined using the following formula: Loading dose (IU) = [(100 - patient's pre-treatment AT activity level in %) /2.28] x Body Weight in kg Medicinal product no longer authorised

The usual loading dose in surgical patients (baseline AT activity 50%, bodyweight 75 kg) with congenital antithrombin deficiency in clinical risk situations is 20-25 IU/kg bodyweight. The loading dose should be given as a 15 minute infusion immediately followed by initiation of the maintenance infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The required maintenance dose for surgical patients is given as a continuous infusion and is determined using the following formula:

## Maintenance dose (IU/hour) = [(100 - patient's pre-treatment AT activity level in %) /10.22] x Body Weight in kg

The usual maintenance dose in surgical patients with congenital antithrombin deficiency in clinical risk situations is 4-5 IU/kg/h. During consumptive states (e.g. major surgery, concomitant use of heparin) the actual dose may be higher. See therapeutic monitoring and dose adjustment recommendations below. Treatment should be continued until the risk for venous thromboembolisms is reduced and/or when effective follow-on anticoagulation has been established. Therapeutic Monitoring and Dose Adjustment The dose should be adjusted on the basis of laboratory measurements of antithrombin activity. Response may vary in individual patients, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and different half-lives. Frequent antithrombin activity assessments and dosing adjustments may be necessary when starting treatment and just after surgery. After the start of the maintenance dose infusion, blood for AT activity levels should be drawn at 45 minutes after the start of the loading dose infusion.  In case the AT activity level is between 80% and 120% (0.8 - 1.2 IU/ml), no dose adjustment is needed. In case the AT activity level is less than 80%, increase the maintenance infusion rate by 50%. In case the AT activity level is greater than 120% decrease the infusion rate by 30%. Check AT activity level 30 minutes after any change in infusion rate, or four hours after a value within the target range. Subsequently, antithrombin activity should be checked 1-2 times a day and dose adjustments made accordingly. The antithrombin activity level should be maintained above 80% for the duration of the treatment, unless clinical particulars would indicate a different effective level. It is possible that the surgical procedure will influence AT activity levels.  Therefore, an additional check of the AT activity level should be done after the surgery. In case the activity level is below 80% a 15 minutes bolus infusion of AT can be given to quickly restore the AT activity level.  The dose can be calculated utilizing the post-surgical AT activity in the loading dose formula above. Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of ATryn in children and adolescents (&lt;18 years) have not been established.  No data are available.  Paediatric antithrombin levels may be different from adult levels, particularly in neonates. Method of administration For intravenous use. The loading dose should be given as a 15 minute infusion immediately followed by initiation of the maintenance infusion. Medicinal product no longer authorised
