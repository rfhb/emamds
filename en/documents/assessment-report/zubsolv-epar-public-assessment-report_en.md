## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

## 2.1.1. Disease or condition

Opioid dependence is associated with considerable health risks and severe economic and psychosocial consequences for opioid-dependent persons and their families. It is linked to a substantially increased risk of premature death from drug overdose, violence, and suicide. Furthermore, sharing of needles among intravenous users contributes to the spread of potentially fatal blood infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C.

## 2.1.2. Epidemiology

In Europe there are 1.3 million adult problem opioid users.  The main opioid used is heroin, with an estimated 37,800 heroin use/possession offences and 17,000 heroin supply offences reported in 2013 (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction: EMCDDA, 2015). An estimated 700,000 opioid  users  received  substitution  treatment  in  2013;  opioids  were  the  principal  drugs  reported  in approximately 41% of all drug treatment requests. For the same year, average annual prevalence of high-risk opioid use among individuals aged 15 to 64 years was around 0.4% (4 per 1,000 population) although prevalence estimates vary among EU countries from less than 1 to around 8 cases per 1,000 population aged 15 to 64 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.1.3. Management

World Health Organisation guidelines for treatment of opioid dependence recommend a combination of both  pharmacological  and  psychosocial  interventions,  with  the  following  aims:  reducing  or  ceasing opioid use, preventing future harms associated with opioid use, and improving the quality of life and well-being of the opioid-dependent patient (WHO 2009).

Opioid substitution is recognised as an effective therapy for keeping patients in treatment programmes and reducing the use of illicit opioids. The principle is to replace the opioid of abuse with a more longacting  opioid  which  will  not  give  a  rush  or  a  high  but  will  relieve  the  opioid-dependent  person  of cravings  and  enable  return  to  a  more  normal  life.  Those  μ-receptor  agonists  with  a  rapid  onset  of action  and  short  half-life  (e.g.,  heroin)  are  the  main  opioid  drugs  of  abuse,  having  the  greatest potential to engender destructive behaviour, because addicted individuals obtain an immediate reward, and the drive to further use is accentuated by rapid and severe withdrawal symptoms.

In contrast, μ-receptor agonists with a slower onset of action and longer half-life, such as the synthetic opioid  methadone,  cause  physical  dependence  without  necessarily  providing  such  a  potent  stimulus towards addictive behaviour. Methadone (which can be dosed once daily) has little impact on mood, judgment, and psychomotor skills in opioid-tolerant patients, and was thus a mainstay of treatment of opioid dependence for many years. However, the combination of its long terminal half-life and potent full μ-opioid receptor agonism is associated with toxicity problems and fatal.

Buprenorphine is an alternative option for substitution therapy, administered either alone or combined with naloxone. Buprenorphine is a partial μ-receptor agonist and a ƙ -receptor antagonist, which has very  high  affinity  and  low  intrinsic  activity  at  the  μ-receptor  and  will  displace  morphine,  heroin, methadone,  and  other  opioid  full  agonists.  Its  partial  agonist  effects  give  buprenorphine  several clinically desirable pharmacological properties compared with opioid full agonists, including lower abuse potential, lower level of physical dependence (less severe withdrawal syndrome), a ceiling effect with respect to clinical effects at higher doses, and greater safety in overdose. These properties have led to widespread  use  of  buprenorphine  in  both  the  detoxification  and  maintenance  therapy  of  opioid dependent individuals. Previously administered alone, buprenorphine is now more commonly used in combination with the opioid antagonist naloxone. Naloxone  has negligible oral or sublingual bioavailability and does not reach clinically significant concentrations in the general circulation when administered orally or sublingually. The naloxone component is included to deter abuse by other routes (particularly  intravenous),  by  which  it  result  in  systemic  levels  sufficient  to  cause  unpleasant withdrawal effects.

In  the  EU,  buprenorphine  only  (Subutex)  was  first  approved  for  use  in  France  in  1996  and subsequently in other European countries, and the buprenorphine and naloxone combination Suboxone was  first  approved  in  the  EU  via  the  Centralised  Procedure  in  2006.  Suboxone  sublingual  tablets, containing  buprenorphine  and  naloxone  in  a  4:1  dose  ratio,  are  well  established  in  the  EU  as  a substitution  treatment  for  opioid  drug  dependence,  within  a  framework  of  medical,  social  and psychological treatment.

## 2.2. About the product

The Zubsolv buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablet was designed to offer improved bioavailability, faster disintegration, and improved taste masking compared with the Suboxone reference product. An improved bioavailability means that equivalent exposure with maintained efficacy could be achieved at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lower  doses  when  taken  as  intended,  while  resulting  in  less  buprenorphine  being  available  for parenteral misuse/abuse. Faster disintegration times and improved taste masking may improve patient acceptability and reduce one potential hurdle to successful treatment. Additionally, faster disintegration  may  limit  the  possibility  for  dose  sequestering  for  misuse  or  diversion  when  the medication is administered in a monitored intake setting.

Proposed indication is the same as that of the licensed product, Suboxone:

Substitution  treatment  for  opioid  drug  dependence,  within  a  framework  of  medical,  social  and psychological  treatment.  The  intention  of  the  naloxone  component  is  to  deter  intravenous  misuse. Treatment is intended for use in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age who have agreed to be treated for addiction.

## 2.3. The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific advice

Orexo AB sought Scientific Advice on the proposed PK bridging approach for this MAA from 3 national agencies: the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in July 2015, the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) in September 2015 and January 2016, and the Medical Products Agency (MPA) in October 2015.

Advice from the agencies was similar in many aspects. All 3 agencies advised that a hybrid application was a suitable route, that the reference product must be EU-sourced, and that it was acceptable to conduct  the  pivotal  bridging  study  in  healthy  subjects  in  the  US.  However,  advice  regarding  an appropriate  study  design  to  generate  data  to  support  full  bridging  of  the  efficacy  and  safety programme differed between the agencies.

The proposal that efficacy and systemic safety could be fully bridged by a PK comparison, based on comparative  bioavailability  versus  EU-sourced  Suboxone  at  a  single  dose  strength  combined  with available dose proportionality data, was generally acceptable to the MHRA. The MPA also agreed that a bridging strategy based on PK data was acceptable but recommended PK bridging at 2 dose strengths of Zubsolv, considering the small deviations in dose proportionality in exposure parameters as well as the  deviations  from  strict  compositional  proportionality  for  the  lower  strengths  (2.9/0.71,  1.4/0.36, and 0.7/0.18 mg).

Taking into consideration the above advice from the 3 agencies, Orexo proposed a revised bridging study design, based on bioavailability comparisons at the highest and second-to lowest strengths of Zubsolv to the Suboxone reference product. BfArM accepted the revised plan at the follow-up scientific advice meeting in January 2016. The PK comparisons at the highest (11.4/2.9 mg) and second-tolowest  (1.4/0.36  mg)  strengths  would  allow  for  bracketing  the  in-between  strengths  (2.9/0.71, 5.7/1.4,  and  8.6/2.1  mg).  A  biowaiver  of  strength  for  the  lowest  strength  (0.7/0.18  mg)  was considered feasible based on the directly proportional composition to the 1.4/0.36 mg strength.

The  agencies  also  recommended  that  the  previous  clinical  studies  conducted  with  the  Zubsolv  FCP should be included in the MAA as supportive data.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.4.1 of this report.

The aim was to formulate rapidly disintegrating sublingual tablet for treatment of opioid dependence. Buprenorphine and naloxone in a 4:1 ratio is approved in the EU as Suboxone sublingual tablet (EU/1/06/359).

Pharmaceutical development is described in detail concerning the development of each strength; physicochemical properties of the active substance and manufacturing considerations have been taken into consideration. Satisfactory information regarding site transfers during development has been provided. Process robustness was investigated originally as a design space, but stated not to be applied in commercial production: no regulatory freedom is granted in this respect.

Development formulations were found to have improved absorption compared to the reference product Suboxone.  Therefore lower strengths of active substances were chosen compared to the reference product.

1.4/0.36 mg and 11.4/2.9 mg strengths were studied in-vivo and biowaivers were requested for the other four strengths. Using an appropriate discriminatory dissolution method, comparable rapid dissolution was observed for two tablet strengths vs. equivalent Suboxone strengths at two pHs. The lack of further comparative dissolution data with Suboxone is accepted as Zubsolv is not to be interchanged with Suboxone, as discussed in the clinical sections below. However comparability of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in-vitro dissolution was shown for all strengths of the product within the Zubsolv product range at 3 pHs: pH 1.2, pH 4.5 and pH 5.8. Whilst some further data dissolution was provided at pH 6.8, the applicant's argumentation that such is not relevant due to the buffer effect in the sublingual cavity is accepted. As bioequivalence failed at the low concentration blend, the biowaiver within the range of the product cannot be assured at the low blend. This therefore also affects the medium concentration blend. As per clinical report, the SmPC will state that the 3 lower strengths are not to be substituted for the higher strengths.

The development of the dissolution method was sufficiently described and the discriminatory power of the method was considered acceptable.

The primary packaging is PVC/OPA/Al/PVC // Al/PET/Paper child resistant blister cards. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

## Manufacture of the product and process controls

The manufacturing process consists of the following main steps:  mixing/blending followed by compression and packaging. Due to the low content of active substances in the composition, the manufacturing process is considered to be non-standard.

The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process.  Critical  process parameters (CPPs) were discussed and appropriately controlled. The critical steps were identified and the CPPs controlled in these steps were presented.

The final proposed commercial process has been validated. The CHMP recommended the in-process controls and manufacturing process to be reviewed as part of the manufacturing process validation of the next three batches of each strength and as appropriate, the registered details will then be updated by variation.

## Product specification

The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, identification  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  related  substances (HPLC),  disintegration  (Ph.  Eur.),  friability  (Ph.  Eur.),  water  (Ph.  Eur.),  microbiological  Control  (Ph. Eur.).

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

Batch analyses data for key batches used in clinical studies, stability, validation and other relevant development studies are provided and confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

## Stability of the product

Stability data were provided for batches of each strength of the finished product stored according to the ICH guidelines conditions. Detailed information on batches used in the stability studies and stability data available for each strength/storage condition are provided in the table below:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 2: stability data description

| Strength       | Batch                      | Storage conditions (°C/% RH)   | Stability data available     |
|----------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 0.7 mg/0.18 mg | 3 production scale batches | 25/60 40/75                    | Up to 24 months 6 months     |
| 1.4 mg/0.36 mg | 3 production scale batches | 25/60 30/65 40/75              | 54 months 12 months 6 months |
| 1.4 mg/0.36 mg | 2 production scale batches | 25/60 40/75                    | 48 months 6 months           |
| 2.9 mg/0.71 mg | 2 production scale batches | 25/60 40/75                    | Up to 36 months 6 months     |
| 2.9 mg/0.71 mg | 1 production scale batch   | 25/60                          | 12 months                    |
| 5.7 mg/1.4 mg  | 3 production scale batches | 25/60 40/75                    | 54 months 6 months           |
| 5.7 mg/1.4 mg  | 2 production scale batches | 25/60 40/75                    | 48 months 6 months           |
| 8.6 mg/2.1 mg  | 2 production scale batches | 25/60 40/75                    | 36 months 6 months           |
| 8.6 mg/2.1 mg  | 1 pilot scale batch        | 25/60 40/75                    | 36 months 6 months           |
| 11.4 mg/2.9 mg | 2 production scale batches | 25/60 40/75                    | 36 months 6 months           |
| 11.4 mg/2.9 mg | 1 pilot scale batch        | 25/60 40/75                    | 36 months 6 months           |

The batches of medicinal product are either identical or representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

Samples were tested according to the shelf-life specifications. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.

Naloxone assay results were out of specification at accelerated conditions for many batches. Intermediate storage conditions have not been tested for all strengths. Therefore the storage condition 'do not store above 25 °C' was required.

For the 1.4 mg/0.36 mg strength and the 5.7 mg/1.4 mg strength, all data is within specification therefore a 48 months shelf life was considered acceptable.

For the 0.7 mg/0.18 mg strength, the applicant claimed 24 months shelf life as this strength shows the same trend during stability as the 1.4 mg/0.36 mg strength (both low concentration blend). 24 months shelf life was accepted.

The applicant claimed 36 months shelf life for the 2.9 mg/0.71 mg strength since it shows the same trend during stability as the 1.4 mg/0.36 mg and 5.7 mg/1.4 mg strengths (this medium concentration blend  is  in-between  the  low  and  high  concentration  blends).  As  trends  are  seen  in  the  naloxone stability in the 1.4 mg/0.36 mg, but not in the 5.7 mg/1.4 mg, a conservative approach was requested and a shelf life of 30 months was applied.

For the 8.6 mg/2.1 mg and 11.4 mg/2.9 mg strengths, stability results are within specification, therefore a 36 month shelf life was accepted.

Buprenorphine  Hydrochloride  and  Naloxone  Hydrochloride  dihydrate  are  well-known  pharmaceutical substances and the European Pharmacopoeia recommends that they should be stored protected from light.  The finished product is packed in PVC/OPA/Al/PVC // Al/PET/Paper blisters as the primary pack for the sublingual tablets.  This packaging is completely impenetrable to light.  The patient is instructed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that  the  blister  should  not  be  opened  until  just  before  administration.  This  is  primarily  a  safety precaution but also protects the product from light up to the point of administration.

The applicant, therefore, did not consider it necessary to conduct a photostability studies in line with ICHQ1B. The justification was considered acceptable.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years for the 0.7 mg / 0.18 mg strength, 4 years for the 1.4 mg / 0.36 mg and 5.7 mg / 1.4 mg strengths, 30 months for the 2.9 mg / 0.71 mg strength, 3 years for the 8.6 mg / 2.1 mg and 11.4 mg / 2.9 mg strengths when stored in the original package below 25°C as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

## Adventitious agents

No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues on process validation having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## 2.4.6. Recommendation for future quality development

In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

- The in-process controls and manufacturing process will be reviewed for the next three batches of each strength as appropriate by additional sampling according to Ph. Eur. 2.9.40 and as per the provided process validation scheme; the registered details will then be updated by variation.

## 2.5. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.5.1. Introduction

A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.

Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.

## 2.5.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

A Phase I, Phase II Tier A and relevant Tier B environmental risk assessments were conducted for both buprenorphine  and  naloxone.  Buprenorphine  and  naloxone  do  not  show  the  potential  to  affect  the environment when examined in sludge micro-organisms, aquatic, sediment, or soil.  However, both buprenorphine and naloxone meet the persistence label criteria.

## Main study

Study OX219-014 A fasting, open-label, randomised, 2-cohort, 2-period cross-over study to evaluate comparative bioavailability of OX219 compared to Suboxone tablet (EU sourced) at two dose levels in healthy volunteers under naltrexone block

Study  OX219-014  was  considered  to  be  the  pivotal  PK  comparative  bioavailability  study  for  this application bridging Zubsolv at the strengths 11.4/2.9 mg and 1.4/0.36 mg to corresponding doses of EU-sourced Suboxone reference product in 2 cohorts:

- Cohort 1: Zubsolv 11.4/2.9 mg vs. 2 x Suboxone 8/2 mg
- Cohort 2: 2 x Zubsolv 1.4/0.36 mg vs. 2 x Suboxone 2/0.5 mg

## Objectives

The  primary  objectives  were  to  determine  relative  systemic  bioavailability  of  buprenorphine  and naloxone to:

- Zubsolv 11.4/2.9 mg buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablet compared to 2x Suboxone 8/2 mg buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets
- Zubsolv 2 x 1.4/0.36 mg buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets compared to 2x Suboxone 2/0.5 mg buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets

The secondary objectives were to assess local tolerability; safety and tolerability; in vivo dissolve time of the tablets; taste acceptability and subject preference for Zubsolv versus Suboxone tablets.

## Study design

This  was  a  fasting,  open-label,  randomised,  2-period,  2-cohort,  4-treatment  cross-over  study  in healthy subjects under naltrexone block (Figure 9).

Figure 9 Schematic study design

<!-- image -->

In total, 125 healthy adult subjects entered the study and were randomised: 64 to Cohort 1 and 61 to Cohort 2. Two subjects discontinued the study: 1 subject in Cohort 1 received only 1 dose of study medication and 1 subject in Cohort 2 received both doses of study medication, but discontinued during treatment period 2. In total, 123 subjects completed the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All 125 subjects were included in the safety population and 123 subjects in the PK population. The PK population comprised 74 (60.2%) male and 49 (39.8%) females. All subjects were in the age range of 19 to 54 years and had a body mass index (BMI) ranging from 19.0 to 29.2 kg/m².

The  PK  population  comprised  85  (69.1%)  White,  35  (28.5%)  Black  or  African  American,  1  (0.8%) Asian,  and  2  (1.6%)  Multi-racial  subjects.  The  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  of  the  2 cohorts were similar.

The PK parameters Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, AUC0-72h, and t ½ were estimated where possible for each subject by treatment. Analysis of buprenorphine and unconjugated naloxone were considered as the primary analyses for establishing equivalence.

Metabolite data, norbuprenorphine and total naloxone, were considered as supportive information only. Geometric  mean  ratios  (GMR)  of  AUC0-72h  for  buprenorphine  and  norbuprenorphine;  AUC0-t  for naloxone  (unconjugated)  and  total  naloxone;  and  Cmax  for  all  analytes  were  estimated  for  the equivalence analysis.

Blood  samples  for  measurement  of  buprenorphine,  unconjugated  naloxone,  norbuprenorphine  and total naloxone were taken pre-dose (0 h) and 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h post dose of each treatment period.

For unconjugated naloxone, the 90% CIs of the Zubsolv:Suboxone GMRs for AUC0-t and Cmax were also fully within the standard bioequivalence limits of  80%  to  125%,  confirming  equivalent buprenorphine exposure between the formulations

For both metabolites, the 90% CI of Zubsolv:Suboxone GMRs for the exposure PK parameters (AUC and  Cmax)  were  lower  than  the  standard  bioequivalence  limits  of  80.00%  to  125.00%,  with  point estimates indicative of approximately 30% lower exposure from Zubsolv compared to Suboxone.

## Zubsolv 2.9/0.71 mg (2x 1.4/0.36 mg)

Derived PK parameters of buprenorphine are summarised in Table 7 for buprenorphine and in Table 8 for naloxone (above). A higher Cmax and AUC was observed for Suboxone compared with Zubsolv in this cohort.

The 90% CI of Zubsolv 2 x 1.4/0.36 mg: 2 x Suboxone 2/0.5 mg GMRs for buprenorphine did not demonstrate equivalence between the two products and were indicative of approximately 20% lower buprenorphine exposure following administration of Zubsolv (Table 12 below).

Likewise, statistical analysis of the secondary PK parameters AUC0-t and AUC0-inf for buprenorphine did not demonstrate equivalence between Zubsolv and Suboxone: GMRs were 80.51 (90% CI: 75.52 85.82) and 79.60 (90% CI: 74.64 - 84.88).

For unconjugated naloxone, the 90% CIs of the Zubsolv:Suboxone GMRs for AUC0-t and Cmax were outside  the  standard  bioequivalence  limits  of  80%  to  125%,  and  equivalence  between  2  x  Zubsolv 1.4/0.36 mg and 2 x Suboxone 2/0.5 mg could not be concluded. The naloxone exposure from Zubsolv was approximately 35% lower than for the Suboxone.

For  both  metabolites,  the  90%  CI  of  Zubsolv:  Suboxone  GMRs  for  the  primary  and  secondary  PK parameters  were  lower  than  the  standard  bioequivalence  limits  of  80.00%  to  125.00%  with  point estimates indicative of approximately 30% lower exposure from Zubsolv compared to Suboxone.

The subject-perceived in vivo dissolve times varied considerably between subjects for both dosages of both formulations. The median (minimum, maximum) subjective dissolve time was significantly shorter for 1 × Zubsolv 11.4 mg/2.9 mg (8.520 [0.88, 56.40] minutes) compared with 2 × Suboxone 8 mg/2 mg (16.210 [2.25, 53.25] minutes) (Hodges-Lehman estimate of median difference [95% CI]: -6.035 [-8.205,  -3.615]  minutes).  The  median  (minimum,  maximum)  subjective  dissolve  time  was significantly shorter for 2 × Zubsolv 1.4 mg/0.36 mg (7.580 [1.68, 50.97] minutes) compared with 2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

×  Suboxone  2  mg/0.5  mg  (9.080  [3.45,  33.20]  minutes)  (Hodges-Lehman  estimate  of  median difference [95% CI]: -1.485 [-2.635, -0.380] minutes). It is of note that the difference in dissolve time is a lot less with the lower dose.

Zubsolv  received  significantly  higher  VAS  scores  for  taste  and  mouthfeel  compared  to  Suboxone  at both dose levels. The distribution of ratings of unpleasant aftertaste indicated a lower frequency and intensity of unpleasant aftertaste for Zubsolv than for Suboxone. There was a statistically significant preference for the Zubsolv formulations over the Suboxone formulations. In the high-dose cohort, 50 of 63 subjects (79.4%) preferred 1 × Zubsolv 11.4 mg/2.9 mg (95% binomial CI: 69.4% - 89.4%). In the low-dose cohort, 47 of 61 subjects (77.0%) preferred 2 × Zubsolv 1.4 mg/0.36 mg (95% binomial CI: 66.5% - 87.6%).

In the high-dose comparison (Zubsolv 11.4 mg/2.9 mg versus 2 × Suboxone 8 mg/2 mg) 90% CIs of the  Zubsolv:Suboxone  AUC  and  Cmax  geometric  least-squares  mean  ratios  for  both  buprenorphine and  unconjugated  naloxone  were  fully  within  the  predefined  equivalence  boundaries  of  80.00%  to 125.00% and equivalent exposure between these products could therefore be concluded.

In the low-dose comparison (2 × Zubsolv 1.4 mg/0.36 mg versus 2 × Suboxone 2 mg/0.5 mg) 90% CIs of the Zubsolv:Suboxone AUC and Cmax geometric least-squares mean ratios were not contained within  the  predefined  equivalence  boundaries  of  80.00%  to  125.00%  for  either  buprenorphine  or unconjugated naloxone and equivalent exposure could not be concluded.

Point  estimates  of  AUC  geometric  mean  ratios  indicated  approximately  20%  lower  buprenorphine exposure  and  35%  lower  unconjugated  naloxone  exposure  from  Zubsolv  versus  the  Suboxone reference product.

Exposure  of  metabolites  (norbuprenorphine  and  total  naloxone)  was  lower  from  Zubsolv  than  from Suboxone at both dose levels and equivalent exposure could not be concluded. Point estimates of AUC geometric  mean  ratios  indicated  20%  to  30%  lower  metabolite  exposure  from  Zubsolv  versus  the Suboxone reference product.

Therefore,  in  this  pivotal  study,  with  the  higher  doses  there  was  equivalent  buprenorphine  and unconjugated naloxone exposure between the formulations. However for the lower strength, there was 20% lower buprenorphine exposure following administration of Zubsolv and naloxone exposure from Zubsolv was approximately 35% lower than for the Suboxone.

The  applicant  performed  a  post-hoc,  dose-normalised,  within-product,  parallel-group  analysis  to compare the  strengths  within  each  product  and  this  suggested  a  less  than  proportional  increase  in buprenorphine  exposure  with  increased  dose  for  either  Zubsolv  or  Suboxone.  For  unconjugated naloxone, a similar deviation from dose proportionality was observed between the Suboxone dosage strengths but not between the Zubsolv dosage strengths. For both buprenorphine and unconjugated naloxone, the deviation from dose proportionality appeared to be greater between Suboxone dosage strengths than between Zubsolv dosage strengths.

## Dose proportionality

Dose proportionality of Zubsolv over the dose interval 1.4/0.36 mg to 11.4/2.9 mg was investigated within-subject  in  study  OX219-004,  using  combinations  of  the  tablet  strengths  1.4/0.36  mg  and 5.7/1.4 mg (the only strengths developed at the time of the study). This study had a fasting, singledose, open-label, randomised, 4-treatment, 4-period crossover design, in which the subjects received 4 separate single-dose administrations of Zubsolv. Dose proportionality was confirmed for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

buprenorphine AUC0-t over the tested 8-fold dose range (1.4 to 11.4 mg), but not for AUC0-inf or Cmax, which increased slightly less than proportionally to increased dose.

Dose  proportionality  for  unconjugated  naloxone  was  confirmed  for  AUC0-t  and  AUC0-inf  over  the tested  8-fold  dose  range  (0.36  to  2.9  mg)  but  not  for  Cmax,  which  increased  slightly  less  than proportionally to increased dose.

For  the  metabolites,  dose  proportionality  was  confirmed  for  norbuprenorphine  Cmax,  AUC0-t,  and AUC0-inf,  and  total  naloxone  AUC0-inf  and  Cmax  over  the  tested  8-fold  dose  range  of  parent compounds buprenorphine/naloxone (1.4/0.36 mg to 11.4/2.9 mg). Total naloxone AUC0-t increased slightly more than proportionally to increased dose.

Both buprenorphine and naloxone exposure increased with dose. Buprenorphine exposure met the prespecified  criteria  for  proportionality  based  on  AUC0-t,  while  AUCinf  indicated  a  slightly  less  than proportional increase in exposure with increased dose. This was noted by the applicant to be consistent with  the  reference  product  Suboxone,  which  displays  a  slightly  less  than  proportional  increase  in buprenorphine exposure with dose, as described in the Suboxone SmPC. While less than proportional increase  in  buprenorphine  exposure  has  been  reported  for  both  Zubsolv  and  Suboxone,  exploratory post hoc data from study OX219-014 suggest that deviation from dose proportionality may be larger between Suboxone than between Zubsolv strengths. Regarding naloxone, both AUC0-t and AUCinf met the  dose  proportionality  criteria.  Cmax  for  both  buprenorphine  and  naloxone  increased  slightly  less than proportionally with dose.

Buprenorphine  exposure  met  the  pre-specified  criteria  for  proportionality  based  on  AUC0-t,  while AUCinf indicated a slightly less than proportional increase in exposure with increased dose. This was noted by the applicant to be consistent with the reference product Suboxone, which displays a slightly less  than  proportional  increase  in  buprenorphine exposure  with  dose,  as described in  the  Suboxone SmPC.

## 2.6.3. Pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. The pharmacodynamic properties of buprenorphine/naloxone combination are well characterised and described for the reference product and in the literature.

## 2.6.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Zubsolv has been developed in 6 strengths based on 3 different powder blends: the low concentration blend (0.7/0.18 mg and 1.4/0.36 mg strengths), the intermediate concentration blend (2.9/0.71 mg strength), and the high concentration blend (5.7/1.4 mg, 8.6/2.1 mg, and 11.4/2.9 mg strengths).

Based on scientific advice from selected EU national authorities, the bridging strategy was based on providing  comparative  bioavailability  data  on  the  11.4/2.9  mg  strength  (representing  the  high concentration blend) and the 1.4/0.36 mg strength (representing the low concentration blend) to the respective strengths of the EU reference product Suboxone.

The applicant considered that additional strengths of the respective blends could then be supported by biowaivers based on comparative in vitro dissolution. Furthermore, being intermediate to the high and low concentration blends, the 2.9/0.71 mg strength is supported by interpolation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Dose proportionality of Zubsolv over the dose interval 1.4/0.36 mg to 11.4/2.9 mg was investigated in study OX219-004.

Demonstration of equivalent buprenorphine and naloxone exposure between Zubsolv 11.4/2.9 mg and 2 x Suboxone 8/2 mg provides a PK bridge between the EU reference product Suboxone and the high concentration  blend  strengths  of  Zubsolv.  The  PK  bridge  between  the  high  concentration  blend strengths  of  Zubsolv  and  Suboxone  is  further  supported  by  the  demonstration  of  equivalent buprenorphine  exposure  between  Zubsolv  5.7/1.4  mg  and  US  sourced  Suboxone  8/2  mg  (US Suboxone has the same size and weight as EU Suboxone and the composition qualitatively only differs by the addition of a colouring agent in the US product.)

While equivalent buprenorphine exposure was not concluded between 2 x Zubsolv 1.4/0.36 mg and 2 x Suboxone 2/0.5 mg, the exposure difference was approximately 20% lower for Zubsolv, and this was attributed to a larger deviation from dose proportionality between Suboxone strengths than between Zubsolv strengths.

In  a  clinical  context,  buprenorphine  is  individually  titrated  to  clinical  effect,  and  if  small  exposure differences between products were to translate to differences in clinical effects, this would be naturally addressed  by  dose  adjustments  in  the  standard  care  of  the  patient.  Despite  the  deviation  from equivalence in exposure, the applicant proposes that the comparative bioavailability data between 2 x Zubsolv  1.4/0.36  mg  and  2  x  Suboxone  2/0.5  mg  provide  an  appropriate  link  between  the  low concentration blend strengths of Zubsolv and the Suboxone  reference product. Naloxone is insignificantly absorbed after sublingual administration. The purpose of naloxone is to deter parenteral abuse of the product and it has no utility for the intended sublingual route of administration. Thus the lower  naloxone  exposure  compared  to  the  Suboxone  reference  product  seen  in  the  comparison between 2 x Zubsolv 1.4/0.36 mg and 2 x Suboxone 2/0.5 mg (as well as between Zubsolv 5.7/1.4 mg and US sourced Suboxone 8/2 mg) would not be expected to be of any clinical significance.

## 2.6.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

It is acknowledged that Zubsolv is not intended for generic substitution, nor should it be treated as a generic in terms of strictly following the bioequivalence criteria. Failed proof of bioequivalence to the reference  product  can  be  to  a  certain  extent  superseded  by  available  efficacy  data  obtained  from clinical development of the product.

The results of the comparative bioavailability study show that at higher doses, Zubsolv and Suboxone may be bioequivalent but at lower doses, Zubsolv is not equivalent and delivers lower concentrations of both components in the combination.

It is agreed that for use of Zubsolv as a stand-alone treatment, the differences in drug delivery with different  doses  for  naloxone  could  be  acceptable.  The  differences  with  buprenorphine  are  of  more concern but could be handled by careful individual titration of Zubsolv doses since treatment of opioid dependence is based on titration of the individual patient response. The applicant has provided data on Zubsolv PK linearity in the proposed dosage range and differences to Suboxone (at lower strengths). These  differences  support  the  SmPC  recommendation  that  patients  are  not  transferred  from  one formulation to another.

The  composition  of  Zubsolv  tablets  is  not  considered  quantitatively  proportional  as  three  different blends  are  used  for  tablets  manufacture.    Dose  proportionality  of  Zubsolv  over  the  dose  interval 1.4/0.36 mg to 11.4/2.9 mg was investigated within-subject in study OX219-004, using combinations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of  the  tablet  strengths  1.4/0.36  mg  and  5.7/1.4  mg.    Both  buprenorphine  and  naloxone  exposure increased with dose. Buprenorphine exposure met the pre-specified criteria for proportionality based on AUC0-t, while AUCinf indicated a slightly less than proportional increase in exposure with increased dose.  Regarding  naloxone,  both  AUC0-t  and  AUCinf  met  the  dose  proportionality  criteria.  Cmax  for both buprenorphine and naloxone increased slightly less than proportionally with dose. Because of the small deviations in buprenorphine dose proportionality exposure parameters as well as deviations from strict  compositional  proportionality  for  the  three  lower  strengths  (0.17/0.18mg,  1.4/0.36mg  and 2.9/0.71mg), using multiples of the three lower dose presentations of Zubsolv to substitute for any of the three higher dose presentations  is not recommended.

## 2.6.6. Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of Zubsolv in the proposed indication was bridged to Suboxone.  Additional supportive efficacy data from clinical studies conducted with Zubsolv in the US were also included in this application.  Studies OX219-006 and -007, which evaluated the early treatment efficacy of Zubsolv, were designed to support a US label extension to include induction of treatment. Study OX219-008 was a multi-centre, open-label, single-arm, uncontrolled extension study, which enrolled 665 opioiddependent patients who had completed studies OX219-006 or OX219-007 and chose to continue treatment.  In addition, a comprehensive literature review was performed to search for any relevant new findings relating to the use of buprenorphine, either alone or in combination with naloxone.

## Supportive studies

## Efficacy of Zubsolv in opioid-dependent patients

More than 1000 opioid-dependent male and female patients between 18 and 65 years of age were enrolled into studies OX219-006 and -007. Although the studies were conducted in the US, the patient population  enrolled  was  considered  to  be  relevant  to  the  EU  opioid-dependent  population,  with  the majority of patients reporting lifetime use of heroin (62.6% in study OX219-006, and 66.4% in study OX219-007).

## Study OX219-006

Study OX219-006 started with a 2-day, blinded, fixed-dose assessment period, in which patients were randomised to either Zubsolv (5.7/1.4 mg on Day 1, and 5.7/1.4 to 11.4/2.81 mg on Day 2) or generic buprenorphine (8 mg buprenorphine on Day 1, and 8 mg to 16 mg on Day 2). On Day 3, patients on generic  buprenorphine  were  switched  to  open-label  Suboxone  Film.  Doses  were  titrated  up  to  a maximal daily dose of 17.1/4.2 mg and 24/6 mg buprenorphine/naloxone for Zubsolv and Suboxone, respectively, based on clinical symptoms.  On Day 15, all patients switched treatments according to a fixed Zubsolv:Suboxone conversion factor of 5.7:8, so that patients who previously received Suboxone Film were given Zubsolv, and patients previously receiving Zubsolv were given Suboxone Film.  The primary endpoints were retention in treatment at Day 3 and Day 15 (measured by the proportion of randomised  patients  retained  in  each  treatment  group).  Additional  measures  of  efficacy  included symptoms  of  opioid  withdrawal  (measured  by  the  Clinical  Opiate  Withdrawal  Scale  [COWS]  and Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale [SOWS]), and cravings (measured by the opioid cravings VAS), illicit  drug use (self-reports and urine drug screen), and addiction severity (Addiction Severity Index [ASI-Lite]).  The primary analysis was based on non-inferiority testing of retention in treatment on Day

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3 and Day 15 performed on the per-protocol analysis set. Zubsolv was to be considered non-inferior if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference between the 2 treatments in the proportion of patients retaining treatment on each of the 2 visits was ≥-10%. To preserve a 5% significance level, the Day 15 visit was tested initially and if non-inferiority was demonstrated at this visit, the Day 3 data were then to be tested for non-inferiority using the same method.

In total, 758 patients were randomised and received treatment in study OX219-006. For the primary endpoint of retention in treatment, Zubsolv was non-inferior to buprenorphine/ Suboxone at both Day 3  and  Day  15.  At  Day  15,  83.0%  of  the  patients  (273/329)  in  the  Zubsolv  group  were  retained  in treatment compared with 82.5% (269/326) in the Suboxone group; Zubsolv to Suboxone difference: 0.5% (95% CI -5.3, 6.3). As the lower limit of the CI was ≥-10% (the pre-specified non-inferiority margin), non-inferiority of Zubsolv was established at this time point. At Day 3, 93.9% of the patients (309/329) in the Zubsolv group were retained in treatment compared with 92.6% (302/326) in the buprenorphine group; Zubsolv to buprenorphine difference: 1.3% (95% CI -2.6, 5.1). As the lower limit  of  the  CI  was  ≥-10%  (the  pre-specified  non-inferiority  margin),  non-inferiority  of  Zubsolv  was also  established  at  Day  3.  Non-inferiority  was  also  demonstrated  in  the  full  analysis  set,  thus supporting the primary analysis.

Secondary efficacy endpoints (retention at each visit, COWS, SOWS, craving VAS scores, and time to first  opioid-negative  urine  drug  sample)  were  similar  between  treatments,  with  no  statistically significant differences. Following the treatment switch at Day 15, continued improvements in COWS, SOWS, and craving VAS scores were observed for patients in both groups at the end of study. Of the patients who switched to Zubsolv at Day 15, 3.0% withdrew before Day 22, and of the patients who switched to Suboxone Film, 4.4% withdrew by Day 22.

## Study OX219-007

Study OX219-007 started with a 2-day blinded, fixed-dose assessment period, in which patients were randomised to either Zubsolv (5.7/1.4 mg on Day 1, and 5.7/1.4 to 11.4/2.81mg on Day 2) or generic buprenorphine (8 mg buprenorphine on Day 1, and 8 mg to 16 mg on Day 2). On Day 3, all patients received an open-label dose of Zubsolv 5.7/1.4 mg or 11.4/2.8 mg. Doses on Day 4 through Day 28 were individually titrated between 5.7/1.4 mg and 17.1/4.2 mg. The primary endpoint was retention in treatment at Day 3. The same additional measures of clinical efficacy as in Study OX219-006 were evaluated as secondary endpoints.

310 patients were randomised and received treatment. For the primary endpoint, a lower proportion of patients in the Zubsolv group than in the generic buprenorphine group were retained at Day 3: 88.3% (113/128) versus 95.3% (122/128), respectively, Zubsolv to buprenorphine difference: -7.0% (95% CI -13.7, 0.4). As the lower limit of the CI was &lt;-10% (the pre-specified non-inferiority margin), noninferiority of Zubsolv was not established.

Secondary endpoints (COWS, SOWS, and craving VAS) indicated similar treatment effects for Zubsolv and generic buprenorphine.

Although non-inferiority was not demonstrated by the primary endpoint analysis in study OX219-007, examination  of  the  reasons  for  discontinuation  from  the  study  and  a  review  of  the  data  for  the secondary endpoints did not suggest that this was driven by a difference in efficacy or safety between the treatment groups.  Further reassurance is provided by a post hoc analysis of retention in treatment at Day 3 using data pooled from both studies OX219-006 and -007 were supportive of a conclusion of non-inferiority of Zubsolv to generic buprenorphine, at the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 10%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study OX219-008

Study  OX219-008  was  a  multi-centre,  open-label,  single-arm,  uncontrolled  extension  study,  which enrolled  665  opioid-dependent  patients  who  had  completed  studies  OX219-006  or  OX219-007  and chose  to  continue  treatment.  The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  follow  the  patients  on  treatment  with Zubsolv for an extended period of time and collect further efficacy and safety data. Patients received up to 24 additional weeks of treatment with Zubsolv.

The results provide evidence of a continued clinical effect from the previous studies, based on COWS, SOWS, and craving VAS total scores. As shown in studies OX219-006 and -007, in terms of impact upon the severity of opioid dependence, improvements from baseline continued through study OX219008  on  all  7  subscale  scores  on  the  ASI-Lite  for  the  overall  population  at  Week  12  and  Week  24. Retention rates were consistent with previous long-term studies with buprenorphine (43.9% at Week 24/End  of  Study)  and  may  reflect  the  absence  of  treatment  adjuncts  during  the  study  (e.g. counselling, participation in 12-step programmes).

## Results of the literature review relating to efficacy

Several studies reported efficacy data for buprenorphine versus active control for treatment of opioid dependence. Compared with naltrexone, buprenorphine maintenance treatment was associated with higher retention rates and a lower degree of positive urine samples (Bandawar et al 2015, Mokri et al 2015).  Comparisons  versus  methadone  indicate  slightly  higher  retention  rates  on  methadone  under similar treatment settings (e.g. Hser et al 2015, Burns et al 2014, Saxon et al 2013), although this difference was not evident in all studies (e.g. Piralishvili et al 2015).

When used for short-term opioid detoxification, buprenorphine demonstrated superior efficacy based on relief from abstinence symptoms and cravings as well as on completion of detoxification compared with  clonidine  (Ling  et  al  2005,  Hussain  et  al  2015,  Steele  and  Cunningham  2012).    Two  studies examining the efficacy of different tapering durations with buprenorphine showed contradictory results. One study found that a 4-week tapering schedule followed by transfer to naltrexone maintenance had more successful outcomes than a 1- or 2- week schedule for the entire 12-week follow-up period, both on retention in treatment and opioid-negative urine (Sigmon et al 2013). In contrast, another study found that abstinence was superior at the end of a 1-week taper than after a 4-week taper (Ling et al 2009).  Regardless  of  tapering  schedule,  long-term  success  rates  for  tapering  remain  low  with prolonged  abstinence  of  no  more  than  5%  to  15%  (e.g.  Weiss  et  al  2011,  Wright  et  al  2011)  and clearly inferior to maintenance treatment (e.g. Fiellin et al 2014).

Efficacy  data  reported  in  the  literature  are  in  line  with  efficacy  data  in  the  SmPC  for  the  reference product  Suboxone  and  revealed  no  new  information  considered  to  have  an  impact  on  the  current efficacy assessment for buprenorphine alone or in the combination with naloxone.

## 2.6.7. Discussion on clinical efficacy

This hybrid marketing authorisation application is primarily supported by the PK bridge to the reference product, Suboxone.

Studies OX219-006, -007 and -008 were conducted in support of a US label extension for including induction of treatment in the label.  The applicant points out that US Suboxone has the same size and weight as EU Suboxone and the composition qualitatively only differs by the addition of a colouring agent in the US product.  The Zubsolv clinical studies (OX219-006, -007 and -008), which involved a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

total of 1068 opioid-dependent patients, indicate that Zubsolv could be an effective treatment option, providing support to the pivotal PK bridging data.

Additionally,  a  comprehensive  literature  review  revealed  no  new  information  that  would  have  an impact  on  the  current  efficacy  assessment  for  buprenorphine  alone  or  for  the  combination  of buprenorphine with naloxone.

There are no clinical studies utilising the 0.7/0.18 mg or 2.9/0.71 mg tablets however there are almost two  years  of  post-marketing  experience  with  these  strengths  in  the  US  with  no  identified  postmarketing concerns or safety issues.  These strengths are needed to titrate doses and provide options for prescribers and are considered to be acceptable.

## 2.6.8. Conclusions on clinical efficacy

The efficacy of Zubsolv in the proposed indication is supported by:

- -bridging to the EU-sourced reference product Suboxone;
- -the US Zubsolv clinical studies (OX219-006, -007 and -008); and
- -literature review.

## 2.6.9. Clinical safety

The safety of Zubsolv has been bridged to Suboxone. In addition, supportive safety data from the 8 clinical trials and post-marketing data from the US licenced Zubsolv product was provided. A literature review was also conducted by the applicant, which encompassed the period from October 2002 to 1 June 2012, together with a more recent search covering the period 1 June 2012 to 2 April 2016.

In total, Orexo has performed three patient studies (OX219-006, -007 and -008) and five clinical studies in healthy subjects (OX219-014 pivotal study, OX219-003, -004, -005, -009) using the final commercial product (FCP) of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablet (Zubsolv).

## Patient exposure

Overall, 338 healthy adult volunteers and 1068 opioid dependent patients received test and reference products in the clinical development programme presented for Zubsolv. Including 125 healthy subjects in  the  pivotal  OX219-014 study. Overall, 1,295 subjects were exposed to Zubsolv FCP: 330 healthy subjects and 965 patients.

The route of dosing for both the test and reference products in each study was sublingual apart from study OX219-009 where buccal administration was used (for the reference treatment [B] only). In the healthy subject studies exposure was to single doses of study treatment.

Long-term safety and tolerability in patients was investigated in Studies OX219-006, -007 and -008. The  majority  of  patients  were  white  and  male.  The  patient  studies  provided  a  longer  duration  of exposure, representing 273.0 patient-years overall. In total, 270 patients received at least 6 months of treatment.  OX219-008  was  a  multi-centre,  open-label,  uncontrolled  extension  study  conducted  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients  who  completed  studies  OX219-006  or  -007  to  assess  safety  and  efficacy  for  maintenance treatment of opioid dependence with Zubsolv.

## Adverse events

The  adverse  drug  reactions  listed  in  Section  4.8  of  the  proposed  Zubsolv  SmPC  correspond  to  the reference product Suboxone. The data has been compiled from pivotal clinical trials in which, 342 of 472  patients  (72.5  %)  reported  adverse  reactions  and  adverse  reactions  reported  during  postmarketing surveillance of Suboxone.

The most commonly reported treatment related adverse reactions reported during the pivotal clinical trials for Suboxone were constipation and symptoms commonly associated with drug withdrawal (i.e. insomnia, headache, nausea, hyperhidrosis and pain). Some reports of seizure, vomiting, diarrhoea, and elevated liver function tests were considered serious.

The ADRs also correspond to the licenced US Zubsolv product. Adverse events commonly observed with  administration  of  the  licenced  US  Zubsolv  product  during  clinical  trials  and  post-marketing experience  are  headache,  nausea,  vomiting,  hyperhidrosis,  constipation,  signs  and  symptoms  of withdrawal, insomnia, pain, and peripheral oedema.

All  sections  relating  to  safety  in  the  proposed  SPC,  i.e.  Section  4.3-4.9,  directly  correspond  to  the reference SPC of Suboxone.

## Clinical studies in healthy subjects

(OX219-014 pivotal study, OX219-003, -004, -005, -009)

Overall,  the  most  commonly  reported  AEs  in  healthy  subjects  after  administration  of  Zubsolv  were nausea (23.0%), dizziness (11.2%), vomiting (10.6%), headache (10.4%) and abdominal pain (6.1%)

In  the  pivotal  study  OX219-014,  124  AEs  were  reported  by  52  of  the  125  subjects  (41.6%)  who participated in this study, 7 of 63 (11.1%) after receiving Zubsolv 11.4/2.9 mg, 20 of 64 (31.3%) after receiving 2 x Suboxone 8/2 mg, 20 of 61 (32.8%) after receiving 2 x Zubsolv 1.4/0.36 mg and 17 of 61 (27.9%) after receiving 2 x Suboxone 2/0.5 mg. Across all treatments, the AEs reported by most subjects were nausea (20.8%), vomiting (15.2%), dizziness (10.4%) and headache (10.4%).

Somnolence was also reported as a common AE in both study OX219-005 and -009. Other common AEs in study OX219-009 only, were abdominal pain, fatigue and decreased appetite. Adverse events ranged from mild to moderate in severity.

Three unexpected AEs, of mild severity, were identified in study OX219-003 (2 cases of hypoaesthesia and 1 case of salivary hypersecretion). No unexpected AEs were reported in studies OX219-004, -005, -009 or -014.

There were no serious adverse events reported in healthy subjects.

## Patient studies (OX219-006, -007 and -008)

Treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) were seen in ≥5% of patients in the same two System Organ Classes, SOCs (gastrointestinal disorders and nervous system disorders) in both study OX219-006 and -007. These are comprised of known events consistent with the current prescribing  information  for  the  maintenance  of  opioid  dependence  indication.  Overall,  most  TEAEs reported  during  both  phases  of  the  study  were  mild  to  moderate,  with  severe  events  reported  in &lt;2.5% of patients. There were no evident imbalances between the treatment groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  SOCs  across  the  3  patient  studies  that  had  events  reported  in  ≥5%  of  patients  were gastrointestinal disorders, nervous system disorders, psychiatric disorders and infections and infestations.  No  individual  PTs  occurred  in  either  the  Zubsolv  or  reference  groups  in  ≥5%  of  the population.  Treatment-related  TEAEs  in  these  SOCs  included  most  commonly  nausea,  vomiting, constipation, insomnia and headache.

In general there was a balanced incidence and severity of all TEAEs between Zubsolv and reference (Suboxone).

The SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders and infections and infestations had events reported in ≥5% of patients  (72  [10.3%]  and  47  [6.7%],  respectively)  in  the  study  OX219-006.  The  2%  difference between the treatments in patients with TEAEs in the SOC of infections and infestations was largely driven  by  infections  unrelated  to  study  treatment  such  as  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  which occurred in 5 patients in the group taking Zubsolv versus 1 patient in the group taking buprenorphine/Suboxone, and oral herpes occurring in 4 patients in the group taking Zubsolv versus no patients in the group taking buprenorphine/Suboxone.

In the SOC of psychiatric disorders in study OX219-007, insomnia was reported in ≥5% of patients only in the generic buprenorphine group (11 patients out of 155 [7.1%]). Only 4 patients out of 155 (2.6%) experienced insomnia in the Zubsolv group.

In  OX219-006,  -007  and  OX219-008,  the  most  commonly  reported  treatment-related  TEAE  was constipation &lt;5%.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

The SAEs and safety data listed in the proposed Zubsolv SmPC correspond to the reference product Suboxone  and  are consistent with the known  safety profile for the buprenorphine/naloxone combination product. SAEs for this product and opioids as a class are well known and adequate risk mitigation measures are detailed in the SmPC.

Adverse events in both healthy subjects and patient clinical studies were comparable between Zubsolv and reference product. The SAEs were consistent with the known safety profile for the buprenorphine/naloxone combination product.

## Laboratory findings

The abnormalities in laboratory values listed in the proposed Zubsolv SmPC correspond to the safety profile  of  the  reference  product  Suboxone  and  are  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  for  the buprenorphine/naloxone combination. Clinical studies with Zubsolv showed abnormalities in laboratory values consistent with the known adverse reaction profile.

## Safety in special populations

The special populations identified in the proposed Zubsolv SmPC correspond to the reference product Suboxone and include elderly, paediatric population, pregnancy and breastfeeding, hepatic impairment and renal impairment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  following  populations  of  patients  were  excluded  from  participating  in  Zubsolv  clinical  studiespatients over the age of 65 years, patients below the age of 18 years, pregnant or lactating women and newborns, patients with severe liver disease.

No  recommendations  on  posology  are  made  for  the  elderly  population.  Adolescents  age  15  to  &lt;18 years should be more closely monitored during treatment. Zubsolv is not recommended in pregnancy and breast-feeding. Caution is required when prescribing in severe renal impairment and Zubsolv is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.

The risk mitigations measures for special populations are in line with Suboxone and consistent with the additional supportive data in the dossier.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Drug  interactions  included  in  the  proposed  safety  information  are  cytochrome  P-450  3A4  (CYP3A4) inhibitors and inducers, drugs which potentiate CNS depression and drugs which potentiate respiratory depression. These drug interactions adequately represent the known safety profile and correspond to the reference SmPC.

The  interaction  with  serotonergic  drugs  has  been  identified  as  a  risk  in  the  licenced  US  Zubsolv, involving  reports  of  the  concomitant  use  of  opioids  with  other  drugs  that  affect  the  serotonergic neurotransmitter system resulting in serotonin syndrome.

The  remaining  proposed  drug  interactions  adequately  represent  the  known  safety  profile  and correspond to the SmPC of a reference product.

## 2.6.10. Post marketing experience

Zubsolv received approval for the US market on July 3rd 2013. Since authorisation, the AEs of adrenal insufficiency and androgen deficiency were included in Section 6.2 of the post-marketing data in the US Zubsolv label.

## 2.6.11. Discussion on clinical safety

Both buprenorphine and naloxone are well-established medicinal products with known safety profiles. The combination of both products into a single formulation for the treatment of opioid dependence has a well-established safety profile.

The safety profile for Zubsolv has been derived mainly from Suboxone, an established buprenorphine/ naloxone product for the same indication and supported by 8 clinical studies involving 1,295 subjects who received Zubsolv, including healthy subjects and opioid-dependent patients. No new safety signals were identified in the Zubsolv studies conducted in patients and healthy subjects, and the data are consistent with the established safety profiles for buprenorphine and naloxone and Suboxone.

Furthermore, there is clinical experience with the product on the US market since July 3rd 2013, with an estimated 44,800 Zubsolv patient-years exposure. No significant additional safety signals were identified in a review of the available literature.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the context of switching between Suboxone and Zubsolv products, the risk of under-dosing with secondary withdrawal symptoms is mitigated with amended guidance for switching formulation in Section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC. In addition, in the clinical context, buprenorphine is individually titrated to clinical effect, and if small exposure differences between products were to translate to differences in clinical effects, this would be addressed by dose adjustments in the standard care of the patient.

## 2.6.12. Conclusions on clinical safety

No new significant safety concerns were identified for Zubsolv and the safety profile is acceptable.

## 3. Benefit-risk balance

## 3.1. Therapeutic Context

## 3.1.1. Disease or condition

Opioid dependence is associated with considerable health risks and severe economic and psychosocial consequences for the opioid dependent person and their family. It is linked to a substantially increased risk of premature death from drug overdoses, violence and suicide.

Furthermore, sharing of needles among intravenous users contributes to the spread of potentially fatal blood infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C.

## 3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

Opioid substitution is recognised as an effective therapy for keeping patients in treatment programmes and reducing the use of illicit opioids. The principle is to replace the opioid of abuse with a more longacting  opioid  which  will  not  give  a  rush  or  a  high  but  will  relieve  the  opioid-dependent  person  of cravings and enable return to a more normal life. Methadone (which can be dosed once daily) has little impact  on  mood,  judgement,  and  psychomotor  skills  in  opioid-tolerant  patients,  and  was  thus  a mainstay  of  treatment  of  opioid  dependence  for  many  years.  However,  the  combination  of  its  long terminal  half-life  and  potent  full  μ-opioid  receptor  agonism  is  associated  with  toxicity  problems  and fatal.

Buprenorphine is an alternative option for substitution therapy, administered either alone or combined with  naloxone.  The  naloxone  component  is  included  to  deter  abuse  by  other  routes  (particularly intravenous), by which it results in systemic levels sufficient to cause unpleasant withdrawal effects.

Zubsolv  is  a  rapidly  disintegrating  sublingual  tablet  containing  buprenorphine  and  naloxone  in  a combination ratio of 4:1 for substitutional treatment of opioid dependence. Buprenorphine is a partial

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

μ-opioid receptor agonist known to relieve drug withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Naloxone is a full μ-opioid receptor antagonist, added to deter intravenous (IV) abuse of the medication. Due to the low sublingual bioavailability, naloxone has insignificant or no effects when taken sublingually as intended.

Zubsolv has been developed using technology for sublingual delivery that was to provide comparable systemic buprenorphine exposure to Suboxone tablets at a lower administered dose of the drug due to its higher bioavailability.

## 3.1.3. Main clinical studies

The  efficacy  of  Zubsolv  in  the  proposed  indication  is  bridged  to  the  EU-sourced  reference  product Suboxone.  The 'pivotal' PK bridging study for this application was study OX219-014, which bridged Zubsolv  at  the  strengths  11.4/2.9  mg  and  1.4/0.36  mg  to  corresponding  doses  of  EU-sourced Suboxone reference product in 2 cohorts:

- Cohort 1: Zubsolv 11.4/2.9 mg vs. 2 x Suboxone 8/2 mg
- Cohort 2: 2 x Zubsolv 1.4/0.36 mg vs. 2 x Suboxone 2/0.5 mg

Further  efficacy  data  from  clinical  studies  OX219-006,  OX219-007  and  OX219-008  conducted  with Zubsolv  in  the  US  together  with  results  of  a  literature  search  performed  to  determine  any  new, relevant findings with buprenorphine alone or combined, are considered supportive.

Study OX219-006 was a prospective, randomised, multi-centre, parallel-group, active-controlled, noninferiority  study  comparing  treatment  efficacy  and  adherence  of  the  sublingual  tablets  of  Zubsolv versus generic buprenorphine following induction of therapy during the first 3 days of treatment.  The purpose of this study was  to assess early treatment efficacy of Zubsolv vs Buprenorphine mono/Suboxone Film.

Study  OX219-007  was  a  prospective,  randomised,  multi-centre,  blinded,  parallel-group,  activecontrolled study comparing the sublingual tablets of Zubsolv versus buprenorphine monotherapy for the  induction  component  of  opioid  maintenance  therapy.    The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to demonstrate that induction on Zubsolv is non-inferior to induction on Buprenorphine monotherapy.

Study OX219-008 was a multi-centre, open-label, uncontrolled extension study conducted in patients who completed studies OX219-006 or -007.  The purpose of this study was to assess long-term (24 weeks) safety, efficacy and effects on quality of life and health economic parameters during Zubsolv treatment.

## 3.2. Favourable effects

The favourable effects of Zubsolv are in line with those of Suboxone. The applicant has provided data that suggest it dissolves more rapidly, and is more acceptable to patients form the point of view of taste.

The  efficacy  of  Zubsolv  in  the  proposed  indication  is  bridged  to  the  EU-sourced  reference  product Suboxone whereby efficacy  data  for  buprenorphine/naloxone  are  primarily  derived  from  a  one-year clinical  trial,  comprising  a  4-week  randomised  double  blind  comparison  of  buprenorphine/naloxone, buprenorphine and placebo followed by a 48 week safety study of buprenorphine/naloxone.  In this trial,  326 heroin-addicted subjects were randomly assigned to either buprenorphine/naloxone 16 mg per day, 16 mg buprenorphine per day or placebo. The primary study comparison was to assess the efficacy of buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone individually against placebo. The percentage of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

thrice-weekly urine samples that were negative for non-study opioids was statistically higher for both buprenorphine/naloxone versus placebo (p &lt; 0.0001) and buprenorphine versus placebo (p &lt; 0.0001).

## 3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

Favourable effects are based on adequate delivery of the constituents of the combination medicine. Buprenorphine levels should be adequate to prevent withdrawal and naloxone levels are required as a deterrent. The differences in drug delivery with the lower drug doses will require careful individual titration when using Zubsolv.

Small deviations in buprenorphine dose proportionality exposure parameters as well as deviations from strict compositional proportionality for the three lower strengths support the recommendation to not use multiples of the three lower dose presentations of Zubsolv to substitute for any of the three higher dose Zubsolv presentations.

The  differences  between  Suboxone  and  Zubsolv  formulations  imply  that  switching  between  the  two would  not  reproduce  the  same  plasma  concentrations  of  buprenorphine.  A  lower  buprenorphine exposure  from  Zubsolv  may  potentially  result  in  reduced  opioid  receptor  stimulation  leading  to withdrawal  symptoms  when  switching  from  another  buprenorphine  product  at  a  dose  level  below 5.7/1.4 mg. In addition, owing to the long terminal half-life of buprenorphine, it would take several days to reach a new steady state when switching between formulations. This uncertainty supports the recommendation that patients should not switch between products.

## 3.4. Unfavourable effects

The  safety  of  Zubsolv  in  the  proposed  indication  is  bridged  to  the  EU-sourced  reference  product Suboxone. The tabulated list of adverse events from the reference product Suboxone SmPC has been generated from pivotal clinical trials in which, 342 of 472 patients (72.5 %) reported adverse reactions and from adverse reactions reported during post-marketing surveillance.

In addition, supportive safety data from the 8 clinical trials, three patient studies (OX219-006, -007 and -008) and five clinical studies in healthy subjects (OX219-014 pivotal study, OX219-003, -004, 005, -009) were submitted. Post-marketing data from the US licenced Zubsolv product and literature review were also provided.

The most commonly reported treatment related adverse reactions reported during the pivotal clinical trials for Suboxone were constipation and symptoms commonly associated with drug withdrawal (i.e. insomnia, headache, nausea, hyperhidrosis and pain). Some reports of seizure, vomiting, diarrhoea, and elevated liver function tests were considered serious.

The  proposed  ADRs  were  also  observed  for  Zubsolv.  Adverse  events  commonly  observed  with administration of Zubsolv during clinical trials and post-marketing experience in the US are headache, nausea, vomiting, hyperhidrosis, constipation, signs and symptoms of withdrawal, insomnia, pain, and peripheral oedema.

## 3.6. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.6.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The clinical efficacy and safety of buprenorphine and naloxone are well known and well established in clinical use and have been the subject of many publications.  The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product information.

As switching between Suboxone and Zubsolv formulations may create potential for prescribing error, it is not recommended. Differences in posology between Zubsolv and Suboxone and Subutex are also an important identified risk in the RMP.

## 3.6.2. Balance of benefits and risks

The evaluation of Suboxone has concluded positive benefit risk for the combination of buprenorphine and naloxone.

The  Zubsolv  buprenorphine/naloxone  sublingual  tablet  was  designed  to  offer  higher  bioavailability, faster  disintegration,  and  improved  taste  masking  compared  with  the  Suboxone  reference  product. This  application  hence  concerns  a  suprabioavailable  drug  (Zubsolv)  which  is  being  registered  under hybrid legal basis.

From the regulatory as well as scientific point of view the pivotal BE study 014 (if bioequivalence was demonstrated) is considered sufficient to fully bridge the known efficacy and safety profile of Suboxone to the proposed product - Zubsolv.  Other submitted data can be considered as supportive.

It is acknowledged, that Zubsolv is not intended for generic substitution, nor should it be treated as a generic in terms of strictly following the bioequivalence criteria. Failed proof of bioequivalence to the reference product could be to a certain extent superseded by other available data and hence the strict proof  of  bioequivalence  was  not  deemed  necessary.  The  additional  information  documenting  PK linearity  (dose  proportionality)  across  the  entire  dosage  range  has  established  an  adequate  bridge across the dosage range of Zubsolv and provided evidence to support its use as a stand-alone therapy.

## 3.6.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

Not applicable.

## 3.7. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Zubsolv sublingual tablet is positive.

## 4. Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Zubsolv is favourable in the following indication:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Substitution treatment for opioid drug dependence, within a framework of medical, social and psychological treatment. The intention of the naloxone component is to deter intravenous misuse. Treatment is intended for use in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age who have agreed to be treated for addiction.

The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:
