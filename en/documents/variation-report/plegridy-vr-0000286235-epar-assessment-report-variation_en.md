## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Biogen Netherlands B.V. submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 11 July 2025 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation(s) requested   | Variation(s) requested                                                                                                          | Type              |

Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC based on interim results from study 105MS306. This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter, active-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BIIB017 in pediatric subjects aged 10 to less than 18 years for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, with optional open-label extension.

The requested variation(s) proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision(s) P/0419/2023 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP EMEA-001129-PIP01-11-M06 was completed.

The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP EMA/PE/0000273951.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The current variation concerns an update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a, BIIB017) based on interim results from paediatric study 105MS306. This update to Plegridy Product Information implements the outcome of the assessment of procedure EMA/PAM/0000245467 wherein the study was assessed previously.

Study 105MS306 is an open-label, randomized, active-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of BIIB017 with the active control interferon beta-1a (Avonex) in paediatric subjects aged 10 - &lt; 18 years with RRMS. 152 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with BIIB017 125 μg SC every 2 weeks or interferon beta -1a administered at a dose of 30 μg IM injection once weekly .

An interim analysis of Part 1a data was conducted after all participants completed Week 48 (n= 124). The primary endpoint was the adjusted annualized relapse rate (ARR) at week 48. The adjusted ARR (95% CI) was 0.521 (0.322, 0.843) in the Avonex group and 0.386 (0.231, 0.646) in the BIIB017 group. The main secondary endpoint at week 48, was the number of participants free of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions on brain MRI scans. At week 48, 0.136 (95% CI: 0.064, 0.243) participants in BIIB017 were free of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions compared to participants in Avonex group 0.065 (95% CI: 0.018, 0.157). Although the results between the Plegridy and Avonex groups are comparable, the study was not designed as a comparative trial between the treatments (e.g., noninferiority). Rather the primary objective was to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics with efficacy as exploratory  objective.  Due  to  the  open-label  design,  lack  of  blinding  and  no  comparative  analysis between the two treatment groups, the results are considered descriptive.

The results submitted are from an interim analysis and therefore may not fully capture the efficacy (and safety) profile of Plegridy in paediatric patients with RRMS. Thus it is agreed with the MAH to wait until

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the results of the study at week 96 are available to discuss a potential extension of the indication. When the results are available, and similar efficacy is (indirectly) observed compared to adult RRMS patients treated with Plegridy, the MAH is recommended to submit an extension of the indication for paediatric patients with RRMS based on paediatric extrapolation (as outlined in ICH11A).

Based on the efficacy and popPK results section 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 are updated. While the neutral wording of section 5.1 and 5.2 are agreed, the proposed changes to section 4.2 requires some amendment. The MAH proposes to include the statement ' The safety and efficacy of peginterferon beta1a in children and adolescents aged 10 to less than 18 years have not been fully established in multiple sclerosis '. This is not agreed as 'fully' may give the assumption that efficacy has been demonstrated to some extent for this patient population, whereas this is not supported by the current available data. The Applicant agrees to amend the PI as requested.

With respect to safety, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events  (reported in &gt; 10% of participants)  were  multiple  sclerosis  relapse  (50  participants  [32.9%]),  influenza  like  illness  (41 participants  [27.0%]),  injection  site  erythema  (31  participants  [20.4%]),  headache  (30  participants [19.7%]), and pyrexia (22 participants [14.5%]). Most adverse events occurred in similar rate in both treatment groups. Injection site erythema occurred more commonly in the Plegridy group as compared to Avonex (33.3% vs. 7.8%), which may be due to different route of administration of the products (SC vs. IM). Serious adverse events occurred in 13.2% of subjects, and apart from multiple sclerosis relapse occurred only in ≤ 2 patients per PT. A total of 2.7% of patients in the Plegridy group tested positive for neutralizing IFNβ -1a antibodies without apparent impact on efficacy or safety.

The MAH provided a comparative exercise between the AEs observed in paediatric study 105MS306 and adult  study  105MS301. Overall, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events reported for Plegridy in the paediatric population are in line with those reported in adults. Differences in frequencies observed between the adult and paediatric studies may be due to the large difference in sample size (512 vs. 75). The known effects of Plegridy on hematology and blood chemistry in adults were observed also in the current study in children. Based on the provided comparison, there appear to be no new safety risks for Plegridy in paediatric patients. All the relevant safety information is included in section 4.8 of the Plegridy SmPC.

The benefit-risk balance of Plegridy remains positive.

## 3. Recommendations

## Annex:  Rapporteur's  assessment  comments  on  the  type  II variation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5. Introduction

Plegridy  (peginterferon  beta-1a,  BIIB017)  is  currently  authorisated  for  the  treatment  of  relapsingremitting MS (RRMS) in adults. The purpose of this variation is to update the Plegridy Product Information based on 1-2 year interim paediatric data available from the 4 year ongoing Study 105MS306. This is an open-label, randomized, active-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of BIIB017 in pediatric subjects aged 10 - &lt; 18 years with RRMS.

The data was submitted previously in EMA/PAM/0000245467, where the outcome was to submit a type II variation to allow for an update to the Product Information.

## 6. Clinical Pharmacology aspects

## 6.1. Methods - analysis of data submitted

In study 105MS306 (see for more information on study design etc. section 7), sparse sampling was conducted in pediatric participants. A popPK approach was used to characterize the PK of BIIB017 in pediatric RRMS participants aged 10 to &lt;18 years.

To  be  noted,  a  popPK  model  was  originally  established  using  data  from  adult  healthy  and  RMS participants. In the pivotal Phase 3 study 105MS301, 1512 participants were randomized with a ratio of approximately 1:1:1 into 3 treatment groups: placebo, BIIB017 125 μg Q2W, and BIIB017 125 μg Q4W. BIIB017 or placebo was administered SC. The final popPK model was a one-compartment linear model with a first-order absorption rate. Body mass index was identified as a significant covariate on CL/F and V/F.

In study 105MS306, PK samples were collected for BIIB017 on Day 1, Week 4, and Week 24 visits. On Day 1 after the first dose and on Day 1 of Week 24, PK samples were collected within 8 hours of dosing. For Week 4, Day 1, PK sampling for BIIB017 was to occur within 8 hours after dosing, on Day 3 at 48 ± 12 hours (optional home visit for sampling, where available), and on Day 6 at 120 ± 24 hours (optional home visit for sampling, where available).

All samples were analyzed using a validated ELISA method (VeriKine-HS Human Interferon Beta Serum ELISA kit) with lower limit of quantitation of 15.6 pg/ml. PPK analysis was conducted to characterize the PK of BIIB017 in the pediatric participants. The individual parameter estimates from the final PPK model were used to generate simulated steady-state exposure metrics (AUC0-tau, Cmax, Ctrough, and tmax) for all pediatric RRMS participants receiving the approved adult dose of 125 µg Q2W via SC administration .

The PK analysis set included all participants who received at least 1 dose of BIIB017 treatment in Part 1 and  had  at  least  1  measurable  drug  concentration  postbaseline.  A  total  of  306  measurable  PK observations were collected from 75 participants from study 105MS306. One participant was excluded from the analysis due to being nonevaluable (i.e., no measurable PK observations). BLQ observations after administration of the first dose (posttreatment BLQ) account for 4.6% of all observations. These BLQ sample s  were  excluded  from  the  popPK  analysis,  which  was  deemed  appropriate  (&lt;  5%  of  all observations).  No  other  measurable  PK  data  were  excluded.  Consequently,  the  final  popPK  analysis dataset consisted of 74 participants and 292 PK observation records. The popPK report has been already submitted previously (EMA/PAM/0000245467).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 6.2. Results

For the popPK analysis, the existing popPK model for BIIB017 based on the adult PK data from study 105MS301 was evaluated using a validation VPC approach for its robustness in describing the data from pediatric  participants  in  study  105MS306.  Results  showed  that  the  popPK  model  underpredicted  the observed  BIIB017  plasma  concentrations  from  the  pediatric  RRMS  population.  Therefore,  model refinements were necessary to improve model fit of the data from pediatric participants. To conduct model refinements, the PK analysis dataset, which included data from study 105MS306, was combined with the prior PK data from adults. The refined final popPK model included a newly added covariate for population effect (pediatric versus adult) on CL/F and V/F. As indicated by the applicant, the refined model  showed  improved  fit  and  robustness,  as  confirmed  by  VPC  and  nonparametric  bootstrap,  in describing the PK data from pediatric participants in study 105MS306. Pediatric participants (10 to &lt; 18 years old) with RRMS were estimated to have about 56% lower CL/F and 46% lower V/F as compared with adult participants with MS.

The individual parameter estimates from the refined final popPK model were used to generate simulated steady-state exposure metrics (AUC0-tau, Cmax, and Ctrough) for all adult and pediatric MS participants in the pop PK analysis dataset receiving the 125 µg Q2W dose. The steady-state exposure values of adults and pediatrics, including Cmax, Ctrough, AUC0-tau and tmax are listed in table 1. Simulation results showed that individual pediatric exposures were highly overlapping with the individual adult exposures (figure 1), even though mean steady-state AUC0-tau in pediatric RRMS participants was about 2.5 times higher than in adult MS participants (figure 2). This was consistent with the estimated lower CL/F in pediatric participants. Similarly, simulated steady-state Cmax and Ctrough were higher in pediatric RRMS participants as compared with adult MS participants. Furthermore, among pediatric RRMS participants, exposure was similar between the age categories of 10 to &lt; 13 years (n=7) and 13 to &lt; 18 years (n=67). The steadystate tmax values are, in general, comparable between adults and pediatrics. The reason for relatively higher predicted exposure in pediatric participants might be due to higher bioavailability in the pediatric participants  leading  to  lower  CL/F  and  V/F.  However,  due  to  sparse  PK  sampling,  this  could  not  be confirmed in the current PPK analysis.

Additionally,  out  of  75  participants  randomized  to  the  BIIB017  group,  29  participants  (38.7%)  were tested positive for antiIFN β -1a antibodies and only 2 participants (2.7%) of them were tested positive for neutralizing IFN β -1a antibodies. The incidence of participants with neutralizing IFN β -1a antibodies in the BIIB017 group was low and at nonpersistent levels. There was no apparent impact on safety or clinical  efficacy,  although  the  analysis  was  limited  by  the  low  incidence  of  immunogenicity  (CSR 105MS306, Section 12.6). The low incidence and nonpersistent level of neutralizing antibody was also not considered to have any meaningful effect on the PK.

## 6.3. Discussion

The simulated individual steady-state exposures in pediatric RRMS participants were overlapping with the simulated individual adult steady-state exposures, however, the mean simulated AUC0-tau in pediatric RRMS participants was about 2.5 times higher than in adult RRMS participants. This was consistent with the  estimated  lower  apparent  clearance  in  pediatric  participants.  Among  the  pediatric  participants, exposures were comparable between participants aged 10 to &lt; 13 years and those aged 13 to &lt; 18 years. For the safety and efficacy aspects, reference is made to the sections below.

Based upon the obtained results in pediatric subjects, a paragraph was added to section 5.2 of the SmPC to include the results of the popPK analysis. The results have been appropriately worded.

## 7. Clinical Efficacy aspects

Study 105MS306 is a multiple-part study consisting of Part 1 (Part 1a and Part 1a + Part 1b) and Part 2. An interim analysis of the study with cut of data 24 August 2024  includes the analysis of Part 1a, i.e. Week 48 evaluation of the safety, tolerability, efficacy and PK of BIIB017 (Plegridy, peginterferon beta1a) 125 μg SC Q2W in comparison with the active control interferon beta -1a (Avonex) 30 μg IM weekly in paediatric participants aged 10 to &lt; 18 years for the treatment of RRMS.

## 7.1. Study population

The participants included in this ongoing  study were ages 10 to &lt; 18 years with a diagnosis of RRMS, an EDSS score between 0.0 and 5.5 at randomisation (Day 1), and 1 of the following additional criteria: ≥ 1 relapse in the 12 months prior to randomisation (Day 1); ≥ 2 relapses in the 24 months prior to randomisation (Day 1); or  evidence of asymptomatic disease activity (Gd-enhancing lesions) on brain MRI in the 6 months prior to randomisation (Day 1).

There were 152 participants randomised at a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with either BIIB017 (125 μg SC Q2W) or Avonex (30 μg IM weekly), including male (n=57) and female (n=95) participants with a median age of 15.5 years in the range of 10 to 17 years. Seventy-seven participants were randomised to receive Avonex, and 75 participants were randomised to receive BIIB017. There were 15 participants randomised to fulfil the PIP requirement of at least 12 evaluable participants for the primary endpoint ages 10 to &lt; 13 years and 137 participants randomised to fulfil the PIP requirement of at least 80 evaluable  participants  for  the  primary  endpoint  ages  13  to  &lt;  18  years.  Of  the  152  participants randomised, 12 participants who were 10 to &lt; 13 years old and 112 participants who were 13 to &lt; 18 years  old  completed  48  weeks  of  treatment.    Therefore,  124  participants  completed  48  weeks  of treatment fulfilling the PIP requirement for 100 completers by Week 48.

As of the data cutoff date, 52 participants (34.2%) discontinued study treatment overall: 33 participants (42.9%) in the Avonex group and 19 participants (25.3%) in the BIIB017 group. Overall, the most common reasons for study treatment discontinuation were physician decision (18 participants [11.8%]; 11 in the Avonex group and 7 in the BIIB017 group), AEs and participant withdrawal (11 participants [7.2%] each; 7 in the Avonex group and 4 in the BIIB017 group), and parent/guardian withdrawal (7 participants [4.6%]; 3 in the Avonex group and 4 in the BIIB017 group).

As of the data cutoff date, 47 participants (30.9%) were withdrawn from the study, 30 participants (30.9%) in the Avonex group and 17 participants (22.7%) in the BIIB017 group. Overall, the most common reasons for withdrawal from the study were physician decision (16 participants [10.5%]; 11 in the Avonex group and 5 in the BIIB)17 group), participant withdrawal (12 participants [7.9%]; 8 in the Avonex group and 4 in the BIIB017 group), AEs (9 participants [5.9%]; 6 in the Avonex group and 3 in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the BIIB017 group), and parent/guardian withdrawal (7 participants [4.6%]; 3 in the Avonex group and 4 in the BIIB017 group).

## 7.2. Results

The primary endpoint of this study was to assess annualized relapse rate (ARR) at Week 48. In the full analysis set overall, 111 participants (73%) did not relapse up to Week 48: 53 participants (69%) in the Avonex group and 58 participants (77%) in the BIIB017 group. A total of 59 relapses were reported: 35 in the Avonex group and 24 in the BIIB017 group. The adjusted ARR (95% CI) was 0.521 (0.322, 0.843) in the Avonex group and 0.386 (0.231, 0.646) in the BIIB017 group. Overall, the mean (SD) participant relapse rate was 0.61 (1.564). The mean (SD) participant relapse rate was 0.81 (1.994) in the Avonex group compared to 0.40 (0.907) in the BIIB017 group.

For  the  time  to  first  relapse  and  proportion  of  participants  free  of  relapse,  53  participants  (34.9%) experienced a relapse: 32 participants (41.6%) in the Avonex group and 21 participants (28.0%) in the BIIB017 group. The hazard ratio (BIIB017/Avonex) was 0.609 (95% CI: 0.35, 1.06). The number and percentage of participants who did not have a relapse regardless of time in the study was 99 (65.1%) overall: 45 participants (58.4%) in the Avonex group and 54 participants (72.0%) in the BIIB017 group. The estimated Kaplan-Meier proportion of participants who were relapse free at Week 48 was 0.712 overall, 0.662 in the Avonex group, and 0.764 in the BIIB017 group.

The number of participants with data available for brain MRI scans at Baseline and Week 48 was 128: 62 participants in the Avonex group and 66 in the BIIB017 group. The overall proportion of participants free of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions relative to baseline was 0.102 (95% CI: 0.055,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.67), of which 0.065 (95% CI: 0.018, 0.157) were in the Avonex group and 0.136 (95% CI: 0.064, 0.243) were in the BIIB017 group. At Week 48, the overall proportion of participants free of new MRI activity relative to baseline was 0.102 (95% CI: 0.055, 0.167): 62 participants in the Avonex group (0.065; 95% CI: 0.018, 0.157) and 66 participants in the BIIB017 group (0.136; 95% CI: 0.064, 0.243).

The adjusted mean (95% CI) number of new or newly enlarged T2 hyperintense lesions relative to baseline was 15.25 (95% CI: 10.79, 21.55) in the Avonex group and 17.76 (95% CI: 12.86, 24.53) in the BIIB017 group.

The overall mean (SD) number of Gd-enhancing lesions was 0.9 (3.17): 1.3 (4.23) in the Avonex group and 0.5 (1.59) in the BIIB017 group.

At Baseline, the overall mean (SD) number of Gd-enhancing lesions was 2.14 (4.10) in the Avonex group and 2.24 (4.12) in the BIIB017 group.

Cognitive ability was assessed by the SDMT conducted at Baseline and every 24 weeks throughout the study. At Week 48, the mean (SD) change from baseline in SDMT score was 4.6 (8.45) in the Avonex group and 1.3 (8.51) in the BIIB017 group.

At Week 48, the mean (SD) change from baseline in EDSS score was 0.00 (0.962) in the Avonex group and 0.15 (0.769) in the BIIB017 group. At Week 96, the mean change from baseline in EDSS score was -0.10 (0.682) in the Avonex group and 0.03 (0.695) in the BIIB017 group.

PedsQL scale scores were determined every 24 weeks, starting at Baseline. Overall, mean scores in each dimension were similar between Avonex and BIIB017 treatment groups, with mean scores within 1 SD, except for the Work/School dimension.

For the exploratory endpoints, progression of disability occurred in 6 participants (8%) in the Avonex group and 4 participants (5%) in the BIIB017 group. The hazard ratio (BIIB017/Avonex) for time to progression of disability based on Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for baseline EDSS score and age group, was 0.544 (95% CI: 0.152, 1.948).

## 7.3. Discussion

The  efficacy  data  of  study  105MS306  has  been  previously  assessed  in  an  article  46  procedure (EMA/PAM/0000245467).

Briefly,  the  study  design  was  considered  a  conventional  study  in  RRMS  in  terms  of  duration  and endpoints. The primary efficacy outcome was adjusted ARR at week 48, which was lower in the Plegridy group (0.386, 95% CI 0.231, 0.646)) as compared to the Avonex group (0.521, 95% CI 0.322, 0.843). MRI endpoints  were  overall  similar  between  Plegridy  and  Avonex,  with  slightly  higher  proportion  of participants free of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions or MRI activity in the Plegridy group as compared to Avonex on week 48. Changes in EDSS scores were minimal.

In the clinical overview, the MAH concludes that ' No efficacy conclusions can be drawn from this openlabel study, since a comparative inferential assessment to evaluate the primary efficacy endpoint was not included. Therefore, no recommendation on the use of BIIB017 in the paediatric populations has been made. '.

It is acknowledged that the study was not designed as a comparative trial between Plegridy and Avonex (e.g. non-inferiority), rather the primary objective was to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics with efficacy as exploratory objective. In addition, the results submitted are from an interim analysis and therefore may not fully capture the efficacy (and safety) profile of Plegridy in paediatric patients with RRMS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  proposed  wording  in  the  section  5.1  of  the  Plegridy  SmPC  adequately  describes  the  available information.

As also discussed previously in the Article 46 procedure, Study 105MS306 is insufficient to support a claim  of  efficacy  of  Plegridy  in  paediatric  patients  with  RRMS  in  light  of  the  methodological  issues identified (e.g. open label design etc.). In addition, the current submitted data are part of an interim analysis, with more data will become available when the study has been finalized. Hence, these data preclude a recommendation for a paediatric posology in section 4.2 of the Plegridy SmPC. The MAH proposes  to  include  the  statement  ' The  safety  and  efficacy  of  peginterferon  beta1a  in  children  and adolescents aged 10 to less than 18 years have not been fully established in multiple sclerosis '. This is not agreed as 'fully' may give the assumption that efficacy has been demonstrated to some extent for this patient population, whereas this is not supported by the current available data. Therefore, the MAH should remove 'fully' from the proposed wording in section 4.2. The MAH agrees to amend the PI as requested.

## 8. Clinical Safety aspects

## 8.1. Study 105MS306

In Study 105MS306 Part 1a, the most common TEAEs (reported in &gt; 10% of participants) were multiple sclerosis relapse (50 participants [32.9%]), influenza like illness (41 participants [27.0%]), injection site erythema (31 participants [20.4%]), headache (30 participants [19.7%]), and pyrexia (22 participants [14.5%]).

Of these TEAEs, the largest between-group difference was for injection site erythema: 6 participants (7.8%) in the Avonex group and 25 participants (33.3%) in the BIIB017 group; followed by multiple sclerosis  relapse:  30  participants  (39.0%)  in  the  Avonex  group  and  20  participants  (26.7%)  in  the BIIB017  group.  Overall,  10  participants  (6.6%)  had  a  TEAE  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  study treatment: 7 participants (9.1%) in the Avonex group and 3 participants (4.0%) in the BIIB017 group.

The most common SAE in both groups was multiple sclerosis relapse, which reflects MS disease activity.

Clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, and ECG evaluations were consistent with the known safety profile of BIIB017. With respect to immunogenicity, 57/150 (38.0%) tested positive for antiIFN β 1a antibodies (28 participants [37.3%] in the Avonex group and 29 participants [38.7%] in the BIIB017 group) and 15 participants (10.1%) tested positive for neutralising IFN β -1a antibodies (13 participants [17.3%]  in  the  Avonex  group  and  2  participants  [2.7%]  in  the  BIIB017  group).  The  incidence  of participa nts with neutralising IFN β -1a antibodies in the BIIB017 group was low and nonpersistent. There was no apparent impact on safety or clinical  efficacy,  although  the  analysis  was  limited  by  the  low incidence of immunogenicity.

## 8.2. Post hoc analysis - comparison with adult data

The following post hoc safety analysis was performed to provide further insight into the safety profile of BIIB017 in the paediatric population compared with the adult population.

## Overview of Paediatric and Adult Safety Outcomes in BIIB017 Studies

Table 2 summarises comparative safety events from Study 105MS306 (Part 1a, through Week 48) in paediatric  participants  and  the  controlled  BIIB017  Study  105MS301  in  adult  participants  receiving BIIB017 Q2W through Week 48 .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  general,  the  frequency  and  types  of  TEAEs  were  consistent  between  the  two  populations.  Any differences in reported frequencies should be interpreted with caution due to the smaller sample size of the paediatric population (N=75) and the open-label nature of the study.

Flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions are known side effects of BIIB017 treatment. The most commonly reported TEAE PTs in the SOC General disorders and administration site conditions in Study 105MS306 Part 1a were similar to those reported in the pivotal clinical Study 105MS301. These TEAEs included injection site erythema, influenza like illness and pyrexia. In Study 105MS301, most TEAEs associated with flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions were mild or moderate in severity. In Study 105MS306 Part 1a, all TEAEs in the SOCs General disorders and administration site conditions and Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  No  BIIB017 participants discontinued study treatment in Study 105MS306 Part 1a because of TEAEs in these SOCs.

In Study 105MS306 Part 1a, TEAEs of alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, and gamma-glutamyltransferase increased were consistent with the known hepatic enzyme elevations associated with BIIB017 treatment. Like the adult population, most hepatic enzyme elevations were &lt;3 x ULN. In Study 105MS301, elevations of ALT and AST (&gt;5 × ULN) were reported in 2% and &lt;1% of adults treated with BIIB017, respectively. In Study 105MS306 Part 1a, elevations of ALT and AST  &gt;5 × ULN  were  reported  in  1  participant  (1%)  and  in  no  participants  treated  with  BIIB017, respectively, up to Week 48. No participants had laboratory data corresponding to Hy's law in Study 105MS306 Part 1a as of the data cutoff.

1 Frequencies were defined as follows: Very common (≥ 1/10), Common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10).

In  summary, the post hoc comparative safety analysis demonstrates that the safety and tolerability profile of BIIB017 in paediatric participants is consistent with the established adult safety profile. No new safety signals were identified, and the observed numerical differences in adverse event frequencies do not represent clinically relevant distinctions between populations.

## Paediatric and Adult Leukocyte Counts in Plegridy Studies

Decreased peripheral blood counts, including decreases in leukocytes, have been reported in patients receiving BIIB017 and other interferons. Overall, the WBC dynamics in the Study 105MS306 Part 1a population  were  similar  to  those  observed  in  the  adult  population  from  105MS301.  In  both  Study 105MS306 Part 1a and 105MS301, the mean leukocyte counts decreased over 48 weeks but remained within normal limits. In Study 105MS306 Part 1a, the mean leukocyte counts decreased by 9.61% from baseline  at  Week  48  in  the BIIB017  Q2W  group.  In  Study  105MS301,  the  mean  leukocyte  counts decreased by approximately 9% from baseline in the BIIB017 Q2W group at Week 48.

In  Study  105MS306,  decreases  in  WBC  counts  of  &lt;3.0  ×  10 9 /L  were  observed  in  12%  of  patients receiving BIIB017 Q2W over 96 weeks. In 105MS301, decreases in WBC counts of &lt;3.0 × 10 9 /L were observed in 7% and 10% of patients receiving BIIB017 Q2W in Year 1 and Year 2, respectively.

The slight numerical differences in WBC between the two studies are likely explained by relatively small numbers of participants in Study 105MS306 Part 1a and are not considered meaningful. No participants in  study  105MS306 Part  1a  experienced  severe  or  serious  TEAEs  associated  with  decreases  in  WBC counts.

## 8.3. Real world safety data

Cumulative to 12 May 2025, a search of the global safety database for BIIB017 in cases &lt;17 years of age revealed 1891 events in 700 case reports. Of the 1891 events, 576 events (30%) were confirmed by health care professionals (HCPs), and 1315 events (70%) were reported by consumers. The majority of events (1823 events; 96%) were nonserious. Solicited reports constituted the predominant source of reports (76% of events), followed by spontaneous reports (22%) and noninterventional studies (2%). The most commonly reported events were off-label use (301 events; 15.9% of total events), product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administered to patient of inappropriate age (230 events; 12.2%), injection site erythema (81 events; 4.3%), influenza like illness (74 events; 3.9%), drug delivery system malfunction (73 events; 3.9%), headache (63 events;  3.3%),  pyrexia  (47  events;  2.5%),  fatigue  (46  events;  2.4%),  product  dose omission issue (39 events; 2.1%), and multiple sclerosis relapse (34 events; 1.8%). The most reported serious  event  was  MS  relapse  (16  events;  out  of  total  68  serious  events).  Overall,  the  findings  are consistent with the known safety profile for BIIB017.

## 8.4. Discussion

The safety data of study 105MS306  has  been  previously assessed in an article  46  pdWS (EMA/PAM/0000245467).

Summarising, most adverse events occurred in similar rate in both treatment groups. Injection site erythema occurred more commonly in the Plegridy group as compared to Avonex (33.3% vs. 7.8%), which may be due to different route of administration of the products (SC vs. IM). Serious adverse events occurred in 13.2% of subjects, and apart from multiple sclerosis relapse occurred only in ≤ 2 patients per PT. A total of 2.7% of patients in the Plegridy group tested positive for neutralizing IFNβ -1a antibodies without apparent impact on efficacy or safety.

The MAH provided a comparative exercise between the AEs observed in paediatric study 105MS306 and adult  study  105MS301. Overall, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events reported for Plegridy in the paediatric population are in line with those reported in adults. Differences in frequencies observed between the adult and paediatric studies may be due to the large difference in sample size (512 vs. 75). The known effects of Plegridy on hematology and blood chemistry in adults were observed also in the current study in children. Based on the provided comparison, there appear to be no new safety risks for Plegridy in paediatric patients.

In addition, a search was conducted in the Plegridy global safety database for case reports in paediatric patients (&lt; 17 years). Of the 700 reports, the most common reported events were related to off label use ('off  label  use'  15.9%  and  'product  administered  to  patient  of  inappropriate  age'  12.2%).  The remainder of the events reported are in line with the safety profile observed in study 104MS306 and the established safety profile of Plegridy in adults (e.g. influence, injection site erythema, pyrexia etc.).

All the relevant safety information is included in section 4.8 of the Plegridy SmPC.

The safety of peginterferon beta-1a in paediatric patients aged 10 to less than 18 years was studied in an open-label randomized active controlled paediatric trial with 152 paediatric patients with  RRMS  (peginterferon  beta-1a  n=75;  interferon  beta-1a  n=77).  66  patients  in  the peginterferon beta-1a group completed 48 weeks of this study. The following adverse events which are very common in the adult population were also reported as very common in the paediatric population: injection site erythema, influenza like illness, headache and pyrexia. The safety profile in paediatric patients receiving peginterferon beta-1a was consistent with that observed in adult patients.

## Question 1

The MAH is requested to discuss the data to support a paediatric posology and suitability of these data to allow extrapolation of the adult findings in RRMS to RRMS patients aged 10-18 taking into account the natural history course of RRMS in both children and adults and the observed RMI effects at week 48 and 96.

## Summary of the MAH's response

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

While the pathophysiology of RRMS appears broadly consistent across age groups, the higher relapse rate and MRI lesion burden in paediatric patients may influence treatment response dynamics. Genetic, serum, CSF, and cell-based studies largely support a shared biology between paediatric-onset and adultonset  disease.  However,  clinically  paediatric  onset  MS  is  generally  characterized  by  more  frequent relapses and MRI activity compared to adult-onset disease.

The exposure-response relationship for interferon beta-1a has not been fully characterized in paediatric patients, limiting the ability to confidently extrapolate efficacy from adult data. In addition, the adult studies  with  Plegridy  have  a  different  study  design  and  comparators  which  makes  comparisons  or extrapolations from adult data difficult. Given the clinical differences and different study designs direct comparisons and extrapolations are limited.

The  safety  profile  of  Plegridy  in  the  paediatric  population  observed  in  the  CHARGE  study  appears generally consistent with the known safety profile of Plegridy in adults with RRMS. However, meaningful comparisons of efficacy between paediatric and adult populations are limited by differences in the clinical course of paediatric multiple sclerosis, as well as by the design and interim results of the CHARGE study.

While regulatory frameworks support extrapolation in paediatric populations under certain conditions, the  current  evidence  base  for  Plegridy  in  paediatric  RRMS  does  not  yet  meet  the  threshold  for  full extrapolation due to the differences in disease activity, study design, and limited efficacy data. Paediatric MS is characterized by a more active disease course compared to adults ([Gorman 2009]; [Benson 2014]; [Waldman 2016]). Furthermore, in the interim analysis of the CHARGE study, there were no meaningful  differences  identified  in  efficacy  between  Avonex  and  Plegridy  in  paediatric  patients. Complete dataset from the CHARGE study, expected at Week 96, may offer further insight into the potential benefit of Plegridy in this population.

## Assessment of the MAH's response

The MAH's argumentation that there are differences in disease activity and study design prohibiting readily/ full extrapolation of Plegridy from adults to paediatric patients with RRMS is acknowledged.

However, partial extrapolation of efficacy obtained in adult patients with RRMS to paediatric patients with RRMS has been achieved previously (Tecfidera, EMEA/H/C/002601/II/0073).

For Tecfidera, a similar study was submitted as in the current procedure, i.e., a 96 week open-label study that evaluated Tecfidera against Avonex, in paediatric patients with RRMS aged 10 - &lt; 18 years. Although the study showed comparable efficacy of Tecfidera in paediatric patients (indirectly) compared to adults (randomized, placebo-controlled studies), in light of the methodological shortcomings (openlabel  design  etc.),  the  study  could  not  provide  stand-alone  confirmation  of  efficacy.  Consequently, paediatric extrapolation was applied and the CHMP concluded that extrapolation of efficacy from adults with RRMS to paediatric patients aged &gt; 13 years was feasible based on '… shared disease biology, similar  exposure  (derived  from  PK  studies),  and  similar  anti-inflammatory  effects.  Re-establishing efficacy on its own is not necessary .' (Tecfidera EPAR, p. 96-97). No exposure-response modelling was submitted as support for extrapolation and similarity in exposure was deemed sufficient.

Hence, disease similarity and differences in study designs between adult and paediatric patients with RRMS have  already  been  accepted  by  the  CHMP  in  2022.  Considering  the  similarities  between  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Plegridy paediatric development program and Tecfidera, it is anticipated that the same principles would be applied if the MAH would seek partial extrapolation of efficacy.

It is agreed with the MAHs argument that the interim analysis may not fully capture the efficacy (and safety) profile of Plegridy in paediatric patients with RRMS. Thus it is agreed with the MAH to wait until the results of the study at week 96 is available. When these results are available, and similar efficacy is (indirectly) observed compared to adult RRMS patients treated with Plegridy, the MAH is recommended to  submit  an  extension  of  the  indication  for  paediatric  patients  with  RRMS  based  on  paediatric extrapolation (as outlined in ICH11A).

As also discussed previously in the article 46 procedure, Study 105MS306 is insufficient to support a claim  of  efficacy  of  Plegridy  in  paediatric  patients  with  RRMS  in  light  of  the  methodological  issues identified (e.g. open label design etc.). In addition, the current submitted data are part of an interim analysis, with more data becoming available when the study has been finalized. These data preclude a recommendation for a paediatric posology in section 4.2 of the Plegridy SmPC.  The MAH proposes to include the statement ' The safety and efficacy of peginterferon beta1a in children and adolescents aged 10  to less than 18 years have not been fully established in multiple sclerosis '. This is not agreed as 'fully' may give the assumption that efficacy has been demonstrated to some extent for this patient population,  whereas  this  is  not  supported  by  the  current  available  data.  Therefore  the  MAH  should remove 'fully' from the proposed wording in section 4.2 ( 2 nd  RfSI ).

## Conclusion

Issue is not pursued further, but an update to section 4.2 of the SmPC and corresponding information in  the PL is needed (see 2 nd  request).

Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly

No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance

## Question 2

The MAH is recommended to amend the proposed text in section 4.8 of the Plegridy SmPC as follows:

## Paediatric population

The safety of peginterferon beta-1a in paediatric patients aged 10 to less than 18 years was studied in an  open-label  randomized  active  controlled  paediatric  trial  with  152  paediatric  patients  with  RRMS (peginterferon beta-1a n=75; interferon beta-1a n=77). 66 patients in the peginterferon beta-1a group completed 48 weeks of this study. The following adverse events which are very common in the adult population were also reported as very common in the paediatric population: injection site  erythema,  influenza  like  illness,  headache  and  pyrexia. The  safety  profile  in  paediatric patients receiving peginterferon beta-1a was consistent with that observed in adult patients.

1. As also discussed previously in the article 46 procedure, Study 105MS306 is insufficient to support a claim of efficacy of Plegridy in paediatric patients with RRMS in light of the methodological issues identified (e.g. open label design etc.). In addition, the current submitted data are part of an interim analysis, with more data becoming available when the study has been finalized. These data preclude a recommendation for a paediatric posology in section 4.2 of the Plegridy SmPC.

Therefore the MAH should remove 'fully' from the proposed wording in section 4.2.

The corresponding PIL wording needs to be amended accordingly, i.e., the MAH is requested to amend the wording in section 3 of the PL as follows:

## Children and adolescents

Plegridy is not recommended for use in children and adolescents because there is limited data on the use of Plegridy in this population. Plegridy should not be used in children and adolescents below
