This is a non-interventional non-imposed PASS study designed to assess the potential risk of desloratadine exposure on seizures, supraventricular tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation or flutter. In addition, section 4.2 of the SmPC is updated to remove that 'no data are available' in the paediatric population and section 4.4 is updated to include a cross reference to section 4.8 of the SmPC.

| II/0071 | Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to include photosensitivity as an adverse event as requested by the CHMP following the assessment of the PSUR 10. Section 4 of the Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the Portuguese local representative contact in the Package Leaflet. C.I.3.z - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL intended to implement the outcome of a procedure concerning PSUR or PASS or the outcome of the assessment done under A 45/46 - Other variation | 26/06/2014 | 19/08/2014 | SmPC and PL | Following the assessment of the PSUR 10 (covering the period from 16 July 2009 to 15 July 2011), the risk of photosensitivity was reviewed in detail, with a cumulate analysis of the case reports performed and discussed. Based on the data available, the CHMP agreed that, although the reporting rate for photosensitivity was very low, patients should be informed about this potential adverse event. 'Photosensitivity' with an unknown frequency was added to the Product Information. The addition of this adverse event does not adversely affect the benefit/risk balance of Azomyr. |

| X/0033 | The MAH submitted an extension application for a new reformulated syrup. The proposed formulation is mainly intended for paediatric use.

| X/0032 | The MAH submitted an extension application for a new reformulated syrup. The proposed formulation is mainly intended for paediatric use. It is a suitable formulation for the recommended patient age and the likely duration of the treatment, since it is sugar- free, preservative and colorant-free. The MAH will discontinue, for the EU Member States, distribution to local representatives of the desloratadine current syrup formulation within an agreed timeframe. Annex I_2.(d) Change or addition of a new pharmaceutical form | 22/02/2007 | 23/04/2007 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | The MAH submitted an extension application to add a new pharmaceutical form ie orodispersible tablets. The orodispersible tablets may be used in adults and children aged 12 years and over (5mg dose) and in children aged 6 to 11 years old (2.5 mg dose) in the currently approved indications. The overall benefit/risk assessment for the orodispersible tablets was considered positive. The bioequivalence between the already marketed film-coated tablets and the orodispersible formulations has been established. |

| II/0031  | This variation refers to an update of sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the Summary Product Characteristics (SPC) to include the terms 'intermittent' and 'persistent' allergic rhinitis according to the Allergic Rhinitis and its impact on asthma (ARIA) guidelines. Cross references of section 5.1 in both sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the SPC were also made. Section 3 of the Package Leaflet (PL) was amended accordingly. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 27/07/2006   | 01/09/2006 | SmPC and PL                      | According to the Allergic Rhinitis and its impact on asthma (ARIA) guidelines, intermittent allergic rhinitis means that the symptoms are present for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks and persistent allergic rhinitis means that symptoms are present for at least 4 days per week and for more than 4 weeks. Based on data provided by the MAH on the classification of Allergic Rhinitis and according to the ARIA guidelines, the CHMP concluded that the information on intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis could be reflected in sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SPC. Cross- reference of section 5.1 in both sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the SPC were also made and Section 3 of the Package Leaflet (PL) was amended accordingly. The CHMP considered these changes to be acceptable. |

In the sixth PSUR, three new cases of seizures were reported in addition to the review of cases of seizures performed in the previous PSUR and which identified 18 cases (7 possibly related to the use of desloratadine). Further to the assessment of PSUR 6, the CHMP concluded that an update of the SPC was necessary in order to reflect this information. Therefore, the MAH submitted a type II variation to update the SPC and provided further data. Based on these data, the CHMP concluded that the majority of reported extrapyramidal symptoms were psychomotor hyperactivity. The CHMP therefore recommended including 'psychomotor hyperactivity' to section 4.8 of the SPC. In addition, the CHMP considered acceptable the inclusion of the term 'seizures' to section 4.8 of the SPC. Section 4 of the PL has been amended accordingly.   |

Further to the assessment of PSUR 6, the CHMP concluded that an update of the SPC was necessary in order to reflect this information. Therefore, the MAH submitted a type II variation to update the SPC and provided further data. Based on these data, the CHMP concluded that the majority of reported extrapyramidal symptoms were psychomotor hyperactivity. The CHMP therefore recommended including 'psychomotor hyperactivity' to section 4.8 of the SPC. In addition, the CHMP considered acceptable the inclusion of the term 'seizures' to section 4.8 of the SPC. Section 4 of the PL has been amended accordingly.   |

The MAH had also been requested to monitor hepatic reactions. The MAH had received fifty-one cases of myalgia and other related muscle disorders (cramps, twitching, weakness, spasms and stiffness). Of the 53 events of insomnia, 21 cases may have resulted from desloratadine intake (positive rechallenge, de-challenge). Although this is a very low number in comparison to the market experience, the reporting rate of insomnia is probably also very low. The review of dyspnoea (incl: bronchospasm and asthma) included 91 cases (100 ADRs). Of these 63 were dyspnoea. Dyspnoea may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions and should therefore be mentioned among the symptoms of hypersensitivity in the SPC. The MAH therefore applied to include the terms \"myalgia\", \"insomnia\", and \"dyspnoea\" in section 4.8 of the SPC. One case of well-documented hepatitis with hepatic necrosis was identified. A further 19 cases of cholestasis, jaundice, hepatocellular damage and hepatitis were found, 12 of which contained the specific term \"hepatitis\". Although \"Elevation of liver enzymes\" and \"increased bilirubin\" are listed in the SPC, these were not considered to fully cover the possible occurrence of hepatitis.

The CHMP concluded that in daily practise it is particularly difficult to make the diagnosis of AR in the age group of 1 to 2 years due to the fact that there are no specific pathognomonic symptoms distinguishing between infectious and allergic rhinitis and the fact that in this age group infectious rhinitis is extremely frequent. However, the CHMP consider it acceptable to extend the use of desloratadine below the age of 2 years down to 1 year for treating AR and CIU as the MAH fulfilled the EU requirements for the extension of the medicinal product, adequate pharmaco-kinetic studies have been performed showing that the product is safe and does not behave different in children down to 1 year of age. Furthermore adequate information has been added to the SPC (section 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2) informing the prescriber of the difficulty in distinguishing AR from other forms of rhinitis in the age group below 2 years and of the lack of data to support the treatment of infectious rhinitis.

| II/0001 | Extension of indication to include Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria Extension of Indication | 25/04/2001 | 06/08/2001 | SmPC and PL | For the indication CIU a total of 416 subjects were randomised and 211 received 5 mg desloratadine. The symptoms studied were pruritus, number and size of hives, total symptom score (sum of pruritus, number and size of hives), interference with sleep and daily activities, overall condition and therapeutic response. The primary parameter in both CIU studies was change from baseline in the average reflective pruritus score (reflecting the preceding 12 hours). The two studies showed that Azomyr was effective in reducing symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria as compared to placebo. The most common adverse events observed during treatment were headache, dry mouth and fatigue. No serious adverse events were reported in the studies. <Click here for more information> |
