| X/0004 | To introduce four additional presentations, which include all the components (i.e. solvent and reconstitution kit) necessary for the reconstitution and administration of the finished product. Annex I_2.(d) Change or addition of a new pharmaceutical form | 22/10/2009 | 11/01/2010 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | Romiplostim drug product is supplied as a sterile, preservative free lyophilized white powder ready for reconstitution. To be administered, it requires reconstitution with preservative-free sterile water for injection (sWFI). When reconstituted with the appropriate volume of solvent, romiplostim is at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. The change introduced by this extension application affects only the quality part of the dossier. Its scope is to introduce four additional presentations to the existing lyophilized powder presentations, which include all the components (i.e. solvent and reconstitution kit) necessary for the reconstitution and administration of the medicinal product. The purpose of the additional presentations is to enhance healthcare professionals (HCP) convenience by providing the standard components necessary to reconstitute the drug product, so there is no need to source the components separately. The manufacture of the drug product itself has not changed and only additional information has been provided on the solvent (sWFI) used to reconstitute the lyophilized powder. A complete set of information have been submitted for the solvent and injection devices included in the kit. All the new components of the reconstitution kit are CE marked and shown to be functionally and chemically compatible with |

The manufacturing process of the solvent has been described in sufficient detail and it is considered adequately controlled. Test methods and specifications have been provided and consistency demonstrated. Stability data from samples stored at the recommended temperature of storage and under different stress conditions show that the solvent is stable. The proposed new presentations (1-pack) contain the following components: - One vial of romiplostim drug product (250 or 500 micrograms deliverable product) - One prefilled syringe containing 0.72 or 1.2 mL of solvent (sWFI) for the 250 or 500 micrograms presentations   |
