## 1. Introduction

This variation application is submitted to request the addition of a sentence in the approved non-ST segment  elevation  acute  coronary  syndrome  (NSTEACS)  indication  in  order  to  make  clear  that patients  undergoing  a  stent  implantation  following  percutaneous  coronary  intervention  (PCI)  are included in the indication. The rewording applied for is as follows:

'Non-ST  segment  elevation  acute  coronary  syndrome  (unstable  angina  or  non-Q-wave  myocardial infarction),  including  patients  undergoing  a  stent  placement  following  percutaneous  coronary intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).'

Clopidogrel efficacy in NSTEACS patients undergoing a coronary stent placement following PCI has been evaluated in a post-hoc analysis of the CURE study (Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent ischemic Events), in the subset of patients who underwent an intra-coronary stent placement following  PCI  [Stent-CURE  population  (CURE  restricted  to  stent  PCI)].  The  MAH  also  reviewed recently  published  experience  with  clopidogrel  in  patients  with  coronary  stenting.  Safety  was primarily  assessed  on  the  basis  of  Stent-CURE.  Additional  safety  data  from  two  studies  [EFC7086 (CREDO) and EFC3401 (CLASSICS)] in stent-related populations were also taken into account.

## 2. Clinical aspects

## 2.1 Rationale for the proposed change

PCI  causes  trauma  to  the  vessel  wall,  rendering  the  endoluminal  surface  thrombogenic.  As  a consequence  of  mechanical  plaque  rupture  by  angioplasty,  subendothelial  components  are  exposed inducing  platelet  adhesion  to  the  injured  endothelium  and  platelet  aggregation.  Stent  utilisation amplifies  platelet  activation  compared  to  angioplasty.  With  ASA  alone,  thrombotic  complications following PCI remain high. Studies have demonstrated that the adjunctive use of ticlopidine with ASA reduced subacute thrombosis after stent placement and was superior to anticoagulant regimens (ASA with  heparin  or  warfarin).  However,  ticlopidine  has  uncommon  but  potentially  lethal  side  effects (neutropenia  ~1%,  thrombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura  and  aplastic  anemia)  that  have  limited  its routine use in PCI.

Clopidogrel  is  a  newer  thienopyridine,  which  produces  active  metabolite(s)  with  antiaggregatory effects and displays a better safety profile than ticlopidine (lower risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenic  thrombotic  purpura).  Efficacy  and  safety  of  clopidogrel  for  the  prevention  and treatment of atherothrombotic events has been demonstrated by four Phase III randomised controlled trials (CAPRIE, CURE, CLARITY-TIMI 28, and COMMIT/CCS-2).

The  use  of  clopidogrel  in  the  treatment  of  NSTEACS  patients  in  the  context  of  PCI  is  widely generalised. A multinational registry of 401, 255 patients of all ages hospitalised with ACS at 100 sites in 14 countries over a 5-year period (1999-2004) revealed that ACS patients from Europe frequently received  clopidogrel  during  hospitalisation  (52%).  The  administration  of  clopidogrel  was  strongly associated with the performance of PCI at all sites (range of use from 82% to 90%).

International Guidelines in Europe and America contain a Class I recommendation for the routine use of clopidogrel in addition to ASA in the treatment of NSTEACS patients and recommend 9-12 month administration of clopidogrel for these patients when managed with PCI and stenting.

## 2.2 Analysis of data submitted

The justification for the applied rewording of the NSTEACS indication is mainly based on a post-hoc analysis  of  the CURE study,  specifically  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  who  underwent  intra-coronary stent placement following PCI i.e the Stent-CURE population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.1 Design of CURE and Stent-CURE.

CURE was a large scale, multicentre and multinational trial which investigated the efficacy and the safety of clopidogrel 75 mg daily after an initial loading dose of 300 mg, in addition to ASA (75 to 325  mg/day,  left  to  the  Investigators'  decision)  and  other  background  therapy,  in  a  population  of patients with NSTEACS (UA or NQMI) treated for a minimum of 3 months and a maximum of 12 months.

This  double-blind,  randomised,  parallel-group  trial  of  clopidogrel  (+  ASA)  versus  placebo  (ASA), provides information on the clinical benefit of clopidogrel in a broad range of patients in the presence of  numerous  and  representative  concomitant  therapies.  It  was  the  largest  ever  performed  trial  to evaluate  antiplatelet  agents  in  this  indication  and  also  the  largest  completed  study  involving  ACS patients with stent.

The study has already been assessed in the context of a Type II variation (II/24 of Plavix and II/22 of Iscover).  The  Scientific  Discussion  module  of  the  EPAR  provides  a  detailed  summary  of  the  study design and the results. Hence, only a brief general summary will be included in this report.

## 2.2.2. Methods of CURE and Stent-CURE.

Inclusion criteria . Patients were eligible if they presented within 24 hours of onset of ischaemic chest pain or angina-equivalent symptoms suspected to be NSTEACS.

Randomisation had to be performed within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or  angina  equivalent  symptoms.  Study  drugs,  as  well  as  ASA  (continued  if  patients  were  already taking ASA prior to entry into the study), were to be started immediately after randomisation. Regular follow-up assessments ended, as specified in the protocol, either 90 days after the randomisation of the last patient (study end date) or one year after randomisation, whichever date came first.

Concomitant  therapies ,  including  usual  therapy  for  ACS,  were  unrestricted,  except  for  those  that might interfere with the assessment of the clinical benefit. Specifically, concomitant oral anticoagulants, antithrombins (other than heparins), open-label use of thienopyridines (clopidogrel or ticlopidine at the investigator's discretion) and dipyridamole were not allowed. If patients underwent stent placement after entry into CURE, blinded medication could be stopped for up to 2 to 4 weeks to allow  substitution  with  an  open-label  non-investigational  thienopyridine  (clopidogrel  or  ticlopidine) during this short period. The use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors was allowed in connection with PCI.

The first co-primary efficacy  outcome was  the  first  occurrence  of  any  component  of  the  composite cluster  of  cardiovascular  (CV)  death,  MI  or  stroke  (ischemic,  hemorrhagic  or  of  uncertain  type). Cardiovascular death in this cluster was defined to exclude only deaths due to a well-documented nonvascular cause. MI was defined as a new acute MI (differentiated from index-MI) which fulfilled at least  2  of  the  accepted  3  criteria:  characteristic  symptoms,  consistent  new  ECG  changes  and  (re) elevation of cardiac enzymes or troponin levels [twice the upper limit of the normal reference range, 3 times this limit if the event occurred after a percutaneous intervention or 5 times this limit if the event occurred post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)].

The second  co-primary  efficacy  outcome was  the  first  occurrence  of  any  component  of  the  first composite or of refractory ischaemia.  The refractory ischaemia  definition depended on whether the patient was still in his/her initial hospitalisation or if the event occurred after discharge. The refractory ischaemia definition during initial hospitalisation had very stringent criteria: the patient was to have recurrent chest pain or ischaemic symptoms lasting longer than 5 minutes while on optimal medical therapy and leading to additional intervention (thrombolysis for threatened MI, cardiac catheterisation, insertion  of  intra-aortic  balloon  pump  or  revascularisation  procedure,  ie,  percutaneous  transluminal coronary angioplasty PTCA/stent or CABG surgery) or transfer for these procedures by midnight of the next day. The post-discharge definition, 'rehospitalisation for UA', was less stringent and included any  hospital  stay  for  at  least  24  hours  with  clinical  symptoms  of  typical  prolonged  chest  pain unresponsive  to  the  patient's  usual  medication  associated  with  ECG  changes  consistent  with  acute myocardial ischaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subgroup  analyses.  The  variables  of  specific  clinical  interest  were  prior  ASA  and  thienopyridine (clopidogrel/ticlopidine)  use,  prior  PTCA/CABG  surgery,  concomitant  use  of  heparins/hirudin,  oral anticoagulants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intravenous (IV) GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and lipid-lowering agents and  ASA  dose.  Other  factors  examined  included  elevated  cardiac  enzymes/troponin  levels  at randomisation, ST depression ≥ 1 mm a randomisation, history of diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, MI and stroke, and diagnosis at discharge (non-Q-wave MI, unstable angina, other). The occurrence of PTCA (with or without stent) and PTCA/CABG surgery was also used as a covariate, although these and the concomitant medication subgroups were recognised as improper subgroups since they were defined on the basis of post-randomisation events. In this case, the results could be confounded with treatment  effects  and  are  to  be  interpreted  with  caution.  The  occurrence  of  periprocedural  events within  7  days  after  PTCA/CABG  surgery  was  also  analysed.  Other  factors  examined  included  age, gender, race, and smoking status.

The  main  efficacy  analysis  was  an  ITT  analysis  including  all  patients  randomised  in  the  study regardless  of  whether  they  actually  received  study  drug.  All  events  occurring  during  the  follow-up period, but not beyond 365 days or the study end date were counted, including events occurring after permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  Data  from  patients  lost  to  follow-up  were  considered  as censored  at  the  last  date  the  patient  was  known  to  be  alive  for  those  patients  without  an  event. However, for patients experiencing an event prior to being lost to follow-up, that patient's event was included in the analysis.

The number of patients with outcome events was summarised by treatment group using counts and percentages  and  in  the  form  of  event  rate  curves.  The  event  rate  curves  were  estimated  using  the Kaplan-Meier method. The relative risk reduction (RRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from the Cox proportional hazards model were reported along with Kaplan-Meier estimates of 1-, 2-, 3-, 7-, and 15-day, and 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month event rates.

Safety  parameters.  The  safety  analyses  included  the  rate  of  life-threatening  bleeding  and  serious adverse  events  (SAEs).  Safety  data  were  to  be  recorded  from  randomization  up  to  365  days  or  the study end date (06 December 2000). The safety population analysed in CURE was based on the ITT analysis of the subset of patients who underwent stent following PCI, so that benefit and risk could be assessed in the same population.

Sample Size. A total of 12,562 patients were enrolled in CURE: 6,259 in the clopidogrel treatment group and 6,303 in the placebo group. Of the 12,562 enrolled patients, 2,172 (1,080 in the clopidogrel treatment group and 1,092 in the placebo group) underwent a stent placement following PCI. These 2,172 patients (17.3% of the entire CURE population) represent the Stent-CURE population and have been subjected to post-hoc subgroup analysis.

## 2.2.3. Results

## 2.2.3.1. Extent of Exposure

The  extent  of  exposure  is  described  in  Table  1.  Of  the  2172  patients,  50.8%  of  patients  in  the clopidogrel  group  and  51.9%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  were  followed  up  for  more  than  9 months, including, respectively, 32.6% and 35.4% followed up for at least 12 months.

SD = standard deviation.

Approximately 18.0% (18.6% in the clopidogrel group, and 17.4% in the placebo group) permanently discontinued study drug before 12 months, common study end date, or death (see Table 2). The main reasons for discontinuation of study drug were withdrawal of patient consent and AEs.

a Of the 4 patients who never took study drug, the investigator recorded 3 of them as permanently discontinuing, but the other 1 was not permanently discontinued.

## 3.2.1.2. Demographics and baseline characteristics

Demographic and baseline medical data were similar and well balanced between groups, as shown in Table 3.

It should be mentioned that in the original CURE trial an association of the treatment with clopidogrel and a significant decrease of refractory ischemia during hospitalisation (Relative Risk (RR) 0.68, 95%CI 0.52-0.89, p=0.005) , resulting in fewer early revascularisation procedures (RR 0.92, p=0.03) , was identified. However, in the Stent-CURE population no significant differences in the timing of stent placement were observed.

## 2.2.3.2. Efficacy results

A total  of  237  patients  (10.9%)  experienced  a  first  co-primary  outcome  confirmed  by  adjudication. Among these were 192 MIs (81.0%), 19 strokes (8.0%), and 26 other CV deaths (11.0%). The results for the first co-primary endpoint are shown in Table 5: 101 (9.4%) patients in the clopidogrel group versus 136 (12.5%) patients in the placebo group experienced the first co-primary outcome, resulting in a significant relative risk reduction of 26.2% in favour of clopidogrel (95% CI: 4.5%, 42.9%, p = 0.020). The positive result was driven by a reduction in MI.

The Kaplan-Meier curve in Figure 1 displays the first co-primary outcome event rate over time in each treatment  group.  The  clopidogrel  and  the  placebo  curves  group  start  to  diverge  rapidly  after  study start.  The  divergence is present until the end of the follow-up, i.e. after 12 month. A Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) of 31.9% was observed for the first co-primary endpoint (95% CI, 2.1%-52.6%, p = 0.038) within the first 30 days after randomisation; and a RRR of 19.8% (95% CI, - 15.6% - 44.4%, p = 0.237) was observed beyond 30 days (up to 1 year).

Second co-primary endpoint. A total of 227 (21.0%) patients in the clopidogrel group versus 290 (26.6%) patients in the placebo group experienced the second co-primary outcome (MI, stroke, CV death, refractory ischaemia), resulting in a significant relative risk reduction of 23.9% in favour of clopidogrel (95% CI: 9.5%, 36.1%, p = 0.002). The results are displayed in Table 6.

Comparision of results in subpopulations of the Stent-CURE population. The results obtained in the demographic subgroups analysed were consistent with the results in the overall population. The efficacy observed with clopidogrel was independent of all covariates examined. In all subgroups, the treatment difference was in favour of clopidogrel. The results of the analyses according to prior and concomitant medication/therapy also showed that efficacy observed with clopidogrel was independent of all parameters examined. In particular, the efficacy was independent of other concomitant acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, such as heparins (LMWH/UFH)/hirudin, IV GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, ASA and lipid-lowering drugs.

Comparision of the Stent-CURE population with the CURE population without stent. As displayed in Table 8, the 2 subsets of patients (with intracoronary stent and without intracoronary stent) contributed to  the  positive  results  in  the  entire  CURE  population  [RR  =  0.80  (95%  CI  0.72-  0.90,  p&lt;  0.001)], without significant interaction (p = 0.47).

## Optimum Treatment Duration

One of the aspects more thoroughly debated by CHMP was the optimum treatment duration in this clinical  setting,  considering  that  patients  in  CURE  were  treated  for  a  minimum  of  3  months  and  a maximum of  12  months.  This  point  was  also  intensely  debated  at  the  time  of  the  approval  of  the NSTEACS indication (see relevant Scientific Discussion in EPAR).

In a recent trial intended to show the superior efficacy of a slow-release, polymer-based, paclitaxeleluting  stent  in  reducing  the  risk  of  clinical  and  angiographic  restenosis  compared  to  a  bare-metal stent, clopidogrel was administered during a 6-month period. The authors empirically recommended a 6-month post-procedural clopidogrel treatment, while experimental data have demonstrated equivalent rates  of  endothelialisation  with  slow-release  paclitaxel-eluting  stents  and  bare-metal  stents.  The authors  reported  that  no  late  stent  thrombosis  was  observed  after  clopidogrel  discontinuation  at  6 months. In this study, patients with complex coronary lesions, such as thrombus containing lesions, bifurcations,  and  calcified  stenoses  were  excluded  from  the  study.  In  addition,  the  population  with drug-eluting stent was broader than ACS patients only, and therefore did not necessarily integrate the higher risk potentially inherent to ACS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As newer reports are emerging, indicating a continued risk of late stent thrombosis at 1 year as well as increased mortality when antithrombotic treatment with ASA and clopidogrel is discontinued even at such late stage in patients with drug-eluting stents, international guidelines recommend administering 75 mg/day clopidogrel with ASA for up to 12 months for ACS and for patients undergoing a PCI, irrespective of the type of stent placed. It states that stent patients should initially receive a higher-dose ASA of at least 325 mg/day for less than a month for bare-metal stents, for 3 months for sirolimuseluting stents, and more than 6 months for paclitaxel-eluting stents, followed by 75 to 162 mg/ day. The 2005 European Guidelines for Percutaneous Coronary Interventions recommend that clopidogrel should  be  started  and  continued  up  to  12  months  after  drug-eluting  stent  implantation  (Class  1C evidence).

Further to a Request from CHMP concerning the optimal duration of the treatment with clopidogrel, the MAH presented data comparing the frequency of the first co-primary efficacy outcome up to 30 days and for the time beyond 30 days post-randomisation in the stent-CURE and the overall CURE population, as seen in the table below.

Although, during the first 30 days post-randomisation, the RRR in the Stent-CURE population was higher than in the overall CURE population, possibly due to the higher placebo event rate in the higher risk  Stent-CURE  population,  the  RRR  were  similar  and  quite  large  in  both  populations  beyond  30 days.  Actually,  the  event  rates  in  the  Stent-CURE  population,  both  in  the  placebo  group  and  the clopidogrel group, were similar to those in the overall population at the end of this long-term period, indicating that the long-term risk levels and risk reductions are similar in both populations.

The  cumulative  event  rates  for  the  first  co-primary  outcome  (Table  10)  showed  that  the  absolute difference between the group treated with clopidogrel and placebo increased over the whole 12-month treatment and follow-up period.

Moreover, the Cox's proportional hazard model used for the calculation of the RRR of the primary endpoint revealed no significant difference in the risk of any event in the treatment group and placebo over the time, suggesting a consistency of the benefit of clopidogrel treatment up to the end of the study duration.

The  overall  analysis  of  the  first  co-primary  endpoint  in  the  Stent-CURE  population  using  a  Cox's proportional hazards model showed a 26.2 % RRR favouring clopidogrel. This model using time as a variable assumes that, even though rates of events can change over time, the risk of an event in the treated group relative to the placebo group is constant over time. A test of this assumption was nonsignificant (p&gt;0.5), therefore showing the lack of interaction with time, and further demonstrating, as was shown in the overall CURE population, the consistency of the benefit over time. Thus, although we can find different estimates of the RRR with different periods of time, the estimate from the overall model (26.2%) applies across the whole time period.

In  order  to  explore  the  optimum  treatment  duration  within  the  12-month  study  duration,  and  help support  a  medical  decision  to  terminate  clopidogrel  treatment  before  12  months,  the  effect  of discontinuing  clopidogrel  prematurely  was  assessed  for  the  first  co-primary  endpoint  using  a  Cox proportional hazards model, which included a time-dependent covariate for discontinuation of study drug. These post-hoc analyses are very similar to those performed for the entire CURE population to address  the  CHMP concerns in the context of the  variation  for  the  NSTEACS  indication, but  have been further refined by dividing premature permanent discontinuations into 3 groups:

1. All permanent discontinuations: N= 392
2. All inappropriate permanent discontinuations (for non-AE reason): N= 287
3. Permanent discontinuations for withdrawn consent only: N= 172

As  expected,  the  loss  of  protection  resulting  from  clopidogrel  discontinuation  translates  into  no difference between the clopidogrel and placebo groups in first co-primary endpoint event rates at the end of the study.

## 2.2.3.3. Safety results

## Primary safety data of Stent-CURE.

Safety  evaluations  in  the  Stent-CURE  population  were  the  same  as  those  performed  in  the  overall CURE  population.  The  safety  evaluation  was  based  on  the  ITT  analysis  of  the  Stent-CURE population,  so  that  benefit  and  risk  could  be  assessed  in  the  same  population.  The  frequency  of bleeding events is displayed in Table 11.

There  was  no  significant  difference  in  bleeding,  adjudicated  major/life  threatening  bleeding,  either according to bleeding characteristics or site of bleeding.

The  frequency  of  other  adverse  events,  serious  adverse  events,  deaths,  adverse  events  leading  to withdrawal is shown in Table 12.

There was no significant difference between the clopidogrel group and the placebo group in any of the AE categories depicted in the table above.

Additional safety data in stent-related populations undergoing long-term treatment with clopidogrel. The double-blind trial CLASSICS was a safety study of clopidogrel versus ticlopidine on top of ASA 325  mg  with  the  primary  endpoint  consisting  of  major  peripheral  or  bleeding  complications, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or the early discontinuation of the study drug for noncardiac adverse events. The primary endpoint occurred more frequently among patients treated with ticlopidine (9.1%) than in the clopidogrel group (4.6%) (p = 0.005), supporting a superior safety profile of clopidogrel. However, bleeding occurred more frequently in the clopidogrel 75 mg group than in the other study groups. The overall rate of AEs, SAEs, and permanent discontinuations due to an AE was higher in the ticlopidine group than in the clopidogrel groups. Skin disorders, primarily rash, were the most frequent reason for discontinuing therapy, with incidences of 2.6% in ticlopidine users and 0.6% in clopidogrel users.  One  ticlopidine  patient  developed  neutropenia  (neutrophil  &lt;0.1  x  10 9 /l) 28  days  after randomization and four clopidogrel patients had mild and transient thrombocytopenia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CREDO was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel group study to evaluate the effects of long-term treatment (12 months) with clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) on top of ASA 325 mg in the prevention  of  vascular  events  and  all-cause  mortality  in  patients  undergoing  PCI.  In  addition,  the effects  of  a  preprocedural  loading  dose  of  clopidogrel  (300  mg)  were  examined.  All  randomised patients received clopidogrel 75 mg with or without a 300 mg loading dose plus ASA 325 mg once daily for 28 days. After the short-term therapy of 28 days, patients who had received a loading dose continued treatment with clopidogrel 75 mg plus ASA (81 to 325 mg) once daily for up to 365 days. Those who had not received a loading dose continued treatment with placebo plus ASA (81 to 325 mg once daily) for up to 365 days. In the population that initially received a loading dose, there was a trend toward an increase in major bleeding in patients treated with clopidogrel for 1 year (p = 0.07). On the contrary, there was no difference regarding the incidence of minor bleeding episodes between the two study groups. None of the major bleeding events were intracranial haemorrhages, and none were fatal. Furthermore, most of the major bleeding events were related to a procedure (angiography, PCI, CABG, other surgery).

In GRACE, a large prospective, international clinical registry (94 hospitals in 14 countries), a significant increase in major bleeding with the use of thienopyridines in the overall population (2.8% with thienopyridines versus 2.2% without thienopyridines; p= 0.002) was found. In contrast, no difference was observed when limiting the analysis to patients undergoing PCI, with or without stenting or CABG (3.1% with thienopyridines vs 3.7% without thienopyridines; p= 0.22).

Further to a request from CHMP, the MAH presented the frequency of life-threatening bleeding events in Stent-CURE of the clopidogrel and the placebo group compared over time (Table 13).

The rate of life-threatening bleeding events was comparable in both the clopidogrel and the placebo study groups, and also when comparing the Stent-CURE and the overall CURE population. Therefore the application of the current routine safety monitoring was suggested.

## 3. Discussion

## Efficacy

The main data provided to support the rewording of the NSTEACS indication to specifically mention patients undergoing PCI are derived from a post-hoc analysis of the CURE trial in the subset of patients who underwent an intra-coronary stent placement following PCI (Stent-CURE). The CURE trial has previously been assessed in the context of the NSTEACS indication. At the time of the evaluation, the CHMP was of the opinion that CURE was a well designed, well conducted and generally consistent study, performed according to the current standards. The main criticism to this study highlighted by the CHMP was the failure to establish an optimal treatment duration.

The results in Stent-CURE show that treatment with clopidogrel resulted in a significant relative risk reduction of the first and the second co-primary endpoint. The 2 subsets of patients (with intracoronary stent,  i.e.  the  Stent-CURE  population,  and  without  intracoronary  stent)  contributed  to  the  positive results in the entire CURE population without significant interaction

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  main  issue  discussed  by  the  CHMP  was  the  validity  of  the  post-hoc  design  of  the  subgroup analysis in Stent-CURE to support the proposed change in the indication. There was no doubt that, in general, subgroup analyses which are not predefined in the study protocol are less valuable from the methodological point of view and also in terms of statistical power, as stated in the CHMP guidline CPMP/EWP/908/99 (The Points to Consider on Multiplicity Issues in Clinical Trials). However, the CHMP was of the opinion that patients undergoing PCI and subsequent stent placement are already included  in  the  current  indication.  Therefore  the  CHMP  considered  the  applied  rewording  to  be  a clarification of the indication granted rather than an extension of the indication, i.e. a new indication, so that the CHMP guideline does not apply. The CHMP further acknowledged that the conduct of a new clinical trial comparing clopidogrel and ASA in patients undergoing PCI and stenting would be ethically  difficult  to  perform,  since  clopidogrel  is  already  commonly  used  and  accepted  in  this indication. Moreover, international guidelines highly recommend the routine use of clopidogrel in the management of patients with NSTEACS receiving a stent. Since the efficacy of clopidogrel has been confirmed in the CURE study also for the subset of patients undergoing PCI (PCI-CURE) and stenting is a widely accepted routine management following PCI, the CHMP stated that the re-analysis of the Stent-CURE population is adequate to support the applied rewording of the NSTEACS indication.

As with the CURE study and the NSTEACS indication, the CHMP questioned the optimal duration of treatment.  The  MAH  presented  data  indicating  an  increase  in  the  number  of  cardiovascular  events following premature treatment discontinuation. Since the benefit/risk ratio remained comparable over the entire duration of the study, the CHMP agreed with the MAH that there is no need to change the current wording in section 4.2 of the SPC, which states that

'The optimal duration of treatment has not been formally established. Clinical trial data support use up to 12 months, and the maximum benefit was seen at 3 months (see section 5.1).'

The CHMP requested the update of section 5.1 of the SPC to reflect the results of the Stent-CURE post-hoc analysis as follows:

' In the CURE trial, 17% of the total population underwent stent placement. A post-hoc analysis of the data showed that, in this subgroup of patients, Clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg daily)  compared  to  placebo,  demonstrated  a  significant  relative  risk  reduction  (RRR)  of  26.2% favoring Clopidogrel for the co-primary endpoint (CV death, MI or stroke) and also a significant RRR of 23.9% for the second coprimary endpoint (CV death, MI, stroke, or refractory ischemia). Moreover, the  safety  profile  of  clopidogrel  in  this  subgroup  of  patients  did  not  raise  any  particular  concern. Thus, the results from this subset of patients seem to be in line with the overall trial results.'

## Safety

The safety of clopidogrel has been already assessed during the initial NSTEACS indication evaluation. The results in Stent-CURE do not differ from those observed in the overall CURE population, which was previously assessed in the context of the NSTEACS indication. Despite the methodical weakness of post-hoc subgroup analysis, the CHMP was of the opinion that the safety data of Stent-CURE are reliable, since they match the overall CURE outcomes such as in case of the efficacy results.

Since  the  Stent-CURE  population,  i.e.  patients  undergoing  a  stent  placement  represent  a  group  of high-risk  patients,  the  possibility  of  a  specific  safety  monitoring  programme  was  discussed  by  the CHMP. Taking into account the extensive clinical and post-marketing experience in the treatment of NSTEMI  with  clopidogrel  and  the  well-known  safety  profile  of  clopidogrel,  it  was  deemed unnecessary.

## 4. Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment

The Applicant presented a re-analysis of the CURE trial in the subset of patients who underwent an intra-coronary stent placement following PCI (Stent-CURE) to support a rewording of the NSTEACS indication, i.e. the insertion of a sentence pointing out that patients with stent after PCI are included in the target population. Acknowledging the widely generalised use of clopidogrel and the recommendation  of  treatment  guidelines  to  use  clopidogrel  in  NSTEMI  patients  with  PCI  and subsequent stenting, the CHMP considered the applied rewording to be a clarification of the existing indication rather than a new indication. Despite the drawbacks due to the post-hoc design, recognised by  the  CHMP,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  presented  data  are  sufficient  to  support  the applied rewording.

Importantly, the Stent-CURE outcomes showed a similar positive benefit / risk ratio for the subset of NSTEACS patients  undergoing  stent  placement  after  PCI  as  for  the  overall  NSTEACS  population investigated in the CURE trial. It is acknowledged that clopidogrel is already routinely used in patients receiving  a  stent  after  PCI.  The  same  recommendations  on  treatment  duration  as  for  the  overall NSTEACS population apply to PCI patients.
