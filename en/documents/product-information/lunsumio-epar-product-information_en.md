## Duration of treatment

Lunsumio should be administered for 8 cycles, unless a patient experiences unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

For patients who achieve a complete response, no further treatment beyond 8 cycles is required. For patients who achieve a partial response or have stable disease in response to treatment with Lunsumio after 8 cycles, an additional 9 cycles of treatment (17 cycles total) should be administered, unless a patient experiences unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

## Delayed or missed dose

If any dose in cycle 1 is delayed for &gt; 7 days, the previous tolerated dose should be repeated prior to resuming the planned treatment schedule.

If a dose interruption occurs between Cycles 1 and 2 that results in a treatment-free interval of ≥ 6 weeks, Lunsumio should be administered at 1 mg on Day 1, 2 mg on Day 8, then resume the planned Cycle 2 treatment of 60 mg on Day 15.

If a dose interruption occurs that results in a treatment-free interval of ≥ 6 weeks between any Cycles in Cycle 3 onwards, Lunsumio should be administered at 1 mg on Day 1, 2 mg on Day 8, then resume the planned treatment schedule of 30 mg on Day 15.

## Dose modification

Patients who experience grade 3 or 4 reactions (e.g. serious infection, tumour flare, tumour lysis syndrome) should have treatment temporarily withheld until symptoms are resolved (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cytokine Release Syndrome

CRS should be identified based on clinical presentation (see section 4.4). Patients should be evaluated and treated for, other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, such as infections/sepsis. Infusion related reactions (IRR) may be clinically indistinguishable from manifestations of CRS. If CRS or IRR is suspected, patients should be managed according to the recommendations in Table 3.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment of Lunsumio is required in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

Lunsumio has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment. Dose adjustments are not considered necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment based on pharmacokinetics (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Lunsumio has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Dose adjustments are not considered necessary based on pharmacokinetics (see section 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Lunsumio in children below 18 years of age have not yet been established.

## Method of administration

Lunsumio is for intravenous use only.

Lunsumio must be diluted using aseptic technique under the supervision of a healthcare professional. It should be administered as an intravenous infusion through a dedicated infusion line. Do not use an in-line filter to administer Lunsumio. Drip chamber filters can be used to administer Lunsumio.

The first cycle of Lunsumio should be administered over a minimum of 4 hours as intravenous infusion. If the infusions are well-tolerated in cycle 1, the subsequent cycles may be administered over a 2-hours infusion.

Lunsumio must not be administered as intravenous push or bolus.

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)

CRS, including life-threatening reactions, have occurred in patients receiving Lunsumio (see section 4.8). Signs and symptoms included pyrexia, chills, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, and headache. Infusion related reactions may be clinically indistinguishable from manifestations of CRS. CRS events occurred predominantly in cycle 1 and were mainly associated with Day 1 and Day 15 dose administrations.

Patients should be premedicated with corticosteroids, antipyretics and antihistamines at least through cycle 2. Patients must receive adequate hydration prior to the administration of Lunsumio. Patients should be monitored for signs or symptoms of CRS. Patients should be counselled to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. Physicians should institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids as indicated. (see section 4.2).

Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), including fatal cases, have been reported in patients receiving Lunsumio. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by fever, hepatomegaly and cytopenias. HLH should be considered when the presentation of CRS is atypical or prolonged. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of HLH (see Section 4.2). For suspected HLH, Lunsumio must be interrupted and treatment for HLH initiated.

## Serious infections

Serious infections such as pneumonia, bacteraemia, and sepsis or septic shock have occurred in patients receiving Lunsumio, some of which were life-threatening or fatal events (see section 4.8). Febrile neutropenia was observed in patients after receiving Lunsumio infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lunsumio should not be administered in the presence of active infections. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of Lunsumio in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections (e.g., chronic, active Epstein-Barr Virus), with underlying conditions that may predispose to infections or who have had significant prior immunosuppressive treatment. Patients should be administered prophylactic antibacterial, antiviral and/or antifungal medicinal products, as appropriate. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, before and after Lunsumio administration, and treated appropriately. In the event of febrile neutropenia, patients should be evaluated for infection and managed with antibiotics, fluids and other supportive care, according to local guidelines.

## Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS)

ICANS have occurred in patients receiving Lunsumio, including serious and life threatening reactions. The onset of ICANS can be concurrent with CRS, following resolution of CRS, or in the absence of CRS. Manifestations of ICANS reported in clinical trials included confusional state, lethargy, encephalopathy, depressed level of consciousness, and memory impairment. The majority of cases occurred during Cycle 1.

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of ICANS following Lunsumio administration. Patients must be counselled to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time (see Patient card below).

Patients should be advised to exercise caution while (or avoid if symptomatic) driving, cycling or using heavy or potentially dangerous machines (see section 4.7).

At the first signs or symptoms of ICANS, manage according to the ICANS guidance provided in Table 4. Treatment with Lunsumio should be withheld or discontinued permanently as recommended.

## Tumour flare

Tumour flare has been reported in patients treated with Lunsumio (see section 4.8). Manifestations included new or worsening pleural effusions, localised pain and swelling at the sites of lymphoma lesions and tumour inflammation. Consistent with the mechanism of action of Lunsumio, tumour flare is likely due to the influx of T-cells into tumour sites following Lunsumio administration.

There are no specific risk factors for tumour flare that have been identified, however, there is a heightened risk of compromise and morbidity due to mass effect secondary to tumour flare in patients with bulky tumours located in close proximity to airways and/or a vital organ. Patients treated with Lunsumio should be monitored and evaluated for tumour flare at critical anatomical sites.

## Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)

TLS has been reported in patients receiving Lunsumio (see section 4.8). Patients must have adequate hydration prior to the administration of Lunsumio. Patients should be administered prophylactic antihyperuricemic therapy (e.g allopurinol, rasburicase), as appropriate. Patients should be monitored for signs or symptoms of TLS, especially patients with high tumour burden or rapidly proliferative tumours, and patients with reduced renal function. Patients should be monitored for blood chemistries and abnormalities should be managed promptly.

## Immunisation

Live and/or live-attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with Lunsumio. Studies have not been conducted in patients who recently received live vaccines.

## Patient card

The prescriber must discuss the risks of Lunsumio therapy with the patient. The patient should be provided with the patient card and instructed to carry it at all times. The patient card describes the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

common signs and symptoms of CRS and ICANS, including instructions on when a patient should seek medical attention.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed.

A transient clinically relevant effect on CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. warfarin, voriconazole, cyclosporine, etc) cannot be excluded, since initiation of Lunsumio treatment causes a transient increase in cytokine levels which may cause inhibition of CYP450 enzymes. On initiation of Lunsumio therapy in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, therapeutic monitoring should be considered. The dose of the concomitant medicinal product should be adjusted as needed.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception

Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while receiving Lunsumio and for at least 3 months after the last infusion of Lunsumio.

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of Lunsumio in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Lunsumio is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether mosunetuzumab/metabolites are  excreted in human milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Lunsumio therapy.

## Fertility

No human data on fertility are available. No impairments were observed in male or female reproductive organs in the 26-week toxicity studies with cynomolgus monkeys at exposures (AUC) similar to exposure (AUC) in patients receiving the recommended dose.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Lunsumio has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.. Due to the potential for ICANS, patients receiving Lunsumio are at risk of depressed level of consciousness (see section 4.4). Due to the potential for ICANS, patients should be advised to exercise caution while (or avoid if symptomatic) driving, cycling or using heavy or potentially dangerous machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

The adverse reactions (ARs) described in this section were identified from the pivotal clinical trial GO29781 in patients treated at the recommended dose (n=218). Patients had follicular lymphoma (41.3%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma/transformed follicular lymphoma (40.4%) mantle cell lymphoma (11.5%), Richter's transformation (6.4%), and other histologies (0.5%).  The median number of cycles of Lunsumio received was 8 (range 1 -17), 37% of patients received 8 cycles, and 15% received more than 8 cycles up to 17 cycles.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) observed were cytokine release syndrome, neutropenia, pyrexia, hypophosphatemia and headache. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 2%) observed included cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (21% by ASTCT grading system), pyrexia (5%), and pneumonia (3%). Nine of 218 patients (4.1%) discontinued Lunsumio due to an adverse event. CRS was the only adverse reaction that led to discontinuation in more than one patient (2 patients [0.9%]).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The adverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and categories of frequency. Frequency categories are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000), very rare (&lt; 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)

CRS (ASTCT grading system) of any grade occurred in 39% (86/218) of patients, with grade 2 occurring in 14%, grade 3 occurring in 2.3%, and grade 4 occurring in 0.5% of patients treated with Lunsumio. The one patient with the grade 4 event was a patient with FL in the leukemic phase who also experienced concurrent TLS.

CRS of any grade occurred in 15% of patients after the Cycle 1, Day 1 dose; 5% after the Cycle 1, Day 8 dose; 33% after the Cycle 1, Day 15 dose, 5% occurred in patients after the Cycle 2 and 1% in Cycles 3 and beyond. The median time to CRS onset from the start of administration in Cycle 1 Day 1 was 5 hours (range: 1-73 hours), Cycle 1 Day 8 was 28 hours (range: 5-81 hours), Cycle 1 Day 15 was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

25 hours (range: 0.1-391 hours), and Cycle 2 Day 1 was 46 hours (range: 12-82 hours). CRS resolved in all patients, and the median duration of CRS events was 3 days (range 1-29 days).

Of the 86 patients that experienced CRS, the most common signs and symptoms of CRS included pyrexia (98%), chills (36%), hypotension (35%), tachycardia (24%), hypoxia (22%) and headache (16%).

Tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids were used to manage a CRS event in 16% of patients: 6% received tocilizumab alone, 6% received corticosteroids alone, and 4% received both tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Among the 10% of patients who received tocilizumab (with or without a corticosteroid), 86% received only one dose of tocilizumab, with no more than two doses of tocilizumab administered for a single CRS event. In patients experiencing Grade 2 CRS, 48% of patients were treated with symptomatic management without corticosteroids or tocilizumab, 18% received tocilizumab alone, 21% received corticosteroids alone, and 12% received both corticosteroids and tocilizumab. Patients with grade 3 or grade 4 CRS received tocilizumab, corticosteroids, vasopressors and/or oxygen supplementation. Three percent of patients experienced hypotension and/or hypoxia without fever following Lunsumio administration; 2% of patients received tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids in the absence of fever.

Hospitalizations due to CRS occurred in 21% of patients and the median duration of hospitalization was 5 days (range 0-30 days).

## Neutropenia

Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 28% of patients, including 24% Grade 3-4 events. The median time to onset of first neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased events was 48 days (range: 1-280 days), with median duration of 8 days (range: 1-314 days). Of the 60 patients who had neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased events 68% received treatment G-CSF to treat the events.

## Serious infections

Serious infections of any grade occurred in 17% of patients. 1.8% of patients experienced serious infections concurrently with grade 3-4 neutropenia. The median time to onset of first serious infection was 50 days (range: 1-561 days), with median duration of 12 days (range: 2-174 days). Grade 5 events occurred in 0.9% of patients, which included pneumonia and sepsis.

## Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome

Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) occurred in 2.1% (20/949) of patients, 19 patients had Grade 1-2 events and 1 patient had Grade 3 event. The majority of events occurred during the first cycle of treatment. The majority of cases resolved. The median time to onset from initial dose was 17 days (range: 1 to 48 days). The median duration was 3 days (range: 1-20 days).

## Tumour flare

Tumour flare (including pleural effusion and tumour inflammation) occurred in 4% of patients, which included 1.8% grade 2 and 2.3% grade 3 events. The median time to onset was 13 days (range 5-84 days), and median duration was 10 days (range 1-77 days).

## Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS)

TLS occurred in 0.9% of patients, concurrent with CRS. One patient with follicular lymphoma was in the leukemic phase who experienced Grade 4 TLS. TLS onset was on days 2 and 24, and resolved within 4 and 6 days, respectively.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

## 5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents; other antineoplastic agents; monoclonal antibodies,

ATC code: L01FX25

## Mechanism of action

Mosunetuzumab is an anti-CD20/CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody targeting CD20-expressing B-cells. It is a conditional agonist; targeted B-cell killing is observed only upon simultaneous binding to CD20 on B-cells and CD3 on T-cells. Engagement of both arms of mosunetuzumab results in the formation of an immunologic synapse between a target B cell and a cytotoxic T cell leading to T-cell activation. Subsequent directed release of perforin and granzymes from T-cell activation through the immunologic synapsis induce B-cell lysis leading to cell death.

Lunsumio caused B-cell depletion (defined as CD19 B-cell counts &lt; 0.07 x 10 9 /L) and hypogammaglobulinemia (defined as IgG levels &lt; 500 mg/dL).

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Relapsed or refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

An open-label, multicentre, multi-cohort study (GO29781) was conducted to evaluate Lunsumio in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for whom there was no available therapy expected to improve survival. In the follicular lymphoma (FL) cohort (n=90), patients with relapsed or refractory FL (Grade 1-3A) were required to have received at least two prior systemic therapies, including an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and an alkylating agent. Patients with FL Grade 3b and patients with transformed FL at study entry were not eligible; those with a history of transformed FL but FL Grade 1-3A at study entry were included in the FL cohort.

The study excluded patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥ 2, significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, unstable arrhythmias, or unstable angina), significant active pulmonary disease, impaired renal functions (Creatinine clearance [CrCl] &lt; 60 mL/min with elevated serum creatinine level), active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy, active infections (i.e., chronic active EBV, acute or chronic hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, current or a history of CNS lymphoma or CNS disease, a history of macrophage activation syndrome / hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, prior allogeneic stem cell transplant, or prior organ transplantation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients received Lunsumio intravenously in a 21-day Cycle as follows:

- Cycle 1 Day 1: 1 mg
- Cycle 1 Day 8: 2 mg
- Cycle 1 Day 15: 60 mg
- Cycle 2 Day 1: 60 mg
- Cycle 3 and beyond Day 1: 30 mg

The median number of cycles was 8, 59% received 8 cycles, and 18% received more than 8 cycles up to 17 cycles.

The median age was 60 years (range 29 to 90 years) with 31% being &gt; age 65, and 7.8% being ≥ age 75. Sixty-one percent were male, 82% were white, 9% were Asian, 4% were Black, 100% had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and 34% of patients had bulky disease (at least one lesion &gt; 6 cm). The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 2-10), with 38% receiving 2 prior therapies, 31% receiving 3 prior therapies and 31% receiving more than 3 prior therapies.

All patients received prior anti-CD20 and alkylator therapies, 21% received autologous stem cell transplant, 19% received PI3K inhibitors, 9% received prior rituximab plus lenalidomide therapy, and 3% received CAR-T therapies. Seventy-nine percent of patients were refractory to prior anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy and 53% were refractory to both anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and alkylator therapy. Sixty-nine percent of patients were refractory to the last prior therapy and 52% had progression of disease within 24 months of first systemic therapy.

The primary efficacy endpoint was complete response (CR) as assessed by an independent review facility (IRF) according to standard criteria for NHL (Cheson 2007). The efficacy results are summarised in Table 6.

Clinical Cut-off: 27 August 2021

Hypothesis testing was conducted on the primary endpoint of IRF assessed CR rate.

1 DOR is defined as the time from the initial occurrence of a documented PR or CR until the patient experiences an event (documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first).

2 DOCR is defined as the time from the initial occurrence of a documented CR until the patient experiences an event (documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first).

The median follow-up for DOR was 14.9 months. Additional exploratory efficacy outcomes included the median time to first response (1.4 months, range: 1.1 - 8.9) and the median time to first complete response (3.0 months, range: 1.1- 18.9).

## Immunogenicity

The immunogenicity of mosunetuzumab was evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). No patients tested positive for anti-mosunetuzumab antibodies in 418 ADA-evaluable patients who received Lunsumio single-agent intravenous treatments in Study GO27981. Based on the available information, the clinical relevance of anti-mosunetuzumab antibodies could not be assessed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit results of studies with Lunsumio in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of mature B-cell neoplasms (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## Conditional approval

This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called 'conditional approval' scheme. This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Mosunetuzumab pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner over the dose range studied, from 0.05 to 60 mg. The population pharmacokinetic following intravenous administrations of Lunsumio was described by a 2-compartment PK model with timedependent clearance, which was parameterized as descending to a steady-state plateau (CLss) from a baseline value (CLbase) at the start of treatment according to transitional half-life of 16.3 days. Moderate to high pharmacokinetic variability for mosunetuzumab was observed and characterized by inter-individual variability (IIV) ranging from 18% to 86% coefficient of variation (CV) for mosunetuzumab PK parameters: IIV was estimated for CLbase (63% CV), central volume of distribution (31% CV), peripheral volume of distribution (25% CV), CLss (18% CV), and transitional half-life (86% CV).

After the first two Cycles (i.e., 42 days) of the dosing with Lunsumio, the serum concentration reaches the Cmax at the end of dose of Cycle 2 Day 1 of the Lunsumio intravenous infusion with an average maximal concentration of 17.9 µg/mL and %CV of 49.6%. The average total two cycles (42 days) mosunetuzumab exposure AUC was 126 day ·µ g/mL with %CV of 44.4%.

## Absorption

Lunsumio is administered intravenously.

## Distribution

The population estimate of central volume of distribution for mosunetuzumab was 5.49 L with intravenous infusion of Lunsumio. Because mosunetuzumab is an antibody, protein binding studies were not conducted.

## Biotransformation

The metabolic pathway of mosunetuzumab has not been directly studied. Like other protein therapeutics, mosunetuzumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways.

## Elimination

Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the estimated mean CLss and baseline clearance (CLbase) were 1.08 L/day and 0.584 L/day, respectively. The terminal half-life estimate was 16.1 days at steady state based on population pharmacokinetic model estimates. The results obtained in study GO29781 indicate that mosunetuzumab serum concentration reaches the Cmax at the end of the intravenous infusion and declines in a bi-exponential fashion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Elderly

Age did not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis with patients aged 19-96 years (n=439). No clinically important difference was observed in the pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab for patients in this age group.

## Bodyweight

Like other therapeutic proteins, bodyweight was positively associated with mosunetuzumab estimated clearance and volume of distribution. However, based on exposure-response analysis and clinical exposure margins, considering the exposures in patients at ei ther 'low' (&lt;50 kg) or 'high' (≥112 kg) weight, no dose adjustment is required due to patient bodyweight.

## Gender

Based upon population pharmacokinetic analysis, steady-state clearance of mosunetuzumab is marginally lower in females (~13%) compared to males. No dose adjustment is required due to gender, based on exposure-response analysis.

## Race

Race (Asian vs. non-Asian) was not identified as a covariate influencing mosunetuzumab pharmacokinetics.

## Renal impairment

No dedicated studies have been conducted to determine the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab. The renal elimination of intact mosunetuzumab, an IgG monoclonal antibody, is expected to be low and of minor importance.

The population PK analysis of mosunetuzumab showed that creatinine clearance (CrCl) does not affect pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab. Pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab in patients with mild (CrCl 60 to 89 mL/min, n=178) or moderate (CrCl 30 to 59 mL/min, n=53) renal impairment were similar to those in patients with normal renal function (CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min, n=200). Pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 29 mL/min) is limited (n=1), therefore no dose recommendations can be made. Lunsumio was not studied in patients with end-stage renal disease and/or who are on dialysis.

## Hepatic impairment

No specific studies have been conducted to determine the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab. IgGs are mainly eliminated via intracellular catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to influence clearance of mosunetuzumab.

The population PK analysis of mosunetuzumab showed that hepatic impairment does not affect pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab. Pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin &gt; ULN to 1.5 x ULN or AST &gt; ULN, n=53) were similar to those in patients with normal hepatic function (n=384). The number of patients with moderate hepatic impairment is limited (total bilirubin &gt; 1.5-3 x ULN, any AST, n=2) and no patients with severe hepatic impairment have been studied.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of mosunetuzumab in the paediatric population (&lt; 18 years old).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Systemic toxicity

Key nonclinical findings with mosunetuzumab identified in single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 26-weeks in duration included transient post-dose CRS primarily limited to the first dose, vascular/perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates that were primarily in the CNS and infrequently in other organs that were likely secondary to cytokine release and immune cell activation, and increased susceptibility to infection following chronic dosing due to sustained B-cell depletion.

All of the findings were considered pharmacologically-mediated effects and reversible. Across studies there was a single incidence of convulsion in one animal at Cmax and AUC exposures (time-averaged over 7 days) of 3.3- and 1.8- fold higher, respectively, than those in patients receiving Lunsumio at the recommended dose and schedule in Study GO29781.

## Impairment of fertility

An assessment of the male and female reproductive organs was included in a 26-week chronic toxicity study in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys administered by intravenous infusion. Mosunetuzumab had no effect on either male or female reproductive organs at exposures (AUC) similar to exposure (AUC) in patients receiving the recommended dose.

## Reproductive toxicity

No developmental toxicity studies in animals have been conducted with mosunetuzumab. Based on low placental transfer of antibodies during the first trimester, the mechanism of action and available data of mosunetuzumab, and the data on the anti-CD20 antibody class, the risk for teratogenicity is low. Studies with mosunetuzumab in non-pregnant animals have demonstrated that prolonged B-cell depletion can lead to increased risk of opportunistic infection, which may cause foetal loss. Transient CRS associated with Lunsumio administration may also be harmful to pregnancy.

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Lunsumio is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use Lunsumio
3. How to take Lunsumio
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Lunsumio
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Lunsumio is and what it is used for

Lunsumio contains the active substance mosunetuzumab, which is a type of antibody. This is a cancer medicine. It is used to treat adults who have a blood cancer called follicular lymphoma (FL).

In FL, a type of white blood cells called 'B cells' become cancerous. The abnormal B cells do not work properly and grow too quickly, crowding out the normal B cells in the bone marrow and lymph nodes that help protect you from infection.

Lunsumio is given to patients who have tried at least two previous treatments for FL, when either the cancer has not responded to them, or it has come back again.

## How Lunsumio works

The active substance in Lunsumio, mosunetuzumab, is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein that attaches to specific targets in the body. In this case, mosunetuzumab attaches to a target substance found on B cells, including the cancerous B cells, and another target found on 'T cells', a different type of white blood cell. T cells are another part of the body's defences that can destroy invading cells. By attaching the two cells together like a bridge, Lunsumio encourages the T cells to destroy the cancerous B cells. This helps control the FL and prevent its spread.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you use Lunsumio

## You must not be given Lunsumio

- if you are allergic to mosunetuzumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Lunsumio.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Lunsumio if any of the following apply to you (or you are not sure):

- you have ever had heart, lung or kidney problems
- you have an infection, or have had an infection in the past which lasted a long time or keeps coming back
- you are due to have a vaccine or you know you may need to have one in the near future.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having this medicine.

Tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of any of the side effects listed below during or after treatment with Lunsumio. You may need additional medical treatment. The symptoms of each side effect are listed in section 4.

- Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) a condition associated with medicines that stimulate T cells.
- -Before each infusion, you may be given medicines, which help reduce possible side effects of cytokine release syndrome.
- -Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a condition where the immune system makes too many infection-fighting cells called histiocytes and lymphocytes. Signs and symptoms may overlap with CRS, your doctor will check for this condition if your CRS does not respond to treatment or lasts longer than expected.
- Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) a condition associated with effects on the nervous system. Symptoms include feeling confused, problems with memory, language or judgement, disorientation and confusion often accompanied by hallucination (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there), and not being able to concentrate.
- Tumour lysis syndrome some people may get unusual levels of some salts in the blood -caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment.
- -Your doctor or nurse will do blood tests to check for this condition. Before each infusion, you should be well-hydrated and may be given medicines that can help reduce high levels of uric acid. These may help reduce possible side effects of tumour lysis syndrome.
- Tumour flare as your cancer is destroyed, it may react and appear to get worse -this is called 'tumour flare reaction'.
- Infections you may get signs of infection, which can vary depending on where in the body the infection is.

## Children and adolescents

This medicine should not be used in children or adolescents under the age of 18. This is because there is no information about use in this age group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other medicines and Lunsumio

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

It is important to tell your doctor before and during treatment if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to get pregnant. This is because Lunsumio may affect your unborn baby.

- Do not use Lunsumio during pregnancy, unless after discussion with your doctor, it is agreed that the benefits of treatment outweigh any risk to the unborn baby.

## Contraception

Women who could become pregnant must use effective contraception during treatment -and for 3 months after the last dose of Lunsumio.

- Talk to your doctor or nurse about suitable methods of contraception.

## Breast-feeding

You must not breast-feed during and for at least 3 months after your last treatment. This is because it is not known whether any Lunsumio passes into breast milk and could therefore affect the baby.

## Driving and using machines

Lunsumio has major influence on your ability to drive, cycle or use any tools or machines. Due to the possible symptoms of ICANS, you should be careful while driving, cycling or using heavy or potentially dangerous machines. If you currently have such symptoms, avoid these activities and contact your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. See section 4 for more information about side effects.

## 3. How Lunsumio is given

Lunsumio is given under the supervision of a doctor experienced in giving such treatments. Follow the treatment schedule explained to you by your doctor. Check with your doctor if you are not sure.

## How Lunsumio is given

It is given into a vein, as a drip (infusion).

- It is given over 4 hours during the first cycle. Each cycle is 21 days and in the first cycle, you will be given the 4 hour infusion on day 1, day 8 and day 15.
- If side effects are not too severe, the dose may be given over 2 hours during the following cycles.

## Medicines given before Lunsumio treatment

You may be given other medicines 30 to 60 minutes before you are given Lunsumio. This is to help prevent infusion reactions and fever. These other medicines may include:

- Corticosteroids -such as dexamethasone or methylprednisolone
- Paracetamol
- An antihistamine - such as diphenhydramine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## How much Lunsumio is given

Lunsumio is normally given in cycles of 21 days. The recommended treatment duration is at least 8 treatment cycles. However, depending on side effects and how the disease responds to treatment, you may be given up to 17 cycles.

In cycle 1, you will be given 3 doses of Lunsumio in the 21 days:

- Day 1 : 1 mg
- Day 8 : 2 mg
- Day 15 : 60 mg

In cycle 2, you will be given just one dose:

- Day 1 : 60 mg

In cycles 3 to 17, you will be given just one dose:

- Day 1 : 30 mg

## If you miss a dose of Lunsumio

If you miss an appointment, make another one straight away. For the treatment to be fully effective, it is very important not to miss a dose.

## If you stop receiving Lunsumio

Do not stop treatment with Lunsumio unless you have discussed this with your doctor. This is because stopping treatment may make your condition worse.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.
