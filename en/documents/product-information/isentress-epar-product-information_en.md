## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

ISENTRESS 400 mg film-coated tablets

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each film-coated tablet contains 400 mg of raltegravir (as potassium).

## Excipient(s) with known effect

Each tablet contains 26.06 mg lactose (as monohydrate).

For the full list of  excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Film-coated tablet.

Pink, oval tablet, marked with \"227\" on one side.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

ISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.

## Posology

ISENTRESS should be used in combination with other active anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs) (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

## Adults

The recommended dosage is 400 mg (one tablet) twice daily.

## Paediatric population

The recommended dosage for paediatric patients of at least 25 kg body weight is 400 mg (one tablet) twice daily. If unable to swallow a tablet, consider the chewable tablet.

Additional formulations and strengths available:

ISENTRESS is also available in a chewable tablet formulation and in granules for oral suspension formulation Refer to the chewable tablet and granules for oral suspension SmPCs for additional dosing information.

The safety and efficacy of raltegravir in preterm (&lt;37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight (&lt;2,000 g) newborns have not been established. No data are available in this population and no dosing recommendations can be made.

The maximum dose of the chewable tablet is 300 mg twice daily. Because the formulations have different pharmacokinetic profiles neither the chewable tablets nor the granules for oral suspension should be substituted for the 400 mg tablet or 600 mg tablet (see section 5.2). The chewable tablets

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and the granules for oral suspension have not been studied in HIV-infected adolescents (12 to 18 years) or adults.

ISENTRESS is also available for adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg), as a 600 mg tablet to be administered as 1,200 mg once daily (two 600 mg tablets) f or treatment-naïve patients or patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily. The 400 mg tablet should not be used to administer the 1,200 mg once daily regimen. Refer to the 600 mg Summary of Product Characteristics for additional dosing information.

## Elderly

There is limited information regarding the use of raltegravir in the elderly (see section 5.2). Therefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in this population.

## Renal impairment

No dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders. Therefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Method of administration

## Oral use.

ISENTRESS 400 mg tablets can be administered with or without food.

The tablets should not be chewed, crushed or split due to anticipated changes in the pharmacokinetic profile.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## General

Patients should be advised that current anti-retroviral therapy does not cure HIV and has not been proven to prevent the transmission of HIV to others through blood contact.

Raltegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance. Therefore, whenever possible, raltegravir should be administered with two other active ARTs to minimise the potential for virological f ailure and the development of resistance (see section 5.1).

In treatment-naïve patients, the clinical study data on use of raltegravir are limited to use in combination with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate).

## Depression

Depression, including suicidal ideation and behaviours, has been reported, particularly in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Caution should be used in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

The safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders. Therefore, raltegravir should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased f requency of liver f unction abnormalities during combination anti-retroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.

Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination anti-retroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.

## Osteonecrosis

Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination anti-retroviral therapy. Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stif f ness or dif f iculty in movement.

## Immune reactivation syndrome

In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (f ormerly known as Pneumocystis carinii ). Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary .

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation: however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

## Antacids

Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and magnesium antacids resulted in reduced raltegravir plasma levels. Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium antacids is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## Rifampicin

Caution should be used when co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces plasma levels of raltegravir; the impact on the ef ficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if co-administration with rif ampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be considered in adults. There are no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in patients below 18 years of age (see section 4.5).

## Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis

Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal products associated with these conditions (see section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions

Severe, potentially lif e-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported in patients taking raltegravir, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products associated with these reactions. These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported and were characterised by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue raltegravir and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by f ever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, f acial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping raltegravir treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.

## Rash

Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir (see section 4.8).

## Lactose

This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ' sodium-free ' .

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

In vitro studies indicate that raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A, does not inhibit UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A1 and 2B7, does not induce CYP3A4 and does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Based on these data, raltegravir is not expected to aff ect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or P-glycoprotein.

Based on in vitro and in vivo studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway.

Considerable inter- and intra-individual variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir.

## Effect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products

In interaction studies, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful ef fect on the pharmacokinetics of etravirine, maraviroc, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, hormonal contraceptives, methadone, midazolam or boceprevir.

In some studies, co-administration of raltegravir with darunavir resulted in a modest decrease in darunavir plasma concentrations; the mechanism for this effect is unknown. However, the effect of raltegravir on darunavir plasma concentrations does not appear to be clinically meaningful.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir

Given that raltegravir is metabolised primarily via UGT1A1, caution should be used when co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of UGT1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces plasma levels of raltegravir; the impact on the ef f icacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if co-administration with rifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of  the dose of raltegravir can be considered in adults. There are no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in patients below 18 years of age (see section 4.4). The impact of other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, on UGT1A1 is unknown. Less potent inducers (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, rif abutin, glucocorticoids, St. John's wort, pioglitazone) may be used with the recommended dose of raltegravir.

Co-administration of raltegravir with medicinal products that are known to be potent UGT1A1 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir) may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Less potent UGT1A1 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, saquinavir) may also increase plasma levels of raltegravir, but to a lesser extent compared with atazanavir. In addition, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may increase plasma levels of raltegravir, however, the mechanism f or this ef fect is unknown (see Table 1). From the clinical trials, a large proportion of patients used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, both agents that result in increases in raltegravir plasma levels, in the optimised background regimens. The safety profile observed in patients who used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil f umarate was generally similar to the saf ety prof ile of  patients who did not use these agents. Theref ore, no dose adjustment is required.

Co-administration of raltegravir with antacids containing divalent metal cations may reduce raltegravir absorption by chelation, resulting in a decrease of raltegravir plasma levels. Taking an aluminium and magnesium antacid within 6 hours of raltegravir administration significantly decreased raltegravir plasma levels. Therefore, co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium containing antacids is not recommended. Co-administration of raltegravir with a calcium carbonate antacid decreased raltegravir plasma levels; however, this interaction is not considered clinically meaningful. Therefore, when raltegravir is co-administered with calcium carbonate containing antacids no dose adjustment is required.

Co-administration of raltegravir with other agents that increase gastric pH (e.g., omeprazole and famotidine) may increase the rate of raltegravir absorption and result in increased plasma levels of raltegravir (see Table 1). Safety profiles in the subgroup of patients in Phase III trials taking proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists were comparable with those who were not taking these antacids. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required with use of proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists.

All interaction studies were perf ormed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

A large amount of data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily during the first trimester (more than 1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes) indicates no malformative toxicity. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

A moderate amount of data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily during the second and/or third trimester (between 300-1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes) indicates no increased risk of f eto/neonatal toxicity.

Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily can be used during pregnancy if clinically needed.

## Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry

To monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients inadvertently administered raltegravir while pregnant, an Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients in this registry.

As a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in pregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, the animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in order to characterise the saf ety f or the f oetus.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

Raltegravir/metabolites are excreted in human milk to such an extent that eff ects on the breastfed newborns/infants are likely. Available pharmacodynamics/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of raltegravir/metabolites in milk (for details see section 5.3).

A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.

It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV.

## Fertility

No effect on fertility was seen in male and f emale rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in 3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Dizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens containing raltegravir. Dizziness may influence some patients' ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

In randomised clinical trials raltegravir 400 mg twice daily was administered in combination with fixed or optimised background treatment regimens to treatment-naïve (N=547) and treatmentexperienced (N=462) adults for up to 96 weeks. A further 531 treatment-naïve adults have received raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for up to 96 weeks. See section 5.1.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache, nausea and abdominal pain. The most frequently reported serious adverse reaction was immune reconstitution syndrome and rash. The rates of discontinuation of raltegravir due to adverse reactions were 5% or less in clinical trials.

Rhabdomyolysis was an uncommonly reported serious adverse reaction in post-marketing use of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily.

## Tabulated summary of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions considered by investigators to be causally related to raltegravir (alone or in combination with other ART), as well as adverse reactions established in post-marketing experience, are listed below by System Organ Class. Frequencies are defined as common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Cancers were reported in treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve patients who initiated raltegravir in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. The types and rates of specif ic cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population. The risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the groups receiving raltegravir and in the groups receiving comparators.

Grade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in patients treated with raltegravir. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal products associated with these conditions (see section 4.4).

Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).

In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of  combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic inf ections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).

For each of the following clinical adverse reactions there was at least one serious occurrence: genital herpes, anaemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, depression, mental disorder, suicide attempt, gastritis, hepatitis, renal f ailure, accidental overdose.

In clinical studies of treatment-experienced patients, rash, irrespective of causality, was more commonly observed with regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to those containing raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. Rash considered by the investigator to be drug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9, 4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3 per 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity and did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).

## Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus

In clinical trials, there were 79 patients co-infected with hepatitis B, 84 co-inf ected with hepatitis C, and 8 patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C who were treated with raltegravir in combination with other agents for HIV-1. In general, the saf ety profile of raltegravir in patients with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in patients without hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-inf ection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were somewhat higher in the subgroup co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus.

At 96-weeks, in treatment-experienced patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 %, 34 % and 13 %, respectively, of co-inf ected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 11 %, 10 % and 9 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir. At 240-weeks, in treatment-naïve patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 22 %, 44 % and 17 %, respectively, of co-inf ected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 13 %, 13 % and 5 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir.

## Paediatric population

## Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age

Raltegravir has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of raltegravir.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.

One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, abnormal behaviour and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic rash.

One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which were considered serious.

## Infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age

Raltegravir has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

In these 26 infants and toddlers, the f requency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.

One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment discontinuation.

## HIV-1 Exposed Neonates

In IMPAACT P1110 (see section 5.2) eligible infants were at least 37 weeks gestation and at least 2 kg in weight. Sixteen (16) neonates received 2 doses of ISENTRESS in first 2 weeks of life, and 26 neonates received 6 weeks of daily dosing; all were followed for 24 weeks. There were no drug related clinical adverse experiences and three drug-related laboratory adverse experiences (one a transient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine containing prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered non-serious and not requiring specific therapy).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No specific information is available on the treatment of  overdose with raltegravir.

In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. It should be taken into account that raltegravir is presented for clinical use as the potassium salt. The extent to which raltegravir may be dialysable is unknown.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, integrase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AJ01.

## Mechanism of action

Raltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1). Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of integrase, an HIV-encoded enzyme that is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

required for viral replication. Inhibition of  integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of the HIV genome into the host cell genome. HIV genomes that fail to integrate cannot direct the production of new infectious viral particles, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection.

## Antiviral activity in vitro

Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 /uniF0B1 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition (IC95) of  HIV-1 replication (relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures inf ected with the cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, raltegravir inhibited viral replication in cultures of mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical isolates of HIV-1, including isolates from 5 non-B subtypes, and isolates resistant to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. In a single-cycle inf ection assay, raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes and 5 circulating recombinant forms with IC50 values ranging f rom 5 to 12 nM.

## Resistance

Most viruses isolated from patients failing raltegravir had high-level raltegravir resistance resulting from the appearance of two or more mutations in integrase. Most had a signature mutation at amino acid 155 (N155 changed to H), amino acid 148 (Q148 changed to H, K, or R), or amino acid 143 (Y143 changed to H, C, or R), along with one or more additional integrase mutations (e.g., L74M, E92Q, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, S230R). The signature mutations decrease viral susceptibility to raltegravir and addition of other mutations results in a further decrease in raltegravir susceptibility. Factors that reduced the likelihood of developing resistance included lower baseline viral load and use of other active anti-retroviral agents. Mutations conf erring resistance to raltegravir generally also confer resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir. Mutations at amino acid 143 confer greater resistance to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q mutation confers greater resistance to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harbouring a mutation at amino acid 148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance mutations, may also have clinically signif icant resistance to dolutegravir.

## Clinical experience

The evidence of efficacy of raltegravir was based on the analyses of 96-week data from two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2, Protocols 018 and 019) in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult patients and the analysis of 240-week data from randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (STARTMRK, Protocol 021) in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients.

## Efficacy

## Treatment-experienced adult patients

BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials) evaluated the saf ety and anti-retroviral activity of  raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. placebo in a combination with optimised background therapy (OBT), in HIV-infected patients, 16 years or older, with documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs) of anti-retroviral therapies. Prior to randomisation, OBT were selected by the investigator based on the patient's prior treatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and phenotypic viral resistance testing.

Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and placebo. Patients had prior exposure to a median of 12 anti-retrovirals f or a median of  10 years. A median of 4 ARTs was used in OBT.

## Results 48 week and 96 week analyses

Durable outcomes (Week 48 and Week 96) for patients on the recommended dose raltegravir 400 mg twice daily from the pooled studies BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are shown in Table 2.

Raltegravir achieved virologic responses (using Not Completer=Failure approach) of HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL in 61.7 % of patients at Week 16, in 62.1 % at Week 48 and in 57.0 % at Week 96. Some patients experienced viral rebound between Week 16 and Week 96. Factors associated with failure include high baseline viral load and OBT that did not include at least one potent active agent.

## Switch to raltegravir

The SWITCHMRK 1 &amp; 2 (Protocols 032 &amp; 033) studies evaluated HIV-infected patients receiving suppressive (screening HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL; stable regimen &gt; 3 months) therapy with lopinavir 200 mg (+) ritonavir 50 mg 2 tablets twice daily plus at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and randomised them 1:1 to continue lopinavir (+) ritonavir 2 tablets twice daily (n=174 and n=178, respectively) or replace lopinavir (+) ritonavir with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n=174 and n=176, respectively). Patients with a prior history of virological f ailure were not excluded and the number of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited.

These studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of raltegravir versus lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In both studies at Week 24, suppression of HIV RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 84.4 % of the raltegravir group versus 90.6 % of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group, (Non-completers = Failure). See section 4.4 regarding the need to administer raltegravir with two other active agents.

## Treatment-naïve adult patients

STARTMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control trial) evaluated the safety and anti-retroviral activity of  raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. ef avirenz 600 mg at bedtime, in a combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients with HIV RNA &gt; 5,000 copies/mL. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV RNA level (≤ 50,000 copies/mL; and &gt; 50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or negative).

Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the group receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and the group receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime.

## Results 48-week and 240-week analyses

With respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 241/280 (86.1 %) in the group receiving raltegravir and 230/281 (81.9 %) in the group receiving efavirenz. The treatment diff erence (raltegravir -efavirenz) was 4.2 % with an associated 95 % CI of (-1.9, 10.3) establishing that raltegravir is non-inf erior to ef avirenz (pvalue for non-inferiority &lt; 0.001). At Week 240, the treatment dif ference (raltegravir -ef avirenz) was 9.5 % with an associated 95 % CI of (1.7, 17.3). Week 48 and Week 240 outcomes for patients on the recommended dose of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily from STARTMRK are shown in Table 3.

## Paediatric population

## Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age

IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I/II open label multicenter trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, tolerability, and ef f icacy of  raltegravir in HIV inf ected children. This study enrolled 126 treatment experienced children and adolescents 2 to18 years of age. Patients were stratif ied by age, enrolling adolescents f irst and then successively younger children. Patients received either the 400 mg tablet formulation (6 to 18 years of age) or the chewable tablet formulation (2 to less than 12 years of age). Raltegravir was administered with an optimised background regimen.

The initial dose f inding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose selection was based upon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults, and acceptable short-term safety. After dose selection, additional patients were enrolled for evaluation of long-term safety, tolerability and eff icacy. Of  the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of raltegravir (see section 4.2).

## Infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age

IMPAACT P1066 also enrolled HIV-infected, infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age who had received prior antiretroviral therapy either as prophylaxis for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) and/or as combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV infection. Raltegravir was administered as granules for oral suspension formulation without regard to food in combination with an optimised background regimen that included lopinavir plus ritonavir in two-thirds of patients.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

As demonstrated in healthy volunteers administered single oral doses of raltegravir in the fasted state, raltegravir is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 3 hours postdose. Raltegravir AUC and Cmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Raltegravir C12 hr increases dose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Dose proportionality has not been established in patients.

With twice-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved rapidly, within approximately the first 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax and evidence of slight accumulation in C12 hr. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established.

Raltegravir may be administered with or without food. Raltegravir was administered without regard to food in the pivotal saf ety and ef f icacy studies in HIV-infected patients. Administration of multiple doses of raltegravir following a moderate-fat meal did not aff ect raltegravir AUC to a clinically meaningful degree with an increase of 13 % relative to fasting. Raltegravir C12 hr was 66 % higher and Cmax was 5 % higher following a moderate-fat meal compared to fasting. Administration of raltegravir following a high-fat meal increased AUC and Cmax by approximately 2-fold and increased C12 hr by 4.1-fold. Administration of raltegravir following a low-fat meal decreased AUC and Cmax by 46 % and 52 %, respectively; C12 hr was essentially unchanged. Food appears to increase pharmacokinetic variability relative to f asting.

Overall, considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed C12 hr in BENCHMRK 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212 % and the CV for intra-subject variability = 122 %. Sources of variability may include differences in co-administration with food and concomitant medicines.

## Distribution

Raltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 µM.

Raltegravir readily crossed the placenta in rats, but did not penetrate the brain to any appreciable extent.

In two studies of HIV-1 infected patients who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was readily detected in the cerebrospinal f luid. In the f irst study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal f luid concentration was 5.8 % (range 1 to 53.5 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. In the second study (n=16), the median cerebrospinal f luid concentration was 3 % (range 1 to 61 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. These median proportions are approximately 3- to 6-fold lower than the free f raction of  raltegravir in plasma.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Biotransformation and excretion

The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter α -phase half-lif e (~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively. In faeces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely to be derived f rom hydrolysis of raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23 % of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70 % of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the formation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.

## UGT1A1 Polymorphism

In a comparison of 30 subjects with *28/*28 genotype to 27 subjects with wild-type genotype, the geometric mean ratio (90 % CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09) and the geometric mean ratio of C12 hr was 1.91 (1.43, 2.55). Dose adjustment is not considered necessary in subjects with reduced UGT1A1 activity due to genetic polymorphism.

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

Based on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and granules for oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg tablet. In this study, administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6 % decrease in AUC, 62 % decrease in Cmax, and 188 % increase in C12hr compared to administration in the fasted state. Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food. The effect of food on the granules for oral suspension f ormulation was not studied.

Table 6 displays pharmacokinetic parameters in the 400 mg tablet, the chewable tablet, and the granules for oral suspension, by body weight.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elderly

There was no clinically meaningful effect of age on raltegravir pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and patients with HIV-1 inf ection over the age range studied (19 to 84 years, with few individuals over the age of 65).

## Gender, race and BMI

There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to gender, race or body mass index (BMI) in adults.

## Renal impairment

Renal clearance of unchanged medicinal product is a minor pathway of elimination. In adults, there were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with severe renal insufficiency and healthy subjects (see section 4.2). Because the extent to which raltegravir may be dialysable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided.

## Hepatic impairment

Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. In adults, there were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency and healthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic insuff iciency on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical toxicology studies, including conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity and juvenile toxicity, have been conducted with raltegravir in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Ef fects at exposure levels suff iciently in excess of clinical exposure levels indicate no special hazard for humans.

## Mutagenicity

No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) tests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration studies.

## Carcinogenicity

A carcinogenicity study of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. At the highest dose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was similar to that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. In rats, tumours (squamous cell carcinoma) of the nose/nasopharynx were identified at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day in females and at 300 mg/kg/day in males. This neoplasia could result from local deposition and/or aspiration of drug on the mucosa of the nose/nasopharynx during oral gavage dosing and subsequent chronic irritation and inflammation; it is likely that it is of  limited relevance f or the intended clinical use. At the NOAEL, systemic exposure was similar to that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. Standard genotoxicity studies to evaluate mutagenicity and clastogenicity were negative.

## Developmental toxicity

Raltegravir was not teratogenic in developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A slight increase in incidence of supernumerary ribs, a variant in the normal developmental process, was observed in rat foetuses of dams exposed to raltegravir at approximately 4.4-fold human exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) based on AUC0-24 hr. No development effects were seen at 3.4-fold human exposure at the RHD. Similar findings were not observed in rabbits.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

ISENTRESS 600 mg film-coated tablets is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adults, and paediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.

Posology

ISENTRESS should be used in combination with other active anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs) (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

## Adults and paediatric population

In adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg), the recommended dosage is 1,200 mg (two 600 mg tablets) once daily f or treatment-naïve patients or patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily.

Additional f ormulations and strengths available:

ISENTRESS is also available as a 400 mg tablet for twice daily use in HIV infected adults or children and adolescents at least 25 kg. The 400 mg tablet should not be used to administer 1,200 mg once daily regimen (please refer to the 400 mg Summary of Product Characteristics).

ISENTRESS is also available in a chewable tablet formulation and in granules for oral suspension formulation. Refer to the chewable tablet and granules for oral suspension SmPCs for additional dosing information.

The safety and efficacy of raltegravir in preterm (&lt;37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight (&lt;2,000 g) newborns have not been established. No data are available in this population and no dosing recommendations can be made.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The maximum dose of the chewable tablet is 300 mg twice daily. Because the formulations have dif f erent pharmacokinetic prof iles neither the chewable tablets nor the granules f or oral suspension should be substituted for the 400 mg tablet or the 600 mg tablet (see section 5.2). The chewable tablets and the granules for oral suspension have not been studied in HIV-infected adolescents (12 to 18 years) or adults.

## Elderly

There is limited information regarding the use of raltegravir in the elderly (see section 5.2). Therefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in this population.

## Renal impairment

No dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders. Therefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

ISENTRESS 600 mg film-coated tablet formulation should not be used in children weighing less than 40 kg.

## Method of administration

## Oral use.

ISENTRESS 600 mg tablets can be administered with or without food as a 1,200 mg once daily dose. The tablets should not be chewed, crushed or split due to anticipated changes in the pharmacokinetic profile.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## General

Patients should be advised that current anti-retroviral therapy does not cure HIV and has not been proven to prevent the transmission of HIV to others through blood contact.

Raltegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance. Therefore, whenever possible, raltegravir should be administered with two other active ARTs to minimise the potential for virological f ailure and the development of resistance (see section 5.1).

In treatment-naïve patients, the clinical study data on use of raltegravir are limited to use in combination with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate).

## Depression

Depression, including suicidal ideation and behaviours, has been reported, particularly in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Caution should be used in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

The safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders. Therefore, raltegravir should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased f requency of liver f unction abnormalities during combination anti-retroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.

Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination anti-retroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.

## Osteonecrosis

Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination anti-retroviral therapy. Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stif f ness or dif f iculty in movement.

## Immune reactivation syndrome

In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (f ormerly known as Pneumocystis carinii ). Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary .

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation: however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

## Atazanavir

Co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with atazanavir resulted in increased raltegravir plasma levels; theref ore, co-administration is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## Tipranavir/ritonavir

Co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with tipranavir/ritonavir could result in decreased raltegravir trough plasma levels; theref ore, co-administration is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## Antacids

Co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with calcium carbonate and aluminium/magnesium containing antacids resulted in reduced raltegravir plasma levels; therefore, co-administration is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## Strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes

Strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g., rifampicin) have not been studied with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily, but could result in decreased raltegravir trough plasma levels; theref ore, co-administration with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is not recommended.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis

Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal products associated with these conditions (see section 4.8).

## Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions

Severe, potentially lif e-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported in patients taking raltegravir, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products associated with these reactions. These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported and were characterised by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue raltegravir and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by f ever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, f acial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping raltegravir treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.

## Rash

Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir (see section 4.8).

## Lactose

This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ' sodium-free ' .

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

In vitro , raltegravir is a weak inhibitor of organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 (IC50 of 109 µM) and OAT3 (IC50 of 18.8 µM). Caution is recommended when co-administering raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with sensitive OAT1 and/or OAT3 substrates.

In vitro studies indicate that raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A, does not inhibit UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A1 and 2B7, does not induce CYP3A4 and is not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3, organic cation transporters (OCT)1 and OCT2, or multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATE)1 and MATE2-K. Based on these data, raltegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or transporters.

Based on in vitro and in vivo studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway.

Considerable inter- and intra-individual variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products

In drug interaction studies perf ormed using raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of etravirine, maraviroc, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, hormonal contraceptives, methadone, midazolam or boceprevir. These findings can be extended to raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily and no dosage adjustment is required for these agents.

In some studies, co-administration of raltegravir 400 mg tablets twice daily with darunavir resulted in a modest but clinically insignif icant decrease in darunavir plasma concentrations. Based on the magnitude of effect seen with raltegravir 400 mg tablets twice daily, it is expected that the ef fect of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily on darunavir plasma concentrations is likely to be not clinically meaningful.

## Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir

## Inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes

The impact of medicinal products that are strong inducers of UGT1A1 such as rifampicin on raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is unknown, but co-administration is likely to decrease raltegravir trough levels based on the reduction in trough concentrations observed with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily; theref ore, co-administration with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is not recommended. The impact of other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, on UGT1A1 is unknown; therefore, co-administration with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is not recommended. In drug interaction studies, efavirenz did not have a clinically meaningf ul effect on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily; therefore, other less potent inducers (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, rifabutin, glucocorticoids, St. John's wort, pioglitazone) may be used with the recommended dose of raltegravir.

## Inhibitors of UGT1A1

Co-administration of atazanavir with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily significantly increased plasma levels of raltegravir; theref ore, co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily and atazanavir is not recommended.

## Antacids

Co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with aluminium/magnesium and calcium carbonate containing antacids are likely to result in clinically meaningful reductions in the plasma trough levels of raltegravir. Based on these findings, co-administration of aluminium/magnesium and calcium carbonate containing antacids with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is not recommended.

## Agents that increase gastric pH

Population pharmacokinetic analysis from ONCEMRK (Protocol 292) showed that co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with PPIs or H2 blockers did not result in statistically signif icant changes in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. Comparable efficacy and safety results were obtained in the absence or presence of these gastric pH-altering agents. Based on these data, proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers may be co-administered with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily.

## Additional considerations

No studies have been conducted to evaluate the drug interactions of ritonavir, tipranavir/ritonavir, boceprevir or etravirine with raltegravir 1,200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once daily. While the magnitudes of change on raltegravir exposure from raltegravir 400 mg twice daily by ritonavir, boceprevir or etravirine were small, the impact from tipranavir/ritonavir was greater (GMR Ctrough=0.45, GMR AUC=0.76). Co-administration of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily and tipranavir/ritonavir is not recommended.

Previous studies of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily showed that co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (a component of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) increased raltegravir exposure. Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was identified to increase raltegravir 1,200 mg

once daily bioavailability by 12%, however its impact is not clinically meaningful. Therefore, coadministration of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil f umarate and raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is permitted.

All interaction studies were perf ormed in adults.

Comprehensive drug interaction studies were performed with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and a limited number of drug interaction studies were performed for raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data for the use of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily in pregnant women. A large amount of data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily during the first trimester (more than 1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes) indicates no malformative toxicity. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

A moderate amount of data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily during the second and/or third trimester (between 300-1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes) indicates no increased risk of feto/neonatal toxicity.

Raltegravir 1,200 mg is not recommended during pregnancy.

## Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry

To monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients inadvertently administered raltegravir while pregnant, an Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients in this registry.

As a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in pregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, the animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in order to characterise the saf ety f or the f oetus.

## Breast-feeding

Raltegravir/metabolites are excreted in human milk to such an extent that eff ects on the breastfed newborns/infants are likely. Available pharmacodynamics/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of raltegravir/metabolites in milk (for details see section 5.3).

A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.

It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV.

## Fertility

No effect on fertility was seen in male and f emale rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in 3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Dizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens containing raltegravir. Dizziness may influence some patients' ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

In randomised clinical trials raltegravir 400 mg twice daily was administered in combination with fixed or optimised background treatment regimens to treatment-naïve (N=547) and treatmentexperienced (N=462) adults for up to 96 weeks. A further 531 treatment-naïve adults have received raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for up to 96 weeks. See section 5.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache, nausea and abdominal pain. The most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were immune reconstitution syndrome and rash. The rates of discontinuation of raltegravir due to adverse reactions were 5% or less in clinical trials.

Rhabdomyolysis was an uncommonly reported serious adverse reaction in post-marketing use of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily.

## Tabulated summary of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions considered by investigators to be causally related to raltegravir (alone or in combination with other ART), as well as adverse reactions established in post-marketing experience, are listed below by System Organ Class. Frequencies are def ined as common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

In studies of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, cancers were reported in treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve patients who initiated raltegravir in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. The types and rates of specif ic cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population. The risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the groups receiving raltegravir and in the groups receiving comparators.

Grade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in patients treated with raltegravir. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal products associated with these conditions (see section 4.4).

Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).

In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of  combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic inf ections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).

For each of the following clinical adverse reactions there was at least one serious occurrence: genital herpes, anaemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, depression, mental disorder, suicide attempt, gastritis, hepatitis, renal f ailure, accidental overdose.

In clinical studies of treatment-experienced patients, rash, irrespective of causality, was more commonly observed with regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to those containing raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. Rash considered by the investigator to be drug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9, 4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

per 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity and did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).

## Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus

In clinical trials, there were 79 patients co-infected with hepatitis B, 84 co-inf ected with hepatitis C, and 8 patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C who were treated with raltegravir in combination with other agents for HIV-1. In general, the safety prof ile of  raltegravir in patients with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in patients without hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-inf ection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were somewhat higher in the subgroup co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus.

At 96-weeks, in treatment-experienced patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 %, 34 % and 13 %, respectively, of co-infected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 11 %, 10 % and 9 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir. At 240-weeks, in treatment-naïve patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 22 %, 44 % and 17 %, respectively, of co-inf ected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 13 %, 13 % and 5 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir.

## Paediatric population

ISENTRESS 600 mg tablet formulation has not been studied in paediatric patients (see section 4.2).

## Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age

Raltegravir twice daily has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 inf ected children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of raltegravir twice daily.

In these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.

One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, abnormal behaviour and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic rash.

One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which were considered serious.

## Infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age

Raltegravir twice daily has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

In these 26 infants and toddlers, the f requency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.

One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment discontinuation.

## HIV-1 Exposed Neonates

In IMPAACT P1110 (see section 5.2) eligible infants were at least 37 weeks gestation and at least 2 kg in weight. Sixteen (16) neonates received 2 doses of ISENTRESS in first 2 weeks of life, and 26 neonates received 6 weeks of daily dosing; all were followed for 24 weeks. There were no drug related clinical adverse experiences and three drug-related laboratory adverse experiences (one a transient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine containing prevention of mother to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

child transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered non-serious and not requiring specific therapy).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No specific information is available on the treatment of  overdose with raltegravir.

In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. It should be taken into account that raltegravir is presented for clinical use as the potassium salt. The extent to which raltegravir may be dialysable is unknown.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, integrase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AJ01.

## Mechanism of action

Raltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1). Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of integrase, an HIV-encoded enzyme that is required for viral replication. Inhibition of  integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of the HIV genome into the host cell genome. HIV genomes that fail to integrate cannot direct the production of new infectious viral particles, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection.

## Antiviral activity in vitro

Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 /uniF0B1 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition (IC95) of  HIV-1 replication (relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures inf ected with the cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, raltegravir inhibited viral replication in cultures of mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical isolates of HIV-1, including isolates from 5 non-B subtypes, and isolates resistant to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. In a single-cycle inf ection assay, raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes and 5 circulating recombinant forms with IC50 values ranging f rom 5 to 12 nM.

## Resistance

Most viruses isolated from patients failing raltegravir had high-level raltegravir resistance resulting from the appearance of two or more mutations in integrase. Most had a signature mutation at amino acid 155 (N155 changed to H), amino acid 148 (Q148 changed to H, K, or R), or amino acid 143 (Y143 changed to H, C, or R), along with one or more additional integrase mutations (e.g., L74M, E92Q, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, S230R). The signature mutations decrease viral susceptibility to raltegravir and addition of other mutations results in a further decrease in raltegravir susceptibility. Factors that reduced the likelihood of developing resistance included lower baseline viral load and use of other active anti-retroviral agents. Mutations conf erring resistance to raltegravir generally also confer resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir. Mutations at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

amino acid 143 confer greater resistance to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q mutation confers greater resistance to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harbouring a mutation at amino acid 148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance mutations, may also have clinically signif icant resistance to dolutegravir.

## Clinical experience

The evidence of efficacy of raltegravir was based on the analyses of 96-week data from two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2, Protocols 018 and 019) in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult patients, the analysis of 240-week data from randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (STARTMRK, Protocol 021) in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients and the analysis of 96-week data from randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (ONCEMRK, Protocol 292) in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients.

## Efficacy

## Treatment-experienced adult patients (400 mg twice daily)

BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials) evaluated the saf ety and anti-retroviral activity of  raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. placebo in a combination with optimised background therapy (OBT), in HIV-infected patients, 16 years or older, with documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs) of anti-retroviral therapies. Prior to randomisation, OBT were selected by the investigator based on the patient's prior treatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and phenotypic viral resistance testing.

Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and placebo. Patients had prior exposure to a median of 12 anti-retrovirals f or a median of 10 years. A median of 4 ARTs was used in OBT.

## Results 48-week and 96-week analyses

Durable outcomes (Week 48 and Week 96) for patients on the recommended dose raltegravir 400 mg twice daily from the pooled studies BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are shown in Table 2.

† Non-completer is failure imputation: patients who discontinued prematurely are imputed as failure thereafter. Percent of patients with response and associated 95 % confidence interval (CI) are reported.

‡ For analysis by prognostic factors, virologic failures were carried f orward f or percent &lt; 400 and 50 copies/mL. For mean CD4 changes, baseline-carryforward was used for virologic f ailures.

§ The Genotypic Sensitivity Score (GSS) was defined as the total oral ARTs in the optimised background therapy (OBT) to which a patient's viral isolate showed genotypic sensitivity based upon genotypic resistance test. Enf uvirtide use in OBT in enfuvirtide-naïve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT. Similarly, darunavir use in OBT in darunavir-naïve patients was counted as one active drug in OBT.

Raltegravir achieved virologic responses (using Not Completer=Failure approach) of HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL in 61.7 % of patients at Week 16, in 62.1 % at Week 48 and in 57.0 % at Week 96. Some patients experienced viral rebound between Week 16 and Week 96. Factors associated with failure include high baseline viral load and OBT that did not include at least one potent active agent.

## Switch to raltegravir (400 mg twice daily)

The SWITCHMRK 1 &amp; 2 (Protocols 032 &amp; 033) studies evaluated HIV-infected patients receiving suppressive (screening HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL; stable regimen &gt; 3 months) therapy with lopinavir 200 mg (+) ritonavir 50 mg 2 tablets twice daily plus at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and randomised them 1:1 to continue lopinavir (+) ritonavir 2 tablets twice daily (n=174 and n=178, respectively) or replace lopinavir (+) ritonavir with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n=174 and n=176, respectively). Patients with a prior history of virological f ailure were not excluded and the number of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited.

These studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of raltegravir versus lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In both studies at Week 24, suppression of HIV RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 84.4 % of the raltegravir group versus 90.6 % of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group, (Non-completers = Failure). See section 4.4 regarding the need to administer raltegravir with two other active agents.

## Treatment-naïve adult patients (400 mg twice daily)

STARTMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control trial) evaluated the safety and anti-retroviral activity of  raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. ef avirenz 600 mg at bedtime, in a combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients with HIV RNA &gt; 5,000 copies/mL. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV RNA level (≤ 50,000 copies/mL; and &gt; 50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or negative).

Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the group receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and the group receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime.

## Results 48-week and 240-week analyses

With respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 241/280 (86.1 %) in the group receiving raltegravir and 230/281 (81.9 %) in the group receiving efavirenz. The treatment diff erence (raltegravir -efavirenz) was 4.2 % with an associated 95 % CI of (-1.9, 10.3) establishing that raltegravir is non-inf erior to ef avirenz (p-value for non-inferiority &lt; 0.001). At Week 240, the treatment dif ference (raltegravir -ef avirenz) was 9.5 % with an associated 95 % CI of (1.7, 17.3). Week 48 and Week 240 outcomes for patients on the recommended dose of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily from STARTMRK are shown in Table 3.

## Treatment-naïve adult patients (1,200 mg [2 x 600 mg] once daily)

ONCEMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control trial; Protocol 292) evaluated the safety and anti-retroviral activity of raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily + emtricitabine (+) tenof ovir disoproxil fumarate vs. raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, in combination with emtricitabine (+) tenof ovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients with HIV RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/mL. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV RNA level ( ≤ 100,000 copies/mL; and &gt; 100,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or negative).

Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the group receiving raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily and the group receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily.

## Results of Week 48 and 96 analyses

With respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA &lt; 40 copies/mL at Week 48 was 472/531(88.9 %) in the group receiving raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily and 235/266 (88.3 %) in the group receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily. The treatment dif f erence (raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily-raltegravir 400 mg twice daily) was 0.5 % with an associated 95 % CI of (-4.2, 5.2) establishing that raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is non-inf erior to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily.

At Week 96, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA &lt; 40 copies/mL was 433/531(81.5 %) in the group receiving raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily and 213/266 (80.1 %) in the group receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily. The treatment dif ference (raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily-raltegravir 400 mg twice daily) was 1.5 % with an associated 95 % CI of (-4.4, 7.3). Week 48 and Week 96 outcomes from ONCEMRK are shown in Table 4.

Raltegravir 1,200 mg QD and raltegravir 400 mg BID were administered with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

As demonstrated in healthy volunteers administered single oral doses of raltegravir in the fasted state, raltegravir is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 3 hours postdose. Raltegravir AUC and Cmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Raltegravir C12 hr increases dose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg.

With twice-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved rapidly, within approximately the first 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax and evidence of slight accumulation in C12 hr. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established.

Raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily is also rapidly absorbed with median Tmax ~1.5 to 2 hours in the fasted state and generates a sharper absorption peak with a tendency to higher Cmax in comparison to raltegravir twice daily (1 x 400 mg tablet twice daily). In addition, relative to the raltegravir 400 mg formulation the raltegravir 600 mg formulation used in the 1,200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once daily dosing regimen has higher relative bioavailability (by 21 to 66%). Once absorbed, both formulations of raltegravir exhibit similar systemic pharmacokinetics. In patients, after 1,200 mg once daily raltegravir dosing, steady state AUC0-24 was 53.7 h·μM, C 24 was 75.6 nM, and median Tmax was 1.50 h.

Raltegravir 400 mg twice daily may be administered with or without food. Raltegravir was administered without regard to food in the pivotal safety and efficacy studies in HIV-infected patients. Administration of multiple doses of raltegravir following a moderate-fat meal did not aff ect raltegravir AUC to a clinically meaningful degree with an increase of 13 % relative to fasting. Raltegravir C12 hr was 66 % higher and Cmax was 5 % higher following a moderate-fat meal compared to fasting. Administration of raltegravir following a high-fat meal increased AUC and Cmax by approximately 2-fold and increased C12 hr by 4.1-fold. Administration of raltegravir following a low-f at meal decreased AUC and Cmax by 46 % and 52 %, respectively; C12 hr was essentially unchanged. Food appears to increase pharmacokinetic variability relative to fasting.

Raltegravir 600 mg tablets (2 x 600 mg once daily) may be administered with or without food. A single dose food effect study demonstrated that the 1,200 mg once daily had similar or smaller food effects when studied under high-fat and low-fat meal conditions when compared to the 400 mg twice

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

daily. Administration of a low-fat meal with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily resulted in a 42% decrease in AUC0-last, 52% decrease in Cmax, and 16% decrease in C24 hr. Administration of a high fat meal resulted in a 1.9% increase in AUC0-last, 28% decrease in Cmax, and 12% decrease in C24 hr.

Overall, considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed C12 hr in BENCHMRK 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212 % and the CV for intra-subject variability = 122 %. Sources of variability may include differences in co-administration with food and concomitant medicines.

## Distribution

Raltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 µM.

Raltegravir readily crossed the placenta in rats, but did not penetrate the brain to any appreciable extent.

In two studies of HIV-1 infected patients who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was readily detected in the cerebrospinal f luid. In the f irst study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal f luid concentration was 5.8 % (range 1 to 53.5 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. In the second study (n=16), the median cerebrospinal f luid concentration was 3 % (range 1 to 61 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. These median proportions are approximately 3- to 6-fold lower than the free f raction of  raltegravir in plasma.

## Biotransformation and excretion

The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter α -phase half-lif e (~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively. In faeces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely to be derived f rom hydrolysis of raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23 % of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70 % of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the formation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.

## UGT1A1 Polymorphism

In a comparison of 30 subjects with *28/*28 genotype to 27 subjects with wild-type genotype, the geometric mean ratio (90 % CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09) and the geometric mean ratio of C12 hr was 1.91 (1.43, 2.55). Dose adjustment is not considered necessary in subjects with reduced UGT1A1 activity due to genetic polymorphism.

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

Based on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and granules for oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg tablet. In this study, administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6 % decrease in AUC, 62 % decrease in Cmax, and 188 % increase in C12 hr compared to administration in the fasted state. Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food. The effect of food on the granules for oral suspension f ormulation was not studied.

*Number of patients with intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) results at the final recommended dose. † Geometric coefficient of variation.

## Elderly

There was no clinically meaningful effect of age on raltegravir pharmacokinetics over the age range studied with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily. There was no clinically meaningful effect of age on raltegravir pharmacokinetics over the age range studied in ONCEMRK with raltegravir 1,200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once daily.

## Gender, race, ethnicity and body weight

There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to gender, race, ethnicity or body weight in adults for raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, and no clinically meaningful ef fect on raltegravir pharmacokinetics was concluded. For raltegravir 1,200 mg (2 x 600 mg) once daily, population PK analysis also demonstrated that the impacts of gender, race, ethnicity and body weight are not clinically meaningful.

## Renal impairment

Renal clearance of unchanged medicinal product is a minor pathway of elimination. In adults, there were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with severe renal insufficiency and healthy subjects (see section 4.2 of  the 400 mg twice daily SmPC). Because the extent to which raltegravir may be dialysable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided. No renal impairment study was conducted with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily however, based on results with the 400 mg twice daily tablet, no clinically meaningful effect is anticipated.

## Hepatic impairment

Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. In adults, there were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency and healthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic insuff iciency on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the 400 mg twice daily SmPC). No hepatic impairment study has been conducted with raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily, however, based on results with the 400 mg twice daily tablet, no clinically meaningful effect is expected for mild and moderate hepatic impairment.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical toxicology studies, including conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity and juvenile toxicity, have been conducted with raltegravir in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Ef fects at exposure levels suff iciently in excess of clinical exposure levels indicate no special hazard for humans.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Mutagenicity

No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) tests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration studies.

## Carcinogenicity

A carcinogenicity study of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. At the highest dose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was similar to that at the clinical dose of 1,200 mg once daily. In rats, tumours (squamous cell carcinoma) of the nose/nasopharynx were identified at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day in females and at 300 mg/kg/day in males. This neoplasia could result from local deposition and/or aspiration of drug on the mucosa of the nose/nasopharynx during oral gavage dosing and subsequent chronic irritation and inflammation; it is likely that it is of  limited relevance f or the intended clinical use. At the NOAEL, systemic exposure was similar to that at the clinical dose of 1,200 mg once daily. Standard genotoxicity studies to evaluate mutagenicity and clastogenicity were negative.

## Developmental toxicity

Raltegravir was not teratogenic in developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A slight increase in incidence of supernumerary ribs, a variant in the normal developmental process, was observed in rat foetuses of dams exposed to raltegravir at approximately 4.4-fold human exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) based on AUC0-24 hr. No development effects were seen at 3.4-fold human exposure at the RHD. Similar findings were not observed in rabbits.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

ISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.

## Posology

ISENTRESS should be used in combination with other active anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs) (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

The maximum dose of the chewable tablet is 300 mg twice daily.

Because the formulations have different pharmacokinetic profiles neither the chewable tablets nor the granules for oral suspension should be substituted for the 400 mg tablet or 600 mg tablet (see section 5.2). The chewable tablets and the granules for oral suspension have not been studied in HIV-infected adolescents (12 to 18 years) or adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric Population

Children at least 11 kg: weight-based dose of the chewable tablet to a maximum dose of 300 mg, twice daily as specified in Tables 1 and 2. The chewable tablets are available in 25 mg and scored 100 mg strengths.

See section 5.2 regarding the limited data on which these dose recommendations are based.

No data are available in pre-term neonates. The use of ISENTRESS is not recommended in pre-term neonates.

Patients should be instructed to keep scheduled appointments because the ISENTRESS dosage should be adjusted as the child grows.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Additional f ormulations and strengths available

ISENTRESS is also available in a 400 mg tablet and as granules for oral suspension for use. Refer to the 400 mg tablet and granules for oral suspension SmPCs for additional dosing information. The safety and efficacy of raltegravir in preterm (&lt;37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight (&lt;2,000 g) newborns have not been established. No data are available in this population and no dosing recommendations can be made.

ISENTRESS is also available for adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg), as a 600 mg tablet to be administered as 1,200 mg once daily (two 600 mg tablets) f or treatment-naïve patients or patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily. Refer to the 600 mg tablet SmPCs for additional dosing information.

## Elderly

There is limited information regarding the use of raltegravir in the elderly (see section 5.2). Therefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in this population.

## Renal impairment

No dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders. Therefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Method of administration

## Oral use.

ISENTRESS chewable tablets can be administered with or without food (see section 5.2).

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## General

Patients should be advised that current anti-retroviral therapy does not cure HIV and has not been proven to prevent the transmission of HIV to others through blood contact.

Raltegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance. Therefore, whenever possible, raltegravir should be administered with two other active ARTs to minimise the potential for virological f ailure and the development of resistance (see section 5.1).

In treatment-naïve patients, the clinical study data on use of raltegravir are limited to use in combination with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate).

## Depression

Depression, including suicidal ideation and behaviours, has been reported, particularly in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Caution should be used in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

The safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders. Therefore, raltegravir should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased f requency of liver f unction abnormalities during combination anti-retroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.

Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination anti-retroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.

## Osteonecrosis

Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination anti-retroviral therapy. Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stif f ness or dif f iculty in movement.

## Immune reactivation syndrome

In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (f ormerly known as Pneumocystis carinii ). Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary .

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' dise ase and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation: however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

## Antacids

Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and magnesium antacids resulted in reduced raltegravir plasma levels. Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium antacids is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## Rifampicin

Caution should be used when co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces plasma levels of raltegravir; the impact on the ef ficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if co-administration with rif ampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be considered in adults. There are no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in patients below 18 years of age (see section 4.5).

## Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis

Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal products associated with these conditions (see section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions

Severe, potentially lif e-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported in patients taking raltegravir, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products associated with these reactions. These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported and were characterised by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue raltegravir and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by f ever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, f acial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping raltegravir treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.

## Rash

Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir (see section 4.8).

Patients with rare hereditary problems of f ructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

In vitro studies indicate that raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A, does not inhibit UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A1 and 2B7, does not induce CYP3A4 and does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Based on these data, raltegravir is not expected to aff ect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or P-glycoprotein.

Based on in vitro and in vivo studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway.

Considerable inter- and intra-individual variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir.

## Effect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products

In interaction studies, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful ef fect on the pharmacokinetics of etravirine, maraviroc, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, hormonal contraceptives, methadone, midazolam or boceprevir.

In some studies, co-administration of raltegravir with darunavir resulted in a modest decrease in darunavir plasma concentrations; the mechanism for this effect is unknown. However, the effect of raltegravir on darunavir plasma concentrations does not appear to be clinically meaningful.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir

Given that raltegravir is metabolised primarily via UGT1A1, caution should be used when co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of UGT1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces plasma levels of raltegravir; the impact on the eff icacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if co-administration with rifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of  the dose of raltegravir can be considered in adults. There are no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in patients below 18 years of age (see section 4.4). The impact of other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, on UGT1A1 is unknown. Less potent inducers (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, rif abutin, glucocorticoids, St. John's wort, pioglitazone) may be used with the recommended dose of raltegravir.

Co-administration of raltegravir with medicinal products that are known to be potent UGT1A1 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir) may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Less potent UGT1A1 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, saquinavir) may also increase plasma levels of raltegravir, but to a lesser extent compared with atazanavir. In addition, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may increase plasma levels of raltegravir, however, the mechanism f or this ef fect is unknown (see Table 3). From the clinical trials, a large proportion of patients used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, both agents that result in increases in raltegravir plasma levels, in the optimised background regimens. The safety profile observed in patients who used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil f umarate was generally similar to the saf ety prof ile of  patients who did not use these agents. Theref ore, no dose adjustment is required.

Co-administration of raltegravir with antacids containing divalent metal cations may reduce raltegravir absorption by chelation, resulting in a decrease of raltegravir plasma levels. Taking an aluminium and magnesium antacid within 6 hours of raltegravir administration significantly decreased raltegravir plasma levels. Theref ore, co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium containing antacids is not recommended. Co-administration of raltegravir with a calcium carbonate antacid decreased raltegravir plasma levels; however, this interaction is not considered clinically meaningful. Therefore, when raltegravir is co-administered with calcium carbonate containing antacids no dose adjustment is required.

Co-administration of raltegravir with other agents that increase gastric pH (e.g., omeprazole and famotidine) may increase the rate of raltegravir absorption and result in increased plasma levels of raltegravir (see Table 3). Safety profiles in the subgroup of patients in Phase III trials taking proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists were comparable with those who were not taking these antacids. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required with use of proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists.

All interaction studies have been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data for the use of raltegravir chewable tablets in pregnant women. A large amount of data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily during the first trimester (more than 1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes) indicates no malformative toxicity. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

A moderate amount of data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily during the second and/or third trimester (between 300-1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes) indicates no increased risk of feto/neonatal toxicity.

Raltegravir chewable tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit justif ies the potential risk to the f etus. See section 4.2 f or dosing recommendations.

## Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry

To monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients inadvertently administered raltegravir while pregnant, an Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients in this registry.

As a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in pregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, the animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in order to characterise the saf ety f or the foetus.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

Raltegravir/metabolites are excreted in human milk to such an extent that eff ects on the breastfed newborns/infants are likely. Available pharmacodynamics/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of raltegravir/metabolites in milk (for details see section 5.3).

A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.

It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV.

## Fertility

No effect on fertility was seen in male and f emale rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in 3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Dizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens containing raltegravir. Dizziness may influence some patients' ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

In randomised clinical trials raltegravir 400 mg twice daily was administered in combination with fixed or optimised background treatment regimens to treatment-naïve (N=547) and treatmentexperienced (N=462) adults for up to 96 weeks. A further 531 treatment-naïve adults have received raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for up to 96 weeks. See section 5.1.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache, nausea and abdominal pain. The most frequently reported serious adverse reaction was immune reconstitution syndrome and rash. The rates of discontinuation of raltegravir due to adverse reactions were 5 % or less in clinical trials.

Rhabdomyolysis was an uncommonly reported serious adverse reaction in post-marketing use of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily.

## Tabulated summary of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions considered by investigators to be causally related to raltegravir (alone or in combination with other ART), as well as adverse reactions established in post-marketing experience, are listed below by System Organ Class. Frequencies are defined as com mon (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), u ncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Cancers were reported in treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve patients who initiated raltegravir in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. The types and rates of specif ic cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population. The risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the groups receiving raltegravir and in the groups receiving comparators.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Grade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in patients treated with raltegravir. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal products associated with these conditions (see section 4.4).

Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).

In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of  combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic inf ections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).

For each of the following clinical adverse reactions there was at least one serious occurrence: genital herpes, anaemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, depression, mental disorder, suicide attempt, gastritis, hepatitis, renal f ailure, accidental overdose.

In clinical studies of treatment-experienced patients, rash, irrespective of causality, was more commonly observed with regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to those containing raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. Rash considered by the investigator to be drug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9, 4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3 per 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity and did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).

## Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus

In clinical trials, there were 79 patients co-infected with hepatitis B, 84 co-inf ected with hepatitis C, and 8 patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C who were treated with raltegravir in combination with other agents for HIV-1. In general, the saf ety profile of raltegravir in patients with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in patients without hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-inf ection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were somewhat higher in the subgroup co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus

At 96-weeks, in treatment-experienced patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 %, 34 % and 13 %, respectively, of co-inf ected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 11 %, 10 % and 9 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir. At 240-weeks, in treatment-naïve patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 22 %, 44 % and 17 %, respectively, of co-inf ected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 13 %, 13 % and 5 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir.

## Paediatric population

## Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age

Raltegravir has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of raltegravir.

In these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.

One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, abnormal behaviour and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic rash.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which were considered serious.

## Infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age

Raltegravir has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

In these 26 infants and toddlers, the f requency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.

One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment discontinuation.

## HIV-1 Exposed Neonates

In IMPAACT P1110 (see section 5.2) eligible infants were at least 37 weeks gestation and at least 2 kg in weight. Sixteen (16) neonates received 2 doses of ISENTRESS in first 2 weeks of life, and 26 neonates received 6 weeks of daily dosing; all were followed for 24 weeks. There were no drug related clinical adverse experiences and three drug-related laboratory adverse experiences (one a transient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine containing prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered non-serious and not requiring specific therapy).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No specific information is available on the treatment of  overdose with raltegravir.

In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. It should be taken into account that raltegravir is presented for clinical use as the potassium salt. The extent to which raltegravir may be dialysable is unknown.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, integrase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AJ01.

## Mechanism of action

Raltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1). Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of integrase, an HIV-encoded enzyme that is required for viral replication. Inhibition of  integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of the HIV genome into the host cell genome. HIV genomes that fail to integrate cannot direct the production of new infectious viral particles, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Antiviral activity in vitro

Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 /uniF0B1 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition (IC95) of  HIV-1 replication (relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures inf ected with the cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, raltegravir inhibited viral replication in cultures of mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical isolates of HIV-1, including isolates from 5 non-B subtypes, and isolates resistant to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. In a single-cycle inf ection assay, raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes and 5 circulating recombinant forms with IC50 values ranging f rom 5 to 12 nM.

## Resistance

Most viruses isolated from patients failing raltegravir had high-level raltegravir resistance resulting from the appearance of two or more mutations in integrase. Most had a signature mutation at amino acid 155 (N155 changed to H), amino acid 148 (Q148 changed to H, K, or R), or amino acid 143 (Y143 changed to H, C, or R), along with one or more additional integrase mutations (e.g., L74M, E92Q, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, S230R). The signature mutations decrease viral susceptibility to raltegravir and addition of other mutations results in a further decrease in raltegravir susceptibility. Factors that reduced the likelihood of developing resistance included lower baseline viral load and use of other active anti-retroviral agents. Mutations conf erring resistance to raltegravir generally also confer resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir. Mutations at amino acid 143 confer greater resistance to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q mutation confers greater resistance to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harbouring a mutation at amino acid 148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance mutations, may also have clinically signif icant resistance to dolutegravir.

## Clinical experience

The evidence of efficacy of raltegravir was based on the analyses of 96-week data from two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2, Protocols 018 and 019) in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult patients and the analysis of 240-week data from a randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (STARTMRK, Protocol 021) in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients.

## Efficacy

## Treatment-experienced adult patients

BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials) evaluated the saf ety and anti-retroviral activity of  raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. placebo in a combination with optimised background therapy (OBT), in HIV-infected patients, 16 years or older, with documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs) of anti-retroviral therapies. Prior to randomisation, OBT were selected by the investigator based on the patient's prior treatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and phenotypic viral resistance testing

Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and placebo. Patients had prior exposure to a median of 12 anti-retrovirals f or a median of  10 years. A median of 4 ARTs was used in OBT.

## Results 48 week and 96 week analyses

Durable outcomes (Week 48 and Week 96) for patients on the recommended dose raltegravir 400 mg twice daily from the pooled studies BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are shown in Table 4.

Raltegravir achieved virologic responses (using Not Completer=Failure approach) of HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL in 61.7 % of patients at Week 16, in 62.1 % at Week 48 and in 57.0 % at Week 96. Some patients experienced viral rebound between Week 16 and Week 96. Factors associated with failure include high baseline viral load and OBT that did not include at least one potent active agent.

The SWITCHMRK 1 &amp; 2 (Protocols 032 &amp; 033) studies evaluated HIV-infected patients receiving suppressive (screening HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL; stable regimen &gt; 3 months) therapy with lopinavir 200 mg (+) ritonavir 50 mg 2 tablets twice daily plus at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and randomised them 1:1 to continue lopinavir (+) ritonavir 2 tablets twice daily (n=174 and n=178, respectively) or replace lopinavir (+) ritonavir with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n=174 and n=176, respectively). Patients with a prior history of virological f ailure were not excluded and the number of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited.

These studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of raltegravir versus lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In both studies at Week 24, suppression of HIV RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 84.4 % of the raltegravir group versus 90.6 % of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group, (Non-completers = Failure). See section 4.4 regarding the need to administer raltegravir with two other active agents.

## Treatment-naïve adult patients

STARTMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control trial) evaluated the safety and anti-retroviral activity of  raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. ef avirenz 600 mg at bedtime, in a combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients with HIV RNA &gt; 5,000 copies/mL. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV RNA level (≤ 50,000 copies/mL; and &gt; 50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or negative).

Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the group receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and the group receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime.

## Results 48-week and 240-week analyses

With respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 241/280 (86.1 %) in the group receiving raltegravir and 230/281 (81.9 %) in the group receiving efavirenz. The treatment diff erence (raltegravir -efavirenz) was 4.2 % with an associated 95 % CI of (-1.9, 10.3) establishing that raltegravir is non-inf erior to ef avirenz (pvalue for non-inferiority &lt; 0.001). At Week 240, the treatment dif ference (raltegravir -ef avirenz) was 9.5 % with an associated 95 % CI of (1.7, 17.3). Week 48 and Week 240 outcomes for patients on the recommended dose of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily from STARTMRK are shown in Table 5.

## Paediatric population

## Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age

IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I/II open label multicenter trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, tolerability, and ef f icacy of  raltegravir in HIV inf ected children. This study enrolled 126 treatment experienced children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age. Patients were stratif ied by age, enrolling adolescents f irst and then successively younger children. Patients received either the 400 mg tablet formulation (6 to 18 years of age) or the chewable tablet formulation (2 to less than 12 years of age). Raltegravir was administered with an optimised background regimen.

The initial dose f inding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose selection was based upon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults, and acceptable short-term safety. After dose selection, additional patients were enrolled for evaluation of long-term safety, tolerability and eff icacy. Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of raltegravir (see section 4.2).

## Infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age

IMPAACT P1066 also enrolled HIV-infected, infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age who had received prior antiretroviral therapy either as prophylaxis for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) and/or as combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV infection. Raltegravir was administered as granules for oral suspension formulation without regard to food in combination with an optimised background regimen that included lopinavir plus ritonavir in two-thirds of patients.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

As demonstrated in healthy volunteers administered single oral doses of raltegravir in the fasted state, raltegravir is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 3 hours postdose. Raltegravir AUC and Cmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Raltegravir C12 hr increases dose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Dose proportionality has not been established in patients.

With twice-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved rapidly, within approximately the first 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax and evidence of slight accumulation in C12 hr. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established.

Raltegravir may be administered with or without food. Raltegravir was administered without regard to food in the pivotal saf ety and ef f icacy studies in HIV-infected patients. Administration of multiple doses of raltegravir following a moderate-fat meal did not aff ect raltegravir AUC to a clinically meaningful degree with an increase of 13 % relative to fasting. Raltegravir C12 hr was 66 % higher and Cmax was 5 % higher following a moderate-fat meal compared to fasting. Administration of raltegravir following a high-fat meal increased AUC and Cmax by approximately 2-fold and increased C12 hr by 4.1-fold. Administration of raltegravir following a low-fat meal decreased AUC and Cmax by 46 % and 52 %, respectively; C12 hr was essentially unchanged. Food appears to increase pharmacokinetic variability relative to f asting.

Overall, considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed C12 hr in BENCHMRK 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212 % and the CV for intra-subject variability = 122 %. Sources of variability may include differences in co-administration with food and concomitant medicines.

## Distribution

Raltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 µM.

Raltegravir readily crossed the placenta in rats, but did not penetrate the brain to any appreciable extent.

In two studies of HIV-1 infected patients who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was readily detected in the cerebrospinal f luid. In the f irst study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal f luid concentration was 5.8 % (range 1 to 53.5 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. In the second study (n=16), the median cerebrospinal f luid concentration was 3 % (range 1 to 61 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. These median proportions are approximately 3- to 6-fold lower than the free f raction of  raltegravir in plasma.

## Biotransformation and excretion

The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter α -phase half-lif e (~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively. In faeces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely to be derived f rom hydrolysis of raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23 % of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70 % of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

formation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.

## UGT1A1 Polymorphism

In a comparison of 30 subjects with *28/*28 genotype to 27 subjects with wild-type genotype, the geometric mean ratio (90 % CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09) and the geometric mean ratio of C12 hr was 1.91 (1.43, 2.55). Dose adjustment is not considered necessary in subjects with reduced UGT1A1 activity due to genetic polymorphism.

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

Based on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and granules for oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg tablet. In this study, administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6 % decrease in AUC, 62 % decrease in Cmax, and 188 % increase in C12hr compared to administration in the fasted state. Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food. The effect of food on the granules for oral suspension f ormulation was not studied.

Table 8 displays pharmacokinetic parameters in the 400 mg tablet, the chewable tablet), and the granules for oral suspension, by body weight.

*Number of patients with intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) results at the final recommended dose. † Geometric coefficient of variation.

## Elderly

There was no clinically meaningful effect of age on raltegravir pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and patients with HIV-1 inf ection over the age range studied (19 to 84 years, with few individuals over the age of 65).

## Gender, race and BMI

There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to gender, race or body mass index (BMI) in adults.

## Renal impairment

Renal clearance of unchanged medicinal product is a minor pathway of elimination. In adults, there were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with severe renal insufficiency and healthy subjects (see section 4.2). Because the extent to which raltegravir may be dialysable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. In adults, there were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency and healthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic insuff iciency on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical toxicology studies, including conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity and juvenile toxicity, have been conducted with raltegravir in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Ef fects at exposure levels suff iciently in excess of clinical exposure levels indicate no special hazard for humans.

## Mutagenicity

No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) tests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration studies.

## Carcinogenicity

A carcinogenicity study of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. At the highest dose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was similar to that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. In rats, tumours (squamous cell carcinoma) of the nose/nasopharynx were identified at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day in females and at 300 mg/kg/day in males. This neoplasia could result from local deposition and/or aspiration of drug on the mucosa of the nose/nasopharynx during oral gavage dosing and subsequent chronic irritation and inflammation; it is likely that it is of  limited relevance f or the intended clinical use. At the NOAEL, systemic exposure was similar to that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. Standard genotoxicity studies to evaluate mutagenicity and clastogenicity were negative.

## Developmental toxicity

Raltegravir was not teratogenic in developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A slight increase in incidence of supernumerary ribs, a variant in the normal developmental process, was observed in rat foetuses of dams exposed to raltegravir at approximately 4.4-fold human exposure at 400 mg twice daily based on AUC0-24 hr. No development effects were seen at 3.4-fold human exposure at 400 mg twice daily based on AUC0-24 hr. Similar f indings were not observed in rabbits.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

ISENTRESS is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.

Posology

ISENTRESS should be used in combination with other active anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs) (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

Because the formulations have dif f erent pharmacokinetic profiles neither the granules for oral suspension nor the chewable tablets should be substituted for the 400 mg tablet or 600 mg tablet (see section 5.2). The granules f or oral suspension and the chewable tablets have not been studied in HIV-infected adolescents (12 to 18 years) or adults.

## Neonates, Infants and Toddlers

Dosing is weight based from birth as specified in Table 1 and Table 2. Patients can remain on the granules for oral suspension as long as their weight is below 20 kg.

For patients weighing between 11 and 20 kg, either the granules for oral suspension or the chewable tablet can be used as specified in Table 1 (see section 5.2). Refer to the chewable tablet SmPC for additional dosing information.

The safety and efficacy of raltegravir in preterm (&lt;37 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight (&lt;2,000 g) newborns have not been established. No data are available in this population and no dosing recommendations can be made.

Maximum dose of oral suspension is 100 mg twice daily.

Each single-use sachet contains 100 mg of raltegravir which is to be suspended in 10 mL of water giving a final concentration of 10 mg per mL (see section 6.6).

Scheduled appointments for the patient should be kept because the ISENTRESS dosage should be adjusted as the child grows.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Additional f ormulations and strengths available:

ISENTRESS is also available in a 400 mg tablet for use in adults, adolescents and children weighing at least 25 kg and able to swallow a tablet. For patients weighing at least 25 kg but are unable to swallow a tablet, consider the chewable tablet. Refer to the 400 mg and chewable tablet SmPCs for additional dosing information.

ISENTRESS is also available for adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg), as a 600 mg tablet to be administered as 1,200 mg once daily (two 600 mg tablets) f or treatment-naïve patients or patients who are virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily. Refer to the 600 mg tablet SmPC for additional dosing information.

## Elderly

There is limited information regarding the use of raltegravir in the elderly (see section 5.2). Therefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in this population.

## Renal impairment

No dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders. Therefore, ISENTRESS should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Method of administration

## Oral use.

ISENTRESS granules for oral suspension can be administered with or without food (see section 5.2).

For details on preparation and administration of the suspension, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## General

Patients should be advised that current anti-retroviral therapy does not cure HIV and has not been proven to prevent the transmission of HIV to others through blood contact.

Raltegravir has a relatively low genetic barrier to resistance. Therefore, whenever possible, raltegravir should be administered with two other active ARTs to minimise the potential for virological f ailure and the development of resistance (see section 5.1).

In treatment-naïve patients, the clinical study data on use of raltegravir are limited to use in combination with two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate).

## Depression

Depression, including suicidal ideation and behaviours, has been reported, particularly in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness. Caution should be used in patients with a pre-existing history of depression or psychiatric illness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

The safety and efficacy of raltegravir have not been established in patients with severe underlying liver disorders. Therefore, raltegravir should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic hepatitis have an increased f requency of liver f unction abnormalities during combination anti-retroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered.

Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination anti-retroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions.

## Osteonecrosis

Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to combination anti-retroviral therapy. Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stif f ness or dif f iculty in movement.

## Immune reactivation syndrome

In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (f ormerly known as Pneumocystis carinii ). Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary .

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation: however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

## Antacids

Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and magnesium antacids resulted in reduced raltegravir plasma levels. Co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium antacids is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## Rifampicin

Caution should be used when co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces plasma levels of raltegravir; the impact on the ef ficacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if co-administration with rif ampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of the dose of raltegravir can be considered in adults. There are no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in patients below 18 years of age (see section 4.5).

## Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis

Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal products associated with these conditions (see section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions

Severe, potentially lif e-threatening, and fatal skin reactions have been reported in patients taking raltegravir, in most cases concomitantly with other medicinal products associated with these reactions. These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported and were characterised by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue raltegravir and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by f ever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, f acial oedema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping raltegravir treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.

## Rash

Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to patients receiving raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir (see section 4.8).

## Fructose

This medicinal product contains up to 0.5 mg fructose per sachet. Fructose may damage teeth.

## Sucrose

This medicinal product contains up to 4.7 mg sucrose per sachet.

Sucrose may be harmful to the teeth.

Patients with rare hereditary problems of f ructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.

## Sorbitol

This medicine contains sorbitol (E 420) up to 1.5 mg per sachet.

In medicinal products for oral use, sorbitol may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products for oral use administered concomitantly.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

In vitro studies indicate that raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A, does not inhibit UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A1 and 2B7, does not induce CYP3A4 and does not inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport. Based on these data, raltegravir is not expected to af f ect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes or P-glycoprotein.

Based on in vitro and in vivo studies, raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway.

Considerable inter- and intra-individual variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products

In interaction studies, raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful ef fect on the pharmacokinetics of etravirine, maraviroc, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, hormonal contraceptives, methadone, midazolam or boceprevir.

In some studies, co-administration of raltegravir with darunavir resulted in a modest decrease in darunavir plasma concentrations; the mechanism for this effect is unknown. However, the effect of raltegravir on darunavir plasma concentrations does not appear to be clinically meaningful.

## Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir

Given that raltegravir is metabolised primarily via UGT1A1, caution should be used when co-administering raltegravir with strong inducers of UGT1A1 (e.g., rifampicin). Rifampicin reduces plasma levels of raltegravir; the impact on the ef f icacy of raltegravir is unknown. However, if co-administration with rifampicin is unavoidable, a doubling of  the dose of raltegravir can be considered in adults. There are no data to guide co-administration of raltegravir with rifampicin in patients below 18 years of age (see section 4.4). The impact of other strong inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, on UGT1A1 is unknown. Less potent inducers (e.g., efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, rif abutin, glucocorticoids, St. John's wort, pioglitazone) may be used with the recommended dose of raltegravir.

Co-administration of raltegravir with medicinal products that are known to be potent UGT1A1 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir) may increase plasma levels of raltegravir. Less potent UGT1A1 inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, saquinavir) may also increase plasma levels of raltegravir, but to a lesser extent compared with atazanavir. In addition, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate may increase plasma levels of raltegravir, however, the mechanism f or this ef fect is unknown (see Table 3). From the clinical trials, a large proportion of patients used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, both agents that result in increases in raltegravir plasma levels, in the optimised background regimens. The safety profile observed in patients who used atazanavir and / or tenofovir disoproxil f umarate was generally similar to the saf ety prof ile of  patients who did not use these agents. Theref ore, no dose adjustment is required.

Co-administration of raltegravir with antacids containing divalent metal cations may reduce raltegravir absorption by chelation, resulting in a decrease of raltegravir plasma levels. Taking an aluminium and magnesium antacid within 6 hours of raltegravir administration significantly decreased raltegravir plasma levels. Therefore, co-administration of raltegravir with aluminium and/or magnesium containing antacids is not recommended. Co-administration of raltegravir with a calcium carbonate antacid decreased raltegravir plasma levels; however, this interaction is not considered clinically meaningful. Therefore, when raltegravir is co-administered with calcium carbonate containing antacids no dose adjustment is required.

Co-administration of raltegravir with other agents that increase gastric pH (e.g., omeprazole and famotidine) may increase the rate of raltegravir absorption and result in increased plasma levels of raltegravir (see Table 3). Safety profiles in the subgroup of patients in Phase III trials taking proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists were comparable with those who were not taking these antacids. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required with use of proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists.

All interaction studies were perf ormed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data for the use of raltegravir granules f or oral suspension in pregnant women. A large amount of data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily during the first trimester (more than 1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes) indicates no malformative toxicity. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

A moderate amount of data on pregnant women with exposure to raltegravir 400 mg twice daily during the second and/or third trimester (between 300-1,000 prospective pregnancy outcomes) indicates no increased risk of feto/neonatal toxicity.

Raltegravir granules for oral suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit justif ies the potential risk to the f etus. See section 4.2 f or dosing recommendations.

## Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry

To monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients inadvertently administered raltegravir while pregnant, an Anti-retroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients in this registry.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in pregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, the animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account in order to characterise the saf ety f or the f oetus.

## Breast-feeding

Raltegravir/metabolites are excreted in human milk to such an extent that eff ects on the breastfed newborns/infants are likely. Available pharmacodynamics/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of raltegravir/metabolites in milk (for details see section 5.3).

A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.

It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV.

## Fertility

No effect on fertility was seen in male and f emale rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day which resulted in 3-fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Dizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens containing raltegravir. Dizziness may influence some patients' ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

In randomised clinical trials raltegravir 400 mg twice daily was administered in combination with fixed or optimised background treatment regimens to treatment-naïve (N=547) and treatmentexperienced (N=462) adults for up to 96 weeks. A further 531 treatment-naïve adults have received raltegravir 1,200 mg once daily with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for up to 96 weeks. See section 5.1.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment were headache, nausea and abdominal pain. The most frequently reported serious adverse reaction was immune reconstitution syndrome and rash. The rates of discontinuation of raltegravir due to adverse reactions were 5% or less in clinical trials.

Rhabdomyolysis was an uncommonly reported serious adverse reaction in post-marketing use of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily.

## Tabulated summary of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions considered by investigators to be causally related to raltegravir (alone or in combination with other ART), as well as adverse reactions established in post-marketing experience, are listed below by System Organ Class. Frequencies are defined as common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

Cancers were reported in treatment-experienced and treatment-naïve patients who initiated raltegravir in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents. The types and rates of specif ic cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population. The risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the groups receiving raltegravir and in the groups receiving comparators.

Grade 2-4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in patients treated with raltegravir. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Use with caution in patients who have had myopathy or rhabdomyolysis in the past or have any predisposing issues including other medicinal products associated with these conditions (see section 4.4).

Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).

In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of  combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic inf ections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).

For each of the following clinical adverse reactions there was at least one serious occurrence: genital herpes, anaemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, depression, mental disorder, suicide attempt, gastritis, hepatitis, renal f ailure, accidental overdose.

In clinical studies of treatment-experienced patients, rash, irrespective of causality, was more commonly observed with regimens containing raltegravir and darunavir compared to those containing raltegravir without darunavir or darunavir without raltegravir. Rash considered by the investigator to be drug-related occurred at similar rates. The exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9, 4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

per 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity and did not result in discontinuation of therapy (see section 4.4).

## Patients co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus

In clinical trials, there were 79 patients co-infected with hepatitis B, 84 co-inf ected with hepatitis C, and 8 patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C who were treated with raltegravir in combination with other agents for HIV-1. In general, the saf ety profile of raltegravir in patients with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection was similar to that in patients without hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-inf ection, although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were somewhat higher in the subgroup co-infected with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus At 96-weeks, in treatment-experienced patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 %, 34 % and 13 %, respectively, of co-inf ected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 11 %, 10 % and 9 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir. At 240-weeks, in treatment-naïve patients, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 22 %, 44 % and 17 %, respectively, of co-inf ected patients treated with raltegravir as compared to 13 %, 13 % and 5 % of all other patients treated with raltegravir.

## Paediatric population

## Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age

Raltegravir has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of raltegravir.

In these 96 children and adolescents, frequency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.

One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity, abnormal behaviour and insomnia; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic rash.

One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities, Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT, which were considered serious.

## Infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age

Raltegravir has also been studied in 26 HIV-1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age, in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

In these 26 infants and toddlers, the f requency, type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults.

One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug related allergic rash that resulted in treatment discontinuation.

## HIV-1 Exposed Neonates

In IMPAACT P1110 (see section 5.2) eligible infants were at least 37 weeks gestation and at least 2 kg in weight. Sixteen (16) neonates received 2 doses of ISENTRESS in first 2 weeks of life, and 26 neonates received 6 weeks of daily dosing; all were followed for 24 weeks. There were no drug related clinical adverse experiences and three drug-related laboratory adverse experiences (one a transient Grade 4 neutropenia in a subject receiving zidovudine containing prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT), and two bilirubin elevations (one each, Grade 1 and Grade 2) considered non-serious and not requiring specific therapy).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No specific information is available on the treatment of  overdose with raltegravir.

In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. It should be taken into account that raltegravir is presented for clinical use as the potassium salt. The extent to which raltegravir may be dialysable is unknown.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antivirals for systemic use, integrase inhibitors, ATC code: J05AJ01.

## Mechanism of action

Raltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1). Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of integrase, an HIV-encoded enzyme that is required for viral replication. Inhibition of  integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of the HIV genome into the host cell genome. HIV genomes that fail to integrate cannot direct the production of new infectious viral particles, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection.

## Antiviral activity in vitro

Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 /uniF0B1 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition (IC95) of  HIV-1 replication (relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures inf ected with the cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, raltegravir inhibited viral replication in cultures of mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with diverse, primary clinical isolates of HIV-1, including isolates from 5 non-B subtypes, and isolates resistant to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. In a single-cycle inf ection assay, raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes and 5 circulating recombinant forms with IC50 values ranging f rom 5 to 12 nM.

## Resistance

Most viruses isolated from patients failing raltegravir had high-level raltegravir resistance resulting from the appearance of two or more mutations in integrase. Most had a signature mutation at amino acid 155 (N155 changed to H), amino acid 148 (Q148 changed to H, K, or R), or amino acid 143 (Y143 changed to H, C, or R), along with one or more additional integrase mutations (e.g., L74M, E92Q, T97A, E138A/K, G140A/S, V151I, G163R, S230R). The signature mutations decrease viral susceptibility to raltegravir and addition of other mutations results in a further decrease in raltegravir susceptibility. Factors that reduced the likelihood of developing resistance included lower baseline viral load and use of other active anti-retroviral agents. Mutations conf erring resistance to raltegravir generally also confer resistance to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir. Mutations at amino acid 143 confer greater resistance to raltegravir than to elvitegravir, and the E92Q mutation confers greater resistance to elvitegravir than to raltegravir. Viruses harbouring a mutation at amino

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

acid 148, along with one or more other raltegravir resistance mutations, may also have clinically signif icant resistance to dolutegravir.

## Clinical experience

The evidence of efficacy of raltegravir was based on the analyses of 96-week data from two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2, Protocols 018 and 019) in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adult patients and the analysis of 240-week data from a randomised, double-blind, active-control trial (STARTMRK, Protocol 021) in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult patients.

## Efficacy

## Treatment-experienced adult patients

BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials) evaluated the saf ety and anti-retroviral activity of  raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. placebo in a combination with optimised background therapy (OBT), in HIV-infected patients, 16 years or older, with documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes (NRTIs, NNRTIs, PIs) of anti-retroviral therapies. Prior to randomisation, OBT were selected by the investigator based on the patient's prior treatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and phenotypic viral resistance testing.

Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and placebo. Patients had prior exposure to a median of 12 anti-retrovirals f or a median of  10 years. A median of 4 ARTs was used in OBT.

## Results 48 week and 96 week analyses

Durable outcomes (Week 48 and Week 96) for patients on the recommended dose raltegravir 400 mg twice daily from the pooled studies BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are shown in Table 3.

Raltegravir achieved virologic responses (using Not Completer=Failure approach) of HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL in 61.7 % of patients at Week 16, in 62.1 % at Week 48 and in 57.0 % at Week 96. Some patients experienced viral rebound between Week 16 and Week 96. Factors associated with failure include high baseline viral load and OBT that did not include at least one potent active agent.

## Switch to raltegravir

The SWITCHMRK 1 &amp; 2 (Protocols 032 &amp; 033) studies evaluated HIV-infected patients receiving suppressive (screening HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL; stable regimen &gt; 3 months) therapy with lopinavir 200 mg (+) ritonavir 50 mg 2 tablets twice daily plus at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and randomised them 1:1 to continue lopinavir (+) ritonavir 2 tablets twice daily (n=174 and n=178, respectively) or replace lopinavir (+) ritonavir with raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n=174 and n=176, respectively). Patients with a prior history of virological f ailure were not excluded and the number of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited.

These studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of raltegravir versus lopinavir (+) ritonavir. In both studies at Week 24, suppression of HIV RNA to less than 50 copies/mL was maintained in 84.4 % of the raltegravir group versus 90.6 % of the lopinavir (+) ritonavir group, (Non-completers = Failure). See section 4.4 regarding the need to administer raltegravir with two other active agents.

## Treatment-naïve adult patients

STARTMRK (multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active-control trial) evaluated the safety and anti-retroviral activity of  raltegravir 400 mg twice daily vs. ef avirenz 600 mg at bedtime, in a combination with emtricitabine (+) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients with HIV RNA &gt; 5,000 copies/mL. Randomisation was stratified by screening HIV RNA level (≤ 50,000 copies/mL; and &gt; 50,000 copies/mL) and by hepatitis B or C status (positive or negative).

Patient demographics (gender, age and race) and baseline characteristics were comparable between the group receiving raltegravir 400 mg twice daily and the group receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime.

## Results 48-week and 240-week analyses

With respect to the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was 241/280 (86.1 %) in the group receiving raltegravir and 230/281 (81.9 %) in the group receiving efavirenz. The treatment diff erence (raltegravir -efavirenz) was 4.2 % with an associated 95 % CI of (-1.9, 10.3) establishing that raltegravir is non-inf erior to ef avirenz (pvalue for non-inferiority &lt; 0.001). At Week 240, the treatment dif ference (raltegravir -ef avirenz) was 9.5 % with an associated 95 % CI of (1.7, 17.3). Week 48 and Week 240 outcomes for patients on the recommended dose of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily from STARTMRK are shown in Table 5.

IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I/II open label multicenter trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, tolerability, and ef f icacy of  raltegravir in HIV inf ected children. This study enrolled 126 treatment experienced children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age. Patients were stratif ied by age, enrolling adolescents f irst and then successively younger children. Patients received either the 400 mg tablet formulation (6 to 18 years of age) or the chewable tablet formulation (2 to less than 12 years of age). Raltegravir was administered with an optimised background regimen.

The initial dose f inding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose selection was based upon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults, and acceptable short-term safety. After dose selection, additional patients were enrolled for evaluation of long-term safety, tolerability and eff icacy. Of the 126 patients, 96 received the recommended dose of raltegravir (see section 4.2).

## Infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age

IMPAACT P1066 also enrolled HIV-infected, infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age who had received prior antiretroviral therapy either as prophylaxis for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) and/or as combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV infection. Raltegravir was administered as granules for oral suspension formulation without regard to food in combination with an optimised background regimen that included lopinavir plus ritonavir in two-thirds of patients.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

As demonstrated in healthy volunteers administered single oral doses of raltegravir in the fasted state, raltegravir is rapidly absorbed with a tmax of approximately 3 hours postdose. Raltegravir AUC and Cmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Raltegravir C12 hr increases dose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1,600 mg. Dose proportionality has not been established in patients.

With twice-daily dosing, pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved rapidly, within approximately the first 2 days of dosing. There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax and evidence of slight accumulation in C12 hr. The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established.

Raltegravir may be administered with or without food. Raltegravir was administered without regard to food in the pivotal saf ety and ef f icacy studies in HIV-infected patients. Administration of multiple doses of raltegravir following a moderate-fat meal did not aff ect raltegravir AUC to a clinically meaningful degree with an increase of 13 % relative to fasting. Raltegravir C12 hr was 66 % higher and Cmax was 5 % higher following a moderate-fat meal compared to fasting. Administration of raltegravir following a high-fat meal increased AUC and Cmax by approximately 2-fold and increased C12 hr by 4.1-fold. Administration of raltegravir following a low-fat meal decreased AUC and Cmax by 46 % and 52 %, respectively; C12 hr was essentially unchanged. Food appears to increase pharmacokinetic variability relative to f asting.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir. For observed C12 hr in BENCHMRK 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation (CV) for inter-subject variability = 212 % and the CV for intra-subject variability = 122 %. Sources of variability may include differences in co-administration with food and concomitant medicines.

## Distribution

Raltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 µM.

Raltegravir readily crossed the placenta in rats, but did not penetrate the brain to any appreciable extent.

In two studies of HIV-1 infected patients who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily, raltegravir was readily detected in the cerebrospinal f luid. In the f irst study (n=18), the median cerebrospinal f luid concentration was 5.8 % (range 1 to 53.5 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. In the second study (n=16), the median cerebrospinal f luid concentration was 3 % (range 1 to 61 %) of the corresponding plasma concentration. These median proportions are approximately 3- to 6-fold lower than the free f raction of  raltegravir in plasma.

## Biotransformation and excretion

The apparent terminal half-life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours, with a shorter α -phase half-lif e (~1 hour) accounting for much of the AUC. Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir, approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in faeces and urine, respectively. In faeces, only raltegravir was present, most of which is likely to be derived f rom hydrolysis of raltegravir-glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species. Two components, namely raltegravir and raltegravir-glucuronide, were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23 % of the dose, respectively. The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70 % of the total radioactivity; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir-glucuronide. Studies using isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA-expressed UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the formation of raltegravir-glucuronide. Thus, the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation.

## UGT1A1 Polymorphism

In a comparison of 30 subjects with *28/*28 genotype to 27 subjects with wild-type genotype, the geometric mean ratio (90 % CI) of AUC was 1.41 (0.96, 2.09) and the geometric mean ratio of C12 hr was 1.91 (1.43, 2.55). Dose adjustment is not considered necessary in subjects with reduced UGT1A1 activity due to genetic polymorphism.

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

Based on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers, the chewable tablet and granules for oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg tablet. In this study, administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6 % decrease in AUC, 62 % decrease in Cmax, and 188 % increase in C12 hr compared to administration in the fasted state. Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food. The effect of food on the granules for oral suspension f ormulation was not studied.

## HIV-1 Exposed Neonates

IMPAACT P1110 is a Phase I trial to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of raltegravir granules for suspension (GFS) with standard care PMTCT in full term HIV-1-exposed neonates. Cohort 1 (N=16, 10 exposed and 6 unexposed to raltegravir in utero) received 2 single doses of raltegravir GFS (within 48 hours and 7 - 10 days after birth); Cohort 2 (N=26, all raltegravir unexposed in utero) received raltegravir GFS f or 6 weeks: 1.5 mg/kg once daily starting within 48 hours of birth through Week 1; 3 mg/kg twice daily Weeks 2 to 4; and 6 mg/kg twice daily Weeks 5 and 6.

Table 9 displays pharmacokinetic parameters for neonates in Cohort 2 at birth and at 2 weeks of age. Elimination of raltegravir in vivo in human is primarily through the UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation pathway. UGT1A1 catalytic activity is negligible at birth and matures after birth. The dose recommended for neonates less than 4 weeks of age takes into consideration the rapidly increasing UGT1A1 activity and drug clearance from birth to 4 weeks of age.

## Elderly

There was no clinically meaningful effect of age on raltegravir pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and patients with HIV-1 inf ection, over the age range studied (19 to 84 years, with few individuals over the age of 65).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Gender, race and BMI

There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to gender, race or body mass index (BMI) in adults.

## Renal impairment

Renal clearance of unchanged medicinal product is a minor pathway of elimination. In adults, there were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with severe renal insufficiency and healthy subjects (see section 4.2). Because the extent to which raltegravir may be dialysable is unknown, dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided.

## Hepatic impairment

Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver. In adults, there were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency and healthy subjects. The effect of severe hepatic insuff iciency on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical toxicology studies, including conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity and juvenile toxicity, have been conducted with raltegravir in mice, rats, dogs and rabbits. Ef fects at exposure levels suff iciently in excess of clinical exposure levels indicate no special hazard for humans.

## Mutagenicity

No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis (Ames) tests, in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration studies.

## Carcinogenicity

A carcinogenicity study of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential. At the highest dose levels, 400 mg/kg/day in females and 250 mg/kg/day in males, systemic exposure was similar to that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. In rats, tumours (squamous cell carcinoma) of the nose/nasopharynx were identified at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day in females and at 300 mg/kg/day in males. This neoplasia could result from local deposition and/or aspiration of drug on the mucosa of the nose/nasopharynx during oral gavage dosing and subsequent chronic irritation and inflammation; it is likely that it is of  limited relevance f or the intended clinical use. At the NOAEL, systemic exposure was similar to that at the clinical dose of 400 mg twice daily. Standard genotoxicity studies to evaluate mutagenicity and clastogenicity were negative.

## Developmental toxicity

Raltegravir was not teratogenic in developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A slight increase in incidence of supernumerary ribs, a variant in the normal developmental process, was observed in rat foetuses of dams exposed to raltegravir at approximately 4.4-fold human exposure at 400 mg twice daily based on AUC0-24 hr. No development effects were seen at 3.4-fold human exposure at 400 mg twice daily based on AUC0-24 hr. Similar f indings were not observed in rabbits.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you.

If you are the parent of a child taking Isentress, please read this information carefully with your child.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- This medicine has been prescribed for you or your child only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side ef f ects not listed in this leaf let. See section 4.

1. What Isentress is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you take Isentress
3. How to take Isentress
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Isentress
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Isentress is and what it is used for

## What Isentress is

Isentress contains the active substance raltegravir. Isentress is an antiviral medicine that works against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

## How Isentress works

The virus produces an enzyme called HIV integrase. This helps the virus to multiply in the cells in your body. Isentress stops this enzyme from working. When used with other medicines, Isentress may reduce the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your \"viral load\") and increase your CD4-cell count (a type of white blood cells that plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system to help fight infection). Reducing the amount of HIV in the blood may improve the functioning of your immune system. This means your body may fight infection better.

## When Isentress should be used

Isentress is used to treat those who are inf ected by HIV. Your doctor has prescribed Isentress to help control your HIV infection.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Isentress

## Do not take Isentress:

- If you are allergic to raltegravir or to any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in section 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

## Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Isentress.

Remember that Isentress is not a cure for HIV infection. This means that you may keep getting infections or other illnesses associated with HIV. You should keep seeing your doctor regularly while taking this medicine.

## Mental health problems

Tell your doctor if you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. Depression, including suicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly in patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness.

## Bone problems

Some patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe reduction of the activity of the immune system, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stif fness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and dif ficulty in movement. If you notice any of  these symptoms, please inform your doctor.

## Liver problems

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is bef ore deciding if  you can take this medicine.

## Infections

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection, such as fever, and/or f eeling unwell. In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic inf ection, signs and symptoms of inf lammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to f ight inf ections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.

In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

## Muscle problems

Contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness while taking this medicine.

## Skin problems

Contact your doctor promptly if you develop a rash. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions and allergic reactions have been reported in some patients taking this medicine.

## Other medicines and Isentress

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines with or without a prescription.

Isentress might interact with other medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take:

- antacids (an agent that counteracts or neutralises the acid in the stomach to relieve indigestion and heartburn). It is not recommended to take Isentress with certain antacids (those containing aluminium and/or magnesium). Talk to your doctor about other antacids you can take.
- iron salts (to treat and prevent iron def iciency or anemia). You should wait at least two hours between taking iron salts and taking Isentress, as these medicines may reduce Isentress ef ficacy.
- rif ampicin (a medicine used to treat some infections such as tuberculosis), as it may decrease your levels of Isentress. Your doctor may consider increasing your dose of Isentress if you are taking rif ampicin.

## Taking Isentress with food and drink

See section 3.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

- Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk.
- If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.

Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant or breast-f eeding.

## Driving and using machines

Do not operate machines, drive or cycle if you feel dizzy af ter taking this medicine.

## Isentress contains lactose

This medicine contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.

## Isentress contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

## 3. How to take Isentress

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You should check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. Isentress must be used in combination with other medicines for HIV.

## How much to take Adults

The recommended dose is 1 tablet (400 mg) by mouth twice a day.

## Use in children and adolescents

The recommended dose of Isentress is 400 mg by mouth, twice a day for adolescents and children weighing at least 25 kg.

Do not chew, crush or split the tablets because it may change the level of medicine in your body. This medicine can be taken with or without food or drink.

Isentress is also available in a 600 mg tablet, a chewable tablet and in granules for oral suspension. Do not switch between the 400 mg tablet, the 600 mg tablet, chewable tablet or granules for oral suspension without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you take more Isentress than you should

Do not take more tablets than the doctor recommends. If you do take too many tablets, contact your doctor.

## If you forget to take Isentress

- If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it.
- However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule.
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

## If you stop taking Isentress

It is important that you take Isentress exactly as your doctor has instructed. Do not change the dose or stop taking this medicine without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Do not stop taking it because:

- It is very important to take all your HIV medicines as prescribed and at the right times of day. This can help your medicines work better. It also lowers the chance that your medicines will stop being able to f ight HIV (also called \"drug resistance\").
- When your supply of Isentress starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacy. This is because it is very important not to be without the medicine, even for a short time. During a short break in taking the medicine the amount of virus in your blood may increase. This may mean that the HIV virus will develop resistance to Isentress and become harder to treat.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## 1. What Isentress is and what it is used for

## What Isentress is

Isentress contains the active substance raltegravir. Isentress is an antiviral medicine that works against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

## How Isentress works

The virus produces an enzyme called HIV integrase. This helps the virus to multiply in the cells in your body. Isentress stops this enzyme from working. When used with other medicines, Isentress may reduce the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your \"viral load\") and increase your CD4-cell count (a type of white blood cells that plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system to help fight infection). Reducing the amount of HIV in the blood may improve the functioning of your immune system. This means your body may fight infection better.

## When Isentress should be used

Isentress 600 mg f ilm-coated tablets is used to treat adults and paediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg who are infected by HIV. Your doctor has prescribed Isentress to help control your HIV infection.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Isentress

## Do not take Isentress:

- If you are allergic to raltegravir or to any of the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in section 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Isentress.

Remember that Isentress is not a cure for HIV infection. This means that you may keep getting infections or other illnesses associated with HIV. You should keep seeing your doctor regularly while taking this medicine.

## Mental health problems

Tell your doctor if you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. Depression, including suicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly in patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness.

## Bone problems

Some patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe reduction of the activity of the immune system, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors f or developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stif fness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and dif ficulty in movement. If you notice any of  these symptoms, please inform your doctor.

## Liver problems

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is bef ore deciding if  you can take this medicine.

## Infections

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection, such as fever, and/or f eeling unwell. In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic inf ection, signs and symptoms of inf lammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to f ight inf ections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.

In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

## Muscle problems

Contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness while taking this medicine.

## Skin problems

Contact your doctor promptly if you develop a rash. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions and allergic reactions have been reported in some patients taking this medicine.

## Other medicines and Isentress

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

Isentress might interact with other medicines. Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take:

- antacids (an agent that counteracts or neutralises the acid in the stomach to relieve indigestion and heartburn)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- iron salts (to treat and prevent iron def iciency or anemia). You should wait at least two hours between taking iron salts and taking Isentress, as these medicines may reduce Isentress ef ficacy
- atazanavir (an antiretroviral medication)
- rif ampicin (a medicine used to treat some infections such as tuberculosis)
- tipranavir/ritonavir (antiretroviral medicines)

Keep a list of all your medicines to show your doctor and pharmacist.

- You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of medicines that interact with Isentress.
- Do not start taking a new medicine without telling your doctor. Your doctor can tell you if  it is safe to take Isentress with other medicines.

## Taking Isentress with food and drink

See section 3.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If  you are pregnant or breast-f eeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

- Isentress 1,200 mg (two 600 mg tablets once daily) is not recommended in pregnancy because it has not been studied in pregnant women.
- Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk.
- If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.

Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant or breast-f eeding.

## Driving and using machines

Do not operate machines, drive or cycle if you feel dizzy af ter taking this medicine.

## Isentress contains lactose

This medicine contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.

## Isentress contains sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ' sodium-free ' .

## 3. How to take Isentress

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You should check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. Isentress must be used in combination with other medicines for HIV.

## How much to take

## Adults, children and adolescents weighing at least 40 kg

The recommended dose is 1,200 mg taken as two 600 mg tablets taken by mouth once a day.

Do not chew, crush or split the tablets because it may change the level of medicine in your body. This medicine can be taken with or without food or drink.

Isentress is also available in a 400 mg tablet, a chewable tablet and in granules for oral suspension. Do not switch between the 600 mg tablet, 400 mg tablet, chewable tablet or granules for oral suspension without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you take more Isentress than you should

Do not take more tablets than the doctor recommends. If you do take too many tablets, contact your doctor.

## If you forget to take Isentress

- If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it.
- However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule.
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

## If you stop taking Isentress

It is important that you take Isentress exactly as your doctor has instructed. Do not change the dose or stop taking this medicine without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Do not stop taking it because:

- It is very important to take all your HIV medicines as prescribed and at the right times of day. This can help your medicines work better. It also lowers the chance that your medicines will stop being able to f ight HIV (also called \"drug resistance\").
- When your supply of Isentress starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacy. This is because it is very important not to be without the medicine, even for a short time. During a short break in taking the medicine the amount of virus in your blood may increase. This may mean that the HIV virus will develop resistance to Isentress and become harder to treat.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## If you forget to take Isentress

- If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it.
- However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule.
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

## If you stop taking Isentress

It is important that you take Isentress exactly as your doctor has instructed. Do not change the dose or stop taking this medicine without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Do not stop taking it because:

- It is very important to take all your HIV medicines as prescribed and at the right times of day. This can help your medicines work better. It also lowers the chance that your medicines will stop being able to f ight HIV (also called \"drug resistance\").
- When your supply of Isentress starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacy. This is because it is very important not to be without the medicine, even for a short time. During a short break in taking the medicine the amount of virus in your blood may increase. This may mean that the HIV virus will develop resistance to Isentress and become harder to treat.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## Isentress 100 mg granules for oral suspension

## raltegravir

If you are the parent or carer of a child taking Isentress, please read this information carefully. Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start giving this medicine to your child because it contains important information.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaf let. See section 4.

3. How to take Isentress

## 1. What Isentress is and what it is used for

## What Isentress is

Isentress contains the active substance raltegravir. Isentress is an antiviral medicine that works against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

## How Isentress works

The virus produces an enzyme called HIV integrase. This helps the virus to multiply in the cells in your body. Isentress stops this enzyme from working. When used with other medicines, Isentress may reduce the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your \"viral load\") and increase your CD4-cell count (a type of white blood cells that plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system to help fight infection). Reducing the amount of HIV in the blood may improve the functioning of your immune system. This means your body may fight infection better.

## When Isentress should be used

Isentress is used to treat adults, adolescents, children, toddlers and infants who are inf ected by HIV and to treat newborn babies exposed to HIV-1 infection from the mother. Your doctor has prescribed Isentress to help control your HIV infection.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Isentress

## Do not take Isentress

- If  you are allergic to raltegravir or to any of  the other ingredients in this medicine (listed in section 6.).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

## Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Isentress.

Remember that Isentress is not a cure for HIV infection. This means that you may keep getting infections or other illnesses associated with HIV. You should keep seeing your doctor regularly while taking this medicine.

## Mental health problems

Tell your doctor if you have a history of depression or psychiatric illness. Depression, including suicidal thoughts and behaviours, has been reported in some patients taking this medicine, particularly in patients with a prior history of depression or psychiatric illness.

## Bone problems

Some patients taking combination anti-retroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination anti-retroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe reduction of  the activity of  the immune system, higher body mass index, among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stif fness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and dif ficulty in movement. If you notice any of  these symptoms, please inform your doctor.

## Liver problems

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have had problems with your liver before, including hepatitis B or C. Your doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is bef ore deciding if  you can take this medicine.

## Infections

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you notice any symptoms of infection, such as fever, and/or f eeling unwell. In some patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of opportunistic inf ection, signs and symptoms of inf lammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the bo dy to f ight inf ections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.

In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

## Muscle problems

Contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness while taking this medicine.

## Skin problems

Contact your doctor promptly if you develop a rash. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions and allergic reactions have been reported in some patients taking this medicine.

## Other medicines and Isentress

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines with or without a prescription.

Isentress might interact with other medicines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take:

- antacids (an agent that counteracts or neutralises the acid in the stomach to relieve indigestion and heartburn). It is not recommended to take Isentress with certain antacids (those containing aluminium and/or magnesium). Talk to your doctor about other antacids you can take.
- iron salts (to treat and prevent iron def iciency or anemia). You should wait at least two hours between taking iron salts and taking Isentress, as these medicines may reduce Isentress ef ficacy.
- rif ampicin (a medicine used to treat some infections such as tuberculosis), as it may decrease your levels of Isentress. Your doctor may consider increasing your dose of Isentress if you are taking rif ampicin.

## Taking Isentress with food and drink

See section 3.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

- Isentress granules for oral suspension are not recommended in pregnancy because they have not been studied in pregnant women.
- Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to the baby in breast milk.
- If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-f eeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.

Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine if you are pregnant or breast-f eeding.

## Driving and using machines

Do not operate machines, drive or cycle if you feel dizzy af ter taking this medicine.

## Isentress 100 mg granules for oral suspension contain fructose

This medicine contains fructose up to 0.5 mg in each sachet.

Fructose may damage teeth.

## Isentress 100 mg granules for suspension contain sorbitol

This medicine contains sorbitol (E 420) up to 1.5 mg in each sachet.

## Isentress 100 mg granules for suspension contain sucrose

This medicine contains up to 4.7 mg of sucrose in each sachet. Sucrose may be harmful to the teeth.

If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor before taking this medicine.

## Isentress 100 mg granules for suspension contain sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially 'sodi umfree'.

## 3. How to take Isentress

Always give this medicine to your child exactly as their doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You should check with your child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse if  you are not sure. Isentress  must be used in combination with other medicines for HIV.

- See the instructions for use in the booklet f or how to prepare and give a dose of Isentress. Keep the booklet and f ollow it each time you prepare the medicine. Bring this booklet to your child's appointments.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Make sure the doctor, pharmacist or nurse explains how to mix and give the right dose to your child.
- The granules need to be mixed with water before use. You must give to your child within 30 minutes of mixing.
- The dose will change over time. Make sure to follow the instructions of your doctor. The doctor will tell you if  and when to stop giving Isentress to your baby.

## How much to take

The doctor will work out the right dose of granules for oral suspension based on the age and weight of the inf ant or toddler. The doctor will tell you how much of the oral suspension the inf ant or toddler must take.

Your child can take this medicine with or without food or drink.

Isentress is also available in a 400 mg tablet, a 600 mg tablet and in a chewable tablet. Do not switch between the granules for oral suspension, chewable tablet, 600 mg tablet or 400 mg tablet without f irst talking  to your  child's doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Children should keep scheduled doctor's visits because their Isentress dosage should be adjusted as they get older, grow or gain weight. Their doctor may also want to prescribe the chewable tablet when they are able to chew a tablet.

## If you take more Isentress than you should

Do not take more Isentress than the doctor recommends. If you do take more than you should, contact your doctor.

## If you forget to take Isentress

- If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember it.
- However, if it is time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule.
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

## If you stop taking Isentress

It is important that you take Isentress exactly as your doctor has instructed. Do not change the dose or stop taking this medicine without first talking with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Do not stop taking it because:

- It is very important to take all your HIV medicines as prescribed and at the right times of day. This can help your medicines work better. It also lowers the chance that your medicines will stop being able to f ight HIV (also called \"drug resistance\").
- When your supply of Isentress starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacy. This is because it is very important not to be without the medicine, even for a short time. During a short break in taking the medicine the amount of virus in your blood may increase. This may mean that the HIV virus will develop resistance to Isentress and become harder to treat.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
