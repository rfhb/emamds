## 1. Introduction

The MAH has submitted a completed paediatric study; 3082B2-313-WW (B1831001); an open label study to evaluate prophylaxis treatment, and to characterise the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of B-domain deleted recombinant factor VIII albumin free in children with hemophilia A.

This study is being submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation (European Commission [EC]) No 1901/2006. The MAH plans to submit a type II variation Q1 2019 to update the ReFacto AF SmPC to include the safety data from this study once this Article 46 assessment has completed. The MAH will submit an RMP update as part of this type II variation, which will reflect the completion of studies 3082B2-313-WW (B1831001) and B1831007. This submission also fulfils MEA 116.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

Refacto (Moroctocog alfa) received its first regulatory approval on 13 April 1999 in the EU for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII [FVIII] deficiency).  Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) is appropriate for use in adults and children of all ages, including newborns.  Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) does not contain von Willebrand factor, and hence, is not indicated for the treatment of von Willebrand's disease.  Refacto AF (Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC)) was developed as a successor to Refacto (moroctocog alfa) in an effort to eliminate animal/human proteins from the manufacturing process of moroctocog alfa by making the product albumin free.  Refacto (Moroctocog alfa) is approved globally, but is no longer manufactured.

Study B1831001 was undertaken to fulfil a FDA commitment with the primary objective to compare annualised bleeding rate during on demand versus routine prophylaxis and the secondary objective to compare 2 regimens of prophylaxis with Xyntha, the US approved product. The difference between ReFacto AF and Xyntha is the analytical method used to calibrate the working potency standard that is used in the potency assay.  The standard for Xyntha has been calibrated using a one-stage assay, and the standard for ReFacto AF has been calibrated using a chromogenic substrate assay.  The 2 products are not interchangeable.

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted the final report for:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Study B1831001 an open label study to evaluate prophylaxis treatment, and to characterise the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of B-domain deleted recombinant factor VIII albumin free in children with hemophilia A.

For this study, 2 previous interim analysis clinical study reports, dated 07 November 2013 and 11 April 2016,  presented  snapshot  analyses  of  selected  data  collected  for  approximately  4  and  7  years, respectively, after initiation  of  study  enrollment.  The  first  interim  analysis  CSR  included  OD  therapy efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety data, collected for approximately 4 years after initiation of study enrollment. The analyses for these summaries were based on descriptive statistics, using a data cut-off  date  of  31  December  2012.  Moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC),  the  study  drug,  was  reported  as efficacious in the treatment of hemophilia A when used for the OD treatment of bleeding episodes in children under 6 years of age. The majority of the bleeding episodes (93.7%) were resolved with 1 or 2  infusions.  A  total  468  of  493  bleeding  episodes  (94.9%)  treated  with  study  drug  were  rated 'Excellent ' or 'Good ' in their response to initial treatment and 22 (4.5%) were rated as ' Moderate'. No new safety signal was observed. PK data were reported for 5 children aged 3.7 to 5.8 years.

The second interim analysis CSR included data on safety, efficacy, and OD therapy compared to RP, collected for approximately 7 years after initiation of study enrollment up to a data cut-off date of 26 June 2015. An analysis was performed for the primary efficacy endpoint, comparing the mean number of bleeds per year (annualized bleeding rates [ABRs]) while on OD therapy versus RP on the intent to treat  (ITT)  population.  Routine  prophylaxis  with  moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC)  was  reported  to  be efficacious  for  pediatric-aged  subjects  &lt;6  years  with  moderately  severe  to  severe  hemophilia  A, reducing  significantly  the  ABR  compared  to  OD  therapy  in  addition  to  demonstrating  efficacy  when used  as  an  OD  treatment.  No  new  safety  findings  were  reported  in  this  pediatric  hemophilia  A population.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study B1831001

Study B1831001 was an open label, multicentre study of Xyntha conducted at 42 sites in 17 countries worldwide between 11 December 2007 and 18 April 2018 in paediatric patients with moderately severe to severe haemophilia A.

The  primary  objective  was  to  compare  clinical  outcomes  during  periods  of  study  drug  prophylaxis treatment  versus  periods  of  On-demand  (OD)  therapy  in  paediatric  subjects  to  demonstrate  that moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis reduces annualized bleeding rate (ABR) relative to OD therapy in infants to children aged &lt;16 years with haemophilia A.

The  secondary  objectives  included  the  comparison  of  the  clinical  outcomes  of  a  high-  (ie,  25 international unit(s) [IU]/kg every other day [EOD]) versus low-frequency dosing (ie, 45 IU/kg twice a week [BIW]) schedule on the efficacy of study drug prophylaxis.  In addition, the study also evaluated the efficacy and safety of the drug in paediatric patients, including the characterisation of the incidence of  less  than  expected  therapeutic  effect  (LETE)  and  characterisation  of  the  PK  of  FVIII  following moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) administration to patients aged 6 months to &lt;16 years with haemophilia A.

## Overall study design

This  was  an  open  label,  multicentre  study  of  Xyntha  that  originally  planned  to  recruit  a  total  of approximately  72  paediatric  subjects  &lt;6  years  of  age  (&lt;16  years  after  Amendment  10)  with moderately severe to severe haemophilia A (confirmed Factor VIII activity in plasma [FVIII:C] ≤2% by both the local laboratory and the central laboratory at screening) at approximately 40 sites.

The study was conducted in two 6-to-12 month segments (Segment 1 and Segment 2); 2 cohorts were enrolled: the OD cohort included subjects who practised OD therapy for Segment 1 followed by RP for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Segment 2, and the RP cohort included subjects who practised RP for both segments.  Segment 1 for the OD cohort was 12 months for subjects enrolled prior to Amendment 7 (dated 31 August 2011), and 6 months in duration for subjects enrolled after this.  When a bleed occurred for a subject in the OD cohort during Segment 1, study drug was to be administered at a dose and frequency prescribed by the investigator as per local standard of care, based on the recommendation for OD treatment with the licensed product Xyntha.

Figure 1.Study Overview

For the OD cohort, study drug in Segment 2 was administered at the doses and frequencies defined by Regimen B only (25 ± 5 IU/kg EOD).  For the RP subjects, each segment was 12 months in duration. Subjects in the RP cohort were randomised to receive low frequency Regimen A (45 ± 5 IU/kg BIW) followed  by  high  frequency  Regimen  B  (25  ±  5  IU/kg  EOD)  (prophylaxis  sequence  received  during Segments  1  and  2:  the  low-  followed  by  the  high  frequency  dosing  sequence  [AB]),  or  vice  versa (Regimen  B  followed  by  Regimen  A;  prophylaxis  sequence  received  during  Segments  1  and  2:  the high- followed by the low frequency dosing sequence [BA]).  Randomisation to prophylaxis treatment was stratified by haemophilia A severity: FVIII:C &lt;1% or 1% to 2% (according to central laboratory screening result).  There was no active control group in this study.

A subset of severe (FVIII:C ≤1% confirmed by the central laboratory screening test) haemophilia A subjects  could  participate  in  assessments  to  characterise  the  PK  of  FVIII:C  after  administration  of study drug.  Subjects who were eligible and opted to participate underwent a PK assessment, after receiving a single open-label dose (50 ± 5 IU/kg rounded to the nearest complete vial) over 2 minutes, with blood sampled for FVIII:C measurements before and at 0.5 hour, 8, 24, 28 (optional), and 32 hours after the start of the infusion.

## Selection of Study Population

The subjects were considered eligible for enrolment into the study only when they met all the inclusion criteria outlined in the protocol.

The eligible subjects for screening included previously treated male subjects (≥20 exposure days [EDs] to  any  FVIII  replacement product) aged 6 months to &lt;16 years at the time of Screening Visit with moderately severe to severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C ≤2%) by both the local laboratory and the central

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

laboratory.  The subjects were to have a medical history negative for past FVIII inhibitor.  In addition, subjects had to have a FVIII:C of ≤1% confirmed by the central laboratory screening test to be eligible for PK assessments.

## Statistical Considerations for the Determination of Sample Size

Approximately 72 subjects were originally planned  to be enrolled in this  study at approximately 40 sites.  Subjects withdrawn from the study were not replaced, regardless of the reason for withdrawal. Twenty four (24) subjects in the OD cohort were planned to contribute to the comparison of ABR in the OD versus RP treatment settings; 48 subjects in the RP cohort were planned for the comparison of ABR in the 2 prophylaxis regimens (A and B).  After the sample size re-estimation described in Amendment 10,  planned  enrolment  for  the  RP  cohort  was  revised  to  56  subjects  (6  months  to  &lt;16  years), considering the subjects from Site 010 who were excluded from the analyses (allowing for an attrition rate of 30% [38 subjects)].  From the planned total of 72 subjects, a subset of approximately 23 PK subjects  (meeting  specific  criteria)  was  planned  for  PK  assessments  for  the  objective  of  PK characterisation of FVIII:C.

Due to serious breaches of Good Clinical Practice compliance pertaining to data integrity at Site 010, data for 15 subjects at this site were presented separately to those of subjects from other study sites. Data from this site were excluded from safety, efficacy and baseline summary data (but included for protocol deviations and recovery/PK data and inhibitor incidence.

## Subject Disposition and Demography

A total of 71 subjects were screened, and 51 subjects (excluding Site 010 in Poland) were enrolled into this study and included in the intent to treat (ITT) population.  A total of 50 subjects were included in the modified intent to treat (mITT) population; 1 subject enrolled in the OD cohort did not receive any study  drug.    A  total  of  41  (80.4%)  subjects  completed  the  study,  and  10  (19.6%)  subjects discontinued the study early; the most common reason for discontinuation  was adverse event (AE) (9.8%).    The  complete  details  about  the  disposition  of  the  enrolled  subjects  are  present  in  CSR B1831001.

Demographic and other baseline characteristics for all subjects dosed in the study are presented in Table 1.  All subjects were male.  The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age (range) was 4.65 ± 1.99 years (1.1 12.7 years).  The majority of subjects (84.3%) were aged between 2 and 6 years, were white (78.4%) and of non Hispanic and non Latino ethnicity (86.3%).  The mean ± SD height was 107.45  ±  13.31  cm,  and  mean  ±  SD  weight  was  18.74  ±  5.44  kg  for  all  subjects.    Similar characteristics were observed for the subjects in the RP and OD cohorts.

All 7 subjects with PK data available, and included in the PK analysis, were younger than 6 years of age (including 1 subject from Site 010).

## Medical History (ITT Population)

While enrollment eligibility allowed for subjects with based FVIII activity of &lt;2%, all subjects enrolled were  classified  as  having  severe  hemophilia,  ie,  with  &lt;1%  FVIII  activity  level  at  screening.  Most subjects  had  a  life  time  exposure  to  FVIII  of  &gt;50  days;  5  subjects  had  between  20  and  50  prior exposure dates. The mean ( ± SD) total number of bleeds in the last 12 months was 9.1 ± 14.3. A total of 20 (39.2%) subjects had a target joint involvement bleed. The most commonly (&gt;20%) reported medical history by System Organ Class (SOC) was Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (11 [21.6%] subjects) (Table 14.1.4) . Other SOCs reported for &gt;10% of subjects were Gastrointestinal disorders, Injury, poisoning and procedural complications, and Vascular disorders (each reported for 6 [11.8%] subjects).

## Efficacy, Safety Including Immunogenicity and Pharmacokinetic Evaluations

The measures of PK and safety in this study were standard measurements, widely used and generally recognised as reliable, accurate, and relevant.  The safety measurements recorded in this clinical study were those employed in most clinical studies, including the recording of AEs coded in accordance with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities.

Inhibitor development was monitored as part of ongoing safety surveillance by the sponsor to ensure that subjects treated with study drug had an acceptable rate of inhibitor development.  The study had testing for inhibitor development at a frequency consistent with commonly accepted standard of care practice in the usual clinical setting.

## RESULTS

## Pharmacokinetic Evaluations

The optional PK assessment occurred at the beginning of the study (Visit 2), before subjects initiated moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) treatment. Blood samples were collected at time 0 (prior to the dose) and then  0.5  hour,  8,  24,  28  (optional  time  point)  and  32 hours  after  the  start  of  the  infusion.  Plasma samples were analysed for FVIII  activity  and  FVIII  inhibitor  at  Covance  Laboratories  Inc  (Chantilly, Virginia, USA) using validated, sensitive and specific analytical one-stage coagulation assays.

## Immunogenicity - FVIII Inhibitors

Incidence of FVIII inhibitors was monitored throughout the duration of this study.  Due to technical issues with the inhibitor assay at the Covance Central Laboratory Services in Chantilly, VA, testing of FVIII inhibitors needed to be transferred to a new laboratory, Esoterix/Labcorp Inc (Denver, CO). In addition,  serum  samples  were  collected  and  tested  for  anti-FVIII  antibodies,  antibodies  to  Chinese hamster ovary, and antibodies to the affinity ligand used in the study drug purification process (TN8.2) using validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods.  The samples were analysed by Covance (Chantilly, VA).

## Overview of Clinical Pharmacology

The PK parameters for FVIII activity were calculated for each subject using noncompartmental analysis of plasma concentration-time for FVIII activity data.

## Pharmacokinetics Results

Median  and  mean  plasma  concentration-time  profiles  for  FVIII  activity  following  a  single  dose  of 50 IU/kg of Xyntha are presented in figure 2 and 3.  PK parameters are summarised descriptively in Table 19.

## Pharmacokinetic Conclusions

The PK analysis of FVIII activity data for 5 of the 7 subjects  included in this study was reported to the FDA in a previously completed interim analysis and is included in the US Package Insert.  The data from the full study were re-analysed using current Pfizer processes and standards and results obtained were similar. PK analyses demonstrated that geometric mean clearance and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) were 5.822 mL/h/kg and 78.38 mL/kg, respectively.  Mean t½ was about 8.9 hours. Geometric mean incremental recovery was 1.248 IU/dL/IU/kg.

## Efficacy Evaluation

## Primary Efficacy Endpoints

## Annualised Bleed Rate (On-Demand Cohort)

The estimate of the ABR (± standard error [SE]) for the OD cohort (ITT population) during the RP regimen (Regimen B [25 IU/kg EOD]) was 1.76 ± 0.798 and was significantly lower (p = 0.0040) than the estimate for the ABR (± SE) for OD therapy of 47.02 ± 10.749 using a linear mixed-effects model ( Table 3).  A supportive analysis was performed, using the paired t-test (p = 0.0020), based on the within-subject  change  in  ABR  for  the  8 subjects  who  were  evaluated  with  both  OD  and  RP  dosing during the study.  The difference between the 2 treatment regimens, though not tested, was similar to that observed for the PP population, with or without washout data.

In addition, a 1-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of the arithmetic means for ABR during the RP regimen over the ABR during OD therapy in the ITT population was calculated.  The 1-sided 95% upper confidence bound was 0.08, which is &lt;0.5 indicating that the ABR during the RP regimen was at least 50% lower than that observed during OD therapy.  The ratio and corresponding 1-sided 95% CI are presented in Table 3.

Of the 3 categories of bleeding location (joint, soft tissue/muscle, other), bleeding episodes occurred slightly more frequently in soft tissue/muscle during the RP regimen and occurred most frequently in joints  during  OD  therapy.    The  RP-B  regimen  resulted  in  a  mean (±  SD)  ABR  for  joint  bleeding episodes of 0.5 ± 1.3 (median: 0.0), OD therapy resulted in a mean (± SD) ABR for joint bleeding episodes  of  26.2±21.1  (median: 17.5).    The  mean  (±SD)  ABR  for  soft  tissue/muscle  bleeds  was 0.7±1.1 (median: 0.0) during the RP-B regimen and 21.2±15.3 (median: 16.5) during OD therapy.  A similar outcome was also observed for the PP population, with or without washout data.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

## Annualised Bleed Rate of High- Versus Low-Frequency Prophylaxis (RP Cohort)

Table 4  presents  the  summary  statistics  for  the  analysis  of  ABR  for  the  RP  cohort  (ITT  population). The 90% 2-sided CI for the mean difference in ABRs for the 2 prophylactic regimens demonstrated equivalence for subjects in the ITT population, that is, the limits of the 90% CI were wholly within the prospectively defined equivalence limit of (-3, 3) bleeds per year. Sensitivity analyses that estimated the treatment effect and its 95% 2-sided CI obtained from a mixed-effect model were supportive of the results of the equivalence CI results.

## Other Efficacy Endpoints

## Number of Infusions Used to Treat Each Bleeding Episode (ITT Population)

A total of 838 OD infusions were administered to treat the 562 bleeding episodes with a unique start date and time.  The majority of bleeding episodes (76.5%) resolved with 1 infusion.

## Response to On-Demand Treatment for All Bleeding Episodes (ITT Population)

Of the 559 first infusions in 38 subjects for bleeding episodes that were treated initially with a FVIII OD infusion, 555 had responses recorded according to the 4-point OD Haemostasis Efficacy Rating Scale. Most bleeds treated (&gt;90%) had 'excellent' or 'good' responses to the first infusion.  The majority (&gt;60%) of the 279 follow-up infusions (in 31 subjects) had 'excellent' or 'good' responses. Of 279 follow-up infusions, 20 had no response data recorded.  All 20 of these were in 2 subjects and were infusions of non-study FVIII and therefore were not required to record a response.

## Incidence of Less Than Expected Therapeutic Effect (ITT Population)

There  were  no  occurrences  of  LETE  in  the  OD  or  recovery  setting.    In  the  prophylaxis  setting,  7 subjects  were  identified  as  having  spontaneous  bleeding  episodes  within  48 hours  after  a  regularly scheduled prophylaxis dose of study drug with no confounding factors (the criteria for LETE); 5 (9.8%) subjects  had  a  bleeding  episode  during  Regimen  B,  and  3 (7.1%)  subjects  had  a  bleeding  episode during Regimen A (1 subject had a bleeding episode in both Regimen A and Regimen B).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Out of 561 bleeding episodes with a unique start date and time that were treated with study drug, no bleeds met LETE criteria in the OD setting since there were no bleeds that failed to have a response to 2 successive OD infusions; the observed incidence rate of LETE was 0.0%.  Out of a total of 10,927 RP infusions, 18 bleeding episodes met the criteria for LETE in the prophylaxis setting, and the observed incidence  rate  of  LETE  was  0.16%.    No  occurrences  of  LETE  low  recovery  were  reported  following infusion of study drug, and a similar outcome was observed for the EE population.

## Consumption of Moroctocog Alfa (AF-CC) (ITT Population)

The cumulative total number of RP infusions was 10,899 including 3533 during Regimen A and 7366 during Regimen B.

Number of Spontaneous Bleeds and Time to Spontaneous Bleeds During the Prophylaxis Period (ITT Population)

During Regimen A (45 IU/kg BIW), 4 subjects experienced a mean (± SD) of 1.3 ± 0.50 spontaneous bleeding  episodes  within  48 hours  of  a  previous  RP  infusion.    During  Regimen B  (25 IU/kg  EOD), 6 subjects experienced a mean (± SD) of 1.3 ± 0.52 spontaneous bleeding episodes within 48 hours of a previous RP infusion.  A similar outcome was also observed for the EE population.

## Compliance to Prophylaxis Regimen

Most subjects received a  total  actual  number  of  infusions  within ± 20% of the expected number of infusions  (98.0%)  and  had  an  actual  mean  exposure  within ± 20% of the expected mean exposure (84.0%).  Eight (8) subjects had an actual mean exposure that was not within ± 20% of the expected mean exposure (2 in the OD cohort and 6 in the RP cohort).  In the OD cohort during RP regimen B (25 IU/kg EOD), 2 subjects received total doses which were outside their expected doses: 1 subject received  a  total  dose  of  3141.9 IU/kg  which  was  below  the  expected  dose  of  4062.5 IU/kg  and  1 subject  (001504)  received  a  total  dose  of  5243.6 IU/kg  which  was  above  the  expected  dose  of 4287.5 IU/kg.

The  number  (%)  of  subjects  requiring  prophylaxis  regimen  escalation  during  protocol-defined prophylaxis is provided for the ITT and EE populations.  In the ITT population, a total of 3 subjects (2 during Regimen  A  and  1 during  Regimen  B)  required  intensification of their protocol-defined prophylaxis regimen.  Results were similar in the EE population .

## Efficacy Conclusions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The estimate of the ABR for the OD cohort (ITT population) during the RP regimen (25 IU/kg EOD) was significantly lower than the estimate for the ABR for OD therapy using a linear mixed-effects model (mean ABRs [± SE] were 1.76 ± 0.798 and 47.02 ± 10.749, respectively; p = 0.0040).  This result was supported by a paired t-test based on the within-subject change in ABR for the 8 subjects who were evaluated with both OD and RP dosing during the study (p = 0.0020) and a 1-sided 95% upper confidence bound of 0.08 for the ratio of the arithmetic means for ABR during the RP regimen over the ABR during OD therapy (a ratio of &lt;0.5 indicates the ABR during the RP regimen was at least 50% lower  than  that  observed  during  OD  therapy).  These  results  are  similar  and  support  the  same conclusions for prophylaxis as in the second interim CSR.

For  the  OD  cohort  (ITT  population),  the  majority  of  bleeding  episodes  during  OD  therapy  were traumatic events. The mean ( ± SD) ABR for traumatic bleeds was lower during the RP-B (25 IU/kg EOD) regimen (0.8 ± 1.3 [median: 0.0]) than for OD therapy (37.9 ± 31.6 [median: 31.8]).

In the RP cohort, the 90% 2-sided CI for the mean difference in ABRs for the 2 prophylaxis regimens demonstrated equivalence for subjects in the ITT population (the limits of the 90% CI fell wholly within the prospectively defined equivalence limit of [ -3, 3] bleeds per year).

Sensitivity  analyses  that  estimated  the  treatment  effect  and  its  95%  2-sided  CI  obtained  from  a mixed-effect model were supportive of the results of the equivalence CI results.

A total of 838 OD infusions were administered to treat the 562 bleeding episodes with a unique start date and time. The majority of bleeding episodes (76.5%) resolved with 1 infusion. Of the 559 first infusions in 38 subjects for bleeding episodes that were treated initially with a FVIII OD infusion, 555 had responses recorded according to the 4-point On-Demand Hemostasis Efficacy Rating Scale. Most bleeds treated with the first infusion (&gt;90%) had ' excellent ' or ' good ' responses. The majority (&gt;60%) of the 279 follow-up infusions (in 31 subjects) had ' excellent ' or ' good ' responses.

There were no occurrences of LETE in the OD or recovery setting. In the prophylaxis setting, 7 subjects were identified as having spontaneous bleeding episodes within 48 hours after a regularly scheduled prophylaxis dose of study drug with no confounding factors (the criteria for LETE); 5 (9.8%) subjects had  a  bleeding  episode  during  Regimen  B  and  3  (7.1%)  subjects  had  a  bleeding  episode  during Regimen  A  (1  subject  had  a  bleeding  episode  in  both  Regimen  A  and  Regimen  B).  Eighteen  (18) bleeding episodes met the criteria for LETE in the prophylaxis setting and the observed incidence rate of LETE was 0.16%.

The cumulative total number of RP infusions was 10899 including 3533 during Regimen A and 7366 during Regimen B (including both cohorts). Most subjects received a total actual number of infusions within ±20% of the expected number of infusions (98.0%) and had an actual mean exposure within ±20% of the expected mean exposure (84.0%).

## SAFETY EVALUATION

All safety analyses were performed on the ITT analysis population; additionally AEs, laboratory data, and the incidence of inhibitor development were performed on the mITT population.  Safety data were presented for all subjects (OD and RP) combined.  Safety outcome measures included the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and non-SAEs.  Any subject who received at least 1 dose of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) after the informed consent document/assent form had been signed was included in the evaluation  for  safety  in  the  final  CSR.    Information  was  also  collected  on  the  development  of  FVIII inhibitors.  Subject withdrawal for safety reasons was at the discretion of the investigator and treating physicians.

## Treatment emergent events

A total of 49 (98.0%) subjects in the mITT population reported 549 non-haemophilia related TEAEs. The most commonly reported (≥50% of subjects) non-haemophilia related TEAEs by System Organ Class  (SOC)  were  in  the  infections  and  infestations,  general  disorders  and  administration  site conditions, injury, poisoning and procedural complications, and gastrointestinal disorders.  The most commonly reported (&gt;20%) preferred terms were pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, cough and nasopharyngitis.

A total of 15 (30.0%) subjects in the mITT population reported at least 1 TEAE related to haemophilia. The most commonly  reported (&gt;25%  of subjects) haemophilia related TEAEs were in the Musculoskeletal and connective tissues disorders SOC and included the PTs of Pain in extremity and Haemarthrosis.  Other treatment emergent haemophilia related events were each reported by ≤5% subjects.   A total  of  6  subjects  experienced  a  drug  related  TEAE:  3  subjects  had  FVIII  inhibition,  1 subject  had  aminotransferase  increased,  1  subject  had  joint  injury,  and  1  subject  had  drug hypersensitivity and pyrexia.

The majority of TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity and no life threatening TEAEs were reported. Mild and moderate TEAEs were most commonly reported in the Infections and infestations SOC.  The most  commonly  reported  (&gt;20%  of  subjects)  mild  TEAEs  were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection, pyrexia, and cough.  The most commonly reported (&gt;20% of subjects) moderate TEAE was pyrexia. Severe TEAEs were reported for 8 subjects and were distributed around SOCs; only 1 of the severe TEAEs was reported for &gt;1 subject (FVIII inhibition, 2 subjects [4.0%]).  The other severe TEAEs (PTs) were  Varicella,  Device  related  infection,  Pyrexia,  Catheter  site  rash,  Post  procedural  haemorrhage, Haemarthrosis, Muscle spasms, Torticollis, Monoplegia, Seizure, Drug hypersensitivity and Haematoma.

## Serious Adverse Events

A total of 15 (30.0%) subjects reported a total of 30 SAEs.  With the exception of FVIII inhibition (4 [8.0%] subjects), each PT was experienced by ≤2 subjects.  All 4 subjects (including the 1 subject with inhibitor detected pre-study treatment) with FVIII inhibition were discontinued from the study as PP.  A further subject was discontinued due to drug hypersensitivity.

## Factor VIII Inhibitor Development

Investigators reported all FVIII inhibitors in the same expedited manner as outlined for SAEs.

Subjects who developed a confirmed FVIII inhibitor on the study were to be withdrawn from the study after  completion  of  the  procedures  described  in  the  protocol.    Of  the  50  subjects  exposed  to moroctocog alfa (AF-CC), 4 subjects tested positive for FVIII inhibitors.  All 4 subjects were withdrawn from the study and considered as SAEs.  For 1 of the 4 subjects, the FVIII inhibitor event occurred prior to receiving his first dose of study drug and was assessed as unrelated to treatment.  This subject had taken study drug for 19 EDs before the baseline results became available.  He was excluded from the  numerator  and  denominator  for  inhibitor  development  as  the  inhibitor  was  present  prior  to receiving study drug.

Of the 3 treatment-emergent, treatment-related FVIII inhibitor events (reported in subjects &lt;6 years of age), based on the absence of any clinical signs or symptoms along with negative inhibitor testing at an additional laboratory, 2 were classified by the sponsor as false positive inhibitors.  The third case reported a low titer, clinically silent FVIII inhibitor that resolved.  Further details of the 3 reports of positive FVIII inhibitor results are described below:

- Subject wmale subject with severe haemophilia A (FVIII activity ≤1%) had previously received both OD FVIII therapy and a FVIII RP regimen for a total of 35 EDs prior to entering the study. This subject was assigned to the prophylaxis cohort and received moroctocog alfa (AF CC) 25 IU/kg EOD during the first 12 months, and then switched to 45 IU/kg BIW for the remainder of the study.  Samples obtained during visit 3 (month 1) and visit 5 (month 3) reported positive values via central laboratory evaluation of 1.73 BU/mL and 0.89 BU/mL, respectively.  Based on these results the patient was withdrawn from the study.  A subsequent sample collected during the follow up visit and assayed at the central laboratory showed persistence of low titer FVIII  inhibitors  1.58  BU/mL  with  subsequent  sample  collection  reporting  negative  (&lt;0.6 BU/mL)  and  resolution  of  event.    There  were  no  concomitant  medications  taken  as  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

consequence  of  the  event  and  the  subject  did  not  experience  any  clinical  manifestations associated with the FVIII inhibition.  The investigator and the sponsor considered the event of FVIII inhibition to be related to moroctocog alfa (AF CC).

- Subject  male  subject  with  severe  hemophilia  A  (FVIII  activity  ≤1%)  had  previously  been treated  with  both  OD  FVIII  therapy  and  a  FVIII  RP  regimen  for  a  total  of  362  EDs  prior  to entering the study.  This subject was assigned to 45 IU/kg BIW during the first 12 months, and then switched to 25 IU/kg EOD for the remainder of the study.  A blood sample obtained during the visit 7 (month 6) reported positive (1.84 BU/mL).  A subsequent blood sample collected during month 9 was reported as positive (3.20 BU/mL) through central laboratory evaluation, however,  re-test  of  the  sample  reported  negative  (&lt;0.6  BU/mL)  for  FVIII  inhibitor.    The negative  result  was  similarly  reported  through  sample  analysis  at  a  second  laboratory.    A further 4 samples collected over an approximately 4 month period were reported as negative (&lt;0.6  BU/mL)  through  central  laboratory  evaluation.    The  subject  did  not  experience  any clinical manifestations of FVIII inhibitor.  The prophylaxis dose was not increased, no LETE was identified and the recovery assessment was reported normal.  In view of the totality of the data and  clinical  profile  of  the  subject,  the  sponsor  classified  this  as  a  'false  positive'  for  FVIII inhibitor development.
- Subject  male  subject  with  severe  haemophilia  A  (FVIII  activity ≤ 1%)  had  previously  been treated with a total of &gt;50 EDs prior to receiving the first dose of moroctocog alfa (AF CC). This subject was assigned to the prophylaxis cohort and received moroctocog alfa (AF CC) 25 IU/kg EOD during the first 12 months, and then switched to 45 IU/kg BIW for the remainder of the study.  A blood sample to test for FVIII inhibitors was obtained on Visit 5 (month 3) and reported as positive (1.61 BU/mL) and confirmed through sample re-test (2.11 BU/mL) via the central  laboratory.    The  sample  was  re-analysed  at  a  second  laboratory  and  was  reported negative  (&lt;0.6  BU/mL)  as  was  the  local  laboratory  result.    Three  (3)  subsequent  samples collected  across  a  period  of  approximately  5  months  reported  negative  through  central  and local  laboratory  testing.    The  investigator  and  the  sponsor  considered  FVIII  inhibition  was related to moroctocog alfa (AF-CC).  The subject did not experience any clinical manifestations of FVIII inhibitor.  Indeed the prophylaxis dose was not increased, no LETE was identified, and the recovery assessment report was normal.  In view of the totality of the data and clinical profile of the subject, the sponsor classified this event as a 'false positive' for FVIII inhibitor development.

## Vital Signs, Electrocardiogram, Physical Findings and Other Observations Related to Safety

No  clinically  significant  findings  were  reported  for  any  subject  related  to  vital  signs  and  based  on physical examination at ED 1.

## Safety Analyses Conclusions

Overall,  the  median  number  of  infusions  per  subject  was  262,  and  the  median  number  of  EDs  per subject was 261.

No new safety signals were observed for moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) during the course of this study.  The majority of TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity, and no life threatening TEAEs were reported. Severe TEAEs were reported for 8 subjects.  Serious TEAEs were reported for 15 (30.0%) subjects, of which  3  led  to  withdrawal  due  to  FVIII  inhibition  and  1  subject  withdrew  due  to  a  SAE  of  drug hypersensitivity.  A further subject was withdrawn due to FVIII inhibitor that was detected pre-study treatment.  No deaths were reported during the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Three (3) subjects had central laboratory confirmed inhibitor testing after beginning treatment with study drug.  Based on an absence of any clinical signs and symptoms and negative results with repeat inhibitor  assessment  of  the  same  samples  in  a  different  central  laboratory,  2  of  the  3  cases  were classified by the sponsor as false positive inhibitors.  The third case was a low titer, clinically silent FVIII inhibitor that resolved.  A fourth subject had a positive result for low titer FVIII inhibitor prior to receiving study drug.

Overall, the safety profile exhibited in the study would support treatment with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) in a haemophilia A paediatric population as being well tolerated with no new safety findings detected.

## Discussion and overall conclusions by the MAH

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC)  prophylaxis reduces the ABR relative to OD therapy in pediatric aged hemophilia A patients with baseline FVIII &lt;2%. The secondary objectives were to assess the effect of a high (25 IU/kg EOD) versus low (45 IU/kg  BIW)-frequency  dosing  schedule  on  the  efficacy  of  moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC)  prophylaxis,  to continue to characterize the PK of FVIII:C after administration of moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) in children  6 months to &lt;16 years of age with hemophilia A, and to describe moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) efficacy and safety in children, including characterization of the incidence of LETE. From Protocol Amendment 10,  enrollment  into  the  PK  assessment  was  optional  and  could  also  include children  aged  6  to  &lt;16 years; before this date only children aged 6 months to &lt;6 years were included in the study (for all assessments).

The primary objective of this study was met: the prophylaxis regimen at a dose of 25 IU/kg EOD was more efficacious as measured by ABR than OD treatment. This result is consistent with prior studies with  moroctocog  alfa  and  moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC)  and  shows  for  the  first  time  this  effect  with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) in a pediatric population. Additionally, ABR for prophylaxis at a dose of 45 IU/kg  BIW  was  shown  to  be  equivalent  compared  to  a  more  frequently  administered  prophylaxis regimen (25 IU/kg EOD), satisfying a secondary objective. This is the first study to demonstrate that a longer  interval  between  prophylactic  infusions  of  moroctocog  alfa  (AF-CC)  is  as  effective  as  more frequent dosing in a pediatric population. This offers  patients  with  hemophilia  A  a  treatment  option requiring  fewer  infusions,  thus  reducing  the  disease  burden,  which  could  correlate  to  greater compliance and a better quality of life. This is especially beneficial for pediatric patients in whom IV access can be challenging. Response to OD infusions for the treatment of bleeding episodes was similar to that seen in prior studies with moroctocog alfa and moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) with the majority of bleeding episodes responding to 2 or fewer infusions. FVIII recovery was similar to that seen in prior studies with young pediatric patients treated with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC). Rates of LETE were similar to those seen in prior studies.

A PK analysis of FVIII activity data for 5 of the 7 subjects included in this study was reported in a previously  completed  interim  analysis.  However,  the  data  were  reanalyzed  using  current  Pfizer processes and standards and the results were similar. Although Amendment 10 allowed children aged 6 to &lt;16 years to be enrolled in the study, none participated in the PK assessment.

No new safety signals emerged from this study. TEAEs were representative for the pediatric population that  was  studied.  One  subject  experienced  drug  hypersensitivity.  The  inhibitor  rate  was  6.12%; however, 2 of the 3 cases were deemed to be false positive. Overall, taking into consideration that 2 of the  cases  were  assessed  as  false  positive,  the  incidence  and  clinical  significance  of  FVIII  inhibition observed in this study is consistent with that seen in prior studies with PTPs with moroctocog alfa and moroctocog alfa (AF-CC).

Taken together, this study met its objectives and has shown that moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) is safe and efficacious in pediatric-aged subjects for both OD treatment and RP. Additionally, it has shown that RP

with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) is statistically more efficacious than an OD treatment regimen. The study also has shown for the first time that BIW prophylaxis infusions with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) are as efficacious as EOD prophylaxis infusions.

In conclusion the study demonstrated that moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) prophylaxis reduced ABRs relative to OD therapy, showed for the first time that BIW prophylaxis infusions with moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) were as efficacious as EOD prophylaxis infusions, and demonstrated the PK parameters observed in this study are similar to those observed in other studies of young patients (&lt;6 years) with hemophilia A. The study showed that Moroctocog alfa (AF-CC) is safe and efficacious in pediatric patients for both OD therapy and RP.

## 3. Overall conclusion and recommendation by the Rapporteur

The  MAH  has  submitted  the  final  CSR  for  the  completed  paediatric  study;  3082B2-313-WW (B1831001); an open label study to evaluate prophylaxis treatment, and to characterise the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of B-domain deleted recombinant factor VIII albumin free in children with hemophilia  A.  The  study  was  undertaken  to  fulfil  a  FDA  commitment  with  the  primary  objective  to compare  annualised  bleeding  rate  during  on  demand  versus  routine  prophylaxis  and  the  secondary objective to compare 2 regimens of prophylaxis with Xyntha, the US approved product. The difference between  ReFacto  AF  and  Xyntha  is  the  analytical  method  used  to  calibrate  the  working  potency standard that is used in the potency assay.  The standard for Xyntha has been calibrated using a onestage  assay,  and  the  standard  for  ReFacto  AF  has  been  calibrated  using  a  chromogenic  substrate assay.  The two products are not interchangeable.

It may be agreed that the results data support its objectives and has shown that Xyntha is safe and efficacious in paediatric-aged subjects for both OD treatment and RP.

No  new  safety  signals  emerged  from  this  study.    TEAEs  were  representative  for  the  paediatric population  that  was  studied.    The  MAH  plans  to  submit  a  type  II  variation  Q1  2019  to  update  the ReFacto  AF  SmPC  to  include  the  safety  data  from  this  study  once  this  Article  46  assessment  has completed. The MAH will submit an RMP update as part of this type II variation, which will reflect the completion of studies 3082B2-313-WW (B1831001) and B1831007. This submission also fulfils MEA 116.
