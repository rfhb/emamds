## ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Nevirapine Teva 200 mg tablets

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each tablet contains 200 mg of nevirapine (as anhydrous).

Excipient with known effect: Each tablet contains 168 mg of lactose (as monohydrate).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

<!-- image -->

For patients who are unable to swallow tablets or who weigh less than 50 kg or whose body surface area is below 1.25 m 2 according to the Mosteller formula, other nevirapine containing oral formulations are available and should be used if appropriate.

3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Tablet White, oval, biconvex tablets. One side is debossed with \"N\", a scoreline and \"200\". The opposite side is debossed with a scoreline. The score line is only to facilitate breaking for ease of swallowing and not to divide into equal doses. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Nevirapine Teva is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults, adolescents, and children of any age (see section 4.2). Most of the experience with nevirapine is in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The choice of a subsequent therapy after nevirapine should be based on clinical experience and resistance testing (see section 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Nevirapine Teva should be administered by physicians who are experienced in the  treatment of HIV infection. Posology Patients 16 years and older The recommended dose of Nevirapine Teva is one 200 mg tablet daily for the first 14 days (this leadin period should be used because it has been found to lessen the frequency of rash), followed by one 200 mg tablet twice daily, in combination with at least two additional antiretroviral agents. Medicinal product no longer authorised

If a dose is recognized as missed within 8 hours of when it was due, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible. If a dose is missed and it is more than 8 hours later, the patient should only take the next dose at the usual time.

## Dose management considerations

Patients experiencing rash during the 14-day lead-in period of 200 mg/day should not have their Nevirapine Teva dose increased until the rash has resolved. The isolated rash should be closely

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

monitored (see section 4.4). The 200 mg once daily dosing regimen should not be continued beyond 28 days at which point in time an alternative treatment should be sought due to the possible risk of underexposure and resistance.

Patients who interrupt nevirapine dosing for more than 7 days should restart the recommended dosing regimen using the two week lead-in period.

There are toxicities that require interruption of Nevirapine Teva therapy (see section 4.4).

## Special populations

## Elderly

Readministration to patients who previously had ASAT or ALAT &gt; 5 ULN during nevirapine therapy and had recurrence of liver function abnormalities upon readministration of nevirapine (see section 4.4).

Nevirapine has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65. Renal impairment For patients with renal dysfunction requiring dialysis an additional 200 mg dose of nevirapine following each dialysis treatment is recommended. Patients with CLcr ≥ 20 ml/min do not require a dose adjustment, see section 5.2. Hepatic impairment Nevirapine should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, see section 4.3). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Paediatric population Nevirapine Teva 200 mg tablets, following the dosing schedule described above, are suitable for larger children, particularly adolescents, below the age of 16 who weigh more than 50 kg or whose body surface area is above 1.25 m 2 according to the Mosteller formula. Method of administration The tablets shall be taken with liquid, and should not be crushed or chewed. Nevirapine Teva may be taken with or without food. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Readministration to patients who have required permanent discontinuation for severe rash, rash accompanied by constitutional symptoms, hypersensitivity reactions, or clinical hepatitis due to nevirapine. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) or pre-treatment ASAT or ALAT &gt; 5 ULN until baseline ASAT/ALAT are stabilised &lt; 5 ULN. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Coadministration with herbal preparations containing St John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of nevirapine (see section 4.5).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Nevirapine Teva should only be used with at least two other antiretroviral agents (see section 5.1).

Nevirapine Teva should not be used as the sole active antiretroviral, as monotherapy with any antiretroviral has shown to result in viral resistance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period which requires close monitoring of patients to disclose the potential appearance of severe and life-threatening skin reactions (including cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)) and serious hepatitis/hepatic failure. The greatest risk of hepatic and skin reactions occurs in the first 6 weeks of therapy. However, the risk of any hepatic event continues past this period and monitoring should continue at frequent intervals. Female gender and higher CD4 counts (&gt;250/mm 3  in adult females and &gt;400/mm 3 in adult males) at the initiation of nevirapine therapy are associated with a greater risk of hepatic adverse reactions if the patient has detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA i.e. a concentration ≥ 50 copies/ml - at the initiation of nevirapine. As serious and life threatening hepatotoxicity has been observed in controlled and uncontrolled studies predominantly in patients with a plasma HIV-1 viral load of 50 copies/ml or higher, nevirapine should not be initiated in adult females with CD4 cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm 3 or in adult males with CD4 cell counts greater than 400 cells/mm 3 , who have a detectable plasma HIV-1 RNA unless the benefit outweighs the risk. In some cases, hepatic injury has progressed despite discontinuation of treatment. Patients developing signs or symptoms of hepatitis, severe skin reaction or hypersensitivity reactions must discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately. Nevirapine must not be restarted following severe hepatic, skin or hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.3). The dose must be strictly adhered to, especially the 14-days lead-in period (see section 4.2). Cutaneous reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have occurred in patients treated with nevirapine mainly during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity reactions characterised by rash, constitutional findings and visceral involvement. Patients should be intensively monitored during the first 18 weeks of treatment. Patients should be closely monitored if an isolated rash occurs. Nevirapine must be permanently discontinued in any patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by constitutional symptoms (such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, muscle or joint aches, or general malaise), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Nevirapine must be permanently discontinued in any patient experiencing hypersensitivity reaction (characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction), see section 4.4. Nevirapine Teva administration above the recommended dose might increase the frequency and seriousness of skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Concomitant prednisone use (40 mg/day for the first 14 days of nevirapine administration) has been shown not to decrease the incidence of nevirapine-associated rash, and may be associated with an increase in incidence and severity of rash during the first 6 weeks of nevirapine therapy. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Some risk factors for developing serious cutaneous reactions have been identified; they include failure to follow the initial dosing of 200 mg daily during the lead-in period and a long delay between the initial symptoms and medical consultation. Women appear to be at higher risk than men of developing rash, whether receiving nevirapine or non- nevirapine containing therapy.

Patients should be instructed that a major toxicity of nevirapine is rash. They should be advised to promptly notify their physician of any rash and avoid delay between the initial symptoms and medical consultation. The majority of rashes associated with nevirapine occur within the first 6 weeks of initiation of therapy. Therefore, patients should be monitored carefully for the appearance of rash during this period. Patients should be instructed that dose escalation is not to occur if any rash occurs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

during the two-week lead-in dosing period, until the rash resolves. The 200 mg once daily dosing regimen should not be continued beyond 28 days at which point in time an alternative treatment should be sought due to the possible risk of underexposure and resistance.

Any patient experiencing severe rash or a rash accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, blistering, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, muscle or joint aches, or general malaise should discontinue the medicinal product and immediately seek medical evaluation. In these patients nevirapine must not be restarted.

If patients present with a suspected nevirapine-associated rash, liver function tests should be performed. Patients with moderate to severe elevations (ASAT or ALAT &gt; 5 ULN) should be permanently discontinued from nevirapine.

If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction, nevirapine must be permanently stopped and not be reintroduced (see section 4.3). Hepatic reactions Severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity, including fatal fulminant hepatitis, has occurred in patients treated with nevirapine. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical period which requires close monitoring. The risk of hepatic reactions is greatest in the first 6 weeks of therapy. However the risk continues past this period and monitoring should continue at frequent intervals throughout treatment. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. Increased ASAT or ALAT levels ≥ 2.5 ULN and/or co-infection with hepatitis B and/or C at the start of antiretroviral therapy is associated with greater risk of hepatic adverse reactions during antiretroviral therapy in general, including nevirapine containing regimens. Female gender and higher CD4 counts at the initiation of nevirapine therapy in treatment-naïve patients is associated with increased risk of hepatic adverse reactions. Women have a three fold higher risk than men for symptomatic, often rash-associated, hepatic events (5.8 % versus 2.2 %), and treatment-naïve patients of either gender with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma with higher CD4 counts at initiation of nevirapine therapy are at higher risk for symptomatic hepatic events with nevirapine. In a retrospective review of predominantly patients with a plasma HIV-1 viral load of 50 copies/ml or higher, women with CD4 counts &gt; 250 cells/mm 3 had a 12 fold higher risk of symptomatic hepatic adverse reactions compared to women with CD4 counts &lt; 250 cells/mm 3 (11.0 % versus 0.9 %). An increased risk was observed in men with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma and CD4 counts &gt; 400 cells/mm 3 (6.3 % versus 1.2 % for men with CD4 counts &lt; 400 cells/mm 3 ). This increased risk for toxicity based on CD4 count thresholds has not been detected in patients with undetectable (i.e. &lt; 50 copies/ml) plasma viral load. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Patients should be informed that hepatic reactions are a major toxicity of nevirapine requiring close monitoring during the first 18 weeks. They should be informed that occurrence of symptoms suggestive of hepatitis should lead them to discontinue nevirapine and immediately seek medical evaluation, which should include liver function tests.

## Liver monitoring

Clinical chemistry tests, which include liver function tests, should be performed prior to initiating nevirapine therapy and at appropriate intervals during therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Abnormal liver function tests have been reported with nevirapine, some in the first few weeks of therapy.

Asymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes are frequently described and are not necessarily a contraindication to use nevirapine. Asymptomatic GGT elevations are not a contraindication to continue therapy.

Monitoring of hepatic tests should be done every two weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, at the 3 rd month and then regularly thereafter. Liver test monitoring should be performed if the patient experiences signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatitis and/or hypersensitivity.

If ASAT or ALAT ≥ 2.5 ULN before or during treatment, then liver tests should be monitored more frequently during regular clinic visits. Nevirapine must not be administered to patients with pretreatment ASAT or ALAT &gt; 5 ULN until baseline ASAT/ALAT are stabilised &lt; 5 ULN (see section 4.3). Physicians and patients should be vigilant for prodromal signs or findings of hepatitis, such as anorexia, nausea, jaundice, bilirubinuria, acholic stools, hepatomegaly or liver tenderness. Patients should be instructed to seek medical attention promptly if these occur. If ASAT or ALAT increase to &gt; 5 ULN during treatment, nevirapine should be immediately stopped. If ASAT and ALAT return to baseline values and if the patient had no clinical signs or symptoms of hepatitis, rash, constitutional symptoms or other findings suggestive of organ dysfunction, it may be possible to reintroduce nevirapine, on a case by case basis, at the starting dose regimen of 200 mg/day for 14 days followed by 400 mg/day. In these cases, more frequent liver monitoring is required. If liver function abnormalities recur, nevirapine should be permanently discontinued. If clinical hepatitis occurs, characterised by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, icterus AND laboratory findings (such as moderate or severe liver function test abnormalities (excluding GGT)), nevirapine must be permanently stopped. Nevirapine must not be readministered to patients who have required permanent discontinuation for clinical hepatitis due to nevirapine. Liver disease The safety and efficacy of nevirapine has not been established in patients with significant underlying liver disorders. Nevirapine is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, see section 4.3). Pharmacokinetic results suggest caution should be exercised when nevirapine is administered to patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh B). Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In the case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.

## Other warnings

Post-Exposure-Prophylaxis: Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure requiring transplantation, has been reported in HIV-uninfected individuals receiving multiple doses of nevirapine in the setting of post-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP), an unapproved use. The use of nevirapine has not been evaluated within a specific study on PEP, especially in term of treatment duration and therefore, is strongly discouraged.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Combination therapy with nevirapine is not a curative treatment of patients infected with HIV-1; patients may continue to experience illnesses associated with advanced HIV-1 infection, including opportunistic infections.

While effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. Precautions to prevent transmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines.

Hormonal methods of birth control other than Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) should not be used as the sole method of contraception in women taking Nevirapine Teva, since nevirapine might lower the plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. For this reason, and to reduce the risk of HIV transmission, barrier contraception (e.g., condoms) is recommended. Additionally, when postmenopausal hormone therapy is used during administration of nevirapine, its therapeutic effect should be monitored.

Weight and metabolic parameters: An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. In clinical studies, nevirapine has been associated with an increase in HDL- cholesterol and an overall improvement in the total to HDL-cholesterol ratio. However, in the absence of specific studies, the clinical impact of these findings is not known. In addition, nevirapine has not been shown to cause glucose disturbances. Osteonecrosis: Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. Immune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

The available pharmacokinetic data suggest that the concomitant use of rifampicin and nevirapine is not recommended. Furthermore, combining the following compounds with Nevirapine Teva is not recommended: efavirenz, ketoconazole, delavirdine, etravirine, rilpivirine, elvitegravir (in combination with cobicistat), atazanavir (in combination with ritonavir), boceprevir; fosamprenavir (if not co-administered with low dose ritonavir) (see section 4.5).

Granulocytopenia is commonly associated with zidovudine. Therefore, patients who receive nevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly and especially paediatric patients and patients who receive higher zidovudine doses or patients with poor bone marrow reserve, in particular those with advanced HIV disease, have an increased risk of granulocytopenia. In such patients haematological parameters should be carefully monitored.

4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Nevirapine is an inducer of CYP3A and potentially CYP2B6, with maximal induction occurring within 2-4 weeks of initiating multiple-dose therapy. Compounds using this metabolic pathway may have decreased plasma concentrations when coadministered with nevirapine. Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effectiveness of P450 metabolised medicinal products is recommended when taken in combination with nevirapine. The absorption of nevirapine is not affected by food, antacids or medicinal products which are formulated with an alkaline buffering agent. The interaction data is presented as geometric mean value with 90% confidence interval (90% CI) whenever these data were available.

| Zidovudine 100-200 mg TID | Zidovudine AUC ↓ 0.72 (0.60 -0.96) Zidovudine C min ND Zidovudine C max ↓ 0.70 (0.49-1.04) Nevirapine: Zidovudine had no effect on its pharmacokinetics.                | Zidovudine and Nevirapine Teva can be co-administered without dose adjustments Granulocytopenia is commonly associated with zidovudine. Therefore, patients who receive nevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly and especially paediatric patients and patients who receive higher zidovudine doses or patients with poor bone marrow reserve, in particular those with advanced HIV disease, have an increased risk of granulocytopenia. In such patients haematological parameters should be carefully monitored. longer authorised |

Nevirapine metabolites: Studies using human liver microsomes indicated that the formation of nevirapine hydroxylated metabolites was not affected by the presence of dapsone, rifabutin, rifampicin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Ketoconazole and erythromycin significantly inhibited the formation of nevirapine hydroxylated metabolites.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females

Women of childbearing potential should not use oral contraceptives as the sole method for birth control, since nevirapine might lower the plasma concentrations of these medicinal products (see sections 4.4 &amp; 4.5).

## Summary of the safety profile

Pregnancy Currently available data on pregnant women indicate no malformative or foeto/ neonatal toxicity. To date no other relevant epidemiological data are available. No observable teratogenicity was detected in reproductive studies performed in pregnant rats and rabbits (see section 5.3). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Caution should be exercised when prescribing nevirapine to pregnant women (see section 4.4). As hepatotoxicity is more frequent in women with CD4 cell counts above 250 cells/mm 3 with detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma (50 or more copies/ml), these conditions should be taken in consideration on therapeutic decision (see section 4.4). There is not enough evidence to substantiate that the absence of an increased risk for toxicity seen in pretreated women initiating nevirapine with an undetectable viral load (less than 50 copies/ml of HIV-1 in plasma) and CD4 cell counts above 250 cells/mm 3 also applies to pregnant women. All the randomised studies addressing this issue specifically excluded pregnant women, and pregnant women were under-represented in cohort studies as well as in meta-analyses. Breast-feeding Nevirapine readily crosses the placenta and is found in breast milk. It is recommended that HIV-infected mothers do not breast-feed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV and that mothers should discontinue breast-feeding if they are receiving nevirapine. Fertility In reproductive toxicology studies, evidence of impaired fertility was seen in rats. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines There are no specific studies about the ability to drive vehicles and use machinery. However, patients should be advised that they may experience adverse reactions such as fatigue during treatment with Nevirapine Teva. Therefore, caution should be recommended when driving a car or operating machinery. If patients experience fatigue they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery. 4.8 Undesirable effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

The most frequently reported adverse reactions related to nevirapine therapy, across all clinical studies, were rash, allergic reactions, hepatitis, abnormal liver function tests, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, headache and myalgia.

The postmarketing experience has shown that the most serious adverse reactions are Stevens-Johnson syndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis, serious hepatitis/hepatic failure, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, myalgia and lymphadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical period which requires close monitoring (see section 4.4).

## Tabulated summary of adverse reactions

The following adverse reactions which may be causally related to the administration of nevirapine have been reported. The frequencies estimated are based on pooled clinical study data for adverse reactions considered related to nevirapine treatment.

Frequency is defined using the following convention: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

In study 1100.1090, from which the majority of related adverse events (n=28) were received, patients on placebo had a higher incidence of events of granulocytopenia (3.3%) than patients on nevirapine (2.5%).

Anaphylactic reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised, controlled clinical studies. The frequency category was estimated from a statistical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to nevirapine in randomised controlled clinical studies (n= 2,718).

Decreased blood phosphorus and increased blood pressure were observed in clinical studies with coadministration of tenofovir/emtricitabine.

## Metabolic parameters

Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4)

The following adverse reactions have also been reported when nevirapine has been used in combination with other anti-retroviral agents: pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy and thrombocytopaenia. These adverse reactions are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents and may be expected to occur when nevirapine is used in combination with other agents; however it is unlikely that these adverse reactions are due to nevirapine treatment. Hepatic-renal failure syndromes have been reported rarely. In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4). Skin and subcutaneous tissues The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, with nevirapine attributable rash occurring in 12.5 % of patients in combination regimens in controlled studies. Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. Hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction, angioedema and urticaria) have been reported . Rashes occur alone or in the context of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, myalgia and lympadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. Severe and life-threatening skin reactions have occurred in patients treated with nevirapine, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Fatal cases of SJS , TEN and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported. The majority of severe rashes occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment and some required hospitalisation, with one patient requiring surgical intervention (see section 4.4). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hepato-biliary

The most frequently observed laboratory test abnormalities are elevations in liver function tests (LFTs), including ALAT, ASAT, GGT, total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Asymptomatic elevations of GGT levels are the most frequent. Cases of jaundice have been reported. Cases of hepatitis (severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity, including fatal fulminant hepatitis) have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. The best predictor of a serious hepatic event was elevated baseline liver function tests. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical period which requires close monitoring (see section 4.4).

## Paediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on clinical study experience of 361 paediatric patients the majority of which received combination treatment with ZDV or/and ddI, the most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine were similar to those observed in adults. Granulocytopenia was more frequently observed in children. In an open-label clinical study (ACTG 180) granulocytopenia assessed as medicinal product-related occurred in 5/37 (13.5 %) of patients. In ACTG 245, a double-blind placebo controlled study, the frequency of serious medicinal product-related granulocytopenia was 5/305 (1.6 %). Isolated cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome have been reported in this population.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose There is no known antidote for nevirapine overdose. Cases of nevirapine overdose at doses ranging from 800 to 6,000 mg per day for up to 15 days have been reported. Patients have experienced oedema, erythema nodosum, fatigue, fever, headache, insomnia, nausea, pulmonary infiltrates, rash, vertigo, vomiting, increase in transaminases and weight decrease. All of these effects subsided following discontinuation of nevirapine. Paediatric population One case of massive accidental overdose in a newborn was reported. The ingested dose was 40 times the recommended dose of 2 mg/kg/day. Mild isolated neutropenia and hyperlactataemia was observed, which spontaneously disappeared within one week without any clinical complications. One year later, the child's development remained normal. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, ATC code J05AG01. Mechanism of action Nevirapine is a NNRTI of HIV-1. Nevirapine is a non-competitive inhibitor of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, but it does not have a biologically significant inhibitory effect on the HIV-2 reverse transcriptase or on eukaryotic DNA polymerases α, β, γ, or δ. Antiviral activity in vitro Medicinal product no longer authorised

Nevirapine had a median EC50 value (50% inhibitory concentration) of 63 nM against a panel of group M HIV-1 isolates from clades A, B, C, D, F, G, and H, and circulating recombinant forms (CRF), CRF01\\_AE, CRF02\\_AG and CRF12\\_BF replicating in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. In a panel of 2,923 predominantly subtype B HIV-1 clinical isolates, the mean EC50 value was 90 nM. Similar EC50 values are obtained when the antiviral activity of nevirapine is measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocyte derived macrophages or lymphoblastoid cell line. Nevirapine had no antiviral activity in cell culture against group O HIV-1 isolates or HIV-2 isolates.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Nevirapine in combination with efavirenz exhibited a strong antagonistic anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro (see section 4.5) and was additive to antagonistic with the protease inhibitor ritonavir or the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide. Nevirapine exhibited additive to synergistic anti-HIV-1 activity in combination with the protease inhibitors amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, saquinavir and tipranavir, and the NRTIs abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine. The anti-HIV-1 activity of nevirapine was antagonized by the anti-HBV medicinal product adefovir and by the anti-HCV medicinal product ribavirin in vitro .

## Resistance

HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility (100-250-fold) to nevirapine emerge in cell culture. Genotypic analysis showed mutations in the HIV-1 RT gene Y181C and/or V106A depending upon the virus strain and cell line employed. Time to emergence of nevirapine resistance in cell culture was not altered when selection included nevirapine in combination with several other NNRTIs.

1,216 antiretroviral-therapy naïve patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt; 5,000 copies/ml at baseline were assigned to nevirapine 400 mg once daily, nevirapine 200 mg twice daily, efavirenz 600 mg once daily, or nevirapine (400 mg) and efavirenz (800 mg) once daily, plus stavudine and lamivudine for 48 weeks.

Genotypic analysis of isolates from antiretroviral naïve patients experiencing virologic failure (n=71) receiving nevirapine once daily (n=25) or twice daily (n=46) in combination with lamivudine and stavudine for 48 weeks showed that isolates from 8/25 and 23/46 patients, respectively, contained one or more of the following NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions: Y181C, K101E, G190A/S, K103N, V106A/M, V108I, Y188C/L, A98G, F227L and M230L. Cross-resistance Rapid emergence of HIV-strains which are cross-resistant to NNRTIs has been observed in vitro . Cross resistance to delavirdine and efavirenz is expected after virologic failure with nevirapine. Depending on resistance testing results, an etravirine-containing regimen may be used subsequently. Cross-resistance between nevirapine and either HIV protease inhibitors, HIV integrase inhibitors or HIV entry inhibitors is unlikely because the enzyme targets involved are different. Similarly the potential for cross-resistance between nevirapine and NRTIs is low because the molecules have different binding sites on the reverse transcriptase. Clinical results Nevirapine has been evaluated in both treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients. Studies in treatment-naïve patients 2NN study The double non-nucleoside study 2 NN was a randomised, open-label, multicentre prospective study comparing the NNRTIs nevirapine, efavirenz and both medicinal products given together. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The primary endpoint, treatment failure, was defined as less than 1 log10 decline in plasma HIV-1 RNA in the first 12 weeks, or two consecutive measurements of more than 50 copies/ ml from week 24 onwards, or disease progression.

Median age was 34 years and about 64% were male patients, median CD4 cell count was 170 and 190 cells per mm 3 in the nevirapine twice daily and efavirenz groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in demographic and baseline characteristics between the treatment groups.

The predetermined primary efficacy comparison was between the nevirapine twice daily and the efavirenz treatment groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The nevirapine twice daily regimen and the efavirenz regimen were not significantly different (p= 0.091) in terms of efficacy as measured by treatment failure, or any component of treatment failure including virological failure.

The simultaneous use of nevirapine (400 mg) plus efavirenz (800 mg) was associated with the highest frequency of clinical adverse events and with the highest rate of treatment failure (53.1%). As the regimen of nevirapine plus efavirenz did not have additional efficacy and caused more adverse events than each medicinal product separately, this regimen is not recommended.

Twenty per cent of patients assigned to nevirapine twice daily and 18% of patients assigned to efavirenz had at least one grade 3 or 4 clinical adverse event. Clinical hepatitis reported as clinical adverse event occurred in 10 (2.6%) and 2 (0.5%) patients in the nevirapine twice daily and efavirenz groups respectively. The proportion of patients with at least one grade 3 or 4 liver-associated laboratory toxicity was 8.3% for nevirapine twice daily and 4.5% for efavirenz. Of the patients with grade 3 or 4 liver-associated laboratory toxicity, the proportions coinfected with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus were 6.7% and 20.0% in the nevirapine twice daily group, 5.6% and 11.1% in the efavirenz group. 2NN Three-year follow-up-study This is a retrospective multicentre study comparing the 3-year antiviral efficacy of nevirapine and efavirenz in combination with stavudine and lamivudine in 2NN patients from week 49 to week 144. Patients who participated in the 2NN study and were still under active follow-up at week 48 when the study closed and were still being treated at the study clinic, were asked to participate in this study. Primary study endpoints (percentage of patients with treatment failures) and secondary study endpoints as well as backbone therapy were similar to the original 2NN study. A durable response to nevirapine for at least three years was documented in this study, and equivalence within a 10% range was demonstrated between nevirapine 200 mg twice daily and efavirenz with respect to treatment failure. Both, the primary (p = 0.92) and secondary endpoints showed no statistically significant differences between efavirenz and nevirapine 200 mg twice daily. Studies in treatment-experienced patients NEFA study The NEFA study is a controlled prospective randomised study which evaluated treatment options for patients who switch from protease inhibitor (PI) based regimen with undetectable load to either nevirapine, efavirenz or abacavir. The study randomly assigned 460 adults who were taking two nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and at least one PI and whose plasma HIV-1 RNA levels had been less than 200 c/ml for at least the previous six months to switch from the PI to nevirapine (155 patients), efavirenz (156), or abacavir (149). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The primary study endpoint was death, progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or an increase in HIV-1 RNA levels to 200 copies or more per millilitre.

At 12 months, the Kaplan-Meier estimates of the likelihood of reaching the endpoint were 10 % in the nevirapine group, 6 % in the efavirenz group, and 13 percent in the abacavir group (P=0.10 according to an intention-to-treat analysis).

The overall incidence of adverse events was significantly lower (61 patients, or 41%) in the abacavir group than in the nevirapine group (83 patients, or 54%) or the efavirenz group (89 patients, or 57%). Significantly fewer patients in the abacavir group (9 patients, or 6%) than in the nevirapine group (26 patients, or 17%) or the efavirenz group (27 patients, or 17%) discontinued the medicinal product because of adverse events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Perinatal Transmission

Numerous studies have been performed examining the use of nevirapine in regards to perinatal transmission, most notably HIVNET 012. This study demonstrated a significant reduction in transmission using single dose nevirapine (13.1 % (n = 310) in the nevirapine group, versus 25.1 % (n = 308) in the ultra-short zidovudine group (p = 0.00063)). Monotherapy with nevirapine has been associated with the development of NNRTI resistance. Single dose nevirapine in mothers or infants may lead to reduced efficacy if an HIV treatment regimen using nevirapine is later instituted within 6 months or less in these patients. Combination of other antiretrovirals with single-dose nevirapine attenuates the emergence of nevirapine resistance. Where other antiretroviral medicines are accessible, the single dose nevirapine regimen should be combined with additional effective antiretroviral medicines (as recommended in internationally recognized guidelines).

The clinical relevance of these data in European populations has not been established. Furthermore, in the case nevirapine is used as single dose to prevent vertical transmission of HIV-1 infection, the risk of hepatotoxicity in mother and child cannot be excluded. Paediatric population Results of a 48-week analysis of the South African study BI 1100.1368 confirmed that the 4/7 mg/kg and 150 mg/m 2 nevirapine dose groups were well tolerated and effective in treating antiretroviral naive paediatric patients. A marked improvement in the CD4+ cell percent was observed through Week 48 for both dose groups. Also, both dosing regimens were effective in reducing the viral load. In this 48week study no unexpected safety findings were observed in either dosing group. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption: Nevirapine is readily absorbed (&gt; 90 %) after oral administration in healthy volunteers and in adults with HIV-1 infection. Absolute bioavailability in 12 healthy adults following single-dose administration was 93 ± 9% (mean SD) for a 50 mg tablet and 91 ± 8 % for an oral solution. Peak plasma nevirapine concentrations of 2 ± 0.4 μg/ml (7.5 μM) were attained by 4 hours following a single 200 mg dose. Following multiple doses, nevirapine peak concentrations appear to increase linearly in the dose range of 200 to 400 mg/day. Data reported in the literature from 20 HIV-infected patients suggest a steady state Cmax of 5.74 μg/ml (5.00 -7.44) and Cmin of 3.73 μg/ml (3.20 -5.08) with an AUC of 109.0 h*μg/ml (96.0 -143.5) in patients taking 200 mg of nevirapine bid. Other published data support these conclusions. Long-term efficacy appears to be most likely in patients whose nevirapine trough levels exceed 3.5 μg/ml. Distribution: Nevirapine is lipophilic and is essentially nonionized at physiologic pH. Following intravenous administration to healthy adults, the volume of distribution (Vdss) of nevirapine was 1.21 ± 0.09 l/kg, suggesting that nevirapine is widely distributed in humans. Nevirapine readily crosses the placenta and is found in breast milk. Nevirapine is about 60 % bound to plasma proteins in the plasma concentration range of 1-10 μg/ml. Nevirapine concentrations in human cerebrospinal fluid (n = 6) were 45 % (± 5 %) of the concentrations in plasma; this ratio is approximately equal to the fraction not bound to plasma protein.

Biotransformation and elimination: In vivo studies in humans and in vitro studies with human liver microsomes have shown that nevirapine is extensively biotransformed via cytochrome P450 (oxidative) metabolism to several hydroxylated metabolites. In vitro studies with human liver microsomes suggest that oxidative metabolism of nevirapine is mediated primarily by cytochrome P450 isozymes from the CYP3A family, although other isozymes may have a secondary role. In a mass balance/excretion study in eight healthy male volunteers dosed to steady state with nevirapine 200 mg given twice daily followed by a single 50 mg dose of 14C-nevirapine, approximately 91.4 ± 10.5 % of the radiolabelled dose was recovered, with urine (81.3 ± 11.1 %) representing the primary route of excretion compared to faeces (10.1 ± 1.5%). Greater than 80 % of the radioactivity in urine was made up of glucuronide conjugates of hydroxylated metabolites. Thus cytochrome P450

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

metabolism, glucuronide conjugation, and urinary excretion of glucuronidated metabolites represent the primary route of nevirapine biotransformation and elimination in humans. Only a small fraction (&lt; 5 %) of the radioactivity in urine (representing &lt; 3 % of the total dose) was made up of parent compound; therefore, renal excretion plays a minor role in elimination of the parent compound.

Nevirapine has been shown to be an inducer of hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic enzymes. The pharmacokinetics of autoinduction is characterised by an approximately 1.5 to 2 fold increase in the apparent oral clearance of nevirapine as treatment continues from a single dose to two-to-four weeks of dosing with 200-400 mg/day. Autoinduction also results in a corresponding decrease in the terminal phase half-life of nevirapine in plasma from approximately 45 hours (single dose) to approximately 25-30 hours following multiple dosing with 200-400 mg/day.

In a 200 mg nevirapine single dose pharmacokinetic study of HIV-negative patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, n=6; Child-Pugh B, n=4), a significant increase in the AUC of nevirapine was observed in one Child-Pugh B patient with ascites suggesting that patients with worsening hepatic function and ascites may be at risk of accumulating nevirapine in the systemic circulation. Because nevirapine induces its own metabolism with multiple dosing, this single dose study may not reflect the impact of hepatic impairment on multiple dose pharmacokinetics (see section 4.4).

Special populations: Renal dysfunction: The single-dose pharmacokinetics of nevirapine has been compared in 23 patients with either mild (50 ≤ CLcr &lt; 80 ml/min), moderate (30 ≤ CLcr &lt; 50 ml/min) or severe renal dysfunction (CLcr &lt; 30 ml/min), renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, and 8 patients with normal renal function (CLcr &gt; 80 ml/min). Renal impairment (mild, moderate and severe) resulted in no significant change in the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine. However, patients with ESRD requiring dialysis exhibited a 43.5 % reduction in nevirapine AUC over a one-week exposure period. There was also accumulation of nevirapine hydroxy-metabolites in plasma. The results suggest that supplementing nevirapine therapy with an additional 200 mg dose of nevirapine following each dialysis treatment would help offset the effects of dialysis on nevirapine clearance. Otherwise patients with CLcr ≥ 20 ml/min do not require an adjustment in nevirapine dosing. Hepatic dysfunction: A steady state study comparing 46 patients with mild (n=17: Ishak Score 1-2), moderate (n=20; Ishak Score 3-4), or severe (n=9; Ishak Score 5-6, Child-Pugh A in 8 pts., for 1 Child-Pugh score not applicable) liver fibrosis as a measure of hepatic impairment was conducted. The patients studied were receiving antiretroviral therapy containing nevirapine 200 mg twice daily for at least 6 weeks prior to pharmacokinetic sampling, with a median duration of therapy of 3.4 years. In this study, the multiple dose pharmacokinetic disposition of nevirapine and the five oxidative metabolites were not altered. However, approximately 15 % of these patients with hepatic fibrosis had nevirapine trough concentrations above 9,000 ng/ml (2 fold the usual mean trough). Patients with hepatic impairment should be monitored carefully for evidence of medicinal product induced toxicity. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Gender and older people

In the multinational 2NN study, a population pharmacokinetic substudy of 1,077 patients was performed that included 391 females. Female patients showed a 13.8 % lower clearance of nevirapine than did male patients. This difference is not considered clinically relevant. Since neither body weight nor Body Mass Index (BMI) had influence on the clearance of nevirapine, the effect of gender cannot be explained by body size. Nevirapine pharmacokinetics in HIV-1 infected adults does not appear to change with age (range 19-68 years) or race (Black, Hispanic, or Caucasian). Nevirapine has not been specifically investigated in patients over the age of 65.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

Data concerning the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine have been derived from two major sources: a 48 week paediatric study in South Africa (BI 1100.1368) involving 123 HIV-1 positive, antiretroviral naïve patients aged 3 months to 16 years; and a consolidated analysis of five Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocols comprising 495 patients aged 14 days to 19 years.

Pharmacokinetic data on 33 patients (age range 0.77 - 13.7 years) in the intensive sampling group demonstrated that clearance of nevirapine increased with increasing age in a manner consistent with increasing body surface area. Dosing of nevirapine at 150 mg/m 2 BID (after a two-week lead in at 150 mg/m 2 QD) produced geometric mean or mean trough nevirapine concentrations between 4-6 μg/ml (as targeted from adult data). In addition, the observed trough nevirapine concentrations were comparable between the two methods.

Not applicable.

The consolidated analysis of Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) protocols 245, 356, 366, 377, and 403 allowed for the evaluation of paediatric patients less than 3 months of age (n=17) enrolled in these PACTG studies. The plasma nevirapine concentrations observed were within the range observed in adults and the remainder of the paediatric population, but were more variable between patients, particularly in the second month of age. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans other than those observed in clinical studies based on conventional studies of safety, pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. In carcinogenicity studies, nevirapine induces hepatic tumours in rats and mice. These findings are most likely related to nevirapine being a strong inducer of liver enzymes, and not due to a genotoxic mode of action. 6.

-If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Nevirapine Teva is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you take Nevirapine Teva 3. How to take Nevirapine Teva 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Nevirapine Teva 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Nevirapine Teva is and what it is used for Nevirapine Teva belongs to a group of medicines called antiretrovirals, used in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) infection. The active substance of your medicine is called nevirapine. Nevirapine belongs to a class of anti-HIV medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that HIV needs in order to multiply. Nevirapine stops reverse transcriptase from working. By stopping reverse transcriptase from working, Nevirapine Teva helps control HIV-1 infection. Nevirapine Teva is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults, adolescents, and children of any age. You must take Nevirapine Teva together with other antiretroviral medicines. Your doctor will recommend the best medicines for you. If Nevirapine Teva has been prescribed for your child, please note that all information in this leaflet is addressed to your child (in this case please read 'your child' instead of 'you'). 2. What you need to know before you take Nevirapine Teva Do not take Nevirapine Teva -if you are allergic to nevirapine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

<!-- image -->

You must take the dose of Nevirapine Teva as prescribed by your doctor. This is especially important within the first 14 days of treatment (see more information in ' Teva' ).

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Nevirapine Teva During the first 18 weeks of treatment with Nevirapine Teva it is very important that you and your doctor watch out for signs of liver or skin reactions. These can become severe and even life threatening. You are at greatest risk of such a reaction during the first 6 weeks of treatment. If you experience severe rash or hypersensitivity (allergic reactions that may appear in the form of rash) accompanied by other side effects such as -fever, -blistering, -mouth sores, -inflammation of the eye, -swelling of the face, -general swelling, -shortness of breath, -muscle or joint pain, -general feelings of illness, -or abdominal pain YOU SHOULD DISCONTINUE TAKING NEVIRAPINE TEVA AND YOU MUST CONTACT your doctor IMMEDIATELY as such reactions can be potentially life-threatening or lead to death. If you ever have only mild rash symptoms without any other reaction please inform your doctor immediately, who will advise you whether you should stop taking Nevirapine Teva. If you experience symptoms suggesting a damage of the liver, such as -loss of appetite, -feeling sick (nausea), -vomiting, -yellow skin (jaundice), -abdominal pain you should discontinue taking Nevirapine Teva and must contact your doctor immediately. If you develop severe liver, skin or hypersensitivity reactions whilst taking Nevirapine Teva, NEVER TAKE Nevirapine Teva again without referring to your doctor. How to take Nevirapine Medicinal product no longer authorised

The following patients are at increased risk of developing liver problems:

- -women
- -infected with hepatitis B or C
- -abnormal liver function tests
- -treatment-naïve patients with higher CD4 cell counts at the start of Nevirapine Teva therapy (women more than 250 cells/mm³, men more than 400 cells/mm³)
- -pre-treated patients with detectable HIV-1 plasma viral load and higher CD4 cell counts at the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

start of nevirapine therapy (women more than 250 cells/mm³, men more than 400 cells/mm³)

In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection (AIDS defining illness), signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body's immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately.

In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment.

Changes of body fat may occur in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Contact your doctor if you notice changes in body fat (see section 4 ' Possible side effects '). Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop a bone disease called osteonecrosis  (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe weakness of the immune system and higher body mass index may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms please inform your doctor. If you are taking nevirapine and zidovudine concomitantly please inform your doctor since he might need to check your white blood cells. Do not take Nevirapine Teva after an exposure to HIV unless you have been diagnosed with HIV and instructed to do so by your doctor. Nevirapine Teva is not a cure for HIV infection. Therefore, you may continue to develop infections and other illnesses associated with HIV infection. You should therefore remain in regular contact with your doctor. You can still pass on HIV when taking this medicine, although the risk is lowered by effective antiretroviral therapy. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting other people. Prednisone should not be used to treat a rash related to Nevirapine Teva. If you are taking oral contraceptives (e.g. 'pill') or other hormonal methods of birth control during treatment with Nevirapine Teva you should use a barrier contraception (e.g. condoms) in addition to prevent pregnancy and further HIV transmission. If you are receiving post-menopausal hormone therapy, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. If you are taking or are prescribed rifampicin to treat tuberculosis please inform your doctor before taking this medicine with Nevirapine Teva. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Children and adolescents

Nevirapine Teva tablets can be taken by:

- -children 16 years of age or older
- -children under 16 years of age who:
- -weigh 50 kg or more
- -or have a body surface area above 1.25 square metres.

For children under 16 years of age who weigh less than 50 kg or whose body surface area is below 1.25 m 2 other nevirapine containing oral formulations are available and should be used if appropriate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other medicines and Nevirapine Teva

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Inform your doctor about all other medicines you are taking before you start taking Nevirapine Teva. Your doctor might need to monitor whether your other medicines are still working and adjust doses. Carefully read the package leaflet of all other HIV medicinal products you are taking in combination with Nevirapine Teva.

It is particularly important that you tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken:

- -St John's Wort ( Hypericum perforatum , medicine to treat depression)

-rifampicin (medicine to treat tuberculosis) -rifabutin (medicine to treat tuberculosis) -macrolides e.g. clarithromycin (medicine to treat bacterial infections) -fluconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections) -ketoconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections) -itraconazole (medicine to treat fungal infections) -methadone (medicine used for treatment of opiate addicts) -warfarin (medicine to reduce blood clotting) -hormonal contraceptives (e.g. the 'pill') -atazanavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) -lopinavir/ritonavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) -fosamprenavir (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) -efavirenz (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) -etravirine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) -rilpivirine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) -delavirdine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) -zidovudine (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) -boceprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis C) -telaprevir (medicine to treat hepatitis C) -elvitegravir/cobicistat (another medicine to treat HIV-infection) Your doctor will carefully monitor the effect of Nevirapine Teva and any of these medicines if you are taking them together. If you are undergoing kidney dialysis, your doctor may consider a dose adjustment of Nevirapine Teva. This is because Nivirapine Teva can be partly washed out of your blood by dialysis. Nevirapine Teva with food and drink There are no restrictions on taking Nevirapine Teva with food and drink. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

You should stop breast-feeding if you are taking Nevirapine Teva. It is in general recommended that you do not breast-feed if you have HIV infection because it is possible that your baby can become infected with HIV through your breast milk.

## Driving and using machines

You may experience fatigue when taking Nevirapine Teva. Use caution when engaging in activities such as driving, using any tools or machines. If you experience fatigue you should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or using any tools or machines.

## Nevirapine Teva contains lactose and sodium

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicine contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodiumfree'.

## 3. How to take Nevirapine Teva

You should not use Nevirapine Teva on its own. You must take it with at least two other antiretroviral medicines. Your doctor will recommend the best medicines for you.

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Dose: The dose is one 200 mg tablet per day for the first 14 days of treatment ('lead-in' period). After 14 days, the recommended dose is one 200 mg tablet twice a day. It is very important that you take only one Nevirapine Teva tablet a day for the first 14 days ('lead-in' period) If you have any rash during this period, do not increase the dose but consult your doctor. The 14-day 'lead-in' period has been shown to lower the risk of skin rash. As Nevirapine Teva must always be taken together with other HIV antiretroviral medicines, you should follow the instructions for your other medicines carefully. These are supplied in the package leaflets for those medicines. You should continue to take Nevirapine Teva for as long as instructed by your doctor. As explained in ' Warnings and precautions' , above, your doctor will monitor you with liver tests or for undesirable effects such as rash. Depending on the outcome your doctor may decide to interrupt or stop your Nevirapine Teva treatment. Your doctor might then decide to restart you on a lower dose. Only take Nevirapine Teva tablets by mouth. Do not chew your tablets. You may take Nevirapine Teva with or without food. If you take more Nevirapine Teva than you should Do not take more Nevirapine Teva than prescribed by your doctor and described in this leaflet. There is at present little information on the effects of Nevirapine Teva overdose. Consult your doctor if you have taken more Nevirapine Teva than you should. If you forget to take Nevirapine Teva Medicinal product no longer authorised

Try not to miss a dose. If you notice that you have missed a dose within 8 hours of when it was due, take the missed dose as soon as possible. If it has been more than 8 hours since the dose was due only take the next dose at the usual time.

## If you stop taking Nevirapine Teva

Taking all doses at the appropriate times:

- -greatly increases the effectiveness of your combination antiretroviral medicines.
- -reduces the chances of your HIV infection becoming resistant to your antiretroviral medicines.

It is important that you continue taking Nevirapine Teva correctly, as described above, unless your doctor instructs you to stop.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you stop taking Nevirapine Teva for more than 7 days your doctor will instruct you to start the 14 day 'lead-in' period (described above) once again, before returning to the twice daily dose.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes.

- -severe problems with liver or kidneys (liver or kidney failure).

As mentioned in ' Warnings and precautions ', above, the most important side effects of Nevirapine Teva are severe and life threatening skin reactions and serious liver damage. These reactions occur mainly in the first 18 weeks of treatment with Nevirapine Teva. This is therefore an important period which requires close monitoring by your doctor. If you ever observe any rash symptoms, inform your doctor immediately. When rash occurs it is normally mild to moderate. However, in some patients a rash, which appears as a blistering skin reaction, can be severe or life-threatening (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and deaths have been recorded. Most of the cases of both severe rash and mild/moderate rash occur in the first six weeks of treatment. If rash occurs and you also feel sick, you must stop treatment and visit your doctor immediately. Hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions can occur. Such reactions may appear in the form of anaphylaxis (a severe form of allergic reaction) with symptoms such as: -rash -swelling of the face -difficulty breathing (bronchial spasm) -anaphylactic shock Hypersensitivity reactions can also occur as rash with other side effects such as: -fever -blistering of your skin -mouth sores -inflammation of the eye -swelling of the face -general swelling -shortness of breath -muscle or joint pain -a reduction in the numbers of your white blood cells (granulocytopenia) -general feelings of illness Medicinal product no longer authorised

Tell your doctor immediately if you experience rash and any of the other side effects of a hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction. Such reactions can be life-threatening.

These events are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents and may be expected to occur when Nevirapine Teva is used in combination with other agents; however, it is unlikely that these events are due to treatment with Nevirapine Teva.

## Additional side effects in children and adolescents

A reduction in white blood cells (granulocytopenia) can occur, which is more common in children. A reduction in red blood cells (anaemia), which may be related to nevirapine therapy, is also more commonly observed in children. As with rash symptoms, please inform your doctor of any side effects.
