## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1 Introduction

There is a need for anti-HIV drugs for children acknowledged by a number of organisations including WHO and UNICEF. In response  to  these  calls  the  Paediatric  Expert  Group  (PEG),  created  by  the CPMP in July 2001, completed an assessment of the paediatric needs for anti-HIV drugs in Europe. In this  evaluation  numerous  limitations  were  identified  which  could  damage  treatment  compliance  in children. Oral solutions have limitations insofar as they often present a bad taste; they require large volumes in older children; they may contain some excipients hazardous for children and they present some  logistic  problems  (small  bottles,  refrigeration…).  These  limitations  are  especially  critical  in resource-poor  settings.  As  a  conclusion  of  this  evaluation,  it  was  considered  that  the  Marketing Authorisation  Holders  (MAHs)  should  be  further  encouraged  to  develop  small  tablets  with  lower strength  for  children  able  to  swallow  tablets  and  GSK  was  informed  of  this  request  in  2004.  As  a response, the MAH proposed to pursue the development of scored tablets for Combivir tablets, which is the scope of this submission.

This  Type  II  variation  concerns  the  MAH's  proposal  to  extend  the  approved  indication  to  register Combivir scored tablet formulation intended for use in children weighting 14 kg or more .

The proposed indication is:

'Combivir is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (see section 4.2).'

The proposed posology for this new Combivir formulation is:

| Children weight                          | Posology                                                       |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Children weighing at least 30 kg         | One whole tablet twice daily                                   |
| Children weighing between 21 kg to 30 kg | One half tablet in the morning One whole tablet in the evening |
| Children weighing between 14 kg to 21 kg | One half tablet twice daily                                    |

These  proposed  dosing  recommendations  for  lamivudine  in  the  fixed-dose  combination  Combivir tablet are consistent with those approved for paediatric use of Epivir (lamivudine) tablets.

The currently approved dosing recommendations for Retrovir (zidovudine) for paediatric use are based on body surface area (BSA) and dosed three times daily.

The  MAH  proposes  to  switch  from  a  three  times  daily  dosage  based  on  BSA  to  a twice  daily zidovudine dosage based on body weight .

The MAH proposed to submit an EU Mutual Recognition Type II variation to update the Retrovir product information with the new zidovudine dosage regimen, once the variation for this extension of indication for Combivir scored tablets is approved.

The proposed Combivir scored tablets are identical to the current non-scored tablets except for the addition of the breakline and introduction of the mark on both sides. The MAH has planned to replace the non-scored tablets by the scored tablets, as soon as this new formulation will be approved.

Furthermore, the MAH proposes to update section 5.2 'Pharmacokinetic properties' of the SPC to be harmonised with the Product Information (PI) of Epivir and Retrovir and to include  new pharmacokinetic data on children.

This  variation  includes  Quality  and  Clinical  data. No  new  clinical  data  has  been  generated  in support of the scored tablet application ;  existing data have merely been re-analysed to determine suitable paediatric doses.

## 2 Quality aspects

The  MAH  applied  to  register  scored  Combivir  tablets.  It  is  the  MAH's  intention  to  replace  the currently  registered  non-scored  tablets  with  the  scored  Combivir  tablets.  The  proposed  tablets  are white to off-white, capsule-shaped film-coated tablets engraved with 'GXFC3' and with a score line on each face of the tablet.

The introduction of the score line and additional engraving will result only in a change of appearance of the tablets (no changes to the qualitative or quantitative composition of the finished product were proposed). Batch analysis data and dissolution profile results indicate that the addition of the score line has  not  compromised  product  quality.  The  formulation  composition  and  processing  conditions  of commercial scale for tablets with the selected breakline meet the specifications of the commercial nonscored tablets.  The  proposed scored tablets are equivalent to currently marketed non-scored tablets. The  proposed  change  has  been  supported  by  appropriate  pharmaceutical  development  (selection  of breakline design), process validation and stability studies.

## 3 Non-clinical aspects

## 3.1 Environmental Risk Assessment

Scored  tablets  are  intended  to  replace  the  non-scored  tablets  or  the  use  of  liquid  formulations  of lamivudine and zidovudine. Therefore in agreement with the MAH proposal the CHMP concluded that there was no relevant additional environmental burden associated with this submission.

## 4 Clinical aspects

## 4.1 Clinical efficacy

Combivir (150 mg lamivudine plus 300 mg zidovudine) is  not currently  indicated  for  use  in  HIVinfected paediatric patients less than 12 years old of age because it is a fixed-dose combination that cannot be adjusted based on body size for this patient population.

## The currently recommended dosage for zidovudine and lamivudine in paediatrics are:

- -zidovudine (children from 3 months to 12 years of age): 360 to 480 mg/m² per day , in 3 or 4 divided  doses .  The  maximum  dosage  should  not  exceed  200 mg  every  6  hours.  Of  note,  the recommended dose in adults is 500 or 600 mg/day in 2 or 3 divided doses.
- -lamivudine (children from 3 months to 12 years of age): 4 mg/kg twice daily, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily.

Based on the re-analysis of existing data the MAH has proposed for Combivir tablets the following posology:

| Children weight                          | Posology                                                       |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Children weighing at least 30 kg         | One whole tablet twice daily                                   |
| Children weighing between 21 kg to 30 kg | One half tablet in the morning One whole tablet in the evening |
| Children weighing between 14 kg to 21 kg | One half tablet twice daily                                    |

## 4.1.1 Zidovudine

## 4.1.1.1  Change from zidovudine BSA-based to weight based dosing

Weight-based are simplified regimens and therefore the MAH proposed to switch from a BSA-based dosing  for  zidovudine  to  a  weight-based  dosing.  For  this  purpose,  the  MAH  has  first  extracted  the values of height at the 5 th ,  50 th ,  and  95 th percentile  for  a  given  body  weight  from  the  CDC  Growth Charts  and  then  determined  the  corresponding  BSA  values  for  a  given  body  weight,  using  various calculation methods. Among these calculation functions, the Mosteller equation (see table 1) is the one preferred by UNICEF/WHO, as it is the easiest to use.

Then,  the  daily  zidovudine  doses  base  on  the  approved  regimens  (360  to  480  mg/m²  daily)  were calculated. Based on these results a proposal was made for daily mg/kg zidovudine doses, which are within the range from 360mg/m²/day at the 5 th percentile BSA to 480mg/m²/day at the 95 th percentile:

| Body weight    | Zidovudine regimen                            |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 4 to < 9 kg    | 24 mg/kg/day (8 mg/kg TID)                    |
| ≥ 9 to < 30 kg | 18 mg/kg/day (6 mg/kg TID)                    |
| ≥ 30 kg*       | 200 mg TID (approved dose for ≥ 12 years old) |

## 4.1.1.2  Change from zidovudine dosing three times per day to twice daily

The MAH did not provide any new efficacy clinical data to support the change from the approved three  or  four  times  daily  dosing  of  zidovudine  to  the  proposed  twice  daily  dosing.  Only  a pharmacokinetic study conducted in 6 HIV-infected children from 2 to 13 years of age together with new analysis of the available data was submitted by the MAH. Table 2 summarises the results of this pharmacokinetic study.

Table 2 Summary of zidovudine pharmacokinetic parameter estimates and within-subject parameter rations from zidovudine administration twice daily vs three times daily ª

| Zidovudine                | Zidovudine Dosage Regimen   | Zidovudine Dosage Regimen   | Within-Subject q12h to q8h Ratio   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Pharmacokinetic Parameter | 120mg/m² q8h                | 180mg/m² q12h               |                                    |
| AUC(0-24) (h.mg/l)        | 5.24 (3.73 - 7.35)          | 4.72 (3.50 - 6.36)          | 0.90 (0.52 - 1.56)                 |
| Cmax (mg/l)               | 0.96 (0.55 - 1.70)          | 1.04 (0.69 - 1.57)          | 1.08 (0.62 - 1.88)                 |
| t½ (h)                    | 1.31 (0.99 - 1.72)          | 1.15 (0.90 - 1.47)          | 0.88 (0.71 - 1.10)                 |

The  results  indicate  that  a  TID  and  a  BID  (twice  a  day)  regimen  of  zidovudine  show  comparable pharmacokinetics profiles. However, the demonstration is only based on data derived from 6 patients. Moreover,  given  the  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  zidovudine,  active after an intracellular phosphorylation, it would have been of value to have intracellular pharmacokinetic data collected.

To further substantiate the twice-daily regimen for zidovudine proposed for children, the MAH states that the safety and efficacy of twice daily dosing in adults is well established and that in children with more than 5-6 months of age, the pharmacokinetic profile of zidovudine is similar to that in adults (with similar plasma  terminal  elimination half-life (about 1.5 hours) and  similar process of intracellular  phosphorylation).  Moreover,  the  MAH  argues  that  clinical  studies  as  CNAA3006 1 and PENTA 5 2 have investigated zidovudine as a twice daily regimen in children.

Therefore, the following weight-based zidovudine doses for twice daily regimens are proposed by the MAH, based on maintenance of the same total daily dose (e.g., 240mg/m² BID vs 160mg/m² TID, or 180mg/m² BID vs 120mg/m² TID):

| Body weight    | Zidovudine regimen (BID)                      |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 4 to < 9 kg    | 24 mg/kg/day (12 mg/kg BID)                   |
| ≥ 9 to < 30 kg | 18 mg/kg/day (9 mg/kg BID)                    |
| ≥ 30 kg*       | 300 mg BID (approved dose for ≥ 12 years old) |

To support its proposal, the MAH underlined that the PENTA group 3 and the WHO have developed treatment guidelines with a zidovudine regimen based on a twice daily administration.

1 Study CNAA3006 evaluated the efficacy and safety of zidovudine 180 mg/m 2 twice daily plus lamivudine 4 mg/kg twice daily, with or without abacavir over 48 weeks in 205 children ranging at enrolment from 0.6 to 13 years of age.

2 Penta 5 study evaluated  safety and efficacy over 48 weeks in children from 0.3 to 16.5 years of age.

In  order  to  further  substantiate  the  weight-based  twice  daily  regimen  for  zidovudine,  the  MAH  has provided estimates of pharmacokinetics data (AUC and Cmax) for zidovudine obtained from different calculations derived from a population pharmacokinetic model obtained from a population pharmacokinetic analysis of data in study PACTG 152 (in which two regimens of zidovudine were explored:180 mg/m² and 120 mg/m², every 6 hours).

The exposures (daily AUC) from both mg/m² and mg/kg dosing were calculated using weight-based clearance values from the model.

The figure below shows that the calculated AUCs on a weight-based dosing regimen are comprised within the range of calculated AUC on a BSA-based dosing regimen The two drops in AUC are due to the  change  in  proposed  dose  recommendation  at  8  kg  body  weight  and  to  a  step  function  at  12  kg (taken as typical weight for a 2-year old) for the effect of age in the clearance model.

Post-hoc pharmacokinetic parameter estimates from individual patients were used to calculate AUC and Cmax for both BSA and body-weight based dosing

The AUC value was increased by about 2 to 3 fold in children compared to historical data in adults (study  NZTA101 4 ).  The  Cmax  value  was  also  increased  in  children  compared  to  historical  data  in adults. The MAH explains this finding by the larger variability observed in paediatric patients.

As expected, the Cmax values were higher for the twice daily regimen than for the three times daily regimen.

The MAH has performed new simulations based on the revised population PK model. The results are presented in the table below.

The results are better in line with the results extracted from reanalyses of clinical studies. Moreover, the revised model confirms the high Cmax values.

## Discussion

## Change from zidovudine BSA-based to weight based dosing

The CHMP agrees that dosing recommendations based on body-weight are preferred to those based on BSA for practical reasons. Based to the MAH's demonstration the switch from BSA to weight based dosing regimen can be accepted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Change from zidovudine dosing three times per day to twice daily

The results indicate that a TID and a BID regimen of zidovudine show comparable pharmacokinetics profiles. However, the demonstration is only based on data derived from 6 patients. Moreover, given the pharmacodynamic properties of zidovudine, active after an intracellular phosphorylation, it would have been of value to have intracellular pharmacokinetic data collected.

The CHMP recognises that the BID regimen of zidovudine in paediatric patients is widely used in clinical practice and the recent WHO/PENTA support has reinforced such an use, as well as national guidelines.  However,  it  is  regrettable  that  the  MAH  could  not  provide  clinical  efficacy  data  to substantiate  the  proposed  new  dosage  recommendations  for  zidovudine  in  children  (as  regards  the twice daily regimen and the BSA-dosed dosing).

The pharmacokinetic data for zidovudine were reassuring. However, the calculations of pharmacokinetic parameters for study PACTG 152 for zidovudine showed that the AUC value was increased by about 2 to 3 fold in children compared to historical data in adults (study NZTA101, a pivotal bioequivalence trial conducted in 24 adults receiving 300 mg zidovudine BID).

The MAH 's explanation for the simulated 2-3 fold increased exposure of zidovudine was an observed increased variability in the paediatric population. As could be seen from the simulations in table 3 the variability  was  higher  in  the  paediatric  groups  (simulated  variability  in  AUC  around  50%CV  as compared to 29%CV observed in adults. It is difficult to see that the difference in variability could explain a 2-3 fold difference in mean AUC.

Upon CHMP request the MAH has performed different analyses and compared results to observed exposure  in  children  with  the  currently  approved dose  recommendations  and  to  adult  exposure, including  inter-individual  variability.  The  results  confirm  the  high  Cmax  values  for  zidovudine  in children. These findings pointed out the usefulness to perform clinical studies in special populations such  as  paediatric  patients.  Pharmacokinetic  simulations  might  not  always  be  sufficient  to  provide reassurance on efficacy and safety, as the optimal model might be difficult to define.

## 4.1.2 Lamivudine

Lamivudine  pharmacokinetics  in  paediatric  patients  is  in  general  similar  to  adults.  However,  two characteristics deserve to be underlined:

-Absolute bioavailabilty is reduced in paediatric patients below 12 years of age (F ranging from 55 to 65%) compared to adult patients (F ranging from 80 to 85%).

-Systemic  clearance  is  higher  in  younger  patients  and  decreased  with  age,  approaching  values around 12 years of age.

Recent  findings  from  study  NUCA2002  (included  in  the  original  paediatric  MAA  submission)  and from  the  recent  study  PENTA  13 5 have  shown  that  patients  below  6  years  of  age  presented  AUC values  reduced  by  30%  compared  with  other  age  groups.  These  findings  gave  rise  to  an  update  of section  5.2  of  the  SPC  for  Epivir  (variation  II/61,  positive  Opinion  adopted  in  January  2007,  by CHMP).

In  order  to  further  investigate  whether  certain  age  groups  of  paediatric  patients  have  poorer  oral absorption  of  solid  oral  formulations  compared  to  liquids,  pharmacokinetic  data  from  original paediatric  lamivudine  trial,  NUCA2002,  was  re-examined.  In  this  study  absolute  bioavailability  of lamivudine in paediatric patients was determined with patients receiving single doses of either an oral solution,  capsule,  and  tablet  formulation  compared  to  an  intravenous  formulation.  A  scatterplot  of absolute bioavailability versus age for the different formulations is shown in figure 2.

Figure 2 shows that when presenting the oral bioavailability by formulation and by age, there is a trend for  increased  oral  bioavailability  with  age.  As  regards  the  value  of  bioavailability  as  a  function  of formulation, no clear trend is apparent.

## 4.1.3 Dosing recommendations for use of Combivir scored tablets in paediatrics

From the daily zidovudine doses calculated in table 1, and based on a twice daily regimen, it appears that the 150 mg zidovudine contained in a half-tablet of Combivir would be an appropriate dose for children weighing from about 14 to 22 kg.

As regards lamivudine, over the 14 to 22 kg weight range, a 75 mg lamivudine dose contained in a half-tablet of Combivir would deviate from the nominal 4 mg/kg dose by +34% at the low end of the body weight range (14 kg) and by -15% at the high end of the weight range (22 kg). To avoid a dose that is more than about 10% below the nominal 4 mg/kg dose, the upper weight limit was decreased to 21 kg. Because of the favourable safety profile of lamivudine, there is no concern in exceeding the nominal dose by 34% at the lower end of the proposed weight range (14 kg).

Similarly, it is proposed that patients weighing at least 30 kg may safely receive the full 150 mg tablet dose of lamivudine twice daily (+25% compared to the 4 mg/kg recommended dose).

In order to explore the dosing recommendations for Combivir, the MAH has performed Monte Carlo simulations based on population pharmacokinetic modelling to estimate the exposures of zidovudine and lamivudine for the following Combivir regimens:

| Regimen/ Body Regimen 1   | 14 to ≤ 21 kg               | >21 to 30 kg                          |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| weight Regimen 2          | One half tablet twice daily | One half tabletAM One whole tablet PM |
| Regimen 3                 |                             | One half tablet three times daily     |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results of these simulations are presented in table 5.

3TC: Lamivudine

The results of the simulations showed for both actives and regardless of dosing regimen that AUCs were slightly increased in the &gt; 21-30 kg group compared to the 14-21 kg group.

As  expected  the  Cmaxs  were  higher  in  the  regimen  2  (0.5  tablet  AM  +  1  tablet  PM)  than  in  the regimen 3 (0.5 tablet three time a day). The MAH has discussed the potential alteration of the safety profile related to the higher Cmax values. The well known safety profile for lamivudine gives some reassurance.  For  zidovudine,  the  percentage  of  patients  who  experience  adverse  events  such  as gastrointestinal  events  (which  are  believed  to  be  associated  with  plasma  concentrations)  may  be increased.  It  is  unlikely  that  haematological  events  (i.e  anemia)  would  be  increased  as  they  are considered to be associated with overall exposure (AUC).

In  general,  lamivudine  and  zidovudine  exposure  in  children  are  modestly  higher  than  in  adults. Lamivudine  adult  exposures  (mean  (CV%))  are  Cmax:  1.22  ug/ml  (24%),  AUC0-24:  9.4  ug.h/ml

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(27%)  [EPV10001]  and  zidovudine  adult  exposures  (mean  (CV%))  are  Cmax:  2.01  ug/ml  (40%), AUC0-24: 4.8 ug.h/ml (29%) [NTZA1001].

Monte  Carlo  Simulations  based  on  the  revised  population  PK  model  were  performed  to  predict zidovudine  exposure  for  the  proposed  dosing  regimens  of  scored  Combivir.  Results  show  that zidovudine AUC values simulated are consistent across the 3 weight-ranges and are consistent with the historical paediatric data (for the higher zidovudine dosing regimen i.e 160 mg/m²).

Cmax values are higher than the historical data and even more especially in the 21-30 kg weight-range as expected due to the inhomogeneous dosing regimen.

As Monte Carlo Simulation tended to predict higher zidovudine exposure, especially Cmax, PK data in paediatrics from study P53-04 and post-hoc model parameter estimates from PACTG 152 were reanalysed to predict zidovudine exposure (daily AUC and Cmax) from scored Combivir tablets.

When  comparing  predicted  zidovudine  exposure  for  the  scored  tablet  from  different  methods, predicted zidovudine daily AUC for scored tablet by weight band are generally in agreement among the  results  from  Monte  Carlo  Simulation,  re-analysis  of  P53-04  (limited  sample  size),  and  PACTG 152. Predicted zidovudine Cmax for scored tablet by Monte Carlo Simulation are on average 41% and 10%  higher  than  those  from  PACTG  152  in  the  weight  group  of  14-&lt;21kg,  and  21-&lt;30kg, respectively.

When comparing predicted  zidovudine  exposure  for  the  scored  tablet  to  adults  and  paediatric  data from  currently  approved  zidovudine  dosing  regimens,  predicted  zidovudine  daily  AUC  for  scored tablet are higher than adult data from 300mg BID and paediatric data from 120mg/m² TID, but are similar to paediatric data from 160mg/m² BID.

Predicted  zidovudine  Cmax  by  Monte  Carlo  Simulation  for  the  proposed  scored  tablet  dosing regimens are on average 33% and 62% higher amongst children weighing 14-&lt;21kg, and 21-&lt;30kg, respectively, when compared to adults receiving 300mg BID. Predicted zidovudine Cmax for scored tablet by reanalysis of PACTG 152 are similar to adult and paediatric data from currently approved zidovudine regimens in the weight band of 14-&lt;21kg, while predicted zidovudine Cmax in the 21&lt;30kg weight are 50% higher than adults and 86% higher than paediatric patients receiving 160mg/m² q8h.

It was noted that the MAH has initially submitted simulations in the group with unequal doses that did not reflect a 12 hours dose interval but rather was based on doses separated by 8 hours. The MAH has submitted simulations taking into account a dosing interval of 12 hours, which does not change the conclusions.

Proposed posology for Combivir:

Based  on  the  results  of  simulations  and  taking  into  account  the  2006  WHO  recommendations,  the MAH has proposed the following dosage recommendations for children over 14 kg:

| Children weight                          | Posology                                                       |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Children weighing at least 30 kg         | One whole tablet twice daily                                   |
| Children weighing between 21 kg to 30 kg | One half tablet in the morning One whole tablet in the evening |
| Children weighing between 14 kg to 21 kg | One half tablet twice daily                                    |

## Discussion

All  the  results  confirm  that  Cmax  are  higher  and  this  is  more  relevant  with  the  regimen  half  tablet AM/one tablet PM. Therefore, the main concern as regards the regimens proposed by the MAH is to determine whether or not the variations of plasma concentrations subsequent to the administration of inhomogeneous dosing for children weighing between 21 kg to 30 kg (i.e an half tablet in the morning and a whole tablet in the evening) could alter the safety and efficacy profiles of the drugs.

It is all the more critical that such an inhomogeneous dosing regimen is questionable specially taking into consideration the poor compliance to anti-HIV multitherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regarding  Cmax  values,  the  MAH  recognised  that  there  is  a  concern  regarding  the  safety  of  the proposed dosing regimen. This concern must not be neglected, since the impact on the safety (and efficacy/adherence) of the scored tablets clearly depends on the type of adverse event. For example, an increase in vomiting can be assumed to have a greater impact than an increased incidence of nausea. However,  it  is  known  that  gastrointestinal  (GI)  adverse  events  of  zidovudine  decrease  over  time. Therefore, the MAH was requested to carefully evaluate these events in a post-marketing study (e.g. in an  observational  cohort)  and,  if  necessary,  explore  a  regimen  for  diminishing  these  events  (e.g.  by either taking 3 x ½ tablet or by starting zidovudine therapy with the oral solution and switching to the tablet formulation after a few weeks). The MAH committed to submit a proactive pharmacovigilance survey and to submit a safety review focusing on Combivir paediatric scored tablets every 6 month. Within this variation the SPC is updated in order to warn prescribers for the possibly increased risk of adverse events. A respective statement on the possibility to change the dosing schedule in case of GIintolerance by taking 3 x ½ tablet Combivir /day is inserted. Furthermore, results from Arrow study are  expected.  These  issues  are  further  discussed  in  the  following  safety  and  pharmacovigilance sections.

## 4.2 Clinical safety

No new safety data have been generated specifically with the scored tablets of Combivir.

Data on treatment with the combination of the components zidovudine/lamivudine in patients less than 12 years of age is provided by the randomised, doubleblind, study CNAA3006 (n=205). However, this study  in  children  aged  between  six  months  and  13  years  did  not  evaluate  the  new  formulation  of Combivir which is proposed in this current application, i.e. the tablets with a scored break line. Study CNAA3006 compared Combivir + abacavir (n=102) to Combivir alone (n=103). Results show that less than 10% of participants in each arm experienced a treatment limiting adverse events (AE); nausea/ vomiting were the AE most frequently associated with Combivir + abacavir, were generally transient and did not lead to discontinuation of the study drug. Furthermore, incidences of grades 3 and 4 hepatic, haematologic, pancreatic, and renal toxicities occurred infrequently in both arms

In addition study APV29005, which investigated subjects aged 2 to 18 years receiving different dosing regimes  of  boosted  and  unboosted  Fosamprenavir,  once  a  day  (QD)  and  twice  a  day  (BID)  dosing (Fosamprenavir  BID,  Fosamprenavir  /Ritonavir  BID,  oral  suspension  or  tablets)  included  seven subjects treated with zidovudine/lamivudine).

These studies did not suggest there is a difference in the adverse event profile of zidovudine/lamivudine in children under the age of 12 years compared with adolescents and adults.

## 5 Pharmacovigilance system

## 5.1 Risk Management Plan (RMP)

As an enlarged paediatric population will be exposed with this new formulation the CHMP requested the  MAH  to  submit  a  RMP  for  Combivir  scored  tablets.  The  RMP  should  take  into  account  the efficacy  and  safety  concerns  related  to  the  use  of  Combivir  in  this  new  paediatric  population,  as detailed in this assessment report. Furthermore, the MAH should consider an educational program for prescribers and parents or caregivers to ensure that the dosing regimen should be applied as indicated.

The MAH has submitted a RMP and identified the following important potential risks with the use of Combivir paediatric scored tablet:

▪ Dosing recommendations resulting in over exposure

The pharmacokinetic population PK model that was used as the basis for the Monte Carlo simulations provides  good  predictions  of  AUC(0-24)  values,  however,  Cmax  values  then  tend  to  be  biased  to higher values. It is important to note that current dosing recommendations for paediatric patients result in higher exposures than exposures for adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Inhomogeneous dosing regimen in children weighing 21 to 30 kg

In the pharmacokinetic population PK model, Cmax for both lamivudine and zidovudine were higher for the Half tab/Full tablet regimen, for the &gt; 21 to 30 Kg weight group, compared to the homogenous TID regimen.

-  about zidovudine safety, increased zidovudine Cmax may increase the percentage of patients who experience  adverse  effects  such  as  gastrointestinal  events,  which  are  more  generally  believed  to  be associated  with  plasma  concentrations;  if  gastrointestinal  intolerance  occurs,  then  a  0.5  tablet  three times a day(TID) regimen with lower Cmax values may improve tolerability, however it is noted that this  regimen  would  be  less  patient  friendly;  conversely,  it  is  unlikely  that  zidovudine  associated haematological events (e.g. anaemia) would increase as this is generally considered more associated with overall exposure (AUC).
- about zidovudine efficacy, the potential effect on efficacy and development of resistance is expected to be minimal if any, since phosphorylation steps would not be affected and taking into consideration the half-life for zidovudine-TP (~ 7 hours) which should be sufficient to maintain efficacious levels with  minimal  risk  for  the  development  of  resistance.  This  is  supported  in  part  by  a  study  which examined the short term viral load decline following monotherapy of zidovudine administered as 600 mg once daily versus 300 mg twice daily which demonstrated similar viral load declines over 14 days.
-  about  lamivudine  safety,  the  increase  in  lamivudine  AUC  and  Cmax  is  not  considered  to  have clinical relevance with respect to adverse events, regarding results of the original dose ranging study in pediatrics that examined larger doses up to 10 mg/kg BID during 48 weeks; moreover, supportive data in  the  adult  dose  ranging  trial,  which  examined  doses  from  0.25  mg/kg  BID  up  to  10  mg/kg  BID, showed similar adverse event profiles across all dose groups.
-  about lamivudine efficacy, the half-life for the active lamivudine-TP is 16 hours, which should be sufficient  to  maintain  efficacious  levels,  and  this  antiretrovial  agent  is  currently  approved  for  once daily dosing in adults. Since changes in phosphorylation are not observed with maturation, it is likely that the inhomogenous BID dosing will have similar efficacy to a 'homogenous' twice daily.
- Risk of Choking Associated with Tablets in younger Children

There is a potential risk of choking (false route) associated with the half or whole scored tablets of Combivir in children &lt; six years of age, although there are currently no data to indicate the likely level of this risk. Techniques and strategies have been developed to enable training of young children (&lt;4 years or &lt;20kg) to successfully swallow solid tablets and capsules. Therefore, children anticipated to be at risk of choking should either be properly trained to swallow the solid form or else prescribed the oral solution of lamivudine and zidovudine which has been specifically formulated for this population.

## ▪ Carcinogenicity in Children exposed to NRTIs

Preclinical  studies  with  certain  NRTIs  have  revealed  some  carcinogenic  potential  in  rodents  and transplacental  carcinogenicity  data  are  included  in  the  EU  SPC  for  Combivir.  However  current information from clinical studies and widespread clinical use has not revealed any clinical concerns: there is some limited data from longer-term follow up of children exposed in utero and neonatally to AZT (zidovudine) +/- lamivudine, who were enrolled in PACTG 219/076 or in the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS). No tumours of any kind were observed in exposed children.

The  assessment  of  the  risk  for  cancer  in  children  exposed  to  antiretroviral  medicinal  products  was considered not feasible to be performed within the planned MITOC study on mitochondrial toxicity in children exposed to NRTIs, but rather via linkage of HIV and cancer registries.

## Together to routine pharmacovigilance, additional pharmacovigilance activities are considered by the MAH:

The  ongoing  paediatric  trial,  the ARROW  Study ,  which  is  an  independent  investigator  study, sponsored and co-ordinated by the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, London. The MAH is providing support in the form of antiviral drug supply, including scored solid forms of Combivir.

ARROW is a 5 year open-label randomised trial evaluating two strategic approaches for management of antiretroviral therapy in symptomatic HIV infected infants and children in Africa. Recruitment will take place over 18 months, with a maximum follow up of 5 years. 1200 children (6 months to 17 years old) will be enrolled from 4 sites in Africa (800 Uganda (3 sites), 400 Zimbabwe (1 site). Dosing of patients in ARROW is undertaken according to the weightbased dosing bands described in the WHO

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2006 Infant and Children Treatment Guidelines and includes the 'inhomogeneous' whole tab/half tab dosing. Dosing for participants in ARROW is consistent with the dosing proposals described in the Type II variations for scored tablets of Epivir (lamivudine) and Combivir.

The ARROW study started recruitment in Uganda in March 2007 and in Zimbabwe in May 2007 and has  already  enrolled  patients  who  are  receiving  scored  tablets.  The  study  ARROW  may  provide information regarding over exposure, dosing regimes and choking as adverse events will be reported and monitored.

Furthermore, the ARROW pharmacokinetic substudy is planned to address two distinct questions. Part I will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the scored tablets of Combivir, Epivir and Ziagen, including switch from twice to once daily dosing where appropriate. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Efavirenz (EFV) capsules  or  tablets  once  daily  will  also  be  measured.  Part  II  will  address  an  additional  question regarding the switch from liquid to solid formulations in young children in resource-limited settings.

Upon CHMP request, the MAH committed to submit a proactive pharmacovigilance survey and to submit a safety review focusing on Combivir paediatric scored tablets every 6 month.

## Risk minimisation plan

For  important  potential  risks  and  missing  information,  routine  risk  minimisation  activities  are considered to be sufficient.

For inhomogeneous dosing regimen in children weighing 21 to 30 kg, the MAH is considering the usefulness  of  an  educational  program  to  prescribers  and  caregivers.  Planned  activities  include consultation with paediatric experts and Key Opinion Leaders as well as careful consideration of the practical needs for implementation of any program.

A  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  for  Combivir  highlighting  the  safety  concerns  with lamivudine and zidovudine is presented below:

## 6 Overall discussion and benefit risk assessment

The CHMP considers that this new formulation is needed and welcomed. Indeed, the development of a scored  tablet  of  Combivir  answers  a  medical  need  insofar  that  fixed  dose  combinations  are  of particular interest for paediatric patients due to the well known problems in adherence to therapy in this target population. This is especially critical in view of the bad taste of the oral solutions available for the paediatric population.

The  development  of  a  scored  tablet  raised  two  critical  difficulties;  the  switch  of  the  zidovudine regimen from a three times a day to two times a day and the proposed inhomogeneous dosing regimen of Combivir.

The demonstration provided by the MAH for the switch of the zidovudine posology from a three times a day to a two times a day regimen relies on modelling with no new clinical data. Nevertheless, it has to  be  recognised that the twice daily regimen of zidovudine in paediatric patients is widely used in clinical practice and the recent WHO/PENTA support has reinforced such a use, as well as national guidelines.

In  view  of  the  data  provided  by  the  MAH,  the  zidovudine Cmax  values  obtained  with  the  new proposed regimen with scored tablets are expected to be higher and the MAH recognised that there was a concern regarding the possible increased frequency of gastro-intestinal events. Therefore, the MAH was asked to give reassurance that the higher exposure of zidovudine by intake is unlikely to alter the safety profile of the drug in the target paediatric population.

In response to this concern the MAH committed to perform a proactive pharmacovigilance survey and to submit a safety review focusing on Combivir paediatric scored tablets every 6 month. If applicable, the MAH should systematically explore a regimen for diminishing these events (e.g. by either taking 3 times half tablet or by starting zidovudine therapy with the oral solution and switching to the tablet formulation after a few weeks). Within this variation the SPC is updated in order to warn prescribers for the possibly increased risk of adverse events. Furthermore, a statement on the possibility to change the dosing schedule in case of GI-intolerance by taking 3 half tablets of Combivir a day is inserted. Moreover, the ARROW study is ongoing that is expected to further substantiate the PK and safety of Combivir scored tablet.

The MAH also committed to explore whether administration of crushed tablets with small amounts of semi-solid food or liquid is possible from a pharmaceutical quality point of view. This is proposed to be done within a follow-up measure to this variation.

Finally, the MAH committed to submit a type II variation for Retrovir to harmonise the posology with that of Combivir (i.e. change from a TID to a BID regimen).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall,  given  that  this  scored  tablet  is  expected  to  simplify  the  use  of  this  fixed  combination  in children, this type II variation is approvable taking into consideration the changes to the SPC, labelling and PL and the commitments to submit the above requested follow up measures and type II variation.

## 7 Changes to the product information

## SPC

## Section 3 'Pharmaceutical form'

Introduction of score tablets as requested by the MAH.

## Section 4.1 'Therapeutic indication'

The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  extension  of  indication  to  paediatric  patients  and  replacement  of  film coated tablets by scored film coated tablets as requested by the MAH.

The approved indication is as follows:

'Combivir is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (see section 4.2).'

## Section 4.2 'Posology and method of administration'

The  MAH proposed to revise  section  4.2  to  reflect  the  different  dosing  regimen  based  on  children weight. This section was further updated upon CHMP request to include a statement informing that the dosing  regimen  for  paediatric  patients  weighing  14-30  kg  is  based  primarily  on  pharmacokinetic modelling and supported by data from clinical  studies  using  the  individual  components  lamivudine and zidovudine.

Since a pharmacokinetic overexposure of zidovudine can occur a statement was introduced to request a  close  safety  monitoring  is  warranted  in  this  group  of  patients.  Furthermore,  if  gastrointestinal intolerance occurs in patients weighing 21 to 30 kg, an alternative dosing schedule with one-half tablet taken thrice daily can be applied in attempt to improve tolerability.

Combivir tablets  should not  be  used  for  children  weighing  less  than  14  kg,  since  doses  can  not  be appropriately adjusted for the weight of the child.

## Section 5.2 'Pharmacokinetic properties'

The  MAH  proposed  to  introduce  a  sentence  on  pharmacokinetics  in  children.  This  sentence  is extracted from the Retrovir (zidovudine) SPC.

Following  CHMP  comments  the  MAH  has  revised  this  section  to  be  in  line  with  the  section  4.2 CHMP.

The PL was updated accordingly.

The MAH took the opportunity of this variation to split the outer carton and bottle label.
