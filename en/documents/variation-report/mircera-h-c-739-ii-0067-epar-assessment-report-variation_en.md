## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Roche Registration GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 9 May 2018 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                               | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.4                 | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Update of sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update the paediatric information based on results from phase II dose finding study NH 19707 (Dolphin): An Open-Label, Multi-Center, Multiple Dose Study to Determine the Optimum Starting Dose of Intravenous Mircera for Maintenance Treatment of Anemia in Paediatric Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Hemodialysis; listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

The MAH has provided the results of a standalone Dolphin study (NH19707) concerning PK in children to support the proposed amendments to the product information, sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2. This study is part of the PIP which also includes two additional studies (i.e. NH19708 and pop-PK/PD studies) and whose data are pending. The first one (NH19708) is a phase 2 study designed to ascertain the starting dose of Mircera given subcutaneously to paediatric patients with CKD anaemia on dialysis or not yet on dyalisis when switching from epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa. The second one is a population PK/PD model including adult data from previous studies and children data from NH19707 and NH19708 studies.

Considering that there are some uncertainties about efficacy results from study NH19707 and also that the results of NH19708 and pop-PK/PD studies are pending, for the time being changes to sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC including paediatric information are not recommended. In addition, according to the Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics only evidence from relevant studies supporting the indication should be included in this section. The current indication is limited to adults so the inclusion of data on children in section 5.1 is not supported at this stage.

According to the data provided in this variation procedure the benefit-risk balance of Mircera remains positive in the currently authorised conditions for use, which is limited to the adult population. No changes to the SmPc are recommended for the time being.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following change:

## 5. Introduction

## Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease and anemia associated with chronic kidney disease in children

## Chronic Kidney Disease in Children

Childhood chronic kidney disease (CKD) presents clinical features that are specific and totally particular to the paediatric age group, such as the impact of the disease on growth. In addition, some of the typical characteristics  of  paediatric  CKD,  such  as  the  etiology  or  cardiovascular  complications,  represent variables, not only influencing the health of the patient during childhood, but also having an impact on the life of the adult that this child will become (Becherucci et al 2016).

Data on the epidemiology of CKD in children who are on dialysis is available from the North American Paediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) and the United States Renal Data System (USRDS). Information regarding paediatric patients who receive maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has been captured since 1992. Children with CKD represent a very small percentage of the total CKD population (NAPRTCS 2014 Annual Report and USRDS 2016 Annual Report).

The 2014 NAPRTCS registry spans more than 25 years and has collected information on the transplants of over  11,186  children.  As  of  January  1,  2014  (data  base  closure  for  the  2014  report),  12,189  renal transplants had been reported for 11,186 paediatric patients. This represents 586 new transplants and 554 patients with their first registry transplant since the 2010 Annual Report.

In 2014, the total number of children in the United States who had not yet received a primary kidney transplant  and  were  on  maintenance  dialysis  was  7045  (NAPRTCS  2014  Annual  Report).  However, twenty-five  percent  of  primary  transplants  were  preemptive,  as  these  patients  had  never  received maintenance dialysis.

Of the 9,721 children included in the USRDS report (USRDS 2016 Annual Report), adolescents and young adults between the ages of 0 and 21 years with prevalent end stage renal disease (ESRD) as of December 31,  2014,  kidney  transplant  was  the  most  common  treatment  modality  (6825  [70.2%]),  followed  by hemodialysis  (1745  [18.0%])  and  peritoneal  dialysis  (1122  [11.5%]).  Over  80%  of  prevalent  children ages 5-13 years have a kidney transplant. This equates to a point prevalence per million population of 18.5 for hemodialysis, 11.7 for peritoneal dialysis, and 69.8 for transplant.

## Anemia Due to Chronic Kidney Disease in Children

Anemia is a major consequence of CKD. Similar to adults, many paediatric patients with CKD suffer from normocytic,  normochromic  anemia.  Erythropoietin  deficiency  is  the  main  cause  of  anemia  in  these patients.  The  symptoms  associated  with  anemia  include  fatigue,  decreased  exercise  tolerance,  cardiac dysfunction  and  impaired  cognitive  function.  Anemia  also  results  in  increased  risk  of  development  of cardiovascular disease and increased mortality (Foley et al 1996). The mechanism of anemia due to CKD in children is identical to that in adults.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## Current Treatment Options

Exogenous replacement of erythropoietin by erythropoietic agents is an established method for treatment of anemia in CKD. This therapy can be divided into two phases: the initial correction phase, during which hemoglobin  (Hb)  levels  rise  and  reach  plateau  levels,  and  the  subsequent  maintenance  phase  during which plateau levels are maintained by regular erythropoietin administration.

Epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa are approved treatments in the US for anemia associated with CKD in paediatric patients. Epoetin alfa is indicated in patients aged 1 month to 16 years of age for the treatment of  anemia  associated  with  CKD  requiring  dialysis  (US  Package  Insert,  Epogen  2014).  As  noted  in  the product labelling, the safety profile of epoetin alfa in paediatric patients on dialysis appears to be similar to that of adults.

In Europe epoetin alfa and beta are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (CRF):

- in adults and children aged 1 to 18 years on haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis.

-  in  adults  with  renal  insufficiency  not  yet  undergoing  dialysis  for  the  treatment  of  severe  anaemia  of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms.

Darbepoetin  alfa  is  indicated  for  the  correction  and  maintenance  treatment  of  anemia  associated  with CKD in paediatric patients (1-&lt; 18 years of age) on dialysis and patients not on dialysis (US Package Insert, Aranesp 2016). The darbepoetin alfa labeling states that safety and efficacy were similar between adults and paediatric patients with CKD when darbepoetin alfa was used for initial treatment of anemia or patients were transitioned from treatment with epoetin alfa to darbepoetin alfa. The long-term safety and efficacy of darbepoetin were assessed in a prospective registry study of 319 patients treated for up to 2 years (Schaefer et al 2015). No new safety signals were found for darbepoetin treatment and anemia was effectively managed in these patients.

In Europe darbepoetin alfa has the same indication approved in US.

These  approved  erythropoietic  agents  are  administered  by  intravenous  (IV)  or  subcutaneous  (SC) injection either three times a week (epoetin alfa) or once a week or once every 2 weeks (darbepoetin alfa), with the IV route being recommended for patients on dialysis.

## Background of Mircera

## Physical and Chemical Characteristics

Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera) is a chemically synthesized continuous erythropoietin receptor  activator.  Mircera  differs  from  erythropoietin  (EPO)  through  integration  of  an  amide  bond between  an  amino  group  and  methoxy  polyethylene  glycol-butanoic  acid.  This  results  in  a  molecular weight  of  ~60  kDa.  In  contrast  with  EPO,  Mircera  shows  different  activity  at  the  receptor  level characterized by a slower association to the receptor, reduced specific activity in vitro with an increased activity in vivo, as well as an increased half-life. These Mircera (methoxy polyethylene glycolepoetin beta) pharmacological properties allow longer (once-monthly, 1x/month) dosing intervals.

## Mircera Clinical Development in Adults

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

Mircera was first approved in 2007. It is currently approved for the treatment of symptomatic anemia associated  with  CKD  in  adult  patients,  including  those  on  dialysis  and  those  not  on  dialysis,  in  115 countries worldwide.

The global clinical development program for Mircera included 13 Phase I clinical pharmacology studies in 499  healthy  volunteers  and  24  patients  with  CKD  not  yet  on  dialysis  and  16  patients  with  CKD  on peritoneal dialysis, and 10 therapeutic studies comprising four Phase II and six Phase III studies in a total of  1789  patients  with  CKD,  including  patients  on  dialysis  and  not  on  dialysis  (Figure  below).  Three additional Phase III studies were completed post-approval (NH20052, BH17847, BH20051).

## Rationale for Paediatric Use of Mircera and Clinical Development in Paediatric Patients

The MAH is developing Mircera for maintenance treatment of anemia associated with CKD in paediatric patients  switching  from  a  stable  dose  of  another  ESA  to  Mircera.  The  Mircera  clinical  development program  in  paediatric  patients  comprises  2  studies.  The  Phase  II,  single-arm  study  NH19707,  now completed and object of the present variation procedure, assessed IV administration of Mircera every 4 weeks in the maintenance setting in paediatric patients aged 5-17 years on hemodialysis after switching from another ESA. A second paediatric study of SC administration of Mircera every 4 weeks is planned in children  either  on  dialysis  (hemodialysis  or  peritoneal  dialysis)  or  not  yet  on  dialysis,  also  in  the maintenance setting (Study NH19708).

## Regulatory background

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

The  approval  of  Mircera  in  July  2007  included  a  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP)  as  post  approval commitment. In February 2009 the PDCO and MAH agreed to a PIP which consisted of the following two studies:

Phase II study NH19707 with primary objectives

·  To  determine  the  starting  dose  of  intravenous  (iv)  Mircera  in  paediatric  patients  with  CKD  on hemodialysis  when  switching  from  stable  maintenance  treatment  with  epoetin  alfa,  epoetin  beta  or darbepoetin alfa,

- To demonstrate changes in hemoglobin (Hb) over time in response to different iv doses of Mircera.

Phase III study NH19708 with primary objective:

· To confirm the optimal dose of Mircera (sc administration) selected in the previous exploratory dosefinding study, in a larger group of paediatric patients with CKD on dialysis and not yet on dialysis.

The Phase II study (NH19707, also known as 'DOLPHIN') is completed. The CSR was submitted to EMA on July 2016 (seq.0106) and the CHMP concluded the review in December 2016. The primary objectives of this  study  were  to  determine  the  starting  dose  of  MIRCERA  in  paediatric  patients  with  CKD  on hemodialysis  when  switching  from  stable  maintenance  treatment  with  epoetin  alfa,  epoetin  beta  or darbepoetin alfa and to demonstrate changes in Hb over time in response to different iv doses of Mircera in paediatric patients (5&lt;18 years) whose hemoglobin has been stabilized with previous ESA treatment.

The MAH has also performed a model-based evaluation, integrating data from both adults and children followed by model based simulations.

Since the first PIP approval in 2009, knowledge of Mircera has been extended through clinical trials and global  exposure  in  adults  of  approximately  1.9  million  patient-years.  Consequently  and  in  addition  to paediatric  data  generated  by  study  NH19707,  real-world  paediatric  data  are  available  from  the International Paediatric Dialysis Network and two independent publications on paediatric use.

Based on above the MAH considered the originally committed Phase III randomized, controlled parallel group clinical trial involving 150 children is no longer justifiable. Therefore, in September 2016, the MAH submitted a PIP modification proposing the replacement of the current approved Phase III study with a second  Phase  II  study  (using  the  same  study  number  NH19708)  of  25  evaluable  patients  to  address outstanding  questions  not  addressed  in  study  NH19707  (i.e.  administration  in  younger  children,  sc administration of Mircera and its use in pre-dialysis and peritoneal dialysis). The proposed study also aims to confirm the conversion factor when switching from stable subcutaneous maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa, and also to provide clinical evidence for the starting dose of Mircera  given  subcutaneously  in  CKD  paediatric  patients  determined  in  NH19707.  The  request  for modification  procedure  included  an  oral  explanation.  The  PDCO  concluded  in  the  final  opinion  dated February 2017, that the concept of the proposed modifications to study NH19708 would be agreeable, but with  some  additional  amendments  to  the  PIP  such  as  number  of  patients,  further  modelling  and simulation evaluations, design features of the clinical study (interim analysis, inclusion of a youngest age subset, sampling scheme, 6 month safety follow-up) and assessment of the possible risks of polyethylene glycol (PEG) accumulation.

A modified PIP, addressing PDCO concerns, for study NH19708 was submitted in June 2017 and PDCO positive opinion was received on 15th of September 2017.

The presence of RO0503821 is determined using a Sponsor's ELISA method, including streptavidin coated microtitre  plates,  biotin  labelled  anti-EPO  antibodies  and  goat  anti-mouse  IgM  conjugated  to  HRP.  The analytical  method  has  been  validated  successfully  over  the  concentration  range  150  to  4000  pg/mL (January  8,  2013),  demonstrating  sufficient  accuracy,  precision  and  reliability.  The  method  was  not

significantly  affected  by  lipaemia  or  haemolysis.  There  is  no  interference  to  the  analytical  method  for RO0503821 from EPO up to 6400 pg/mL of EPO.

The  inter-  and  intra-assay  precision  was  determined.  During  cross  validation  it  was  shown  that  the method is affected by inter-individual variability (matrix effect). The method has been successfully cross validated.  Human  serum  Hu/S/X/09/702e  or  equivalent  serum  must  be  used  as  the  blank  matrix  in simple analysis studies to eliminate potential bias due to the matrix effect.

Report  No.  1062976 :  Validation  of  a  cell-based  assay  for  the  determination  and  confirmation  of neutralizing antibodies against Mircera in human serum samples.

The  assay  has  been  validated  on  November  27,  2014.  This  direct  NAb  assay  is  based  on  growth stimulation of AS-E2 cells (expressing human low affinity EPO receptor) induced by Mircera followed by the  measurement  of  ATP  using  the  CeiiTiter  Glo®  ATP  luminescence  assay.  In  the  presence  of neutralizing  anti-Mircera  antibodies,  growth  stimulation  is  diminished  or  stopped,  depending  on  the antibody concentration.

The sensitivity of the method is 630 ng/ml positive control in pool matrix. The determined inter and intraassay precision was found to be below 17 % CV. No significant impact on the assay results by position of sample on the assay plate was observed. The assay is robust regarding cell passage numbers from 2 up to  20  and  assay  time  between  94  and  98  h.  All  haemolysed  samples  produced  positive  signals  in  the Mircera Nab assay. Therefore, analysis of haemolysed samples should be avoided. To discriminate false positive  from  true  positive  samples  a  Confirmation  Assay  using  an  alternative  stimulus  has  been established.

This cell based assay method has been shown to be sufficiently precise, accurate, selective and sensitive for the determination of neutralizing antibodies against Mircera in human  serum samples at concentrations higher than 1200 ng/ml of positive control neutralizing antibody against Mircera. However,

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

it has to be noted that the assay shows severe interference at drug levels above 6.25 ng/ml Mircera at HPC 1200 ng/ml.

The assay has been validated on November 4, 2014. This direct NAb assay is based on growth stimulation of  AS-E2 cells (expressing human low affinity EPO receptor) induced by Erythropoeitin followed by the measurement of ATP using the CeiiTiter Glo® ATP luminescence assay. In the presence of neutralizing anti-EPO antibodies, growth stimulation is diminished or stopped, depending on the antibody concentration.

The sensitivity of the method is 121 ng/mL positive control antibody. The determined inter- and intraassay precision was found to be below 19 % CV. No significant impact on the assay results by position of sample on the assay plate was observed. The assay is robust regarding cell passage numbers from 2 up to 20 and assay time between 94 and 98 h. All hemolyzed samples produce positive signals in EPO Nab assay.  Therefore,  analysis  of  hemolyzed  samples  should  be  avoided.  Lipemic  samples  lead  to  false positive signals in 20 % of samples tested. To discriminate false positive from true positive samples a Confirmation Assay using an alternative stimulus has been established.

This cell based assay method has been shown to be sufficiently precise, accurate, selective and sensitive for the determination of neutralizing antibodies against EPO in human serum samples at concentrations higher than 200 ng/ml of positive control neutralizing antibody against EPO. However, it has to be noted that the assay shows severe interference at drug levels above 6.25 ng/mL Mircera at HPC 400 ng/mL.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

The  MAH  submitted  the  reports  for  analytical  methods  used  for  the  determination  of  methoxy polyethylene  glycol-epoetin  beta  (Mircera)  concentrations  in  serum  (study  1054621);  and  for  the characterization  of  anti-Mircera  (peg-EPO;  studies  1046299  y  1062976)  or  anti-erythropoietin  (EPO; studies 1046298 y 1062977) antibodies. These methods were also used to detect anti-Mircera antibodies (ELISA; studies 1046298 y 1046299) as well as neutralizing antibodies (bioassays; studies 1062976 and 1062977).

## 1.3. Rapporteur's discussion

## Analytical methods

Analytical  methods  submitted  in  this  variation  were  validated  within  the  period  2010-2014,  and  are considerate adequate.

## 1.4. Clinical pharmacology

## Methods and results

The PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) analysis included in this application were performed on data from a total of 587 patients; 524 Mircera (methoxy polyethylene glycolepoetin beta) adults and 63 paediatric patients. The data from paediatric patients used in these two population analyses are from study NH19707.

Prior to the conduct of study NH19707, no data were available on the clinical pharmacology of Mircera in paediatric  patients.  Study  NH19707  aimed  to  determine  the  starting  dose  of  intravenous  Mircera  in paediatric  patients  with  CKD  on  hemodialysis  when  switching  from  stable  maintenance  treatment  with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa and to demonstrate changes in Hb over time in response to different doses of Mircera. The study also aimed to evaluate the PK of Mircera in paediatric patients.

## Overview of Study Design

Mircera was administered once every 4 weeks IV for 20 weeks in paediatric patients with CKD receiving hemodialysis who switched from other ESAs (epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa). An optional safety extension period included up to an additional year of treatment for stable patients, however PK samples were  only  collected  during  the  core  study  period.  After  the  first  administration  of  Mircera,  dose adjustments were permitted at every dose (once every 4 weeks) to maintain target Hb levels, which were measured  once  a  week  during  the  core  study  period  and  once  every  four  weeks  during  the  safety extension. The protocol foresaw different groups with different conversion factors related to their previous ESA dose to find the optimum Mircera starting dose. The first group comprised patients who started with an  intermediate  conversion  factor  dose  (Group  1  hereinafter).  In  the  adaptive  design,  this  conversion factor  proved  inadequate  and  a  second  group  (Group  2)  was  enrolled  for  treatment  with  a  higher conversion factor dose, double that of Group 1.

## Dosing Rationale

The conversion factors tested in Group 1 were directly derived from experience in adults receiving Mircera intravenously  and  from  the  results  of  a  published  study  of  darbepoetin  alfa  conducted  in  paediatric patients (Warady et al 2006). As the patients included in this study were already on stable maintenance doses of an ESA prior to conversion to Mircera, and assuming a linear relationship across dose ranges, the use of a conversion factor resulted in a Mircera dose that was proportional to the previous ESA dose,

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

the latter being adjusted according to body weight; thus the starting Mircera dose indirectly accounted for weight-adjusted dose requirements in paediatric patients. As noted above, the adaptive design allowed for a second group to test a higher or lower conversion factor according to findings in Group 1.

The conversion factors tested are shown in tables 1a and 1b (conversion from epoetin alfa or beta and conversion from darbepoetin alfa).

| High conversion factora (Group 2)       | 4 x previous weekly darbepoetin alfa dose (μg) /0.55 | Once every 4 weeks    |

The  clinical  pharmacology  data  from  NH19707  were  analyzed  using  two  different  approaches,  a  noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis and a model-based analysis of PK and PD data.

## Sampling Schedule in Study NH19707

At Week 9, after 3 doses of Mircera, 3 samples were collected: the first sample before dosing, the second sample 2 hours after dosing, and the third sample 48 hours after dosing. At 12 other time-points, a single sample was collected (week 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 and 20).

## Results from the Non-Compartmental Pharmacokinetic Analysis:

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

Twelve patients in Group 1 and 34 patients in Group 2 had sufficient PK data available at Week 9 to be included in the non-compartmental PK analysis. The PK parameters at Week 9 are summarized by group in  Table  2.  At  Week  9,  maximum  serum  drug  concentration  was  observed  at  2.0  hours.  The  mean apparent  terminal  half-life  of  elimination  calculated  from  non-compartmental  analysis  methods  was approximately 121-147 hours (geometric mean), which is similar to values reported in adults (134 hours in adult CKD patients on peritoneal dialysis). The highest exposure was observed as expected in Group 2, with a geometric mean Cmax of 66100 pg/mL and a geometric mean AUC0-tau of 7170000 pg · hr/mL.

## COMPARISON AND ANALYSES OF RESULTS ACROSS STUDIES

Model-based evaluation and simulation (including data from study NH19707 and several studies in adults) were performed to support the characterization of clinical pharmacology following intravenous administration of Mircera to paediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years.

A  model-based  approach  has  been  used  throughout  Mircera  clinical  development.  Population  PK  and PK/PD models were initially developed based on adult Phase III data to support drug approval in adults. When  the  results  from  study  NH19707  became  available,  models  were  re-evaluated  by  incorporating paediatric data.

NH19707 data were pooled with adult Phase II and Phase III data. The pooled PK and PK/PD analyses allow a comparison between adult and paediatric data using a single analysis. The PK and PK/PD analyses were performed on 587 patients: 524 adults and 63 children aged from 6 to &lt;18 years with at least 1 determination of Mircera concentration. Paediatric patients were on hemodialysis and received Mircera IV. The majority of adult patients (n=407) were on hemodialysis. Fewer patients were on peritoneal dialysis or not on dialysis (n=52 and 65, respectively). Adult patients received Mircera IV or SC. The population

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

PK and PK/PD analyses aimed to assess the PK and PD properties of Mircera in paediatric patients and whether these properties differ from those in adults.

The results from the pooled population PK and PK/PD analyses and impact on Mircera development in paediatric drug development are summarized below:

## Pharmacokinetic Findings

-  The  same  structural  PK  model  as  in  the  previous  analysis  based  on  Phase  III  data  only,  i.e.  1compartment  model  with  first  order  absorption  and  elimination  processes,  was  used  to  describe  the paediatric data.
- The estimated clearance was 0.74 L/day and the volume of distribution 3.5 L. The estimated clearance with this model was similar to the estimated clearance based on modelling of Phase III adult data (0.75 L/day) whereas the estimated volume was lower than in the previous model (4.7 L).
- Positive body-weight effects on clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V), and positive age effect on V were confirmed, relationships were consistent across the full age and body weight ranges (see Figure below).
- Once those covariate effects were taken into account, no difference in PK between adult and paediatric patients could be observed: age and body weight capture the differences between both populations (see figure below).

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

Figure  2.  Distribution  of  Random  Effect  for  Clearance  (ETA.CL)  and  Volume  of  Distribution (ETA.V) in Adult and Paediatric Populations

<!-- image -->

Comparable Mircera exposure was observed in both populations at the end of the evaluation period.

## PK/PD Findings

-  The  population  PK/PD  model  developed  with  Phase  III  data  could  be  applied  to  the  pooled  data including the data from study NH19707.
-  No  difference  in  Mircera  dependent  PK/PD  parameters  was  observed  between  paediatric  and  adult patients showing that the Mircera exposure response relationship is similar in both populations (see figure below).

Figure 3. Distribution of Random Effect for Drug-Dependent PK/PD Parameters in Adult and Paediatric Populations

<!-- image -->

Smax: maximum increase in Hb production rate relative to baseline production rate; SC50: concentration of Mircera at which 50% of the maximum increase is achieved.

- A positive body weight effect was found on the PK/PD model parameter representing the theoretical Hb value at baseline prior any ESA treatment (Hb0). This effect is driven by the paediatric population and seems to be in accordance with generally higher Hb levels observed in adults.
- A  positive  effect  of  previous  ESA  dose  on  SC50,  PK/PD  model  parameter  representing  the  Mircera concentration at which 50% of the maximum increase is achieved. Indeed patients receiving higher

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

ESA dose before switching to Mircera require higher concentration of Mircera to achieve 50% of the maximum increase.

- Higher inter-individual variability in PK/PD parameters i.e. 222% coefficient of variation (CV) on SC50 compared to PK parameters 45% CV on CL.

The  clinical  impact  of  the  body  weight  and  age  effects  on  PK  parameters  is  marginal  because  the variability in PK/PD is much higher than PK variability. The main covariate effect, considered by the MAH, explaining variability in Hb response is the previous ESA dose. This justifies the current practice to use a conversion factor based on the previous ESA dose when switching to Mircera. As previous ESA dose is body-weight adjusted, body weight is indirectly taken into account in the Mircera dose. The high interpatient variability in Mircera PK/PD parameters also justifies the current clinical practice of adjustment of Mircera doses based on monitoring of Hb levels during treatment.

## Immunogenicity Results in Study NH19707

In study NH19707, blood samples to measure anti-erythropoietin antibodies and antidrug antibodies were collected on day 1 (before the first drug administration), at week 13 and at final visit of the Core period, and at final visit of the safety extension period.

No patients tested positive for erythropoietin antibodies or anti-drug antibodies at any time during the study, including the safety extension period. For this reason, there is no information about correlation between immunogenicity and PK, PD, safety or efficacy.

## Rapporteur's discussion

The clinical pharmacology of Mircera in paediatric patients is based on data from study NH19707 and it was  analyzed  using  two  different  approaches,  a  non-compartmental  pharmacokinetic  analysis  and  a model-based analysis of PK and PD data.

The NH19707 study is a phase II, open-label, multicentre, dose finding study to determine the optimum starting dose of Mircera in children aged 5-17 years old receiving hemodialysis who switched from other ESAs  (epoetin  alfa/beta  or  darbepoetin  alfa).  Two  groups  using  different  conversion  factors  related  to their previous ESA dose to find the optimum Mircera starting dose were included. The first one comprised patients who started with an intermediate conversion factor dose (Group 1). In the adaptive design, this conversion factor proved to be inadequate and a second group (Group 2) was enrolled using a higher conversion factor dose, double that of Group 1.

In this study, PK analysis was done with data from 12 out of 16 and 34 out of 48 patients from group 1 and 2 respectively. Patients included were from 5 to 18 years of age which does not allow drawing any conclusions regarding patients younger than 5 years. Due to fact that the MAH did not provide the age of patients  included  for  PK  analysis  it  is  not  possible  to  know  if  PK  samples  obtained  are  enough  to characterize  PK  profile  in  all  age  groups  (i.e  children  and  adolescents)  of  the  paediatric  population.  In order to ascertain the starting dose of Mircera in children from 3 months to 18 years old the amended agreed PIP included a new study (NH19708). A population PK will also be conducted with pooled data from  the  former  study  and  existing  PK/PD  models  previously  developed  in  adults  and  children  (study NH19707). When the whole data are available, the comparison with the adult data and a depth discussion of the results, instead of a crude data presentation, will be helpful to describe PK profile in children and establishing the correct posology in this population.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

Samples were obtained at Week 9, after 3 doses of Mircera. At this point 3 samples were collected: the first sample before dosing, the second sample 2 hours after dosing, and the third sample 48 hours after dosing. At 12 other time-points, a single sample was collected (week 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19 and 20). These samples provided PK parameters of Mircera with a serum geometric mean Cmax of 66.1  ng/mL,  a  geometric  mean  AUC0-tau  of  7170  ng.hr/mL  and  an  apparent  mean  half-life  of approximately  121  hours,  based  on  conversion  factor  established  for  group  2.  However,  it  should  be taken  into  account  that  there  are  doubts  about  whether  the  selection  of  this  conversion  factor  is appropriate (see efficacy discussion).

The  MAH  also  conducted  a  pop-PK/PD  analysis  with  data  from  NH19707  study  in  children  and  adult phase II and phase III data whose results have not been presented in this variation. These results will be completed by the ones of the ongoing studies included in the agreed PIP (i.e NH19708 and a new popPK/PD  analysis).    Specifically  these  studies  will  provide  data  on  posology  and  definitive  PK  data  in patients from 3 months of age and older as well as information about the subcutaneous administration of Mircera. In the Rapporteur's view, the entire PK data package in children should be assessed as a whole once the results of all the studies are available.

The MAH is proposing to include some PK data in children in section 5.2 of the SmPC based on partial PK data. Since relevant studies are still ongoing and that their results will be key to have a complete picture of  the  Mircera  PK  profile  in  children,  the  proposed  information  to  be  included  in  the  SmPC  seems,  at present,  premature.  Moreover,  such  data  are  based  on  an  initial  Mircera  dose  that  should  be  further justified.  Therefore,  the  inclusion  of  the  proposed  data  in  the  mentioned  sections  of  the  SmPC  is  not supported at this stage (see also efficacy discussion).

## 1.5. Efficacy data

## Methods - analysis of data submitted

The efficacy is based on the results of a single clinical study, NH19707, supported by PK/PD model-based which is described and discussed above in clinical pharmacology section.

Study NH19707 is a phase II, dose-finding study, open-label, multicenter, multiple dose study of Mircera administered  once  every  4  weeks  intravenously  (IV)  for  20  weeks  in  paediatric  patients  with  chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving hemodialysis who switched from other erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESAs)  (epoetin  alfa/beta  or  darbepoetin  alfa).  After  the  first  administration  of  methoxy  polyethylene glycol-epoetin  beta  (Mircera),  dose  adjustments  were  permitted  to  maintain  target  hemoglobin  (Hb) levels,  which  were  measured  once  a  week  during  the  core  study  period.  The  evaluation  period  for  Hb levels  was  Week  17-21.Patients  who  completed  the  20  weeks  of  treatment  and  who  adequately maintained Hb levels were eligible to enter an optional 52-week safety extension period with the same dosing frequency.

In  this  study,  the  protocol  foresaw  different  groups  with  different  conversion  factors  related  to  their previous ESA dose to find the optimum Mircera starting dose. The first group comprised patients who started with an intermediate conversion factor dose (Group 1 hereinafter). If this intermediate conversion factor proved inadequate, a second group (Group 2) was enrolled for treatment with a higher or lower conversion factor dose.

Figure 4. Core study design

<!-- image -->

The conversion factors tested in Group 1 were directly derived from experience in adults receiving Mircera intravenously  and  from  the  results  of  a  published  study  of  darbepoetin  alfa  conducted  in  paediatric patients (Warady et al 2006). As the patients included in this study were already on stable maintenance doses of an ESA prior to conversion to Mircera, and assuming a linear relationship across dose ranges, the use of a conversion factor resulted in a Mircera dose that was proportional to the previous ESA dose, thus correcting for the higher weight-adjusted dose requirements in paediatric patients.

The  first  16  patients  were  enrolled  in  Group  1.  After  16  patients  had  completed  at  least  16  weeks  of treatment, a preliminary assessment of the safety and efficacy of Mircera was made.

For the preliminary efficacy assessment, the uncorrected 90% confidence interval (CI) for the average Hb change from baseline to weeks 14-16 was calculated. If the lower limit of the CI was ≥-1 g/dL, the upper limit ≤1 g/dL and the number of dose increases and decreases had been approximately balanced across the  patients,  no  other  dose  group  would  have  been  started,  and  additional  patients  would  have  been recruited to receive the same Mircera dose.

This condition was not met; the lower limit of the CI for average Hb change was below -1 g/dL (see Table 8). A high-conversion-factor group as per the study design was therefore initiated (Group 2) based on a conversion factor from previous ESA dose, double that of Group 1 (4 x previous weekly epoetin dose [IU] / 125 or 4 x previous weekly darbepoetin alfa dose [μg] / 0.55).

A preliminary assessment suggested higher than expected variability in Hb; so the protocol was amended to increase the minimum size of Group 2 from 25 to 36 patients. Replacement of patients not completing at  least  18  weeks  of  treatment  led  to  a  total  of  48  patients  in  Group  2.  The  primary  analysis  was performed once all patients of this optimum dose group had completed the core study (visit Week 21).

Patients completing the 20 weeks of treatment with Hb within ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and within the target range of 10-12 g/dL were eligible to enter an optional 52-week safety extension period. During this  period,  the  patients  continued  to  receive  Mircera  once  every  4  weeks  and  Hb  concentration measurements occurred less frequently (every 4 weeks).

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

The target population comprised paediatric patients 5 - 17 years old with clinically stable chronic renal anemia on hemodialysis treatment and who were receiving maintenance treatment with an erythropoietic agent.

The primary efficacy endpoint was as follows:

- o Change  in  Hb  concentration  (g/dL)  between  the  baseline  period  and  the  evaluation  period (weeks 17-21)

The secondary efficacy endpoints assessed were as follows:

- o Number of patients with an average Hb concentration during the evaluation period within ±1 g/dL of their baseline Hb
- o Number of  patients  with  an  average  Hb  concentration  during  the  evaluation  period  above, within or below the range of 10-12 g/dL
- o Incidence of red blood cell transfusions
- o Change in reticulocyte count (x10000 /μL) between the baseline and evaluation periods

## Finally, the following exploratory efficacy endpoints were also defined:

- o Change in dose over time
- o Change in dose between study start and evaluation period
- o The rate of rise in Hb concentration during the titration period

Change  in  Hb  concentration  (g/dL)  between  the  baseline  and  evaluation  periods  (primary  efficacy endpoint) was calculated on a per-patient basis, using an area under the curve (AUC) approach. For all analyses  concerning  Hb,  no  imputation  was  made  for  missing  values  and  analysis  was  performed  on observed cases only. Descriptive statistics of the primary endpoint were calculated. In addition, baseline covariate adjusted estimates of Hb change from baseline, by dose group, and the corresponding 95% CI were calculated from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model.

Mircera was administered by a trained healthcare professional once every 4 weeks for 20 weeks (core study period) and up to 52 additional weeks in patients who entered the safety extension period. The starting doses were based on the following conversion factors:

## Intermediate conversion factor (Group 1)

- o 4  x  previous  weekly  epoetin  dose  (IU)/250  or  4  x  previous  weekly  darbepoetin  alfa  dose (μg)/1.1.

## High conversion factor (Group 2)

- o 4  x  previous  weekly  epoetin  dose  (IU)/125  or  4  x  previous  weekly  darbepoetin  alfa  dose (μg)/0.55.

Between July 2008 and June 2015, a total of 112 patients were screened at 28 sites  in  Belgium  (2), France (6), Germany (5), Hungary (1), Italy (1), Poland (5), Romania (1), Spain (3), Thailand (2) and Ukraine (2).

Of the 112 screened patients, 64 were enrolled (16 initially in Group 1 and then 48 in Group 2).

Replacement of patients not completing at least 18 weeks of treatment led to a total of 48 patients in Group 2.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

As shown in the following figure, 12 patients in Group 1 and 35 in Group 2 completed the evaluation period. Thirty-seven of these completers went on to participate in the optional 1-year safety extension, which was completed by 17 patients in total.

Figure 5. Patient disposition of study NH19707

During the core study period, 4 patients in Group 1 (25%) and 13 in the Group 2 (27%) withdrew from treatment. The most frequently reported reason for withdrawal was renal transplant (4 patients in Group 1  and  9  patients  in  Group  2).  Of  the  two  'other'  reasons  one  was  due  to  liver  transplant,  the  other because the department moved to another hospital.

One  patient  in  Group  2  died  during  the  core  study  period  of  intracranial  hematoma,  considered  not related to study drug.

During the extension period, 20 patients withdrew (16 due to renal transplant, two withdrew consent and a further two, at the same center, due to 'repair of the dialysis station').

During the whole study, patients were in the study for a total of 45 patient exposure years (PEY), with a mean of 0.7 PEY per patient. In the extension period 25 patients were treated for at least an additional 5 months with a total of 23.8 PEY in this period.

## Results

## Patient Demographics

Overall,  there  were  34  male  patients  (53%),  with  a  higher  representation  in  Group  1  compared  with Group 2 (see table 3). The majority of patients were Caucasian, and the mean ± SD age was 11 ± 3.2 years in Group 1 and 13 ± 3.1 years in Group 2. Younger patients (aged 5-11 years) were more strongly represented in Group 1 (56%) compared with Group 2 (33%). The youngest patient was 6 years old. The age distribution is represented graphically in figure below, showing a more evenly distributed age range

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

in  Group  1  and  one  skewed  more  towards  the  older  children  in  Group  2.  These  distributions  are  also reflected in the weight and height, with correspondingly heavier, taller children in Group 2. One 17-yearold patient in Group 2 is recorded as the single smoker.

Median Z scores for height and pre-dialysis weight were negative in both groups (height: -1.07 and 1.67,  respectively,  for  Group  1  and  Group  2;  weight  -0.87  and  -1.32,  respectively),  indicating,  as expected in this patient population, under-developed, underweight patients compared with children of the same sex and age.

The mean baseline body surface area (according to the Mosteller formula) was 1.14 and 1.24 in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively.

Figure 6. Age Distribution at Baseline in Study NH19707: ITT Population

<!-- image -->

Compared with the demographic data presented above for the overall core study population, the subset of patients who entered the safety extension had a greater proportion of males (62% versus 53%) and a higher  proportion  of  Caucasian  patients  (81%  versus  72%).  Other  demographic  characteristics  were similar to the core population.

## Baseline Laboratory Parameters

Median baseline hemoglobin levels were 11.2 g/dL in Group 1 and 11.1 g/dL in Group 2 (see table 4). Ferritin and calculated transferrin saturation levels were generally higher in Group 1 than in Group 2. Of note, overall, 12 patients (19%) had C reactive protein levels above 5 mg/L.

## Previous ESA Therapy

The median time since first ESA administration was 22 months in Group 1 and 14 months in Group 2 (see table 5). In Group 1, the last ESA administered prior to screening was darbepoetin in 8 patients (median weekly dose, 17.5 µg) and epoetin alfa/beta in 8 patients (median weekly dose, 4500 IU). In Group 2, the last ESA administered prior to screening was darbepoetin in 26 patients (median weekly dose, 20 µg) and  epoetin  alfa/beta  in  22  patients  (median  weekly  dose,  6000  IU).  For  the  patients  receiving darbepoetin,  most  patients  were  receiving  once-weekly  administrations.  For  those  patients  receiving epoetin  alfa/beta,  most  were  dosed  2-3  times  a  week,  which  is  in  accordance  with  the  posology authorized.

## Previous and Concomitant Treatments

This section describes outputs for all previous treatments and those for concomitant treatments. Previous treatments refer to treatments with a start date prior to date of first study drug, regardless of end date. Concomitant  treatments  refer  to  those  where  treatment  ended  after  the  time  of  first  study  drug, regardless of start date. With these definitions, treatments that were ongoing at baseline were considered as both prior and concomitant treatments.

## Anticoagulation Treatment

All patients had anticoagulation treatment prior to study start with the most frequently used agents being heparin sodium (3 [19%] in Group 1 and 25 [52%] in Group 2) and enoxaparin sodium (11 [69%] in Group 1 and 16 [33%] in Group 2).

## Iron Supplementation

Most patients recorded receiving iron supplementation prior to study start (58 patients [91%]); during the  study,  including  the  safety  extension  period,  iron  supplementation  was  recorded  by  15  patients (94%) in Group 1 and 47 (98%) in Group 2. The most frequently used agents were iron sucrose, ferrous gluconate, and ferric hydroxide.

## Antihypertensive Agents

Using a classification based on selected coded medication classes, at study start, 37 (58%) patients were taking  or  had  taken  'antihypertensive  and/or  diuretic  agents',  the  most  common  categories  being angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors,  calcium  channel  blocking  agents  and  'beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. There were 38 patients recorded as taking at least one of these agents during the study.

## Hemodialysis at Baseline

The median duration of hemodialysis at baseline was 1.3 years in Group 1 and just under 1 year in Group 2.  Approximately  75%  of  patients  had  been  on  hemodialysis  for  under  2.2  years,  and  had  dialysis treatment (i.e.  possible  previous  peritoneal  dialysis)  for  less  than  4  years.  The  majority  of  patients  in both groups had three hemodialysis sessions per week.

Mean ± SD Kt/V, a measure of dialysis adequacy, was 1.57 ± 0.377 in Group 1 and 1.60 ± 0.408 in Group 2 (a higher score indicates better dialysis adequacy, with 1.20 considered adequate).

Mean ± SD urea reduction ratio, another measure of dialysis adequacy, was 79% ± 8.5% in Group 1 and 72% ± 9.0% in Group 2 (a higher percentage indicates better dialysis adequacy, with 65% considered adequate).

## Efficacy results

## PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT

The changes from baseline to the evaluation period are summarized in the table 7.

In the ANCOVA model of this data, with adjustment for dose group (Group 1/Group 2), age (5-11/12-18 years), previous ESA treatment (darbepoetin alfa/epoetin alfa or beta) and baseline Hb AUC, the adjusted mean change in Hb AUC from baseline to evaluation period was -0.74 (95% CI: -1.32 to -0.16) for Group 1 and -0.09 (95% CI: -0.45 to 0.26) for Group 2 (table 8). Terms from the model show no indication of a strong effect on change in Hb due to previous ESA treatment or age.

In Group 2, mean Hb values remained above 10 g/dL and below 12 g/dL throughout the study. However, in  the  Group  1  there  was  a  clear  decrease  in  Hb  levels  during  the  titration  period,  with  mean  values dropping below 10 g/dL (see figure 7) and reaching a nadir at week 9 before increasing without returning to baseline levels at the start of the evaluation period. In both groups, there was a small increase in Hb at

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

the  start  of  the  study  from  baseline  to  week  3,  although  mean  levels  remained  below  12  g/dL  with  a mean increase from baseline of the order of 0.5 g/dL for Group 1 and less than 0.5 g/dL for Group 2 (see figure 8).

In Group 2, 19 patients had Hb 1 g/dL or more above their baseline value at week 3, 17 at week 4, and 11  at  week  5.  75%  of  patients  were  under  12.5  g/dL  at  week  4,  and  less  than  1.75  g/dL  from  their baseline value. The maximum Hb value seen at this time was 14.7 g/dL.

## Blood Transfusions during the Core Study Period

Three patients required blood transfusions during the core study period, one in Group 1 and two in Group 2 (see table 10). The reasons for transfusion were Hb decreased, procedural hemorrhage, and intracranial hematoma. The patient with intracranial hematoma died as a result of the event.

## Reticulocyte Counts during the Core Study Period

In  both  groups,  mean  reticulocytes  showed  a  cyclic  variation  over  time,  with  peaks  at  week  2, subsequently every 4 weeks and with troughs at week 4 to 5 and subsequently every 4 weeks throughout the study but otherwise showed no overall tendency to increase or decrease.

Mircera Dose during the Core Study Period

A summary of the equivalent 4-weekly Mircera dose over time during the core study period is provided in the table below.

When considering the median values, which are less affected by outliers, in Group 2, the dose decreased slightly through to week 13 and then increased for the fifth and final dose at week 17. In Group 1, the median dose increased slowly throughout the core study, in response to the course of Hb over time.

Equivalent 4-weekly dose is derived to estimate the total dose received in each strict 28 day time window.

## Conversion Factors for Previous Weekly ESA Dose during the Evaluation Period

The  conversion  factors  for  previously  weekly  ESA  dose  to  equivalent  weekly  Mircera  dose  during  the evaluation period are shown in the table below. In Group 2, the median [IQR] conversion factors were 1.8 [1.4, 2.8] for darbepoetin alfa and 0.008 [0.005, 0.01] for epoetin alfa/beta. These are both very close to the conversion factors used to calculate the first dose (1/0.55=1.8 and 1/125=0.008 for darbepoetin and

## Dose Adjustments during the Core Study Period

During the core study period, dose changes occurred frequently in both conversion factor groups (77% of patients in Group 2 and 81% in Group 1 required a dose change) (see table 14). A lower proportion of patients  in  Group  2  compared  to  Group  1  required  a  dose  increase  only  during  the  core  study  period (29% compared to 56%). A greater proportion of patients in Group 2 required no dose change (23%) compared with Group 1 (19%). A greater proportion of patients in Group 2 had both dose decreases and increases (38%) compared with Group 1 (13%).

In terms of absolute numbers of dose changes, the mean number of dose increases and decreases was 1.69 and 0.25, respectively, in Group 1 and 1.19 and 0.73, respectively, in Group 2.

## Rate of Rise in Hb during the Core Study Period

Average  within-patient  Hb  change  (calculated  by  a  regression  model  over  moving  2  week  periods) indicated that, on average, the change in Hb was close to 0 in Group 2 (see table 15). In the case of Group 1, average within-patient Hb changes were mainly negative.

## Subgroup analyses

Age Group (5-11 or 12-17 Years)

In  Group  1,  9/16  patients  (56%)  were  aged  5-11  years  and  7/16  (44%)  were  aged  12-17  years.  In Group 2, 16/48 patients (33%) were aged 5-11 years and 32/48 (67%) were aged 12-17 years.

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint

The difference in change in average Hb between baseline and evaluation periods was similar in both age groups. In Group 2, while the medians were either side of zero, the difference in medians between the 2 age groups was 0.27 g/dL (see table 16).

With respect to Hb change from baseline over time, in Group 2, the two age groups have very similar changes over the first 8 weeks of the study, after this time there is more variability, with the smaller 5-11 year-old category showing slightly larger peaks and troughs (see figure 11).

## Mircera Dose during the Core Study Period

In Group 2, the median equivalent 4-weekly dose during the evaluation period (week 17) was 89 and 127 μg/4 weeks in the 5-11 and 12-17 year age groups respectively (see table 17). These values were very similar  to  the  median  starting  doses  (86  and  150  μg/4  weeks).  The  equivalent  values  for  dose  per kilogram bodyweight were 2.8 and 3.3 μg/kg/4 weeks (see table 18). When looking at the dose per body surface area, in Group 2, the dose during the evaluation period for the younger and older age groups respectively was 93 and 111 μg/4-weeks/m 2 .

When considering the individual patient ratios of initial dose to dose during evaluation (see table 19) in Group 2, there was a small increase (1.25) in the medians in the 5-11 age group whereas the ratio was close to 1 in the 12-17 age group (0.98). In the younger age group, this corresponds to not more than one protocol specified dose change of 25%. In Group 1, the median ratios were both greater than 1 (1.81 for the 5-11 age group and 1.59 for the 12-17 age group).

While absolute doses differ, results for changes in dose are generally reflected in the smaller Group 1 age subsets. Overall for Group 1, dose increases were required and larger increases were seen in the younger patients and smaller increases in the older patients.

## Previous ESA Treatment

In Group 1, 8 patients were previously on darbepoetin alfa and 8 were previously on epoetin alfa/beta. In Group 2, 26 were previously on darbepoetin alfa and 22 were previously on epoetin alfa/beta.

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint

When considering changes in Hb over time in Group 2, the mean Hb change from baseline for patients previously  on darbepoetin alfa  was  generally  below  baseline  whereas the  mean  for  patients  previously

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

taking epoetin alfa/beta remained closer to baseline throughout (see figure below).

## EFFICACY EVALUATIONS DURING THE SAFETY EXTENSION PERIOD

## Hemoglobin over Time

In Group 2, during the safety extension period, all mean Hb values remained within the 10-12 g/dL range (Figure 12). In Group 1, although mean values were below this range at some time points during the core study period, in the safety extension period, mean values in this group also remained within the 10-12 g/dL.

The change from baseline in Group 2 during the safety extension period fluctuated around baseline (see figure below). In Group 1, change from baseline returned to close to baseline, although any conclusions should  be  treated  with  caution  given  the  low  patient  numbers  in  Group  1  (n=5  after  Week  45). Hemoglobin levels over time were similar for the patients aged 5-11 years and those aged 12-17 years, although comparisons are limited by the low patient numbers, particularly at later time points.

Due to the high withdrawal rate, the applicant used the values at the time each individual patient exited the study for evaluation instead of values at week 73. At study exit, 16 of the 28 patients in Group 2 (57%) had Hb levels within ± 1 g/dL of baseline and 20 (71%) had Hb levels within 10-12 g/dL. In Group 1, 7 of the 9 patients (78%) had Hb levels within ± 1 g/dL and 6 (67%) had Hb levels within 10-12 g/dL.

## 1.6. Rapporteur's discussion

The MAH has provided the results of a standalone study (NH19707) concerning PK in children to support the amendments to the product information, sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2.

Study NH19707 was a phase II, open-label, multicentre, dose finding study designed to provide evidence on  the  optimal  dose  of  Mircera  in  the  paediatric  population    (5-17  years  old)  with  CKD  anaemia  on hemodialysis, following iv administration of Mircera after switching from other ESAs (i.e epoetin alfa/beta or  darbepoetin  alfa).  This  study  is  part  of  the  PIP  that  was  modified  in  September  2017  due  to  the unfeasibility  to  conduct  the  phase  III  confirmatory  study  initially  planned.  Instead  of  carrying  out  this phase  III  study,  PDCO  agreed  with  conducting,  in  addition  to  study  NH19707,  two  new  studies  (i.e NH19708 and pop-PK/PD studies). The first one (NH19708) is a phase 2 study designed to ascertain the starting dose of Mircera given subcutaneously in paediatric patients with CKD anaemia on dialysis or not yet on dyalisis when switching with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or dabepoetin alfa. The second one is a population PK/PD model including adult data from previous studies and children data from NH19707 and NH19708 studies.

The duration of study NH19707 was 20 weeks (core phase). After 2 weeks of screening period, patients were given Mircera  for  16  weeks  of  dose  titration  and  continued  4  weeks  more  during  the  evaluation period.  The  protocol  included  two  different  groups  with  different  conversion  factors  based  on  their previous ESA dose to find the optimum Mircera starting dose. Group 1 comprised patients who started with  an  intermediate  conversion  factor  dose.  In  the  adaptive  design,  this  starting  dose  proved inadequate and a group 2 was enrolled for treatment with a higher conversion factor dose, double than that of group 1.

Patients completing the 20 weeks of treatment with Hb within ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and within the target range of 10-12 g/dL were eligible to enter an optional 52-week safety extension period. During this  period,  the  patients  continued  to  receive  Mircera  once  every  4  weeks  with  Hb  concentration measurements  occurred  less  frequently  (every  4  weeks.  As  the  safety  extension  phase  only  included patients  who  had  adequate  response  to  treatment  after  the  core  phase  efficacy  results  during  the extension phase (i.e. long-term efficacy results) should be taken cautiously due to the selection bias.

During the core study phase, 4 patients in group 1 and 13 in group 2 withdrew from treatment renal transplant being the main reason. The MAH  replaced these patients with new ones in order to maintain the sample size planned at the beginning of the study. The replacement of patients is problematic and may lead to bias. A detailed justification is anticipated in case that a variation for the extension of the indication to children is submitted in the future.

Of the 112 screened patients, only 64 were enrolled (16 initially in Group 1 and then 48 in Group 2). The mean age was 11 and 13 years in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Children recruited in Group 2 were a bit older. The number of patients between 5 to 11 years of age was greater in group 1 than in group 2 with a low representation of patients younger than 8 years of age, mainly in group 2. Therefore, currently there is  no  information on PK in children younger than 5 years of age until results from study NH19708 are available.

Two doses have been studied based on two different conversion factors. A total of 16 patients were given Mircera  IV  with  a  starting  dose  based  on  4x  previous  weekly  epoetin  dose  (IU)  /250  or  4x  previous weekly darbepoetin (μg) /1.1. In the second group a total of 16 patients received a starting Mircera dose double than that of group 1, it means 4x previous weekly epoetin dose (IU)/125 or 4x previous weekly

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

darbepoetin alfa μg/0.55.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in Hb concentration (g/dL) between the baseline period and  the  evaluation  period  (weeks  17-21).  The  adjusted  mean  change  in  Hb  from  baseline  to  the evaluation period was -0.09 g/dl (95%IC: -0.45 to 0.26) in group 2 and -0.74 g/dl (95% IC -1.32 to 0.16)  in  group  1.  These  results,  in  principle,  would  support  the  conversion  factor  used  in  group  2 although some issues remain unresolved at this point.

During the core phase the dose administered could be adjusted in order to maintain Hb levels between 10-12 g/dL. It was observed that in group 2 children 5-11 years increased dose administered along the core  period  while  children  12-17  years  tended  to  maintain  or  slightly  decrease  doses  along  the  same period of time. Moreover, subgroup analysis by age group showed less variability in the response in the 5-11 year subgroup (group 2) compared to the 12-17 year subgroup (the median changes of Hb between baseline and evaluation period were 0.08 vs. -0.19, respectively).

Secondary variables showed more stable Hb levels in the group 2 than in the group 1 throughout the core study period. In group 2, 75% of patients maintained Hb values within ±1 g/dL of baseline and 80.6% within 10-12 g/dL. There were also fewer patients who needed dose adjustments in group 2 compared to group 1 (77% vs. 81%, respectively). For these reasons the MAH considered that the conversion factor used in group 2 could be the one selected to adjust the Mircera dose in children who switch from other ESA. It is important to highlight that, for the conversion factor used in group 2, around 20% of children did not reach the Hb target (i.e 10-12 g/dl). This is of concern if it is considered that children were stable on their previously ESA treatment (epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa).

Three  patients  needed  blood  transfusion  during  the  core  period,  one  in  Group  1  due  to  haemoglobin decrease and two in Group 2 due to procedural haemorrhage and intracraneal haematoma (see safety section).

Efficacy assessment during the safety extension period showed that mean Hb values remained within the target (i.e 10-12 g/dL) over this period regardless of the group (1 or 2). As mentioned before, efficacy results during this phase should be carefully considered as only patients who adequately responded to treatment after the core phase were included in the extension.

The  conversion  factors  used  to  calculate  the  initial  dose  were  1/0.55=1.8  and  1/125=0.008  for darboepoetin and epoetins respectively. The MAH reanalysed the real conversion factor used throughout core  period  according  to  the  doses  used  along  this  period.  This  calculation  showed  that  the  median conversion factors were 1.8 (1.4, 2.8) for darbepoetin alfa and 0.008 (0.005, 0.01) for epoetins. Taken into account the observed ranges it seems that the real conversion factor used for epoetins is close to the initial ones proposed. However, for darbepoetin the differences between initial and real conversion factor seems to be greater as shown by the wide range observed. In fact, the mean Hb change from baseline over  time  by  previous  ESA  treatment  during  the  core  study  showed  less  fluctuation  in  the  group  of patients who received epoetin previously compare to patients previously on darbepoetin. Whether this is related to the initial conversion factors proposed is unknown for the time being.

The efficacy results of study NH19707 seem to be promising. However, there are some uncertainties that may need further discussion when all the data in children are available, mainly, the variability in the dose administered during the core phase for the age subgroups and the conversion factors used in relation to previous ESA used. In addition, an important proportion of children included in group 2 (which seems to be in principle the conversion factor selected by the MAH for switching) did not reach the Hb target (i.e 10-12 g/dl). This is relevant since they were stable on their previously ESA treatment and could question the appropriateness of switching to Mircera.

The MAH has proposed to include the results of study NH19707 in section 5.1. of the SmPC.  According to the Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics only evidence from relevant studies supporting the

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

indication should be included in this section. The current indication is limited to adults so the inclusion of data on children in section 5.1. is not supported at this stage. Please see SmPC in a separate document.

## 2. Clinical Safety aspects

## 2.1. Methods

The primary safety information is derived from study NH19707 in paediatric patients 5-17 years old with clinically  stable  chronic  renal  anemia  on  hemodialysis  treatment  and  who  were  receiving  maintenance treatment  with  an  erythropoiesis  stimulating  agent  (ESA)  prior  to  switching  to  methoxy  polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera).

This  Phase  II,  dose-finding  study  was  an  open-label,  multicenter,  multiple  dose  study  of  Mircera administered  intravenously  (IV)  once  every  4  weeks  for  20  weeks  (core  study  period)  in  paediatric patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving hemodialysis who switched from other ESAs (epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa). Patients who completed the core study period with hemoglobin (Hb) within ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and within the target range of 10-12 g/dL were eligible to enter an optional 52-week safety extension period (total duration of treatment, up to 73 weeks).

After the first administration of Mircera, dose adjustments were permitted to maintain target Hb levels, which were measured once a week during the core study period and once every four weeks during the safety extension. Two groups were enrolled, Group 1 with an intermediate conversion factor and Group 2 with a high conversion factor.

The  clinical  safety  of  Mircera  in  paediatric  patients  is  further  supported  by  analysis  of  post-marketing adverse event (AE) reports and data from international registries recording use of Mircera in paediatric patients as well as reports of paediatric Mircera use in the literature.

A  total  of  64  paediatric  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of  Mircera  in  this  study.  The  extent  of exposure (core study and safety extension) is summarized in table 20. Nineteen patients were exposed to Mircera for at least 15 months.

Adverse events with a frequency ≥ 2% by SOC during the core period is shown in Table 22. Most of the AEs  were  associated  with  CKD,  other  previous  and  concurrent  risk  factors/diseases  and  treatments, and/or dialysis-induced, and considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the study drug.

The  most  affected  SOCs  were  Infections  and  infestations  (30/64  patients  overall  [47%]),  General disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (12/64  patients  [19%]),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (12/64 patients overall [19%]) and Nervous system disorders (12/64 patients [19%]).

The  individual  AEs  reported  in  more  than  5%  of  patients  overall  were  nasopharyngitis  (9/64  patients [14%]), headache (9/64 [14%]), vomiting (6/64 patients [9%]), hypertension (8/64 patients [13%]), abdominal pain (4/64 patients [6%]), and bronchitis (4/64 patients [6%]).

InvestigatortextforAdverseEvents encodedusingMedDRAversion 18.

Seven  AEs  in  5/64  patients  (8%)  overall  (1  AE  [decreased  Hb]  in  1  patient  in  Group  1  and  6  AEs [arteriovenous fistula thrombosis, extensive interdialytic weight gain, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, dental caries, thrombosis in device] in 4 patients in Group 2) were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug.

## Adverse Events by Intensity

Two  life-threatening  AEs  occurred,  both  in  patients  in  Group  2  and  reported  by  the  investigator  as unrelated  to  the  study  medication:  intracranial  hematoma  caused  by  a  fall  resulting  in  death    and procedural  hemorrhage  during  dialysis  caused  by  a  poorly  adapted  dialysate  filter  and  leading  to worsening of anemia.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

In addition, 10 severe AEs were reported in 7/64 patients (11%). The only severe AE to be reported more than once was arteriovenous fistula thrombosis (2 patients, 1 in each group). Of the remaining AEs, there were 42 moderate AEs in 26/64 patients (41%) and 81 mild AEs in 35/64 patients (55%).

## Safety Extension Period

During the safety extension period, 27/37 patients (73%) experienced at least one AE (4 [44%] in Group 1 and 23 [82%] in Group 2) (see table 23).

Adverse events with a frequency ≥ 2% by SOC during the safety extension period is shown in Table 24. As  in  the  core  period,  the  SOC  with  the  most  number  of  events  was  Infections  and  infestations  (17 patients overall [46%] had an AE in this SOC).

The  most  frequently  reported  individual  AEs  overall  were  nasopharyngitis  (7  [19%]),  headache  (6 [16%]), and hypertension (5 [14%]).

Two patients (both in Group 2) had 2 AEs considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug: anemia and urinary tract infection.

## Adverse Events by Intensity.

Overall, there were no life-threatening AEs and 5 severe AEs reported during the safety extension period (all  in  patients  in  Group  2).  These  events  were  hypotension,  hypertension,  arteriovenous  fistula thrombosis, arterial injury, and sleep disorder. None of these events were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug.

## Deaths

One fatal SAE was reported in the core study period (intracranial hematoma). The event was the result of a  domestic  head  trauma  and  subsequent  dialysis  with  heparin,  and  considered  by  the  investigator unrelated to the study drug.

## Other Serious Adverse Events

## Core Study Period

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

Overall, including the aforementioned fatal SAE, 16/64 patients (25%) reported a total of 25 SAEs (4/16 [25%] in Group 1 and 12/48 [25%] in Group 2) (Table 25). The most commonly affected SOCs (with &gt; 5% of patients overall with SAEs) were Infections and infestations (8 patients overall [13%]), General disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (4  patients  overall  [6%]),  and  Injury,  poisoning  and procedural complications (4 patients overall [6%]).

SAEs reported in more than 1 patient overall included device-related infection (3 patients), bronchitis (2), thrombosis in device (2), arteriovenous fistula thrombosis (2), procedural hemorrhage (2), fluid overload (2), and hypertension (2).

Investigator text for "T'et uotsxen thnpeu butsn papooue saueng estenpt

The only individual SAE reported in more than 1 patient overall was hypertension (2 patients). Of the AEs classified as serious, none were considered related to the study medication.

## Other Significant Adverse Events

## Adverse Events That Led to Withdrawal of Study Treatment

One patient died and did not complete study treatment during the core study period. No patients were withdrawn from study treatment due to non-fatal AEs in either study period.

The withdrawal rate (see table 21) was higher than initially expected, although these withdrawals were not related to safety but related to transplantation and may reflect a decreased time on the waiting lists for kidney transplantation.

## Adverse Events That Led to Dose Modification

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

No AEs led to dose modification at any time during the study.

## Analysis of Adverse Events by Ogan system or Syndrome

The most clinically relevant specific adverse effects of ESAs as a class that should be considered a priori as potential safety concerns in children are selected to be hypertension, vascular access thrombosis and anti-erythropoietin  antibody-induced  pure  red  cell  aplasia  (AEAB-PRCA).  Hypertension  was  the  most common AE in all treatment groups in most pivotal and post-approval Mircera studies in adults. In these studies,  the  incidence  of  hypertension  was  similar  in  patients  treated  with  Mircera  compared  to  those receiving  comparator  ESAs.  Vascular  access  thrombosis  is  common  in  the  hemodialysis  population.  In adults, no events of PRCA were reported in clinical trials during clinical development while there are 8 spontaneous reports of confirmed AEABPRCA after exclusive use of Mircera.

## Hypertension

## Core Study Period

Overall, at baseline, 32 patients (50%) had hypertension reported by the investigator as one of the risk factors  for  vascular  events  and  hemorrhage  and  37  (58%)  were  already  receiving  or  had  received antihypertensive and/or diuretic agents. During the core study period, 8 patients (13%) had an increase in antihypertensive treatment.

Of the 8 patients with arterial hypertension reported as an AE during the core study period, 7 had preexisting hypertension at enrollment or within 12 weeks prior to enrollment, and 1 had previously received antihypertensive therapy although this patient was not reported to have hypertension at enrollment or within 12 weeks of enrollment. In 1 patient, hypertension was reported as severe in intensity and as an SAE. The event resolved with treatment (doxazosin and carvedilol). One case of moderate hypertension was also reported as an SAE.

Pre-  and  post-dialysis  blood  pressure  measurements  were  performed  in  all  patients  during  the  study. Values remained close to baseline level, and no clear trend or difference between groups was apparent during the study

## Safety Extension Period

During the safety extension period, 9 patients (24%) had increased antihypertensive treatment compared with baseline (5 of these already had increased antihypertensive treatment in the core period).

There were 5 adverse events of hypertension reported during this period. One patient with hypertension in the safety extension period had already reported a hypertension event during the core period. In that patient, both events were considered serious and severe; an increase in antihypertensive treatment was reported after the second event.

During the extension period, two patients reported hypertension as an SAE. In both cases, the event was associated with a change in antihypertensive medication.

## Vascular Access Thrombosis

## Core Study Period

During the core study period, 4 patients (3 in Group 2 and 1 in Group 1) reported 5 events that may be classified as vascular access thrombosis. These events were defined as 'arteriovenous fistula thrombosis' in 2 patients and 'thrombosis in device' in 2 patients (1 patient experienced 2 such events).

All cases were classified as SAEs. For 3 of the patients, the events were considered severe, and 2 cases (one case of 'arteriovenous fistula thrombosis' and one case of 'thrombosis in device') were considered related to study medication. In all cases, the events resolved without sequelae.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## Safety Extension Period

During the safety extension period, 3 patients reported 5 events classified as vascular access thrombosis (different  patients  from  those  with  such  events  during  the  core  period).  These  were  coded  as 'arteriovenous fistula thrombosis' in 2 cases and 'thrombosis in device' in 3 cases.

Three of these events (two reports of `thrombosis in device' in 1 patient and 1 report of 'arteriovenous fistula thrombosis' in another patient) were classified as SAEs. One of these events ('arteriovenous fistula thrombosis') was also a severe AE. None of these events were considered related to study medication and all resolved without sequelae.

## Anti-Erythropoietin Antibody-Induced Pure Red Cell Aplasia

No patients developed anti-drug antibodies or anti-erythropoietin antibodies during the study. No patients developed PRCA.

## Clinical laboratory evaluations

## Hematology

In  this  study,  Hb  concentrations,  reticulocytes,  and  red  blood  cell  counts  were  considered  part  of  the efficacy assessment. One patient had a moderate AE of Hb decreased due, according to the investigator, to the latency effect of Mircera. This AE resolved.

In  clinical  trials  of  Mircera  in  adults,  slight  decreases  in  platelet  counts  have  been  observed.  In  study NH19707,  median  platelet  count  at  baseline  was  221.5  x  109/L  (range  182-398)  and  208.0  x  109/L (range 80-518) in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively, and decreased slightly during the core study period in both groups but remained within 16% and 20% of baseline, respectively. There was substantial withinand between-patient variability of platelets in both groups. In Group 1, 1/16 patients had one or more postbaseline values below the site-specific normal range (typically 150-400 × 109/L). None had values above  normal  range.  In  Group  2,  19/47  patients  had  one  or  more  postbaseline  values  below  normal range,  of  whom  6/19  already  had  low  values  at  baseline,  and  4/47  patients  had  one  or  more  postbaseline values above normal range, of whom 1/4 already had a high value at baseline.

During  the  extension  period,  platelet  values  below  the  site-specific  normal  range  were  reported  in  2 patients (29%) in Group 1 and 15 patients (60%) in Group 2.

No events of bleeding were reported in any patients who had one or more post-baseline platelet counts below  normal.  Thrombocytopenia  was  reported  as  an  AE  in  four  patients;  in  all  cases,  the  event  was classified as mild and unrelated to study drug.

During the core study period, median hematocrit remained within 15% of baseline for both groups and remained stable during the safety extension period.

## Chemistry

Over  the  entire  study  period,  median  changes  from  baseline  for  aspartate  aminotransferase,  alanine aminotransferase,  serum  albumin,  calcium,  blood  glucose  parameters,  as  well  as  for  potassium  and phosphate,  were  minor,  with  no  obvious  trends  over  time.  Abnormal  post-baseline  values  for  these parameters were observed only sporadically. The only abnormalities in these parameters reported as AEs were hyperkalemia (4 patients in  total),  hyperphosphatemia  (3  patients  in  total)  and  hypocalcemia  (1 patient in total). Two of these AEs were reported as severe (hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia).

Post  baseline  values ≥ 800  U/L  were  seen  at  some  timepoint  throughout  the  study  for  alkaline phosphatase in 4 and 3 patients in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. None of these abnormalities were associated with AEs.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## C-reactive protein

Median  C-reactive  protein  (CRP)  levels  remained  close  to  or  below  the  baseline  value  throughout  the study.  The  majority  of  patients  had  normal  CRP  levels  at  baseline  and  these  values  remained  within normal range throughout the study. None of these patients experienced AEs.

## Iron parameters

In Group 2, the largest median changes from baseline were observed at Week 13 for iron (+6.75 μM/L from 12.00 μM/L at baseline), at Week 61 for ferritin (245.38 μg/L from 328.00 μg/L for ferritin) and Week 53 for transferrin saturation (13.11% from 26.82% at baseline). A similar pattern was observed in Group 1. In all cases, median values for these parameters remained within normal values. Two patients reported AEs related to iron parameters: iron deficiency and iron overload.

Neither of these events was considered related to Mircera.

## Vital signs, Physical findings and other observations related to safety

During the core period, plots of pre-dialysis Z scores for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure  (DBP)  showed  no  clear  trend  throughout  the  study,  with  median  Z  scores  within  ±  1  of  the baseline. During the safety extension period, changes from baseline remained small in Group 2. Group 1 showed greater fluctuation, particularly after Week 57, although this may be a consequence of the low patient numbers.

In both dose groups approximately 60% of patients had at least three consecutive predialysis and postdialysis SBP or DBP values at or above the age, sex, and weight specific 95th percentile. Median sitting pulse rate did not change by more than 10 bpm with respect to baseline at any time during the study.

## Changes in height and weight

Analysis of changes in height and weight did not reveal any indication of an impact of Mircera on growth.

## Immunogenicity

No patients tested positive for erythropoietin antibodies or anti-drug antibodies at any time during the study, including the safety extension period.

## Post-marketing adverse event (AE), International Registries and paediatric Mircera use in the literature.

## Post-marketing surveillance

Post-marketing surveillance data, including suspected serious adverse reactions, accumulated for Mircera since approval have been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency and other Health Authorities on a regular basis in the form of Periodic Safety Reports, including any reports from the paediatric population.

Cumulatively until 19 July 2017, 33 reports (28 serious, 5 non-serious) with 54 events (45 serious and 9 non-serious) were received from patients aged 5-17 years, who were treated with Mircera, mostly for nephrogenic anemia.

Of these 33 reports, 4 had fatal outcomes. These cases were reported from noninterventional programs (NIPs). In 3 cases the event death was reported and assessed as unrelated to Mircera. In one of these cases, the patient had dysgerminoma with unreported outcome; in another case venous access was no longer available for hemodialysis and the patient was on palliative care (not medically confirmed); in the third  case  the  patient  died  due  to  underlying  disease.  In  the  fourth  case  report,  cellulitis  with  fatal outcome was reported; however, this case was not medically confirmed and no causal relationship was reported.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

Only in 1 case (out of 33) did the reporter consider the serious events of thrombocytopenia and diarrhea in a patient hospitalized for renal transplantation as 'related' to Mircera. At the time of reporting and upon discontinuation of Mircera treatment, the events were persisting. No further information was available.

No  new/unexpected  information  was  identified  from  either  the  spontaneously  reported  (6)  (no  case reports from the literature) or NIP solicited cases (27).

It is not known how many paediatric patients are treated off-label with Mircera.

## International Registries

Based on the International Paediatric Dialysis Network (IPDN), which is a global consortium of paediatric nephrology centers dedicated to the care of chlidren on chronic dialysis and who maintains two registries: The International Paediatric Peritoneal Dialysis Network (IPPN) registry for children on chronic peritoneal dialysis  (collects  data  from  115  centers  in  40  countries),  and  the  International  Paediatric  Hemodialysis Network  (IPHN)  registry  for  children  on  hemodialysis  (75  centers  in  35  countries).  Together,  the  two registries currently include data from more than 3750 patients.

Hospitalization  terms  for  136  paediatric  patients  treated  with  Mircera  on  peritoneal  or  hemodialysis included in the IPDN registries did not reveal any unexpected safety concerns in this patient population and were aligned with the events observed in Study NH19707.

## Use in Literature

Mircera  has  been  studied  in  two  small  investigator-initiated  trials. Cano  et  al [2011]  evaluated  the efficacy and safety of Mircera in the management of anemia in paediatric patients on stable peritoneal dialysis receiving EPO twice-a-week who converted to subcutaneous Mircera, scheduled every 2 weeks. The  follow-up  was  6  months.  The  primary  efficacy  parameter  was  Hb  &gt;11  g/dL.  Sixteen  paediatric patients aged 2-14 years, including 11 boys, participated in the study. The target Hb level was attained by month 3 for all patients, with an increase in mean ( ± SD) Mircera dose, given every 2 weeks, from 0.86±0.33 to 1.67±0.4 μg/kg. No adverse events attributable to Mircera were reported.

Wedekin et al [2011] conducted a 6-month study of Mircera administered intravenously every 4 weeks in 12 patients (age 6-17 years) in a post-transplant setting (5 switched from darbepoetin and 7 were naïve to  erythropoietin).  The  median Mircera dose was 2.5 μg/kg. No adverse events attributable to  Mircera were reported and Hb levels were effectively controlled.

For  comparison,  during  the  evaluation  period  of  study  NH19707,  the  median  [interquartile  range]  4weekly Mircera dose was similar (3.22 [2.25-5.12] μg/kg) in Group 2.

## 2.3. Rapporteur's discussion

The safety information in paediatric patients aged 5-17 years of age mainly derived from Study NH19707, a  phase  II,  multicenter,  open-label,  dose  finding,  multiple  dose  study  where  paediatric  patients  on hemodialysis and clinically stable chronic renal anemia who previously received maintenance treatment with  ESA  (epoetin  alfa/beta  or  darbepoetin  alfa)  were  switched  to  Mircera.  Patients  received  Mircera administered  intravenously  once  every  4  weeks  for  20  weeks  (copre  study  period).  Patients  who completed this period with Hb within ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and within the target range of 10-12 g/dL were eligible to enter an optional 52-week safety extension period (total duration of treatment, up to 73 weeks).

After the first administration of Mircera, dose adjustments were permitted to maintain target Hb levels, which were measured once a week during the core study period and once every four weeks during the safety extension. Two groups were enrolled, Group 1 with an intermediate conversion factor and Group 2

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

with a high conversion factor (for more information please see clinical efficacy section).

In addition, the clinical safety of Mircera in paediatric patients is further supported by analysis of postmarketing  adverse  events  reports,  data  from  international  registries  recording  use  of  Mircera  in  this population and also with literature reports showing Mircera use in paediatric population.

According to Study NH19707, a total of 64 paediatric patients received at least one dose of Mircera (16 patients in Group 1 and 48 patients in Group 2) and were used to assess safety during core study period. After this period, an additional 52-week safety extension period was planned. In this period thirty seven patients (9 in Group 1 and 28 in Group 2), slightly more than a half (58%) of those initially included in the core study period, met criteria to enter the safety extension period.

During the whole study, patients were in the study for a total of 45.5 patients exposure year (PEY) with a mean of 0.7 PEY per patient. Nineteen patients were exposed to Mircera for at least 15 months.

Safety results  from this  phase  II  study  showed  that  77%  and  73% of  patients  in  the  core  period  and safety extension period reported at least one adverse event, respectively. These percentages seem lower than those obtained from pooled phase II/III trials conducted in adult patients with chronic renal anaemia where around 88% of patients reported at least one adverse event.

During the core period adverse events reported in more than 5% of patients were nasopharyngitis (14%), headache (14%), vomiting (9%), hypertension (13%), abdominal pain (6%), and bronchitis (6%). The most frequently reported adverse events during the extension period were overall nasopharyngitis (19%), headache (16%), and hypertension (14%).

One  death  was  reported  in  the  core  study  period,  due  to  intracranial  hematoma,  resulting  from  a domestic  head  trauma  and  subsequent  dialysis  with  heparin.  It  was  considered  by  the  investigator unrelated to the study drug.

The adverse events considered related to treatment in paediatric patients (phase II study) were 7.8% in the core period and 5.4% in the extension period. For adult patients (pooled phase II/III trials) this data was around 6%.

For  the  safety  assessment  the  MAH  considered  hypertension,  vascular  access  thrombosis  and  antierythropoietin  antibody-induced  pure  red  cell  aplasia  (AEAB-PRCA)  as  potential  safety  concerns.  These adverse events, along with decrease in platelet count and thromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism), were considered of special interest during the clinical development of Mircera in adult patients with chronic renal anaemia and are described as adverse events in Mircera product information.

During the core period in Study NH19707 8 patients (12.5%) reported hypertension as adverse event, 7 of  which  showed  hypertension  prior  to  inclusion  in  the  study.  The  other  one  had  previously  received antihypertensive therapy. Two of these cases reported (3.1%) were classified as serious adverse events, and not considered related to the study medication. In the safety extension period five patients (13.5%) reported  hypertension,  however  two  (5.4%)  was  classified  as  serious  and  not  related  to  the  study medication.

Four patients reported vascular access thrombosis (2 patients (3.1%) described as thrombosis in device and 2 patients (3.1%) as arteriovenous fistula thrombosis. All cases were classified as serious adverse events.  However  only  two  of  them  were  considered  related  to  the  study  medication  (one  case  each). During  the  safety  extension  period  arteriovenous  fistula  thrombosis  and  thrombosis  in  device  were reported  in  2  patients  each  (5.4%).  Two  of  them  were  classified  as  serious  adverse  event  (one arteriovenous  fistula  thrombosis  and  the  other  one  thrombosis  in  device)  and  none  of  them  was considered related to the study drug. No thromboembolic events (i.e. pulmonary embolism) have been recorded.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

No  patients  developed  anti-drug  antibodies  or  anti-erythropoietin  antibodies  during  Study  NH19707. Either pure red cell aplasia.

In Study NH19707 platelet count decreased along core study period both in group 1 and 2 (normal range 150-400x10 9 /L).  Median  baseline  platelet  count  was  221.5x10 9 /L  and  208.0x10 9 /L  in  group  1  and  2, respectively.  No  median  platelet  data  at  the  end  of  the  core  period  has  been  provided  by  the  MAH. However, the MAH stated that in group 1 and 2,  1/16 patients and 19/47 patients had at least one postbaseline values below the normal range, respectively. In group 2, 6/19 of patients who experienced low values already had low values at baseline. In addition in group 2, 4/47 patients had at least one postbaseline  values  above  normal  range  of  whom  1/4 had  high  values  at  baseline.  No  increase  in  platelet count is described in product information in adult patients.

During the extension period platelet values below the normal range was reported in 2 patients in Group 1 and in 15 patients in Group 2.

No  bleeding  events  were  reported  in  any  patient  who  had  post-baseline  platelet  counts  below  normal range. During both periods thrombocitopenia was reported overall in 4 patients and was classified mild and unrelated to the study drug.

In  addition  to  the  safety  data  derived  from  Study  NH19707,  the  MAH  has  provided  data  from postmarketing surveillance, International registries and data from literature. According to these sources it seems that safety profile of Mircera in the paediatric population does not reveal any new signal.

Regarding the safety results provided by study NH19707, no new safety adverse events were identified. It  seems  that  adverse  events  described  in  paediatric  patients  were  similar  to  those  observed  in  adult patients with chronic renal anaemia. However, due to the phase II study design no comparison between adverse  events  observed in  paediatric  and  adult  patients  can  be  made  and  the  MAH  did  not  compare these  safety  data  with  the  ones  already  available  in  adults.  Therefore  no  conclusions  can  be  drawn regarding the possible difference in frequencies of the above described adverse events. For this reason, the  need  to  include  in  the  future  any  particular  information  for  paediatric  population  in  the  product information will be decided when the entire evidence is available and following a careful review of the whole  data  without  any  restrictions  based  on  arbitrary  cut-off  points  (i.e  only  AEs&gt;2%  or  5%  of incidence) as previously stated in the P46 procedure.

Finally the MAH is in agreement and decided not to amend the product information at this point.

Finally,  and  according  to  information  coming  from  non-clinical  studies  related  to  other  PEGylated products, there is a possible risk of accumulation of PEG causing vacuolation in tissues such as brain and kidney as seen in animals. The implication of this finding in humans is at the time being unclear. An upto-date  discussion  on  safety  aspects  related  to  this  issue  is  expected  in  case  that  an  extension  of indication for the inclusion of the paediatric population is claimed in the future.
