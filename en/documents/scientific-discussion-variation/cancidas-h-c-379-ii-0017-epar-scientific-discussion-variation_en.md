## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1 Introduction

Caspofungin  acetate  is  a  semisynthetic  lipopeptide  compound  of  the  echinocandin  family  and represents the  first  in  a  new  class  of  antifungal  agents  (glucan  synthesis  inhibitors)  that  inhibits  the synthesis of beta-1, 3-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall. Cancidas was granted an EU Marketing Authorisation under exceptional circumstances on 24 October 2001, indicated in the treatment  of  invasive  aspergillosis  in  adults,  who  are  refractory  to  or  intolerant  of  amphotericin  B, lipid  formulations  of  amphotericin  B  and/or  itraconazole.  The  approved  dosage  is  a  single  70-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 50 mg thereafter. Duration of treatment is not specified and is to be based  upon the severity  of the patient's  underlying  disease, recovery  from immmunosuppression and  clinical  response.  The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  has  committed  to  specific obligations  and  follow-up measures.  Pursuant  to  article  13 (2) of  Council  Regulation  (EEC) No 2309/93  and  part  4G  of  the  Annex  to  Council  Directive  75/318/EEC,  the  MAH  has  agreed  to provide, as requested by the CPMP, additional clinical data. These data will form the basis for a reassessment of the benefit/risk ratio of Caspofungin MSD in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.

A  type  II  variation  to  extend  the  indication  to  include  treatment  of  invasive  candidiasis  in  nonneutropenic  adult  patients  was  granted  an  EU  Marketing  Authorisation  17  February  2003.  The recommended dose regimen in these patients is a single 70-mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 50 mg thereafter. The duration of treatment is to be based upon the patient's clinical and microbiological response, but in general therapy should be continued for at least 14 days after the last positive culture.

Caspofungin has been given a marketing authorisation in the indication salvage treatment of invasive aspergillosis in the United States on 29 January 2001 and in more than 50 further countries. In addition caspofungin  has  been  approved  for  invasive  candidiasis  in  Korea  and  Brazil  and  for  the  primary treatment of oesophageal (EC) candidiasis (and, in some instances, oropharyngeal candidiasis [OPC]) in 5 countries in South America and the United States.

The present type II variation concerns an extension of the indications to include: 'Empirical therapy for  presumed  fungal  infections  in  febrile  neutropenic  adult  patients '  as  requested  by  the  MAH  in September 2003. The recommended dose constitutes a single 70-mg loading dose on Day 1 followed by 50 mg thereafter. Duration of empirical therapy should be based on the patient's clinical response. Therapy  should  be  continued  until  resolution  of  neutropenia.  Patients  diagnosed  with  a  fungal infection should be treated for a minimum of 14 days treatment should be continued for at least 7 days after both neutropenia and clinical symptoms resolved.

## 2 Clinical assessment

## 2.1 Introduction

Invasive  fungal  infections  are  an  important  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  patients  with neutropenia  following  chemotherapy  for  cancer,  and  Candida  and  Aspergillus  species  are  the  most commonly  identified  pathogens.    Fever,  without  signs  of  localized  infection,  is  the  typical  clinical presentation.  Early, definitive diagnosis is difficult; therefore, empirical administration of antifungal agents has become the standard of care for neutropenic patients who remain febrile despite empirical antibacterial therapy.  Conventional amphotericin B has been shown to reduce the frequency of proven fungal infections in  febrile  neutropenic  hosts, but its  use  has been limited  due to toxicity.  A recent study  of  patients  with  persistent  fever  and  neutropenia  demonstrated  that  empirical  therapy  with AmBisome was as effective as conventional amphotericin B and associated with fewer breakthrough fungal infections, less infusion-related toxicity, and less nephrotoxicity.  Nonetheless, infusion-related toxicity and nephrotoxicity still occurred in 17 to 19% of patients receiving AmBisome.

Caspofungin is  the  first  in  a  new  class  of  antifungals,  the  echinocandins.    Caspofungin  inhibits  the synthesis  of  b-1,  3-D-glucan,  an  essential  component  of  the  cell  wall  of  many  pathogenic  fungi, including Candida and Aspergillus spp. Caspofungin has been approved for the treatment of invasive

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

aspergillosis in patients who are refractory to or intolerant of other therapies and for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.

In view of its favourable efficacy and safety profile in documented fungal infections, caspofungin may represent an effective and well-tolerated agent as empirical therapy in patients with persistent febrile neutropenia.

## 2.2 Pharmacokinetics

There was one pharmacokinetics report associated with this dossier. It is a population PK/PD analysis performed on data obtained in 122 patients (out  of 152) treated empirically with caspofungin in the Phase III Study 026.  All  doses  were  administered  as  1-hr,  constant-rate, intravenous infusions. The maximum duration of empirical treatment was 28 days.

Plasma samples were analyzed with a validated HPLC method using fluorescence detection. The limit of quantification was 125 ng/ml. End-of-infusion (C1hr) and trough (C24hr) samplings were performed. The  PK  parameters  were  the  time-averaged  C1hr  and  C24hr  over  two  different  time  periods,  namely Days 3 to 14 in analyses assessing effects on caspofungin PK, and Day 3 to the end of IV therapy in analyses  assessing  the  effects  of  caspofungin  PK  on  outcome.  Statistical  analysis  was  adequate.  A relatively  large  number of  concentration values  were  excluded  due to inappropriate sampling times; furthermore, 34 pairs of trough and peak samples were assumed to include a switching error.

The following conclusions follow the lines of the previously characterised caspofungin PK profile:

- /square4 Neither end-of-infusion (C1hr) nor trough (C24hr) concentrations predict treatment outcome, not even in subgroup analyses (low-risk vs high-risk patients, and prior antifungal prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis).
- /square4 With  the  possible  exception  of  nausea,  the  occurrence  of  clinical  AE's  and/or  laboratory abnormalities  does  not appear to be increased by  higher  caspofungin plasma  concentrations within the range of PK parameters examined.
- /square4 Weight is a significant  covariate  for C24hr but not  for C1hr. However, the  effect  of  weight is modest within the 50 to 90-kg range of body weights; the current recommendation to increase the daily dose from 50 to 70 mg in patients weighing more than 80 kg may remain.
- /square4 On average, C1hr and C24hr were increased 23% and 31%, respectively, in women relative to men. This does not warrant any dose adjustment based on gender.
- /square4 Older patients on average have modestly higher C24hr concentrations than younger patients, but no dose adjustment is necessary based on age.
- /square4 Race, renal status, and serum albumin levels are not significant determinants of caspofungin PK.
- /square4 In  general,  the  drug-interaction  screening  did  not  unravel  any  concomitant  medication  that would be likely to alter caspofungin PK.
- /square4 Both C1hr and C24hr concentrations are modestly reduced in empirical therapy patients relative to healthy subjects. This is similar to the observation made in invasive candidiasis patients and does not warrant further comments.

Therefore, PK parameters from this Phase III Study 026 are compared to those in previously studied healthy subjects (16 from Protocol 021 and 13 from Protocol 030 with the same dosage regimen of caspofungin).

## 2.3 Clinical efficacy

The  efficacy  data  to  support  the  extension  of  indication  of  caspofungin  to  empirical  therapy  of presumed  fungal  infections  in  febrile,  neutropenic  patients,  originate from  a  Phase  III  study, Protocol 026: A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Comparative Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of MK-0991 Versus Amphotericin B Liposome for Injection as Empirical Therapy in Patients With Persistent Fever and Neutropenia.

## 2.3.1 Summary of methods of the study Protocol 026

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This  is  a  double-blind  and  in-house  blind,  randomized,  comparative  study  to  evaluate  the  safety, tolerability,  and  efficacy  of  caspofungin  versus  AmBisome  in  the  treatment  of  persistent  fever  and neutropenia.  Patients were stratified at study entry to either a high-risk stratum or a low-risk stratum. Patients  at  high  risk  had  undergone  allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  or  received chemotherapy  for  a  relapse  of  acute  leukemia.    All  others  were  assigned  to  the  low-risk  stratum. Patients  were  also  stratified  by  whether  or  not  they  had  received  prophylactic  antifungal  therapy during their chemotherapy regimen

| Evaluation criteria Safety evaluation: Statistical methods:   | 2. Inadequately managed bacterial infection 3. Platelet count, INR and LFTs exceeding specified thresholds 4. Requirement of cyclosporin A, rifampicin or concomitant systemic antifungal therapy 5. Received parenteral amphothericin B within 10 days prior to enrolment Primary objective: To compare, in patients with persistent fever and neutropenia, the proportion of patients in the caspofungin group with a successful treatment outcome to that of liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) (on all 5 study endpoints) The safety variables included the incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse experiences; nephrotoxicity, infusion-related events, laboratory tests outside predefined clinically significant limits (CSLAs) and patients who had study drug decreased because of toxicity. The primary efficacy parameter was the proportion of patients who had a successful treatment outcome as defined in the primary objective. The secondary endpoints included assessment of each of the individual components of the primary endpoint. For each endpoint, the proportion and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was displayed and the difference in response rates between the 2 treatment groups was also displayed with its 95% CI (95.2% for the primary endpoint, using the adjusted alpha of 0.048 from the DSMB interim analysis plan). The CIs for the individual proportions were calculated using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The CI for the difference in response rates for the primary endpoint was calculated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel adjustment for stratification.   |

The study was designed to test for noninferiority of caspofungin relative to Ambisome as empirical therapy  in  patients  with  persistent  fever  and  neutropenia.    The  definition  of  noninferiority  that  was used for this study states that the 95.2% (two-sided) CI for the difference in response rates between the 2 treatment groups (calculated as caspofungin minus AmBisome) includes zero and the lower limit of the CI is not less than -10%.

The primary analysis was performed using the MITT population (at least 1 complete dose of therapy). The  evaluable-patients  analysis  (at  least  4  days  of  therapy  and  no  protocol  violations)  provided supportive data to confirm the results of the MITT analysis.

As  pointed  out  in  the  CPMP  PtC  (Point  to  Consider  on  the  clinical  evaluation  of  new  agents  for invasive fungal infections - CPMP/EWP/1343/01, dated 22 May 2003) there are some major problems with assessing the true efficacy in empiric therapy, since such an indication should be based solely on the  successful treatment  of any fungal infections documented  from  examination  of specimens taken just  before  adding  the  antifungal  agent.  However,  the  confirmation  of  fungal  infection  from  postbaseline  specimens  might  only  represent  failure  to  treat  an  infection  that  was  present,  but  not confirmed, before initiation  of therapy, or  albeit less  likely,  a  failure  of  prophylaxis.  Thus, the two possible  roles  of  the  drug  cannot  be  differentiated.  It  is  further  stated  in  the  CPMP  PtC  that  a superiority  trial  would  be  the  most  appropriate  for  granting  an  indication  that  reflected  the  overall utility of the drug in this type of clinical situation. The MAH was therefore asked to justify the choice of  a  non-inferiority  trial  instead  of  a  superiority  trial.  The  response  provided  by  the  MAH  was reasonable, even though a trial showing a difference would have been more convincing, for reasons stated in the CPMP PtC. At the time of the initiation of the caspofungin empirical therapy trial (1999), the prevailing approach for empirical antifungal therapy studies was the non-inferiority design using the delta of -10%. The CPMP PtC did not come into operation until recently, in November 2003. The P026 study was modelled after the  earlier large randomised  comparative trials in  empirical therapy, including the one that led to the approval of AmBisome in this indication. Moreover, the MAH sought regulatory guidance from the FDA regarding the primary efficacy endpoint.

## · Participant flow

Of 1123 patients enrolled at 116 investigative sites, 1111 received at least one dose of study therapy and were included in the analysis of safety.  Of the 1111 treated patients, 1095 were included in the MITT  analysis;  8  patients  in  each  treatment  group  were  excluded.    The  most  common  reason  for exclusion  was  absence  of  a  temperature  above  38 o C  at  entry.    There  were 901 patients  in  the

evaluable-patients  analysis;  210  patients  (116  in  the  caspofungin  group  and  94  in  the  AmBisome group)  were  excluded.    The  most  common  reasons  for  exclusion  from  the  evaluable-patients population were protocol violations that confounded assessment (12.6%) and inadequate study therapy (generally receipt of less than 4 days of study therapy; 5.1%).  The most common protocol violation that resulted in exclusion from the evaluable-patients population was discontinuation of study therapy prior to resolution of neutropenia  (without having met  any  failure endpoint  at the time of discontinuation).

## · Baseline data

## Demographics and patient characteristics

The demographics and baseline patient  characteristics  of  the  1111  treated  patients  are  displayed  in Table 1.  The  majority  of patients  enrolled in the study  were  men  (56%)  and White (89.5%).  The mean ages of the caspofungin and AmBisome groups were 48.8 and 47.7 years, respectively.

The most common primary conditions reported in the study were acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; 64.0%),  non-Hodgkin's  lymphoma  (NHL;  10.9%),  and  acute  lymphocytic  leukemia  (ALL;  9.9%). Eighty-one  patients  (7.3%)  had  undergone  allogeneic  HSCT,  and  165  (14.9%)  had  undergone autologous HSCT at some time prior to study entry.  Most patients (73.4%) entered the study severely neutropenic with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 100 cells/microl.

Overall,  24.8%  of  the  patients  were  in  the  high-risk category,  and  constituted  26.6%  of  the caspofungin and 22.9% of the AmBisome group.  The numbers of patients categorized as high-risk due to allogeneic HSCT were similar in both treatment groups (6.6% of the caspofungin and 7.5% of the  AmBisome  group).    A  numerically  larger  proportion  of  patients  in  the  caspofungin  than  the AmBisome  group  were  considered  high  risk  on  the  basis  of  relapsed  acute  leukemia  (20.0%  and 15.4%,  respectively).    The  proportions  of  patients  who  received  prior  antifungal  prophylaxis  were similar in both treatment groups (56.2% of the caspofungin and 56.3% of the AmBisome group).

§ Primary Condition Categories:

Acute leukemia (other) includes acute leukemia.

Leukemia (other) includes leukemia, lymphocytic leukemia, myelogenous leukemia.

Lymphoma (other) includes lymphoma.

Solid tumor includes Ewing's sarcoma, angiosarcoma, brain neoplasm, breast malignant neoplasm, germ cell neoplasm, ovarian malignant neoplasm, sarcoma, testicular malignant neoplasm, testicular neoplasm.

Other includes amyloidosis, aplastic anemia, blood dyscrasia, immunohemolytic anemia, macroglobulinemia, myelofibrosis, myeloproliferative disorder, progressive systemic sclerosis.

% Patients with more than one type of transplant are counted under each specific type of transplant.

- ¶ The Neutropenic Status categories are mutually exclusive.  The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;500 category includes patients whose ANC is 100 to 499.
- # Patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and had received chemotherapy for relapse of acute leukemia are counted in the allogeneic HSCT row.

## Duration of therapy

For  the  caspofungin  group,  the  mean  and  median  duration  of  therapy  for  all  treated  patients  were 13 and 11 days, and for the AmBisome group 12.5 and 10 days, respectively.  For both groups, the range was 1 to 90 days.  The mean and median duration of therapy for high-risk patients were slightly greater than for low-risk patients in both treatment  groups (respectively, 15.2 and 12.2 days  for the caspofungin group and 14.5 and 12 days for the AmBisome group).

There  was  an  option  to  increase  the  dose  on  Day  5  or  later  to  70  mg/day  for  caspofungin  and 5 mg/kg/day for AmBisome.  A similar number of patients in both treatment groups received study medication at the standard dose, as was the number of patients who had their dose increased due to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lack of efficacy (75 or 13.3% for caspofungin and 78 or 14.3% for AmBisome).  The treatment groups were also similar with respect to the time that the dosage increase was implemented.  Patients whose dose of study therapy was increased because of clinical deterioration had slightly lower response rates than those who continued to receive the standard dose in both treatment groups.

A total of 59 patients (30 in the caspofungin group and 29 in the AmBisome group) were treated for more than 28 days.

## · Outcomes and estimation

## Primary Composite Endpoint

To be considered a favorable overall response for this study, patients had to have a favorable response for all components of the composite endpoint.

‡ MITT = modified intention-to-treat.

§ N = number of patients in the treatment group in the specified analysis population.

For  the  MITT  population,  the  percentages  of  patients  with  a  favorable  overall  response  in  the caspofungin and AmBisome groups, after adjustment for strata were 33.9% and 33.7%, respectively. The  estimated  difference  in  response  rates  between  the  2  treatment  groups  (caspofungin  minus AmBisome) was 0.2%, with a 95.2% CI of (-5.6, 6.0).  The CI contains 0 and the lower limit (-5.6%) is above the prespecified limit of -10.0%, indicating that caspofungin is noninferior to AmBisome as empirical therapy in patients with persistent fever and neutropenia.  The supportive analysis performed on the evaluable-patients population gives similar results.

It is important to examine the overall favorable response rates within each of the randomization strata (risk category and prophylaxis stratum) in the primary analysis population, because of their potential impact on the overall study outcome.

Table  3  displays  the  observed  favorable  overall  response  rates  in  the  MITT  population  for  the  2 treatment groups overall, by risk category, and by prophylaxis stratum.  The observed (unadjusted for stratum)  percentages  of  patients  with  favorable  overall  responses  are  34.2%  for  caspofungin  and 33.6% for AmBisome.  The overall favorable response rates were somewhat higher for patients in the high- than the low-risk category for both treatment groups, and numerically were greatest in the highrisk patients who received caspofungin.  Overall response rates were similar for both treatment groups whether or not antifungal prophylaxis was used.  Results were similar for the MITT and the evaluablepatients populations.

## Overview of Baseline and Breakthrough Documented Infections

As  already  described,  all  cases  of  suspected  fungal  infection  were  reviewed  by  the  Adjudication Committee,  using  blinded  data.    There  were  a  total  of  358  cases  with  suspected  fungal  infections reviewed  by  the  Adjudication  Committee.    A  total  of 106 MITT patients  had  cases  of  documented (proven  or  probable)  invasive  fungal  infections  (53  with  only  baseline  infection,  52  with  only breakthrough  infection,  and  1 with  both  baseline  and  breakthrough  infection).    Three  additional patients  in  the  study  had  documented  baseline  infections,  but  were  not  included  in  the  MITT population (incomplete  dose of study therapy  or  did not  meet the  entry  criterion  for  fever).  Of the remaining patients 156 were considered to have a possible infection and 93 to have no fungal infection at all.

After locking of the clinical database, it was noted, during the preparation of narrative summaries, that 3 cases that should have been adjudicated were not, and one case previously adjudicated had important autopsy data that had been available but was missed in the earlier adjudication.  These cases were sent to  the  adjudicators  as  blinded  data  in  order  to  present  the  most  complete  and  accurate  adjudication dataset possible.  However, the clean file was not altered because adjudication of these patients would have  no  impact  on the  primary  study  result:  these  patients  failed  other  endpoints  and  were  already failures for the primary analysis.  Inclusion of these cases affects only the numbers and distribution of diagnoses for documented breakthrough infections in the AmBisome group; these were:  1 new case with  breakthrough  probable  chronic  disseminated  candidiasis,  and  one  change  of  diagnosis  from breakthrough proven sinusitis to breakthrough proven disseminated fungal infection.  The data on lateadjudicated cases, are included in the text and tables that follow.  Inclusion of these data had no impact on the overall study analysis or its conclusions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## /square4 Successful Treatment of Baseline Infection

Patients with baseline infections were enrolled into the study and included in the MITT analysis only if the likelihood of a fungal infection at the time of study entry was, at most, possible.  Patients with known, documented invasive fungal infections were excluded.  Therefore, those patients with baseline infections described below may have had possible infection present at study entry (or by Day 2), but the  confirmatory  information  from  tests  or  specimens  obtained  prior  to  or  at  entry,  that  led  the Adjudicators to consider these probable or proven infections, did not become positive until after study entry.

The Adjudication Committee assessed the response to study therapy  of all baseline invasive  fungal infections.  'Complete response' and 'partial response' were considered favorable clinical outcomes. Complete response was defined as resolution  of  all attributable signs, symptoms, and abnormalities detected  by  radiography,  bronchoscopy,  endoscopy,  or  other  procedures,  and  negative  cultures  for fungal pathogens.  A partial response was defined as clinically meaningful improvement in attributable symptoms and signs, as well as in attributable abnormalities  detected by  other procedures, as noted above.

As displayed in the Tables 3 and 4 the percentages of MITT patients who had successful treatment of their baseline fungal infections were 51.9% in  the  caspofungin and 25.9% in the AmBisome group. The difference in response rates between the 2 treatment groups (caspofungin minus AmBisome) was 25.9% with a 95% CI of (0.9, 51.0).  Within each treatment group, the response rates were lower for patients in the high- than the low-risk category, as expected.

## Demographics of Patients with Baseline Infections

There were 27 patients in each treatment group with baseline infections:  4.9% of the caspofungin and 5.0%  of  the  AmBisome  group.    The  baseline  demographic  characteristics  of  the  54  patients  with baseline infections were generally similar between the 2 treatment groups.

## Distribution of Baseline Infections, Overall, and by Stratum

The most common baseline infections were due to Aspergillus species (12 infections per group; the most common diagnosis was pneumonia) and Candida species (also 12 infections per group; the most common diagnosis was fungemia).  The infection types were balanced between the 2 treatment groups. The remaining pathogens were Dipodascus (1), Fusarium (2) , and Mucor (1) species, and mould NOS (not otherwise specified; 2).

With respect to risk-category, the distribution of infections was reasonably balanced in the 2 treatment groups,  except  that  high-risk  patients  in  the  caspofungin  group  had  a  slightly  higher  proportion  of Aspergillus baseline  infections  (6/146  or  4.1%)  than  low-risk  patients  (6/410  or  1.5%).    For AmBisome there  were similar proportions  of Aspergillus baseline  infection  in  the  2  risk  categories (2/122 [1.6%] in the high-risk and 10/417 [2.4%] in the low-risk).

The  distribution  of  infections  by  use  of  prior  prophylaxis  was  balanced  overall  between  the  2 treatment  groups.    The  use  of  prophylaxis,  however,  was  associated  with  lower  overall  rates  of baseline infections due to Candida species (both treatment groups combined:  5/617 [0.8%] in patients with prior prophylaxis and 19/478 [4.0%] without prophylaxis).  These findings are expected, in view of the frequent use of fluconazole prophylaxis in this study population.

The number of baseline infections due to Candida species in this study was as high as the number of baseline  infections  due  to  Aspergillus  species  (24  infections  of  each).  This  is  somewhat  surprising when  considering  the  frequent  use  of  fluconazole  prophylaxis,  which  should  reduce  the  number  of Candida infections. However, the number of Candida infections is indeed much lower in patients who received antifungal prophylaxis than in those who did not.

Concerning the use of prophylaxis this use seems to be quite different according to the center involved and the investigator in charge: indeed, 37.7% of high risk patients did not receive any prophylaxis at all, whereas 54.4% of low risk patients did receive prophylaxis. This difference in 'clinical practice' has  to  be  taken  into  consideration  when  looking  at  the  prophylaxis  strata,  meaning  that  it  is  very difficult to draw conclusions based upon the occurrence of prior prophylaxis.

## Microbiology of Baseline Pathogens

There were 25 yeast pathogens and 30 mould pathogens (including the Fusarium sp. described in the footnote)  identified  either  microbiologically  or  histologically  as  causing  baseline  infections  by  the Adjudication Committee; MIC data were available in 25/55 or 45.5% of total baseline pathogens.

The  MIC  distribution  was  examined  for  15  unique  pathogenic  isolates  tested  from  patients  with baseline  yeast  infections.    Most  baseline  yeast  isolates  were Candida species  and  had  MICs  to caspofungin ≤ 1 µg/ml.  There were 2 isolates with caspofungin MIC &gt;8 µg/ml:  1 C. parapsilosis that trailed  and  1 D. capitatus ,  and  1 C. krusei had  an  MIC of 2µg/ml.   All  yeast isolates  had  MICs to amphotericin B ≤ 1.0 µg/ml.

The  MIC  distribution  was  examined  for  10  unique  pathogenic  isolates  from  patients  with  baseline mould  infections.    Most  baseline  mould  isolates  were Aspergillus species.    All  mould  isolates  had MICs  to  caspofungin ≤ 0.5 µg/ml.    Most  mould  isolates  had  MICs  to  amphotericin  B ≤ 1  µg/ml; however, there were 3 isolates with higher MICs to amphotericin B:  1 A. candidus had an MIC of 2, another A. candidus had an MIC of 4, and 1 A. terreus had an MIC of 4 µg/ml.

## Response to Treatment for Specific Baseline Infections

Response rates were higher in the caspofungin group for both baseline infections caused by Candida and Aspergillus species  (see  Table  5)  and  the  difference  was  most  pronounced  for Aspergillus infections (overall) with rates of 41.7% for the caspofungin group and 8.3% for the AmBisome group. Results were similar in the MITT and evaluable-patients populations.

† N = Number of  modified intention-to-treat patients in treatment group.

‡ All adjudicated diagnoses and assessments.

§ n/m = Number of patients with this category of infection and a favorable response/ umber of patients with this category of infection.  Favorable response is defined as an Adjudication Committee assessment of complete or partial response.

% One patient included in this count had a mixed infection of Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium with an unfavorable response.  The outcome for Fusarium is not shown in this table.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of  the favorable  responses,  partial  responses were  seen  more  often  in  infections caused  by Aspergillus species, (frequently  manifesting  as pneumonia), whereas  complete responses  were  more often  seen  with Candida infections  (frequently  manifesting  as  candidemias).    Of  the  14  successful responses  in  the  caspofungin  group,  6  were  partial  and  8  were  complete  (1  complete  and  4  partial responses caused by Aspergillus sp, and 6 complete and 2 partial responses caused by Candida sp.). Of the 7 successful responses in the Ambisome group, 3 were partial (2 Candida sp. and 1 Fusarium sp.) and 4 were complete (3 Candida sp. and 1 Aspergillus sp). A complete response for candidemias, documented  by  repeat  blood  cultures,  was  more  readily  achieved  than  a  complete  response  for pneumonias, because of the typical lag times in resolution  of associated radiographic abnormalities. The small numbers of isolates from individual species and limited availability of MIC data preclude an analysis of outcome by MIC.

## Per Pathogen Outcomes for Baseline Infections

The  clinical  response  by  pathogen  in  MITT  patients  is  displayed  in  Table  6.    The  proportions  of patients in the caspofungin and AmBisome treatment groups that had favorable clinical responses to baseline Aspergillus pathogens were 46.2 and 7.7%, respectively, and to baseline Candida pathogens, they were 63.6 and 41.7%, respectively.  These results are similar to those observed in the response to treatment for specific baseline infections (see Table 5) with this difference that for one patient in each treatment  group,  there  were  2  unique  baseline  isolates  of  an Aspergillus species  associated  with pneumonia ( A. candidus in the caspofungin group and A. flavus in the AmBisome group), and that one case  of  probable  chronic  disseminated  candidiasis,  in  the  absence  of  culture  or  histopathologic confirmation  of Candida species,  was  considered  to  be  'presumed Candida species'  and  thus  not counted in the per pathogen displays.

The  response  rate  of  Ambisome  for  treating  baseline  fungal  infections  is  unexpectedly  very  low (25.9%)  when  comparing  this  to  results  from  other  studies,  e.g.  Ambisome  versus  voriconazole (Walsh  TJ  et  al.  Voriconazole  compared  with  liposomal  amphotericin  B  for  empirical  antifungal therapy in patients with neutropenia and persistent fever. N Engl J Med 2002; 346:225-34.). Although it is acknowledged that the number of baseline infections is small, this seems to be mainly due to an abnormally  low  response  rate  for  baseline  infections  caused  by  Aspergillus  species.  It  is  not understood  what  the  exact  reason  for  this  could  be.  When  looking  at  Table  6  it  seems  that  5 Aspergillus species in the Ambisome group were not further identified (versus 4 in the caspofungin group).

The  scarcity  of  data  directly  related  to  Aspergillus  infections  in  previously  performed  empirical studies  is  acknowledged.  Data  from  studies  with  documented  infections  are  indeed  difficult  to compare  with  the  current  empirical  study  data,  due  to  the  differences  in  study  design,  in  applied definitions and in other criteria. This also applies to the historical control study, which is an entirely different study with another design and another patient population.  Furthermore, there seems to be a discrepancy between microbiological data as provided in Table 6 for the AmBisome group and data provided  in  the  originally  submitted  documentation.  Indeed,  the  single  A.  terreus  infection  in  the AmBisome group is not  mentioned here and similarly  only  3  instead  of  4  A.  flavus  infections  are documented. Instead 1 unknown mould and 1 Aspergillus-like mould are mentioned here as causative organisms. The apparent discrepancy between Table 6 submitted by the MAH in December 2003 and the original documentation submitted in September 2003 can be explained by the conventions used to present the  data. In tables that  displayed  diagnosis of the invasive  fungal infection, but  not specific pathogen names, the diagnoses were grouped according to the Adjudication Committee's determination of the causative pathogen, and were displayed according to the genus of the causative pathogen.  In  contrast,  in  listing  tables  and  in  per  pathogen  displays,  the  causative  pathogens  were identified by genus  and species, if this information  was available. Therefore,  even if it  would have been  useful  to  apply  the  same  conventions  at  all  times  to  prevent  confusion,  the  discrepancy  is here clarified.

† N = Number of modified intention-to-treat  patients in the treatment group.

‡ m/n = Number of culture documented baseline isolates associated with favorable clinical response/total number of pathogens in patients with culture documented baseline infection.

§ N/A = Not applicable (no patients with this particular pathogen).

% One patient included in this count had a mixed infection of Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium with an unfavorable response . The outcome for Fusarium is not shown in the table.

## Baseline Fungemias

Of 15 baselines yeast MITT isolates tested, 12 were blood isolates.  Thus, the MIC data available for blood isolates from patients in the MITT population resembled the overall MIC pattern for all yeast baseline pathogens.  Yeasts caused all documented fungemias in this study.

## Persistence of Baseline Infections

The persistence of baseline infections was examined by reviewing all documented baseline infections with  an  unfavorable  outcome,  as  determined  by  the  Adjudication  Committee.    A  positive  final  ontherapy  culture  from a relevant site was  considered persistence.  Negative  final  on-therapy  cultures were considered evidence of eradication.  For disseminated infections, all relevant sites were reviewed and any positive final on-therapy culture from a relevant site was considered persistence.  Posttherapy cultures,  whether positive  or negative,  were  not  considered relevant  here inasmuch as patients  may have received alternative antifungal therapy, or could have relapsed.

In  the  caspofungin  group, 2  of  the  13  baseline  infections  with  clinical  failure  were  associated  with documented microbiological persistence: One was a C. tropicalis disseminated fungal infection with positive  blood  culture  at  entry.    Although  repeat  blood  cultures  were  negative,  the  patient  had  a positive culture from skin biopsy on Day 6.  This patient received 14 days of study therapy and was a clinical  failure.  The second was a case of Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium sp. pneumonia with sputum culture positive on Day -3 for A. fumigatus only, and subsequent sputum culture on Day 11

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that was positive for both A. fumigatus and Fusarium sp.  This patient received 19 days of therapy and was a clinical failure.

In  the  AmBisome  group,  4  of  the  20  baseline  infections  with  clinical  failure  were  associated  with documented persistence.  There were 3 cases of persistent candidemia (1 C. tropicalis, and 2 C. krusei) and one case of persistent Aspergillus niger in a disseminated fungal infection.

There were 27 patients with baseline infections in each treatment group. Apart from the persistence of infections  as  described  above,  the  patients  with  documented  baseline  infections  and  unfavorable outcomes can be described as follows:

Among documented baseline infections in the MITT population, there were 13 unfavorable responses in the caspofungin group and 20 unfavorable responses in the AmBisome group.  Most unfavorable responses were failures.  The others were 2 indeterminate outcomes in the caspofungin group and 1 stable disease in the AmBisome  group.    The  patient  narrative summaries  and  adjudicators' assessments  of  the  reason  for  an  unfavorable  clinical  outcome  were  reviewed  and  selected  patient characteristics and reasons for failure determined from this review are presented in a table (data not presented here).

Patients with  unfavorable  outcomes  for baseline infections were a  very  high risk subset of patients; most  were  either  high  risk,  or  if  low  risk  had  acute  leukemia  (mostly  AML),  and  entered  with profound neutropenia.  Most patients had multiple reasons for failure.

Of  the  13  unfavorable  responses  in  the  caspofungin  group,  5  were  dose-increased  for  inadequate clinical  response,  9  were  prematurely  discontinued  due  to  lack  of  efficacy,  7  had  persistent neutropenia,  10  had  progressive  signs  or  symptoms,  9  had  progressive  (or  new)  radiological abnormalities,  5  had  a  positive  culture,  including  2  with  persistent  baseline  pathogen,  10  changed antifungal therapy, and 4 patients died.

For the 20 patients with unfavorable responses in the AmBisome group, 10 were dose-increased for inadequate  clinical  response,  5  were  prematurely  discontinued  due  to  lack  of  efficacy,  13  had persistent neutropenia,  18 had  progressive  signs or  symptoms,  14  had  progressive  (or  new) radiological abnormalities, 12 had a positive culture, including 4 with persistent baseline pathogen, 8 changed antifungal therapy, and 10 patients died.

In the 'baseline fungal infection' endpoint, there was an imbalance for persistent neutropenia (defined as ANC &lt;500/µL at the end of study therapy) between treatment groups, which favours caspofungin. Persistent neutropenia was commonly present in patients with an unfavorable treatment outcome (in 7 of the 13 caspofungin failures, 53.8 %, and in 13 of the 20 AmBisome failures, 65%), and only 1 of the 21 patients with favorable outcomes for both treatment groups. Although the two groups were well balanced at study entry, persistent neutropenia appeared somewhat more common in the AmBisome group  (13/27,  48%,  had  persistent  neutropenia  in  the  AmBisome  group  vs.  7/27,  25.9%,  in  the caspofungin  group),  and  this  independent  prognostic  factor  may  have  influenced  the  outcomes  of baseline infections.

## /square4 Absence of Breakthrough Infections

Breakthrough infections were defined as probable and/or proven adjudicated infections with onset on or after Day 3 of study therapy and up to 7 days after completion of therapy.

The distinction between a baseline and a breakthrough infection was predefined, albeit very arbitrary, as based upon the given definitions (onset up to the second day of study therapy versus onset on or after  the  third  day  of  study  therapy).  The  adjudication  committee  decided  if  it  was  a  baseline  or breakthrough infection with date of onset as the date that a diagnostic test (e.g. a culture specimen) was obtained.

As displayed in Tables 3 and 4 the percentages of MITT patients without breakthrough infections were similar in both treatment groups ( 94.8% in the caspofungin and 95.5% in the AmBisome group).  The observed difference (caspofungin minus AmBisome) in response rates between the 2 treatment groups was -0.8% with a 95% CI of (-3.3, 1.8).  Breakthrough infections were more common for patients in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the high-risk category in both treatment groups, as expected, but the rates of breakthrough infections appeared similar whether or not antifungal prophylaxis was used.

## Demographics of Patients With Breakthrough Infections

In  the  MITT  population  there  were  29  caspofungin  patients  and  24  AmBisome  patients  with breakthrough  infections,  when  the  late  adjudication  cases  are  included.    The  baseline  demographic characteristics of these patient infections were generally similar.

## Distribution Of Breakthrough Infections Overall and by Stratum

There were 30 breakthrough infections in 29 patients in the caspofungin group, and 25 breakthrough infections in the 24 AmBisome patients. Candida species were the most common pathogens (chronic disseminated candidiasis [14] and fungemia [12] were the most common diagnoses).  The second most common pathogens were Aspergillus species (pneumonia was the most common diagnosis [12]).

Overall,  by  pathogen,  the  types  of  breakthrough  infections  were  balanced  between  the  2 treatment groups. However, there were more breakthrough infections caused by species other than Candida or Aspergillus in the caspofungin than the AmBisome group (4/30 versus 1/25, respectively): these were caused by Basidiomycetes (1), Zygomycetes (2) and Fusarium (1) in the caspofungin group, and by a not further specified mould in the Ambisome group.  Across pathogens, there were numerically more cases of disseminated fungal infection in the caspofungin than the AmBisome group (8 versus 3).

Breakthrough  infection  occurred  more  often  in  high-risk  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  (15/146 [10.3%]  of  caspofungin  and  9/122  [7.4%]  of  AmBisome  patients)  than  low-risk  patients  (15/410 [3.7%]  and  16/417  [3.8%],  respectively).    Also  there  was  a  higher  proportion  of Aspergillus breakthrough infections in high-risk patients in both treatment groups (7/146 [4.8%] and 7/122 [5.7%], respectively) than low-risk patients (3/410 [0.7%] and 2/417 [0.5%], respectively).

The  overall  distribution  of  breakthrough  infections  was  generally  similar  between  the  2 treatment groups whether or not prophylaxis was used.

## Microbiology of Breakthrough Pathogens

The organisms causing breakthrough infections were primarily Candida and Aspergillus species, but also  included  several  less  common  yeast  and  mould  pathogens.    There  were  32  yeast  pathogens (including the C. glabrata in the footnote) and 24 mould pathogens identified either microbiologically or  histologically as  causing breakthrough infections by the Adjudication Committee; MIC data were available in 27/56 or 48.2% of total breakthrough pathogens.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the 17 unique  yeast breakthrough isolates tested in the MITT population, 15 were blood isolates and 14 were Candida species.

There were 5 yeast isolates in the caspofungin arm and 2 from the AmBisome arm (1 C. parapsilosis and 1 C. guilliermondii, both trailers) with caspofungin MICs &gt;8 µ g/ml.  In the caspofungin group, 3 of the 5 isolates with MICs &gt;8 µ g/ml in RPMI were trailing isolates (all C. parapsilosis ) and one was a  nonCandida isolate, T. beigelii .    Trailing  in  RPMI  medium  has  been  consistently seen  for  some Candida species,  especially  C. parapsilosis and  C. guillermondii .    This in  vitro phenomenon is  not seen  in  other  media  and  has  not  been  associated  with  reduced  susceptibility  to  caspofungin.    The significance  of  caspofungin  MICs  for  T. beigelii is  unclear  since  there  are  no  standardized  testing methods for any anti-fungal agent against the nonCandida yeasts.

One breakthrough Candida isolate, Candida albicans , had a clear endpoint of MIC &gt;8 µ g/ml in RPMI. This  isolate  came  from  a  patient  with  a  breakthrough  disseminated Candida infection  involving multiple sites and blood.  This patient had 4 separate Candida albicans isolates all determined to be of common origin by DNA and CA3 fingerprinting analyses:  an oropharyngeal isolate, a blood isolate, a tissue isolate from lung biopsy and a tissue isolate from liver biopsy.  Additional evaluation included MIC testing, FKS1 gene sequence analysis, assays of glucan synthase activity, and in vivo activity in the mouse TOKA disseminated candidiasis model.  The liver and mouth isolates were considered fully susceptible to caspofungin by all  methods.  The lung and blood isolates, however, showed  elevated MIC values both in RPMI (&gt;128 µ g/ml) and AM3 (&gt;16 µ g/ml) medium, had FKS single amino acid substitution at position 645, and reduced inhibition of glucan synthesis based on increased IC50 values. In the animal model, caspofungin showed efficacy against the blood but not the lung isolate.  For the lung isolate, an ED90 value could not be calculated, although there was a significant reduction of C. albicans colony forming units (CFU) in kidneys of mice at doses ranging from 12 to 20 mg/kg/day, compared to infected, untreated controls.

All 10 unique mould breakthrough isolates from both treatment arms, most of which were Aspergillus species,  had  caspofungin  MICs ≤ 0.5 µg/ml and  amphotericin B MICs of ≤ 1 µg/ml. There  was 1 A. flavus isolate with an amphotericin B MIC of 2 µg/ml.

## Timing of Breakthrough Infections

Most breakthrough fungal infections in both treatment groups occurred  while the patients  were still receiving  study  therapy  (only  4 of  30  cases  for  caspofungin  and  5  of  25  for  AmBisome  occurred within 7 days after the end of study therapy).

## Additional Information Regarding Documented Infections

## -  Discordance  Between  Adjudication  Committee  and  Investigator  Assessments  of  Documented Infection

Discordance between the Adjudication Committee and the investigators  was  common regarding the adjudicated probable and proven fungal infections but was generally not of clinical significance; most of the discordance was due to the different terminology used to describe the same pathogenic process. The  Adjudication  Committee,  which  was  unaware  of  the  investigators'  assessments  regarding treatment  outcome,  was  generally  more  conservative  than  the  investigators  and  assigned  more unfavorable treatment outcomes.

## Mortality in Patients with Documented Infections

Because  mortality  rates  are  substantial  in  this  at-risk  patient  population,  due  to  fungal  and  other infections,  as  well  as  underlying  malignancy  and  its  noninfectious  complications,  it  is  important  to examine mortality from a variety of perspectives.  This study examined mortality using three different prespecified  approaches.    This  section  presents  mortality  data  in  patients  with  documented  fungal infections, with consideration of overall mortality and mortality potentially attributable to the fungal infection (e.g. death caused by or occurring in the presence of active fungal infection).

The  other  prespecified  approaches  to  mortality  were  survival  to  7  days  posttherapy  for  the  MITT population, as a component of the primary endpoint (see point 3 below) and a review of mortality for all treated patients in the Safety section.

Overall mortality rates in the MITT population due to or in the setting of active fungal infection are summarized separately for patients with baseline and breakthrough infections in Table 8 below.

## - Mortality in Patients With Documented Baseline Infection

The mortality rate in patients with a baseline infection was substantially lower in the caspofungin than the AmBisome group (3 deaths [11.1%] versus 12 deaths [44.4%]) (p&lt;0.01).  The excess mortality in the  AmBisome  group  appeared  primarily  to  be  associated  with  bacterial  or  fungal  infections  or nonspecific  sepsis  syndromes.    Investigators  made  a  determination  about  the  relationship  of  the adverse experiences to death.  The Adjudication Committee determined independently the presence of invasive fungal infections, but did not specifically assess whether a fungal infection contributed to the patient's death.  However, a review of the narratives of the 15 deaths among 54 patients with baseline infections shows that 13 (86.7%) of these 15 deaths were either due to fungal infections or occurred in the setting of active fungal infection:  3 of 27 patients (11.1%) in the caspofungin group and 10 of 27 (37.0%) in the AmBisome group, thus yielding mortality rates in the setting of active fungal infection of 11.1% and 37.0% , respectively.  These results are also consistent with the higher rate of successful treatment  outcome  for  baseline  infections  in  the  caspofungin  group.    The  Adjudication  Committee assessed  the  treatment  outcome  of  the  baseline  infection  as  failures  in  each  of  the  13  patients  who died.    In  the  remaining  2  cases,  the  deaths  were  due  to  noninfectious  causes,  and  the  Adjudication Committee's determination of treatment outcome for the baseline infection was favorable.

## - Mortality in Patients With Documented Breakthrough Infection

During the study period, the mortality rate in patients with breakthrough infections was similar for the 2  treatment  groups:    10  deaths (34.5%) in  the  caspofungin  group  and  10 deaths (41.7%) in  the AmBisome group.  The most common fatal adverse experiences were in the Body as a Whole system; usually  related  to  a  bacterial  or  fungal  infection  or  a  nonspecific  sepsis  syndrome.    There  was  one additional fatal adverse  experience in the  caspofungin group reported in the poststudy period (more than  14  days  after  the  end  of  study  therapy)  as  a  fatal  fungal  infection.    Thus  there  were  11/29  or 37.9% deaths in the setting of breakthrough infections in the caspofungin group.  All 21 deaths (11 in the  caspofungin  group  and  10  in  the  AmBisome  group)  were  either  due  to  a  fungal  infection  or occurred in the presence of active fungal infection.

## - Breakthrough Infections Identified After the 7-day Posttreatment Follow-Up Visit

All  suspected  fungal  infections  were  adjudicated,  but  the  analysis  of  breakthrough  infections  was limited  to  those  that  occurred  and  were  documented  by  the  7-day posttherapy  visit,  as  defined  and required by the protocol.  Evidence for breakthrough infections identified after the 7-day posttreatment follow-up visit was not required by protocol and was not uniformly available; however, in some cases, these data were reported by the investigator and all such information was provided to the Adjudication Committee.    Any  breakthrough  infections  identified  from data obtained  only  after  the  7-day posttherapy follow-up visit were documented by the Adjudication Committee.  Although described in the  study  report,  they  were  not  counted  in  the  primary  analysis.    There  were  5  'post-7-day' breakthrough infections in the caspofungin group, and 6 in the AmBisome group.  Of the 11 patients with 'post-7-day' breakthrough infections, 3 patients died (or had a fatal adverse experience) during

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the study (during 2 week posttreatment follow-up period):  2 in the caspofungin group and 1 in the AmBisome  group.    Based  upon  available  data,  the  overall  numbers  of  'post-7-day'  breakthrough infections  appeared  similar  between  the  treatment  groups,  with  similar  distribution  of  specific diagnoses, pathogens, and mortality.

## - Adjudicated Possible Invasive Fungal Infections

The Adjudication Committee assessed all the same variables with respect to possible infections as for the  documented  infections,  although,  as  prespecified,  possible  invasive  fungal  infections  were  not included  in  any  of  the  formal  study  analyses.    However,  when  possible  infections  were  included according  to  the  same  conventions  as  documented  infections,  the  conclusions  of  the  primary study analysis remain unchanged for both the MITT and evaluable-patients populations.

The company was asked to prove its assertion that inclusion of 'possible' invasive fungal infections in the  primary  analysis  would  not  alter  the  main  study  conclusion.  As  specified  in  the  protocol  only documented infections (i.e. proven or probable infections) were considered for analysis. Concerning the possible breakthrough infections, the majority of patients (56/57) had pneumonias. Only 3 out of the 57 patients had microbiological data of which only one fulfilled the microbiological criteria for IFI as defined by the EORTC/MSG. Although the criteria of diagnosis of possible IFI were sufficient for initiating antifungal therapy, a post-hoc examination by the expert panel based upon all data available up to 7 days post-therapy could not demonstrate more definitive data, which is reassuring. Although it can  be  agreed  that  the  occurrence  of  possible  infections  should  be  regarded  with  a  high  level  of uncertainty, and that in the setting of an empirical therapy trial in febrile neutropenic patients, analysis of documented invasive fungal infections should be limited to the probable and proven categories, the higher numbers of possible breakthrough infections in the caspofungin group vs AmBisome group (38 vs 19) raises some concern.

## /square4 Survival to 7-Day Follow-Up

Four patients in the caspofungin group and five in the AmBisome group were lost to follow-up within 7 days after the completion of therapy and are therefore counted as failures for the survival endpoint. As shown in the Tables 3 and 4 the percentages of  patients  who  survived  for  at  least  7  days  after completion  of  therapy  were 92.6% for  caspofungin  and 89.2% for  AmBisome.    The  observed difference (caspofungin minus AmBisome) in response rates between the 2 treatment groups was 3.4% with a 95% CI of (0.0, 6.8).  The rate of survival to 7 days posttherapy was lower in high- than lowrisk patients within each treatment group, as would be expected.  For the evaluable-patients analysis, patients who were lost to follow-up earlier than 7 days after the completion of therapy are excluded from the analysis of the survival endpoint.  Results were similar for the evaluable-patients population (survival rate 92.6% for caspofungin and 90.1% for AmBisome).

## Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Survival Time

Kaplan-Meier estimates of the time to death for each of the treatment groups were calculated in order to reflect the probability of surviving beyond a given day through 7 days posttherapy (see Figure 1).  It should be noted that most patients completed study treatment by 28 days and were followed only 7 days longer for the survival endpoint, or up to 35 days.  Consequently, the population becomes much smaller after Day 35.  The log-rank chi-square statistic was significant (p=0.044), indicating that there is  a  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  with  respect  to  time  to  death.    A  consistently  higher proportion of caspofungin than AmBisome patients survived, and the difference was most pronounced after Study Day 28.  The Kaplan-Meier estimates for survival to 7 days posttherapy was repeated for the  evaluable-patients  population,  however,  the  log-rank  chi-square  statistic  was  not  significant (p=0.192).

Kaplan-Meier  estimates  and  curves  were  also  calculated  in  order  to  assess  the  effect  of  the  risk category on survival time.  The log-rank chi-square statistic was significant (p=0.032), indicating that there is a difference among the 4 treatment group and risk category combinations with respect to time to  death:    there  was  a  shorter  survival  time  for  high-risk  patients  in  the  AmBisome  than  the caspofungin group, and for low-risk patients in either treatment group.

## Deaths Reported During Treatment and Follow-up Period

In  the  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint,  patients  lost  to  follow-up  before  7  days  post-therapy  were considered failures.  The percentages of patients who actually died during study therapy or the 7-day posttherapy  follow-up  period  were  numerically  lower  for  caspofungin  ( 6.7% ,  37/556)  than  for AmBisome  ( 9.8% ,  53/539).    Most  of  the  deaths  in  both  groups  occurred  during  the  7-day posttreatment  follow-up  period.    The  treatment  groups  were  generally  balanced  with  respect  to  the most common  fatal  adverse  experiences,  which  were  related  to  various  infections  (fungal  and  nonfungal), hematologic malignancies, and respiratory illnesses.  Cardiovascular fatal adverse experiences were slightly  more  frequent in the  AmBisome  group (10 [1.8%] for caspofungin and 19 [3.5%]  for AmBisome).  Fatal  hepatobiliary  system  adverse  experiences  were  noted  in  2  caspofungin  patients (0.4%)  but  not  in  the  AmBisome  group;  neither  was  considered  drug  related.    Similar  adverse experiences led to  death in both treatment  groups  and reflected the serious  underlying diseases and complications expected in such a sick study population.

Overall, 90 (8.2%) MITT patients died, 37 in the caspofungin group and 53 in the AmBisome group. Few patients died during study therapy; the majority of fatal events (79/90; 88%) occurred during the 7-day follow-up. Autopsy was performed in 21 (23%) cases. Of these 10 had documented IFI (5 in each treatment group), according to the adjudicators and IFI was confirmed in all cases at autopsy. In the other 11 cases, 2 with possible pneumonia and 9 with non-fungal deaths (not considered to have IFI by Adjudicators), no invasive fungal infection could be detected at autopsy. Fatal adverse events in the remaining cases included e.g. cardiovascular events, respiratory illnesses and sepsis/multiple organ failure reflecting the serious underlying disease and complications that could be expected in this study population. Data suggest that most patients (other than those discussed above with documented IFI) died due to non-fungal causes.

The MAH was asked to investigate if there was indeed an increase in creatinine levels in those patients who died and to analyse if these levels could be a reason for the difference in survival seen between both  treatment  groups.  As  expected,  an  increase  in  creatinine  in  patients  with  already  pre-existing renal impairment was indeed a clear predictor of increased mortality. As clearly demonstrated in this analysis,  the  outcome  of  a  baseline  infection  as  well  as  the  presence  of  persistent  neutropenia  are important prognostic factors for survival. The survival endpoint as presented in the application file had to be re-analysed due to the existing imbalance in persistent neutropenia in the patients with a baseline

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

infection. Taking these data into consideration, the survival advantage for caspofungin appears at least doubtful.

## /square4 Absence of Premature Discontinuation Due to Toxicity of Lack of Efficacy

The study endpoint defined discontinuations due to either toxicity or lack of efficacy as failure for the MITT analysis.    In  contrast,  patients  who  discontinued  therapy  for  reasons  other  than  study  drugrelated toxicity or lack of efficacy were, like patients who completed therapy, considered as successes. Patients  who  prematurely  discontinued  therapy  due  to  lack  of  efficacy  had  either  suspected  fungal infection  generally  requiring  a  change  of  antifungal  therapy  or  persistent  fever  without  a  suspected fungal infection.

As shown in the Tables 3 and 4 the rates of absence of premature discontinuation for toxicity or lack of efficacy were consistently higher in the caspofungin group, overall ( 89.7% for caspofungin versus 85.5% for  AmBisome)  and  for  both  high-  and  low-risk  categories  and  with  or  without  use  of antifungal prophylaxis.  Results for the evaluable-patients population  were generally similar (88.2% for caspofungin and 83.4% for AmBisome, respectively).

## Reason for Premature Discontinuation

More than one reason for discontinuation was possible; however, only one reason was identified by the investigator for assessment of this endpoint.  The specific reasons for endpoint discontinuations are summarized in Table 9 below.

## Lack of Efficacy

Lack of efficacy could have been due either to suspected fungal infection or to persistent fever without specific evidence to suggest fungal infection.  As shown above similar proportions of patients in both treatment groups discontinued for each of the lack of efficacy reasons.

All discontinuations due to lack of efficacy were reviewed.  If any evidence of fungal infection was present,  then  the  case  was  adjudicated.    In  contrast  to  other  analyses  in  this  submission,  possible invasive  fungal  infections  in  the  Adjudicators'  assessment  were  included  with  probable  or  proven infections in order to permit an adequate comparison with the investigators' clinical management of the  patients.    For  all  49  discontinuations  due  to  suspected  fungal  infection,  the  Adjudication Committee agreed that there was at least a possible fungal infection (either baseline and breakthrough infection).  Of baseline infections, all but 2 were considered by the Adjudication Committee to have unfavorable treatment outcomes, thus showing fundamental agreement between the investigators' and the Adjudication Committee's decisions regarding possible and documented infection.

## Toxicity

Caspofungin  had  generally  lower  rates  of  discontinuation  due  to  drug-related  adverse  experiences (4.9% for caspofungin and 8.2% for AmBisome).  Relatively few patients prematurely discontinued therapy due to drug-related clinical adverse experiences.  Nine patients in the caspofungin group were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

discontinued due to drug-related adverse experiences of the skin and skin appendages, and 1 case was a serious rash; all patients recovered. Five patients in the caspofungin group were discontinued due to drug-related adverse experiences in the hepatobiliary system or hyperbilirubinemia; one of the adverse experiences was considered serious.  Of these 5 patients 4 patients had underlying hepatic dysfunction. The  hepatobiliary  adverse  experience  generally  occurred  in  the  setting  of  other  concomitant  organ dysfunction  or  allergic  reaction,  with  no  particular  pattern  to  the  biochemical  abnormalities  noted. The biochemical abnormalities that occurred during therapy were relatively mild in 2 cases, and in 2 of  3  other  cases  with  marked  abnormalities,  this  appeared  to  be  an  isolated  event.    The  adverse experience resolved in 2 cases.  With regard to the 3 cases with hepatobiliary adverse experiences that did not resolve, 14-day follow-up information was available only in 1 case; the other 2 patients died of other  causes  within  4  days  after  discontinuation  of  therapy  and  therefore  resolution  could  not  be assessed.

Very few patients discontinued therapy due to drug-related laboratory adverse experiences (3 versus 13 cases in the caspofungin and the AmBisome group, respectively).  Laboratory drug-related adverse experiences  leading  to  discontinuation  were  primarily  related  to  liver  function  tests  (ALT,  AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total or direct hyperbilirubinemia) or to increased serum creatinine.  In each test category, there were fewer discontinuations in the caspofungin than the AmBisome group.

## /square4 Resolution of Fever During Neutropenia

Fever resolution  was  defined as  a  maximum  oral temperature  (or its  equivalent,  using  noninfusionrelated  temperatures)  of  &lt;38 degrees  Celsius  for  at  least  48  consecutive  hours during  the  period  of neutropenia  (ANC  &lt;500/µL).    As  shown  in  the  Tables  3  and  4  similar  percentages  of  patients experienced  fever  resolution  during  neutropenia: 41.2% in  the  caspofungin  and 41.4% in  the AmBisome  group.    The  observed  difference  (caspofungin  minus  AmBisome)  in  response  rates between the 2 treatment groups was -0.2% with a 95% CI of (-6.0, 5.6).  This endpoint had the lowest success rate of all the individual components of the composite primary endpoint.   Unexpectedly, there was a higher rate of fever resolution in the high-risk category for both treatment groups (50 to 52.1% for high-risk patients; 37.3 to 38.9% for low-risk patients).  A detailed exploration was undertaken of the  durations  of  fever,  neutropenia,  and  fever  during  neutropenia,  with  an  emphasis  on  differences related to risk category rather than treatment group.

## Time to Resolution of Fever During Study Therapy

Kaplan-Meier  estimates  were  computed  for  the  proportion  of  MITT  patients  with  persistent  fever during study therapy.  The log-rank chi-square statistic was not significant (p=0.834), indicating that there is no difference between the treatment groups with respect to time to resolution of fever.  By Day 7 of study therapy, ~50% of the patients in each treatment group had resolution of fever.

Kaplan-Meier estimates  were  also used to  display the time to resolution  of  fever by the 4 treatment and  risk  category  groups  for  MITT  patients.    The  log-rank  chi-square  statistic  was  not  significant (p=0.402), indicating that there is no difference among the 4 treatment and risk category groups with respect to time to resolution of fever.

## Time to Resolution of Neutropenia During Study Therapy

Kaplan-Meier  estimates  were  calculated  for  the  time  to  resolution  of  neutropenia.    In  the  MITT analysis,  the  log-rank  chi-square  statistic  was  not  significant  (p=0.732),  indicating  no  difference between the treatment groups with respect to time to resolution of neutropenia.  By Day 8 of study therapy,  ~50%  of  the  patients  in  each  treatment  group  had  resolution  of  neutropenia  during  study therapy.

For  the  MITT  analysis,  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  were  also  computed  for  the  time  to  resolution  of neutropenia for the 4 treatment group and risk category subgroups.  The median times to resolution of neutropenia for the low-risk groups (8 days for both treatment groups) were lower than those observed in the high-risk groups (11 and 12 days for the caspofungin and AmBisome groups, respectively).  The log-rank  chi-square  statistic  was  highly  significant  (p&lt;0.001),  indicating  a  difference  among  the  4 treatment  groups  and  risk  category  combinations  groups  with  respect  to  time  to  resolution  of neutropenia.  Low-risk patients had a shorter duration of neutropenia (by 3 to 4 days) than high-risk patients in both treatment groups.  However, for each risk category, caspofungin and AmBisome had similar response rates for this endpoint.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Time to Resolution of Fever During Neutropenia

The log-rank chi-square statistic was not significant (p=0.258), indicating no difference between the treatment groups with respect to time to resolution of fever during neutropenia.  By Day 10 of study therapy,  ~50%  of  the  patients  in  each  treatment  group  had  resolution  of  fever  during  neutropenia, compared with Day 7 in the analysis for resolution of fever irrespective of neutropenia.  Kaplan-Meier estimates  for  the  time  to  resolution  of  fever  during  neutropenia  for  the  MITT  analysis  were  also calculated for the 4 treatment groups and risk category groups.  No significant difference was observed (p=0.075) among the 4 treatment group and risk category combinations.

However, as the duration of neutropenia was markedly different between the risk categories for both treatment groups, additional Kaplan-Meier calculations were performed to examine the effect of risk category  alone.    The  log-rank  chi-square  statistic  was  significant  (p=0.021),  indicating  a  difference between  the risk categories with respect to time to resolution of fever during neutropenia. Unexpectedly,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  persistent  fever  during  neutropenia  was  consistently higher  in  the  low-risk  than  the  high-risk  stratum,  a  fact  explained  by  the  censoring  of  data  from patients whose neutropenia had resolved before 48 hours without fever could be demonstrated.  Since the low-risk patients had shorter durations of neutropenia, they were censored from this analysis to a greater  extent  than  high-risk  patients.    Such  patients  are  thus  considered  failures  for  both  the  fever resolution and the overall endpoint.

## Exploratory Analyses Based on Variations of the Resolution of Fever Endpoint

Fever is a nonspecific finding in the neutropenic patient and can be caused by a variety of infectious and noninfectious problems, including viral and bacterial as well as fungal infections, the underlying primary malignancy, or it can be a complication of therapy.  A number of exploratory analyses were performed in which fever resolution was either substantively modified from the definition used in the primary  analysis  or  was  excluded  entirely  from  the  composite  primary  analysis.    For  consistency, handling of all other endpoints was unchanged in these analyses.

For the primary analysis, fever resolution was defined as having a maximum oral temperature of &lt;38 o C  for  at  least  48  consecutive  hours  during  neutropenia.    The  primary  analysis  was  repeated  in  an exploratory manner using variations of the definition of fever resolution as follows: (1) resolution of fever  for  24  hours  prior  to  the  resolution  of  neutropenia,  (2)  resolution  of  fever  at  the  7-day posttherapy follow-up visit, and (3) exclusion of fever resolution from the composite endpoint.  These definitions can be considered progressively less conservative than that used for the primary analysis because  (1)  the  shortening  of  the  required  duration  without  fever  from  48  to  24  hours  during neutropenia  should  be  more  readily  and  frequently  achieved,  (2)  the  'afebrile  at  7-day  follow-up' endpoint  is  independent  of  neutropenia,  and  also  because  the  temperature  recorded  is  a  single measurement and  not the  maximum temperature over a 24-hour period, and (3)  exclusion  of  fever resolution simply disregards the temperature data.

Table  10  summarizes  the  observed  rates  of  overall  favorable  responses  and  for  fever  resolution according to each of the 4 definitions.

It  is  apparent  that  the  overall  favorable  response  rates  and  the  fever  resolution  rates  increase substantially with progressively less conservative definitions of fever resolution.  It should be noted that all other endpoint responses (e.g., those for documented infection, survival, and discontinuation of therapy)  were  handled  identically  to  the  primary  analysis,  and  so  these  other  individual  endpoint responses  are  unchanged.    Overall  response  rates  are  increased  most  dramatically  when  fever resolution is excluded entirely, and reflects a composite outcome that consists solely of endpoints of documented infection, survival, and premature discontinuation of therapy.

## Overall response with fever resolution for 24 hours during neutropenia

The primary  analysis  was repeated  after  fever  resolution  was  redefined  as  having  a  maximum  oral temperature  of  &lt;38 o C  for  at  least  24  consecutive  hours  during  the  period  of  neutropenia.    It  was expected that requirement of a shorter period without fever would increase the response rate in lowrisk  patients  whose  short  durations  of  neutropenia  would  not  permit  a  demonstration  of  48  hours without fever despite favorable responses for all other endpoints.  It was confirmed that the difference in fever resolution rates between risk categories is much smaller than that observed with the 48 hour afebrile endpoint used in the primary analysis (see Figure 2).

## Overall response with fever resolution at the 7-day follow-up visit

The primary analysis  was repeated  after  fever resolution  was redefined as  having a  maximum  oral temperature (or its equivalent) of &lt;38 o C at the 7-day posttherapy follow-up visit in order to evaluate outcome  when  temperature  was  not  linked  to  neutropenia.    Similarly,  these  results  confirm  the expectation that the difference in fever resolution rates between risk categories is eliminated with the 7-day posttherapy endpoint (see Figure 2).

## Overall response excluding the resolution of fever endpoint

This analysis demonstrates that overall response rates increase  markedly  for both treatment groups, and that low-risk patients have higher overall response rates (by at least 4%) than high-risk patients, as would be expected, when fever resolution is excluded from the endpoint and efficacy is based upon documented invasive fungal infections, survival, and completion of therapy (see Figure 2).

The data from this study suggest that patients with short durations of neutropenia may frequently fail the  fever  resolution  endpoint  but  have  favorable  outcomes  for  other  endpoint  components.  This explains the paradoxical observation that high-risk patients, in whom a longer period of neutropenia was demonstrated, in fact had higher rates of favorable overall responses (43.2% for caspofungin and 37.7%  AmBisome)  than  low-risk category patients (31.0%  for caspofungin and 32.4%  for AmBisome) when the 48 hour-afebrile-during- neutropenia definition of fever resolution was used in the  primary  analysis  (see  Table  3).    In  fact,  the  high-risk  patients  in  the  primary  analysis  had substantially higher rates of fever resolution (52.1% for caspofungin and 50.0% for AmBisome) than low-risk patients (37.3% for caspofungin and 38.8% for AmBisome). Review of the primary analysis by risk category using variations of the fever resolution endpoint confirms the observation that lowrisk  patients  have  higher  response  rates  than  high-risk  patients  when  the  less  conservative  fever resolution definitions are used.  This is most apparent when fever resolution is excluded entirely from the  overall endpoint. The results of the analysis that excludes fever resolution indicate much higher overall response rates in both treatment groups, and also suggest that caspofungin may be superior to AmBisome as empirical therapy when fever resolution is  excluded and  only the other 4 secondary endpoints  are  considered:  overall  favourable  response  of  81.7%  for  caspofungin  versus  74.7%  for Ambisome when adjusted for strata (estimated  difference in  response  rate  7.0%  with  a  95%  CI  of (1.9, 12.1)).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The difference in fever resolution between the high and low risk groups seems indeed to be the cause for the higher overall response rate seen in high risk patients, for the reasons explained above. This is confirmed when using the less conservative definitions for fever resolution. Nevertheless, although it is acknowledged that by extending the period without fever a number of patients in the low risk group would be excluded from the analysis  due to rapid recovery  of their  neutropenia, the  criterion  of 48 hours  without  fever seems a  minimum requirement  for the  fever resolution  endpoint. Theoretically, fever resolution for 5 consecutive days during neutropenia would even be a better endpoint, although practically  more  difficult  to  realise.  It  is  reassuring  to  see  that  response  rates  for  caspofungin  as compared to Ambisome remain similar, independently of the definitions used for fever resolution.

## · Ancillary analyses

The primary analysis of efficacy was repeated for demographic subpopulations based on gender, age ( ≤ or  &gt;65  years of age), and race (Caucasian versus non-Caucasian).  Caspofungin seemed similarly efficacious in both males and females, in both older adult patients (&gt;65 years) and those up to 65 years of  age,  and  in  Caucasians  as  well  as  non-Caucasian  patients,  although  a  limited  number  of patients over 65 years and of non-White patients were studied.

## 2.3.3 Clinical studies in special populations

No special studies were performed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

Children were not included in the empirical study and no specific data were obtained in children for this indication. Nevertheless, a paediatric study is planned to start in 2005, which will closely follow the design of the present adult study, but will be primarily a safety study.

## 2.3.4 Issue on dose increase of caspofungin to 70mg

The  recommendation  of  a  dose  increase  of  caspofungin  to  70  mg  in  case  of  inadequate  clinical response cannot be endorsed due to lack of supportive data. A minimum requirement to support the recommendation  of  up-dosing  is  that  a  dose-response  effect  of  higher  doses  of  caspofungin  should have been documented. It is worth recalling that caspofungin has been authorised for use in invasive

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

aspergillosis  only  under  exceptional  circumstances.  In  particular,  there  is  an  ongoing  Specific Obligation (S.O.) to evaluate higher doses of caspofungin in invasive aspergillosis. This S.O. will not be fulfilled, since the aspergillosis study has been stopped. Instead, the MAH has included a wording on the 70mg dosage in the SPC.

Similarly,  the  MAH  has  withdrawn  the  request  to  increase  the  dose  to  70  mg  and  has  proposed deletion of the text regarding updosing to 70mg for empirical therapy.

The  wording  in  section  4.2  of  the  SPC  as  proposed  by  the  MAH  is  as  follows :  'A  single  70-mg loading dose should be administered on Day-1, followed by 50 mg daily thereafter. Doses higher than 70 mg daily have not been adequately studied.' This new wording applies to the existing indications of  Invasive  Aspergillosis  and  Invasive  Candidiasis  as  well  as  to  the  current  variation  II/17  for  the empirical treatment indication.

## 2.3.5 Conclusion on clinical efficacy

The indication, as proposed by the MAH, ' Empirical therapy for presumed fungal infections in febrile, neutropaenic adult patients , should be revised.

The requested indication is misleading since it implies that caspofungin will be useful regardless of the identity of any fungal pathogen, a fact which is not supported by the data provided. Therefore the CPMP decided to adopt an alternate wording, as follows: ' Empirical therapy for presumed fungal infections (such as Candida and Aspergillus) in febrile, neutropaenic adult patients '. Together with this revised indication, a warning statement regarding uncommon yeasts and non-aspergillus moulds was added to section 4.4 of the SPC as follows: ' Limited data suggest that less common non-Candida yeasts and non-Aspergillus moulds are not covered by caspofungin. The efficacy of caspofungin against these fungal pathogens has not been established. '

However, the  current  indication  for  invasive  candidasis (IC)  is  inconsistent  with  the  extension, since it includes only non-neutropenic patients. The number of neutropenic patients with IC who have received caspofungin has increased with the data from the empirical trial and now totals 26 patients (14 patients from the invasive candiasis trial (P014) trial and 12 patients from the current trial). In comparison with the 22 neutropenic patients who received AmBisome/amphotericin B in these trials, favourable response rates were slightly higher in the caspofungin group (15/26 (58%) vs  9/22  (41%)).  Considering  the  great  difficulties  in  recruiting  a  large  number  of  neutropenic patients with documented IC, the CPMP is of the opinion that efficacy for caspofungin has been sufficiently demonstrated to delete the restriction of the IC indication to non-neutropenic patients.

## 2.4 Clinical safety

## 2.4.1 Supportive clinical data

## /square4 Background Summary

Safety information on 876 individuals who received single or multiple doses of caspofungin has been submitted previously through the original and supplemental Marketing Applications in patients with invasive  aspergillosis  (N=72),  oesophageal  or  oropharyngeal  candidiasis  (N=285),  and  invasive candidiasis (N=125).  In addition, a total of 394 subjects received caspofungin in Phase I trials.

The following  drug-related  adverse  experiences  have  been  reported  in at least  2%  of  patients  with invasive  aspergillosis  or  Candida  infections:    infused  vein  complications/  thrombophlebitis,  fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, chills, increased ALT and AST, increased alkaline phosphatase, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), increased bilirubin, decreased serum albumin, decreased serum potassium, eosinophilia, decreased hemoglobin/hematocrit, decreased WBCs and decreased platelets. Possible allergic type reactions have been reported in clinical studies including isolated reports of rash, facial  swelling,  pruritus,  sensation  of  warmth,  or  bronchospasm.    Cases  of  anaphylaxis  during administration of caspofungin have also been reported.

The following serious adverse  experiences have been reported in association  with  caspofungin in at least one patient in clinical studies: pulmonary infiltrates, venous thrombosis, hypercalcemia, rash, and thrombocytopenia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## /square4 Safety data to support this variation

The safety data to support the extension of indication of caspofungin to empirical therapy of presumed fungal infections in febrile, neutropenic patients, originate from a Phase III study, Protocol 026 : A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Comparative Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of MK-0991 Versus Amphotericin B Liposome for Injection as Empirical Therapy in Patients With Persistent Fever and Neutropenia.

## 1  Patient exposure

There were 1123 patients randomized in the study, of whom 1111 received at least one dose of active therapy (564 patients received caspofungin and 547 patients received AmBisome) and were included in the analysis of safety.  The duration of study therapy for both treatment groups ranged from 1 to 90 days.  The mean duration of study therapy in the caspofungin and AmBisome groups were 13.0 and 12.5 days, respectively.

Table 11 displays the descriptive statistics for duration of therapy (after Day 1) by treatment group and dose to  define the  exposure  of patients to  elevated  doses  of study therapy.  Therapy  on Day 1  was excluded from the analysis so that the 70-mg loading dose of caspofungin on Day 1 would not skew the results.  The mean durations of the standard dose of study therapy were similar for the 2 treatment groups  (10.4  and  10.3  days  for  caspofungin  and  AmBisome,  respectively).    Similar  numbers  of patients received the increased dose of study therapy after Day 1 (13.3% for caspofungin and 14.3% for  AmBisome).    In  addition,  the  mean  durations  of  study  therapy  at  the  increased  dose  were  also similar for the 2 treatment groups (11.6 and 10.0 days for caspofungin and AmBisome, respectively).

## 2  Adverse events

As expected in seriously ill patients, clinical adverse experiences were common in this study: of the 1111  patients,  1039  (93.5%)  reported  at  least  1  clinical  adverse  experience:    521  (92.4%)  in  the caspofungin group and 518 (94.7%) in the AmBisome group.

Drug-related clinical adverse experiences were significantly less common in the caspofungin than the AmBisome group (p&lt;0.001).  The proportion of patients in the caspofungin group who discontinued from therapy due to a serious drug-related clinical adverse experience was also significantly smaller than the corresponding proportion in the AmBisome group (p=0.015) (see Table 12).

Although  a  patient  may  have  had  2  or  more  clinical  adverse  experiences,  the  patient  is  counted  only  once  within  a category.  The same patient may appear in different categories.

† N = the number of patients in the treatment group.

‡ n = the number of patients with the specific adverse experience.

The number (%) of patients with specific clinical adverse experiences, both overall and drug related and occurring at an incidence of at least 2% overall, is displayed by body system in Table 13 above.

The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  adverse  experiences  in  the  caspofungin  group  were consistent  with  those  reported  overall  and  included  fever  (17.0%),  chills  (13.8%),  rash  (6.2%),  and headache (4.3%).

The most frequently reported drug-related clinical adverse experiences in the AmBisome group were chills  (24.7%),  fever  (19.4%),  nausea  (11.3%),  vomiting  (8.6%),  and  headache  (5.7%).    The  drugrelated adverse experiences of chills, nausea, and vomiting were less common in the caspofungin than the AmBisome group (p&lt;0.05).

## 3  Serious adverse events and deaths

Overall,  312  (28%)  of  the  1111  patients  had at  least  one  serious  clinical  adverse  experience:    147 (26.1%)  in  the  caspofungin  group  and  165  (30.2%)  in  the  AmBisome  group.    The  most  common serious  adverse  experiences  across  treatment  groups  were  pneumonia  (4.2%),  AML  (3.0%),  and respiratory failure  (2.8%). There  were  25  patients  with  serious  clinical  adverse  experiences determined by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study therapy: 9 (1.6%) in the caspofungin group and 16 (2.9%) in the AmBisome group.

In the caspofungin group, 3 patients had serious drug-related adverse experiences of renal failure or insufficiency.    Two  patients  with  serious  drug-related  adverse  experiences  of  rash  recovered.    The remaining  cases  were  (1)  an  infusion-related  hypersensitivity  reaction  (consisting  of  chills,  rigors, chest tightness, and tachypnea lasting 15 minutes,  followed 2 hours later by  nausea  and  high  fever, resolving over 3 hours after the infusion), (2) a case of progressive hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of metastatic disease of the lungs and liver, (3) congestive heart failure, hypokalemia, and extension of a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

prior  myocardial  infarction  in  the  setting  of  AML  and  underlying  cardiovascular  disease,  and  (4) bronchiolitis  obliterans  with  organizing  pneumonia  noted  on  lung  biopsy  performed  3  days  after completion of study therapy.

In  the  AmBisome  group,  5  patients  had  serious  drug-related  adverse  experiences  in  the respiratory system consisting of 3 adverse experiences of respiratory distress, 2 dyspnea, and 1 hypoxia, 3 patients had  serious  drug-related  adverse  experiences  in  the  immune  system  (hypersensitivity  reaction  [3], anaphylaxis  [1],  and  anaphylactic  reaction  [1])  and  3  patients  had  serious  drug-related  adverse experiences  in  the  urogenital  system  (acute  renal  failure  [2],  and  renal  insufficiency  [1]).    The remaining cases were a hypokalemia, a ventricular fibrillation with cardiac arrest, a fungal infection and a Grand mal seizure.

There were 136 patients (12.2% of the 1111 patients receiving study drug) who died as a result of a fatal adverse experience that occurred during the course of the study:  61 (10.8%) in the caspofungin group  and  75  (13.7%)  in  the  AmBisome  group.    Only  3 patients  had  serious  adverse  experiences leading  to  death  that  were  considered  either  possibly,  probably  or  definitely  drug-related  by  the investigator.  One patient was treated with caspofungin but discontinued and subsequently expired due to renal insufficiency that was felt by the investigator to be possibly related to study drug therapy.  The other  2  patients  who  died  due  to  a  drug-related  serious  adverse  experience  were  in  the  AmBisome group:    one  experienced  a  cardiac  arrest  reported  by  the  investigator  as  possibly  related  to  study therapy,  while the  other  died due to respiratory  distress that  was probably related to study therapy. The  remaining  deaths  were  due  to  complications  of  underlying  diseases  or  infections,  and  the distribution of the different aetiologies was generally similar in the 2 treatment groups.

## 4  Discontinuations due to AES

There  were  161  discontinuations  from  study  therapy  as  a  result  of  a  clinical  adverse  experience, including 78 (13.8%) in the caspofungin group and 83 (15.2%) in the AmBisome group.  The most frequently reported specific clinical adverse experiences leading to discontinuation of study therapy in the caspofungin group were rash (1.4%), fever (1.1%), and pneumonia (1.1%), and in the AmBisome group were AML (1.5%), fever (1.3%), pneumonia (1.1%), and fungal infection (1.1%).

Of  the  161  discontinuations,  60  occurred  because  of  a  drug-related  clinical  adverse  experience, including 25 (4.4%) in the caspofungin group and 35 (6.4%) in the AmBisome group.

In the caspofungin group ten patients discontinued due to drug-related adverse experiences of the skin and  skin  appendages  (1  case  was  a  serious  rash;  all  patients  recovered),  and  five  patients  were discontinued due to drug-related adverse experiences in the hepatobiliary system or hyperbilirubinemia (one of the adverse experiences was considered serious).

There  were  35  discontinuations  in  the  AmBisome  group  due  to  drug-related  clinical  adverse experiences: 4 because of hypersensitivity reactions, 3 anaphylaxis or anaphylactic-type reactions and 4 fevers.

Of the patients with a serious drug-related clinical adverse experience as described above, 4 patients in the  caspofungin  group  discontinued  treatment  (the  patient  with  the  hypersensitivity  reaction,  the patient with the hyperbilirubinemia, one patient with renal insufficiency and one patient with rash). In the AmBisome group all except for 2 patients with a serious drug-related clinical adverse experience (one case of renal insufficiency and the patient with hypokalemia) discontinued treatment.

## 5  Laboratory findings

Of the 1111 patients, 627 (56.4%) reported at least 1 laboratory adverse experience:  302 (53.5%) in the  caspofungin  group  and  325  (59.4%)  in  the  AmBisome  group.    Laboratory  adverse  experiences were significantly less common in the caspofungin than the AmBisome group (p=0.049).

Other significant differences in  favour of  caspofungin included the  following safety parameters: the proportion  of patients with drug-related laboratory adverse  experiences (p&lt;0.001), the proportion  of patients  who  discontinued  from  therapy  due  to  a  laboratory  adverse  experience  (p=0.026),  and  the proportion  of  patients  who  discontinued  from  therapy  due  to  a  drug-related  laboratory  adverse experience (p=0.010) (see Table 14).

The  number  (%)  of  patients  with  specific  laboratory  adverse  experiences,  both  overall  and  drug related, is displayed by test category in Table 15.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  most  common  drug-related  laboratory  adverse  experiences  in  the  caspofungin  group  were increased  ALT  (8.7%),  hypokalemia (7.3%),  increased  alkaline  phosphatase (7.0%),  increased  AST (7.0%), and total blood bilirubin increased (3.0%).

The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  laboratory  adverse  experiences  in  the  AmBisome  group were increased alkaline phosphatase (12.0%), hypokalemia (11.8%), increased ALT (8.9%), increased AST (7.6%), and increased serum creatinine (5.5%).

The drug-related adverse experiences of increased alkaline phosphatase, hypokalemia, and increased serum  creatinine  were  less  common  in  patients  who  received  caspofungin  than  in  patients  who received AmBisome (p&lt;0.05).

‡ n = Number of patients meeting criteria.

§ Observed Difference = Caspofungin 70/50 mg-AmBisome 3.0 mg/kg.

% Observed difference is not displayed because patients with no adverse experience are the complement of patients with one or more adverse experiences.

¶ Determined by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely drug related.

# Confidence Interval (CI) cannot be calculated because no patients in the study had this event.

## - Serious Laboratory Adverse Experiences

Two  patients  (0.4%)  in  the  caspofungin  group  and  5  patients  (0.9%)  in  the  AmBisome  group experienced  a  serious  laboratory  adverse  experience.    Neither  of  the  2  serious  laboratory  adverse experiences  reported  in  the  caspofungin  group  were  determined  to  be  drug  related,  but  1  of  the  5 serious adverse experiences in the AmBisome group (increased total serum bilirubin) was determined to be drug related.

## - Discontinuations Due to Laboratory Adverse Experiences

There  were  22  patients  overall  who  discontinued  from  study  therapy  due  to  a  laboratory  adverse experience:    6  (1.1%)  in  the  caspofungin  group  and  16  (2.9%)  in  the  AmBisome  group.    Of  the  6 discontinuations in the caspofungin group, 3 were due to a drug-related adverse experience of hepatic dysfunction (increased AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase [1], increased ALT only [1], and increased total  and  direct  bilirubin  only  [1]).    In  the  AmBisome  group,  there  were  13  (2.4%)  drug-related discontinuations:    9  due  to  abnormal  liver  function  tests  (increased  bilirubin,  increased  alkaline phosphatase, increased ALT and AST), and 4 due to increased creatinine.

## - Safety Analyses

Four safety hypotheses were predefined for this study. The primary safety analysis for this study was a comparison of the incidence  of nephrotoxicity between the 2 treatment  groups. The results of the  4 safety analyses are summarized in Table 16.

‡ Observed difference = Caspofungin 70/50 mg-AmBisome 3.0 mg/kg

§ For analysis of nephrotoxicity, percent was calculated as m/n (Number of patients with nephrotoxicity/ Number of patients with serum creatinine data).  For caspofungin, n= 547 and for AmBisome n = 522.

## - Nephrotoxicity

Nephrotoxicity  was predefined as a  doubling of serum  creatinine  or an increase in  creatinine by ≥ 1 mg/dL, if the creatinine was elevated at study entry.  The analysis included all patients who met these criteria during study therapy, whether or not the elevations were considered to be adverse experiences. As predefined in the protocol, the analysis of nephrotoxicity was performed using the data from only those  patients  with  a  creatinine  clearance  &gt;30  ml/min  at  baseline.    The  observed  proportions  of patients with nephrotoxicity were 2.6% (14/547) for caspofungin and 11.5% (60/522) for AmBisome. The difference in nephrotoxicity rates between the 2 treatment groups (caspofungin minus AmBisome) was  -8.9%,  with  a  95%  CI  of  (-12.0,  -5.9).    The  CI  lies  completely  below  0,  indicating  that caspofungin is superior to AmBisome with respect to the risk of nephrotoxicity.

## - Infusion-Related Adverse Experiences

Infusion-related  adverse  experiences  were  recorded  daily  during  intravenous  study  therapy.    The proportions  of  patients  who  developed  at  least  1  infusion-related  event  were 35.1% (198/564) and 51.6% (282/547)  in  the  caspofungin  and  AmBisome  groups,  respectively.    The  difference  in proportions between the 2 treatment groups (caspofungin minus AmBisome) was -16.4%, with a 95% CI  of  (-22.2,  -10.7)  and  an  associated  p-value  &lt;0.001,  indicating  that  caspofungin  is  superior  to AmBisome with respect to the occurrence of infusion-related events (mainly chills and fever).  There were numerically fewer severe infusion-related events in the caspofungin group than in the AmBisome group (5.1% in the caspofungin group versus 8.6% in the AmBisome group).

## - Drug-Related Clinical and Laboratory Adverse Experiences

Overall,  686  (61.7%)  of  the  1111  patients  reported  one  or  more  clinical  or  laboratory  adverse experiences determined by the investigator to be drug related:  307 ( 54.4% ) in the caspofungin group and  379  ( 69.3% )  in  the  AmBisome  group.    The  difference  between  the  2  treatment  groups (caspofungin minus AmBisome) was -14.9, with a 95% CI of (-20.5, -9.2) and an associated p-value &lt;0.001, indicating that caspofungin is superior to AmBisome with respect to the occurrence of drugrelated adverse experiences.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## - Discontinuations Due to Drug-Related Clinical or Laboratory Adverse Experiences

Seventy-two (6.5%) of the 1111 patients discontinued therapy due to a clinical or laboratory adverse experience determined by the investigator to be drug related:  28 ( 5.0% ) in the caspofungin group and 44  ( 8.0% )  in  the  AmBisome  group.    The  difference  between  the  2  treatment  groups  (caspofungin minus  AmBisome)  was  -3.1,  with  a  95%  CI  of  (-6.0,  -0.2)  and  an  associated  p-value  of  0.037, indicating that  caspofungin is superior to  AmBisome  with respect to the  occurrence  of drug-related adverse experiences that result in discontinuation from therapy.

## 6  Safety in special populations

Adverse experience summaries were reviewed for patient subgroups based on age, gender, and race. Of the 1111 patients enrolled in the study that received active therapy, 14.9% (165 patients) were &gt;65 years  of  age.    Not  unexpectedly,  patients  in  this  age  category  in  both  treatment  groups  had  higher incidences  of  serious  clinical  adverse  experiences  and  death  than  those  patients  aged  65  years and younger  (37.1%  versus  24%  in  the  caspofungin  group  and  40.8%  versus  28.5%  in  the  AmBisome group,  respectively  for  serious  clinical  adverse  experiences;  20.2%  versus 9.1%  in the  caspofungin group and 23.7% versus 12.1% in the AmBisome group, respectively for deaths).  However, given the relatively  small  number  of  elderly  patients  any  actual  differences  due  to  patient  age  are  difficult  to assess.

Of the 1111 patients enrolled in the study that received active therapy, 622 patients were male and 489 were female.  Overall, the clinical and laboratory adverse experience profile showed similar incidence of clinical adverse experiences in males and females in both treatment groups.

Overall, nearly 90% of patients (994/1111) were white.  As a result, the clinical and laboratory adverse experience profile of patients who were white mirrors that of the overall study populations, and any apparent differences in the occurrence of adverse experiences in other races should be considered in context, given the small size of this population.

## 2.4.2 Post-marketing data

From 14-Dec-2000 through 15-Mar-2003, a total of 300 spontaneous and compassionate-use, namedpatient,  or  temporary-use-authorization  study  reports  were  identified.    Of  these  reports,  207  were spontaneous  adverse  experience  reports  received  from  healthcare  providers  and  120  (58%)  were serious.    The  remaining  93  were  compassionate-use,  named-patient,  or  temporary-use-authorization study reports that were not part of Merck clinical trials of which 73 (78%) met the criteria for serious. In the 120 spontaneous reports that had at least one serious adverse event, the most frequently reported serious adverse events were death NOS (10 reports), hypokalemia (9), increased alkaline phosphatase (8),  increased AST  (8),  increased ALT  (7),  and  multiorgan failure (7). In the 73  serious compassionate-use,  named-patient,  temporary-use-authorization  study  reports,  the  most  frequently reported serious adverse experiences were death NOS (11), multiorgan failure (11), aspergillosis (6), septic shock (6) and increased alkaline phosphatase (4).

From  14-Dec-2000  through  15-Mar-2003,  95  reports  of  fatal  outcomes  were  identified  concerning patients  who  received  caspofungin  in  the  postmarketing  environment,  including  38  spontaneous reports and 57 compassionate-use, named-patient, or temporary-use-authorization study reports.  In 22 reports,  the  causes  of  death  were  unknown  and/or  there  was  insufficient  information,  precluding  a proper evaluation.

In the remaining 73 reports, the patients' deaths were most likely related to their serious underlying medical illnesses (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis, leukaemia, sepsis, and pneumonia).

Six spontaneous reports  were identified  which  may  be indicative  of possible  drug interactions  with caspofungin. The  reported interacting therapies included cyclosporine (2),  gemtuzumab  (1), ciprofloxacin and clindamycin (1), tacrolimus (1), and warfarin (1).

In 2 reports, limited information was received involving possible drug interactions with cyclosporine, precluding  further  evaluation,  since  no  information  was  provided  in  either  report  regarding  blood cyclosporine  levels  or  dosing  regimens  of  other  concomitant  therapies.    In  2  clinical  studies, cyclosporine (one 4-mg/kg dose or two 3-mg/kg doses) increased the area under the curve (AUC) of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

caspofungin by ~35%, probably due to reduced uptake of caspofungin by the liver, while blood levels of cyclosporine remained unchanged.

One  report  concerned  possible  drug  toxicity  with  caspofungin  and  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  in  a patient with preexisting leukemia, diabetes mellitus, and elevated AST and ALT.  The patient received 1 day of therapy with gemtuzumab ozogamicin.  Over the next 8 days, his condition deteriorated; he developed hepatic  failure and  hepatorenal syndrome.   Therapy  with  caspofungin  was started  on the eighth day, and on the following day, he experienced a 'significant' increase in liver enzymes.  He died 2 days later from hepatic and respiratory failure.  Hepatotoxicity, including severe hepatic venoocclusive disease, has been reported in association with the use of gemtuzumab ozogamicin as a single agent,  as  part  of  a  combination  chemotherapy  regimen,  and  in  patients  without  a  history  of  liver disease or hematopoietic stem-cell transplant.

The  3  remaining  reports  of  potential  drug  interactions  consisted  of  1)  a  patient  who  developed bronchospasm, shortness of breath, chills, and back pain on the third day of infusion with caspofungin, which  was  attributed  to  a possible drug  interaction  between  caspofungin, ciprofloxacin,  and clindamycin, 2) a patient on therapy with tacrolimus 2 mg twice a day.  When concomitant therapy with itraconazole and amphotericin B were switched to caspofungin, the patient developed decreased blood tacrolimus levels, and 3) a patient with an increased prothrombin time attributed to a possible drug interaction with warfarin and caspofungin.  Concomitant therapy included fluconazole, which is known to increase the  effect of  warfarin.  No information was provided in this report regarding the temporal relationship between the initiating of any medications and the patient's increased prothrombin time.

## Hepatic Adverse Events

A  total  of  67  reports  that  may  represent  hepatic  injury  were  identified  in  patients  treated  with caspofungin, of which 41 were spontaneous and 26 were from compassionate-use, named-patient, or temporary-use-authorization programs.

In  49  of  the  67  reports,  the  patient  had  serious  underlying  medical  conditions,  pre-existing  hepatic disease/elevations  in  liver  function  tests,  and/or  concomitant  therapies  that  were  associated  with hepatotoxicity.    In  another  15  reports,  there  was  insufficient  information  for  a  proper  evaluation. Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase), elevated direct and total bilirubin and rare  cases of  hepatic  dysfunction are included in the 'Side Effects' section of the current CCDS for caspofungin.  All 67 reports were either consistent with the current CCDS for caspofungin and/or were reported as not related to therapy with caspofungin.

## Renal Adverse Events

A total of 22 reports representing possible renal dysfunction were identified in patients treated with caspofungin (14 reports were from the marketed environment, and 8 occurred in patients who received caspofungin from compassionate-use, named-patient, or temporary-use-authorization programs).

In  19  of  the  22  reports,  the  patients  received  concomitant  medications  known to be associated  with nephrotoxicity, including tobramycin, tacrolimus, ciprofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin, or amphotericin.  The 3 other reports include a case of nonserious polyuria occurring on the same day as the  initiation  of  therapy  with  caspofungin,  nephrotic  syndrome  in  a  patient  with  borderline  renal function (inadequate information on concomitant medications and medical history), and acute tubular necrosis in a patient with a complicated postoperative course status post bowel resection, where the reporter did not believe to be associated with caspofungin.

Additionally, in 5 reports, pre-existing  elevated serum  creatinine (3), renal  failure  and renal tubular acidosis  were  described  in  the  patient's  concurrent  condition/medical  history.    Increased  serum creatinine is included in the 'Side Effects' section of the current CCDS for caspofungin.  At this time there is inadequate evidence of a causal relationship between the other described renal dysfunctions and treatment with caspofungin, based on available data.

## Allergic Adverse Experiences

Thirty-nine reports with allergic adverse experience terms and reported in temporal association with administration of caspofungin were identified (32 were spontaneous reports and 7 occurred in a patient

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

who received caspofungin from compassionate-use, named-patient, or temporary-use-authorization programs).  Eighteen of the 39 reports were considered serious.  Nine of these patients had a concurrent condition/medical history of previous drug allergy/reaction; one had a history of asthma. Anaphylaxis, and possible histamine-mediated symptoms, including isolated reports of rash, facial swelling, pruritus, sensation of warmth, or bronchospasm are labeled in the CCDS for caspofungin. The above reports were consistent with the current CCDS and safety profile for caspofungin, and pose no additional concerns regarding potential allergic adverse experiences temporally associated with administration of caspofungin.

## Safety reports from ongoing studies

At the time of this application, there were 3 ongoing open-label noncomparative clinical studies in the caspofungin development program.

Since  the  submission  of  the  Worldwide  Clinical  Summary  (submitted  06-Mar-2002)  for  Invasive Candidiasis,  there  were  24  patients  who  received  caspofungin  in  the  Salvage  Aspergillosis  study (Protocol  019) during  the  period  from  06-Nov-2001  to  15-Mar-2003.    During  this  time  period,  35 serious adverse experiences were reported in 19 patients, none of which were drug related.  Nineteen (in 14 patients) of the 35 serious adverse experiences reported were fatal.  The adverse experiences reported were consistent with the serious underlying diseases, concurrent conditions, and concomitant medications in these seriously ill patients.

Thirty-one patients, aged 2 to 17 years, were treated with caspofungin in the Pediatric Pharmacokinetic study (Protocol 033) during the period from 06-Nov-2001 to 15-Mar-2003.  Sixteen serious  adverse  experiences  were  reported  in  10  patients,  none  of  which  were  drug  related.    One patient experienced the fatal serious adverse experience of fungal pneumonia.

One patient was enrolled in the Combination Therapy study (Protocol 037 ) from 06-Nov-2001 to 15Mar-2003.  There were no serious adverse experiences reported for this patient prior to the in-house data cutoff date of 15-Mar-2003.

## 2.4.3 Conclusion of clinical safety

A  total  of  1111  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of  therapy  (564  received  caspofungin  and  547 received AmBisome) in the submitted Empirical Therapy Study. By comparison, 876 individuals had received single or multiple doses of caspofungin in prior applications for caspofungin. As a result, this study provides the largest increase to the safety database of caspofungin to date.

Overall, drug-related clinical and laboratory adverse experiences were significantly less frequent in the caspofungin group than in the AmBisome group.

The  most common  drug-related  clinical  adverse experiences  in  the  caspofungin  group were: fever (17.0%), chills (13.8%), rash (6.2%), and headache (4.3%).  Chills, nausea, and vomiting were significantly less common in the caspofungin than the AmBisome group.

The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  laboratory  adverse  experiences  in  the  caspofungin  group included increased ALT  (8.7%),  hypokalemia  (7.3%),  increased alkaline phosphatase  (7.0%), increased AST (7.0%), and total blood bilirubin increased (3.0%).  A significant difference between the 2 treatment groups was noted for drug-related increased alkaline phosphatase, hypokalemia, and increased serum creatinine in favour of caspofungin.

Four safety hypotheses were predefined for this study. The primary safety analysis for this study was a comparison of the incidence of nephrotoxicity between the 2 treatment groups; 2.6 % of the patients in the  caspofungin  group  versus  11.5  %  of  patients  in  the  AmBisome  group  met  the  definition  of nephrotoxicity, indicating that caspofungin is superior to AmBisome with respect to the occurrence of nephrotoxicity.

Similarly, in this study caspofungin was superior to AmBisome with respect to the 3 other predefined safety comparisons, including infusion-related events, drug-related adverse experiences, and discontinuations due to drug-related adverse experiences.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety data on caspofungin from ongoing studies and from the postmarketing environment are quite consistent  with  what  has  been  previously  reported  in  other  Phase  II  and  III  studies  within  the caspofungin development program.

Thus, in general  caspofungin safety results from this study together  with postmarketing  data  do not seem to raise any new concerns, but vigilance still remains mandatory.

## 2.5 Benefit Risk assessment and conclusion

Invasive  fungal  infections  are  an  important  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  patients  with neutropenia  and  cancer  chemotherapy,  with Candida and Aspergillus being  the  most  commonly identified pathogens. No early diagnostic procedure for establishing an accurate diagnosis of invasive fungal  infections  is  available,  therefore  empirical  administration  of  antifungal  agents  has  become standard practice in neutropenic patients who remain febrile despite adequate antibacterial therapy. A pre-emptive approach is currently being evaluated, using more advanced diagnostic measures such as PCR techniques, ELISA antigen and chest CT, but at present these tests are not standardised for this use  and  there  is  no  real  consensus  for  defining  a  target  population  for  pre-emptive  therapy  yet. Although  the  pre-emptive  approach  is  currently  being  used  in  certain  European  centres,  empirical therapy is still considered relevant clinical practice.

There are some major problems with assessing true efficacy in empirical therapy, since the indication should  be  based  solely  on  the  successful  treatment  of  any  fungal  infections  documented  from examination of specimens taken just before adding the antifungal agent. The sole inclusion criterion is neutropenic  fever  without  response  to  parenteral  antibiotics,  and  the  rate  of  fever  caused  by  noninfectious causes is difficult to evaluate. Given that all patients with and without fungal infections are treated,  the  true  efficacy  of  the  antifungal  drug  is  difficult  to  evaluate.  The  controlled  trials  on empirical antifungal  therapy  performed so  far  have  all  used  a  non-inferiority  design  and  composite endpoints. However, to compare two antifungal drugs and show that they are equivalent without a well defined primary endpoint is not optimal. A superiority trial design would be more appropriate for new antifungals, as stated in the recently adopted CPMP PtC. However, at the time of the initiation of the caspofungin  empirical therapy trial (1999), the prevailing  approach  for  empirical antifungal therapy studies  was  the  non-inferiority  design  using  a  delta  of  -10%.  The  CPMP  PtC  did  not  come  into operation  until  recently,  in  November  2003.  The  P026  study  was  modelled  on  the  earlier  large randomised  comparative  trials  in  empirical  therapy,  including  the  one  that  led  to  the  approval  of AmBisome  in  this  indication.  For  all  these  reasons,  the  CPMP  considered  that  a  superiority  trial cannot be considered an absolute requirement for granting this indication. The CPMP also believes, in accordance with the MAH's position, that the efficacy of caspofungin in documented invasive fungal infections has been satisfactorily demonstrated in previous studies.

The  response  assessment  reports  clearly  demonstrate  the  multitude  of  prognostic  factors  (e.g. persistent  neutropenia,  change  in  antibacterial  regimen,  pre-existing  renal  impairment,  underlying disease…) that might affect the outcome of all the separate secondary endpoints and thereby also the primary composite efficacy endpoint. All these variables are impossible to control for and contribute to the difficulties of assessing true efficacy of a drug in empirical therapy. A cautious attitude towards the results achieved in empirical antifungal trials is indeed indicated. As shown, there was a trend for prolonged  neutropenia  in  patients  with  baseline  infections  in  the  AmBisome  group,  favouring caspofungin, which likely influenced on the outcome of baseline infections.

The MAH has responded in many ways satisfactorily to the list of outstanding issues. Regarding the major issue of an imbalance for persistent neutropenia (defined as ANC &lt;500/µl at the end of study therapy  (EOT))  between  treatment  groups  favouring  caspofungin  in the  'baseline  fungal  infection' secondary endpoint, the MAH claimed that this was due to the fact that there were more unfavourable responses and a related shorter duration of therapy in the AmBisome group. This circular reasoning (the  time  to  end-of-therapy  itself  depends  on  the  resolution  of  neutropenia)  cannot  be  endorsed. Overall, there was a clear trend for prolonged neutropenia in the AmBisome group, irrespective of the time  to  end-of-therapy.  However,  this  analysis  is  based  on  very  few  patients  (27  subjects  in  each

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment group, i.e. 5% of the whole population) and a reanalysis of the study with adjustment for a post-entry  outcome  ('persistent  neutropenia')  is  inappropriate.  Therefore  it  is  difficult  to  draw  any firm conclusions.

A similar trend in the outcome of the 7-day survival favouring caspofungin was demonstrated. Since the  differences  in  successful  treatment  response  for  baseline  infections  and  7-day  survival  between treatment groups were small and barely/not statistically significant, the superiority of caspofungin to AmBisome  cannot  be  claimed  for  these  two  secondary  endpoints.  However,  the  non-inferiority  of caspofungin to AmBisome in the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e. favourable overall response for the 5part composition endpoint) remains unchanged.

Regarding the requested supplementary data on possible breakthrough infections it was clarified that the majority of patients (56/57) had pneumonia and that only 3 of these subjects had microbiological data,  whereof  only  one  fulfilled  the  microbiological  criteria  for  IFI  as  defined  by  EORTC/MSG. Although it can be agreed that the occurrence of possible infections should be regarded with a high level of uncertainty, and that in the setting of an empirical therapy trial in febrile neutropenic patients, analysis  of  documented  invasive  fungal  infections  should  be  limited  to  the  probable  and  proven categories,  the  higher  numbers  of  possible  breakthrough  infections  in  the  caspofungin  group  vs  the AmBisome group (38 vs 19 ) raises some concern.

Data of this pivotal comparative phase III trial, P026, including more than 1000 patients, indicate that caspofungin  performs  similarly  to  liposomal  amphotericin  B  in  the  treatment  of  suspected  fungal infection  due  to  Aspergillus  and  Candida  in  patients  with  persistent  febrile  neutropenia.  Also, caspofungin showed similar efficacy to AmBisome for the prevention of breakthrough infections with no appreciable difference between  groups in total rates or in by-pathogen rates. Caspofungin  has in earlier  clinical  studies  convincingly  been  shown  to  be  efficacious  in  the  treatment  of  refractory invasive aspergillosis and invasive candidiasis in non-neutropenic patients. Limited data in neutropenic patients with documented candidaemia as well as deep-sited Candida infections indicate that  caspofungin  has  similar  efficacy  in  these  patients.  In  the  P026  trial,  the  safety  profile  of caspofungin was demonstrated to represent an advantage compared with Ambisome.

The indication, as proposed by the MAH, ' Empirical therapy for presumed fungal infections in febrile, neutropaenic adult patients , should be revised.

The requested indication is misleading since it implies that caspofungin will be useful regardless of the identity of any fungal pathogen, a fact which is not supported by the data provided. Therefore the CPMP decided to adopt an alternate wording, as follows: ' Empirical therapy for presumed fungal infections (such as Candida and Aspergillus) in febrile, neutropaenic adult patients '. Together with this revised indication, a warning statement regarding uncommon yeast and non-aspergillus moulds was added to section 4.4 of the SPC as follows: ' Limited data suggest that less common non-Candida yeasts and non-Aspergillus moulds are not covered by caspofungin. The efficacy of caspofungin against these fungal pathogens has not been established. '

Considering  all  the  above  aspects  and  the  revision  of  the  SPC  as  requested, the  risk/benefit relationship is considered favourable .

## 2.6 Adopted  changes  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  and  Package Leaflet

## 2.6.2 Summary of Product Characteristics

## Section 4.1 'Therapeutic indications'

The requested indication is misleading since it implies that caspofungin will be useful regardless of the identity  of  any  fungal  pathogen,  a  fact  which  is  not  supported  by  the  data  provided.  Therefore  the CPMP decided to  adopt an  alternate  wording,  as  follows: ' Empirical  therapy  for  presumed  fungal infections (such as Candida and Aspergillus) in febrile, neutropaenic adult patients '.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  current  indication  for  invasive  candidasis (IC)  is  inconsistent  with  the  extension  of  indication, since  it  includes  only non-neutropenic patients.  The  number  of  neutropenic  patients  with  IC  who have  received  caspofungin  has  increased  with  the  data  from  the  empirical  trial  and  now  totals  26 patients  (14  patients  from  the  invasive  candiasis  trial  (P014)  trial  and  12  patients  from  the  current trial).  In  comparison  with  the  22  neutropenic  patients  who  received  AmBisome/amphotericin  B  in these trials, favourable response rates were slightly higher in the caspofungin group (15/26 (58%) vs 9/22  (41%)).  It  will  read  as  follows:  ' Treatment  of invasive  candidiasis  in  non-neutropenic  adult patients '.

## Section 4.2 'Posology and method of administration'

The  recommendation  of  a  dose  increase  of  caspofungin  to  70  mg  in  case  of  inadequate  clinical response cannot be endorsed due to lack of supportive data. The wording in section 4.2 of the SPC as proposed  by  the  MAH  is  as  follows :  'Doses  higher  than  70 mg  daily  have  not  been  adequately studied.' This new wording applies to the existing indications of Invasive Aspergillosis and Invasive Candidiasis as well as to the empirical treatment indication.

The CPMP agreed on the wording as proposed by the MAH at the time of the application:  ' Duration of empirical therapy should be based on the patient's clinical response. Therapy should be continued until  up  to  72  hours  after  resolution  of  neutropaenia  (ANC ≥ 500).  Patients  found  to  have  a  fungal infection should be treated for a minimum of 14 days and treatment should continue for at least 7 days after both neutropaenia and clinical symptoms are resolved .'

## Section 4.4 'Special warnings and special precautions for use'

Together with this revised indication, a warning statement regarding uncommon yeast and nonaspergillus moulds was added to section 4.4 of the SPC as follows: ' Limited data suggest that less common non-Candida yeasts and non-Aspergillus moulds are not covered by caspofungin. The efficacy of caspofungin against these fungal pathogens has not been established. '

The CPMP agreed on the modified wording as proposed by the MAH at the time of the application: ' The safety  information  on  treatment  durations  longer  than  4 weeks  is  limited,  however,  available data suggest that caspofungin continues to be well tolerated with longer courses of therapy (up to 162 days).'

## Section 4.8 'Undesirable effects'

Based on the results of the empirical therapy study, adverses events were updated in this section 4.8, as follows: ' In clinical studies, 1440 individuals received single or multiple doses of CANCIDAS: 564 febrile neutropaenic patients (empirical therapy study), 125 patients with invasive candidiasis, 72 patients with invasive aspergillosis, 285 patients with localised Candida infections, and 394 individuals enrolled in Phase I studies. In the empirical therapy study patients had received chemotherapy for malignancy or had undergone hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (including 39 allogeneic transplantations). In the studies involving patients with documented Candida infections, the majority of the patients with invasive Candida infections had serious underlying medical conditions (e.g., haematologic or other malignancy, recent major surgery, HIV) requiring multiple concomitant medications.  Patients in the non-comparative Aspergillus study often had serious predisposing medical conditions (e.g., bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplants, haematologic malignancy, solid tumours or organ transplants) requiring multiple concomitant medications .'

…

' Reported clinical and laboratory abnormalities among all patients treated with CANCIDAS (total 989) were typically mild and rarely led to discontinuation .'…

Furthermore , tachycadia, dyspnea and sweating were added as adverse events reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH proposed to delete the word 'isolated' since there were 39 post-marketing reports of suspected allergic reaction of which 18 were serious. The CPMP accepted this proposal.

## Section 5.1 'Pharmacodynamic properties'

The CPMP agreed on the update of the numbers in the in vitro activity of caspofungin:

' Caspofungin  has  in  vitro  activity  against  Aspergillus  species  (Aspergillus  fumigatus  [N = 75], Aspergillus  flavus  [N = 111],  Aspergillus niger  [N = 31],  Aspergillus  nidulans  [N = 8],  Aspergillus terreus [N = 52], and Aspergillus candidus [N = 3]). Caspofungin also has in vitro activity against Candida species (Candida albicans [N = 1032], Candida dubliniensis [N = 100], Candida glabrata [N = 151],  Candida  guilliermondii  [N = 67],  Candida  kefyr  [N = 62],  Candida  krusei  [N = 147], Candida lipolytica [N = 20], Candida lusitaniae [N = 80], Candida parapsilosis [N = 215], Candida rugosa  [N = 1],  and  Candida  tropicalis  [N = 258]),  including  isolates  with  multiple  resistance transport mutations  and  those with  acquired  or  intrinsic  resistance  to  fluconazole,  amphotericin B, and 5-flucytosine .'

Considering the great difficulties in recruiting a large number of neutropenic patients with documented IC, the CPMP is of the  opinion that efficacy  for  caspofungin  has been sufficiently  demonstrated to delete  the  restriction  of  the  IC  indication  to  non-neutropenic  patients.  Therefore,  the  paragraph  on Invasive Candidiasis was modified to read: ' These limited data are supported by the outcome of the empirical therapy study .'

The CPMP agreed on the following wordings to reflect data on empirical therapy as follows:

'Empirical Therapy in Febrile, Neutropaenic Adult Patients: A total of 1111 patients with persistent fever and neutropaenia were enrolled in a clinical study and treated with either caspofungin 50 mg once  daily  following  a  70-mg  loading  dose  or  liposomal  amphotericin  B  3.0 mg/kg/day.  Eligible patients  had  received  chemotherapy  for  malignancy  or  had  undergone  hematopoietic  stem-cell transplantation, and presented with neutropaenia (&lt;500 cells/mm 3  for 96 hours) and fever (&gt;38.0°C) not responding to ≥ 96 hours of parenteral antibacterial therapy. Patients were to be treated until up to 72 hours after resolution of neutropaenia, with a maximum duration of 28 days. However, patients found to have a documented fungal infection could be treated longer. If the drug was well tolerated but the patient's fever persisted and clinical condition deteriorated after 5 days of therapy, the dosage of  study  drug  could  be  increased  to  70 mg/day  of  caspofungin  (13.3 %  of  patients  treated)  or  to 5.0 mg/kg/day  of  liposomal  amphotericin  B  (14.3 %  of  patients  treated).There  were  1095  patients included in the primary Modified Intention-To-Treat (MITT) efficacy analysis of overall favourable response; caspofungin (33.9 %) was as effective as liposomal amphotericin B (33.7 %) [% difference 0.2  (95.2 %  CI  -5.6,  6.0)].  An  overall  favourable  response  required  meeting  each  of  5  criteria: (1) successful  treatment  of  any  baseline  fungal  infection  (caspofungin  51.9 %  [14/27],  liposomal amphotericin B 25.9 % [7/27]), (2) no breakthrough fungal infections during administration of study drug  or  within  7  days  after  completion  of  treatment  (caspofungin  94.8 %  [527/556],  liposomal amphotericin  B  95.5 %  [515/539]),  (3) survival  for  7  days  after  completion  of  study  therapy (caspofungin 92.6 % [515/556], liposomal amphotericin B 89.2 % [481/539]), (4) no discontinuation from  the  study  drug  because  of  drug-related  toxicity  or  lack  of  efficacy  (caspofungin  89.7 % [499/556], liposomal amphotericin B 85.5 % [461/539]), and (5) resolution of fever during the period of  neutropaenia  (caspofungin  41.2 %  [229/556],  liposomal  amphotericin  B  41.4 %  [223/539]). Response  rates  to  caspofungin  and  liposomal  amphotericin  B  for  baseline  infections  caused  by Aspergillus species were, respectively, 41.7 % (5/12) and 8.3 % (1/12), and by Candida species were 66.7 %  (8/12)  and  41.7 %  (5/12).  Patients  in  the  caspofungin  group  experienced  breakthrough infections  due  to  the  following  uncommon  yeasts  and  moulds:  Trichosporon  species  (1),  Fusarium species (1), Mucor species (1), and Rhizopus species (1).'

## Section 5.2 'Pharmacokinetic properties'

The CPMP agreed on the proposed wording to update the paragraph on elderly patients as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

' In patients who were treated empirically or who had invasive candidiasis, a similar modest effect of age was seen in older patients relative to younger patients .'

## 2.6.2 Package Leaflet

The CPMP agreed on the proposed wordings to reflect the change from the SPC in the PL, as follows:

## 1. What is CANCIDAS and what is it used for?

'Persistent fever due to infection may occur following chemotherapy or medical conditions that lower the body's resistance to disease by lowering counts of certain white blood cells. If the fever is not reduced by treatment with an antibiotic, your doctor may suspect that you have a fungal infection and prescribe CANCIDAS to treat it.' is added.

## 4. What undesirable effects may CANCIDAS have?

This section of the PL is udated as follows: 'The most common side effect is fever. Other reported side effects include:

- rapid heart beat,
- Headache,
- flushing,
- abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
- shortness of breath,
- rash, itching, sweating,
- allergic reactions (including swelling of the face and/or lips, itching, rash, sensation of warmth, or trouble breathing),
- pain, chills, vein irritations at the infusion site (including itching, redness, discharge, swelling, burning sensation, or clotting),
- swelling of the hands, ankles or feet,
- alterations in some laboratory blood tests (including decreased red blood cell count and increased values of some liver and kidney tests, high calcium).'
- impaired liver function,

In  addition,  the  MAH  has  completed  the  list  of  local  representatives  in  the  Package  Leaflet  in accordance with EMEA/QRD templates, to include the 10 accession countries.

## III. CONCLUSION

The  majority  of  the  CPMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the proposed  wordings  to  be  introduced  into  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  based  on  the observations and the appropriate conclusions.

The CPMP adopted on 24 March 2004 an Opinion on a Type II variation to be made to the terms of the Community Marketing Authorisation.
