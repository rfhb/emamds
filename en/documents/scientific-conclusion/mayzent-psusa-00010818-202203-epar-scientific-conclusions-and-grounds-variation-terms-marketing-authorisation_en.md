## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for siponimod, the scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on lymphopenia from spontaneous reports and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing siponimod should be amended accordingly in order to ensure a better monitoring of lymphopenia and align the recommendations with the product information of fingolimod.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for siponimod the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing siponimod is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.
