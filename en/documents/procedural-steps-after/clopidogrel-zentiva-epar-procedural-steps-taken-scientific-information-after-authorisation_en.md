Clopidogrel has been shown to increase repaglinide exposure in healthy volunteers. In vitro studies have shown the increase in repaglinide exposure is due to inhibition of CYP2C8 by the glucuronide metabolite of clopidogrel. Due to the risk of increased plasma concentrations, concomitant administration of clopidogrel and drugs primarily cleared by CYP2C8 metabolism (e.g., repaglinide, paclitaxel) should be undertaken with caution.   |

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 23/01/2014 | 18/09/2014 | SmPC | Dermatitis exfoliative is one form of severe dermatitis, and as such deserves to be differentiated from other dermatitis, particularly since it may signal the presence of DRESS. MAH proposes a change in SmPC section 4.8 to address this difference. The report on dermatitis exfoliative has shown sufficient evidence that clopidogrel may induce exfoliative rashes either generalized or localized including hands and feet locations. This is supported particularly by sentinel and rechallenge cases. Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information in order to add information on Core Data |

The results of ACTIVE-W showed that use of a vitamin-K antagonist reduced the risk for stroke by 42% over clopidogrel and aspirin. Those considered unsuitable for warfarin therapy were enrolled in ACTIVE-A and randomized to receive clopidogrel (75 mg/day) or placebo on a background of aspirin therapy. The safety profile of clopidogrel is well established and no new safety concerns were discovered during the analysis of ACTIVE A and W trials what must be analysed is the rates on known risks namely bleeding in the context of the benefits.   |

The current variation provides an overview and discussion of the data generated from the comprehensive research program undertaken to further elucidate the variability of PK and PD response of clopidogrel. The MAH submitted a type II Variation application to request an update of the sections 4.4 \"Special warnings and precautions for use\" and 4.5 \"Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction\" of the SPC. The Patient Information Leaflets have been updated to reflect these SPC modifications. |
