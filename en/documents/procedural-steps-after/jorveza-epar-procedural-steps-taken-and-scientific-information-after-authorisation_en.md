| II/0015 | Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to update the list of adverse reactions based on final results from the long-term maintenance study BUL-2/EER; this is a double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled, phase III study on the efficacy and tolerability of a 48-week treatment with two different doses of budesonide effervescent tablets vs. placebo for maintenance of clinico-pathological remission in adult patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. The RMP version 3.0 has also been submitted. The MAH also submitted the final report of study BUL-6/BIO, which was previously assessed within the scope of extension EMEA/H/C/004655/X/0007/G as applicant's response to CHMP Day 120 List of Questions. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 10/11/2022 | SmPC and PL | The applicant has submitted the final study report of study BUL-2/EER and evaluated the safety of the different phases of the trial separately. Overall, the conclusions of the applicant that the nature and frequency of AEs over time, during the overall 3-year observation period is consistent with the known safety profile of the previous data submitted (mainly the OLI and DB phases of the trial) has been demonstrated in adequate manner. As already previously demonstrated, the main safety concern with the compound relates to the occurrence of local fungal infections in the oral cavity, the laryngeal and pharyngeal regions, as well as the oesophagus. Most of the other events observed relate to known events for the substance budesonide, which, however, do not seem to occur at increased frequency or severity in the patients with EoE with the formulation under evaluation. The applicant has, however, identified a couple of adverse effects/adverse drug reactions, which are - based on the results of the final study report of study BUL-2/EER - proposed to be included into the prescribing information for the product in addition, or with a higher frequency than previously assigned. The conclusion to add several identified ADRs into the prescribing information is overall supported, and adequate frequency of these events has been assigned. Overall, it can be concluded that the treatment with Jorveza at daily doses of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg has been |

The risk-benefit ratio of the compound remains positive.                                            |
