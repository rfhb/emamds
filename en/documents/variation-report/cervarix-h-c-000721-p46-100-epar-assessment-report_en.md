## 1. Introduction

On 14 March 2024 the MAH submitted the final study report for study EPI-HPV-101-VE DB (221785) for Cervarix, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

The MAH conducted a systematic literature review and meta-regression analysis in order to assess efficacy/effectiveness of Cervarix against advanced cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse (CIN3, CIN3+) and cervical cancer.

Long-term efficacy and immunogenicity information is already part of Cervarix´s label. However, as national immunization programs with universal Cervarix vaccination are being rolled out, and observational studies are being developed, real-world and long-term follow-up of clinical trials data on the long-term effects of Cervarix are accruing and becoming available. In addition, analysis may provide estimates of the effect size while adjusting for important covariates such as age at first vaccination, follow-up time to vaccination, study design, and other relevant variables. The EPI-HPV101-VE DB study (study 221785) was thus conducted with the aim of compiling all published evidence, given that new available data had not been generated by GSK. Study 221785 is not part of any Paediatric Investigation Plan.

The MAH hereby submits the final study report for study EPI-HPV-101-VE DB (221785), entitled: ' Efficacy/effectiveness of Cervarix against grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse (CIN3, CIN3+) and cervical cancer. A systematic review and meta-regression analysis.'

The MAH concluded that results are in line with the approved product information for Cervarix in the EU. Therefore, no additional changes to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Cervarix are considered necessary. This is agreed.

Among studies used in the systematic literature review, some were sponsored by GSK (the MAH), and some were sponsored by other sponsors. Among the studies sponsored by GSK, two studies included a paediatric population. These two GSK studies were submitted to EMA, not under the scope of article 46 but under the below scopes:

- Study 580299/008 or HPV-008 (NCT00122681) was submitted as follow up measure (EMEA/H/C/000721/FUM014, EMEA/H/C/000721/FUM 14.1, EMEA/H/C/000721/FUM028.2) and as a variation to update the SmPC and PL (EMEA/H/C/000721/II/011 and EMEA/H/C/000721/II/0020)
- Study 580299/012 or HPV-012 (NCT00169494) was submitted as follow up measure (EMEA/H/C/000721/FUM/018/019/020, EMEA/H/C/000721/FU2 18.1, EMEA/H/C/000721/FU2 18.2)

Some of the data have been already submitted to EMA in previous procedures. The current data of this systematic review and meta-regression analysis could bring different conclusions/outcome.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study Efficacy/effectiveness of CERVARIX against grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse (CIN3, CIN3+) and cervical cancer. A systematic review and meta-regression analysis. 221785 (EPI-HPV-101 VE DB) is a standalone study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study 221785 is not part of a Paediatric Investigation Plan. To comply with the requirements of the Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the MAH is submitting the final Clinical Study Report as agreed with EMA.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies

CERVARIX is composed of recombinant C-terminally truncated HPV 16 L1 and HPV 18 L1 proteins, assembled into VLPs adjuvanted with AS04. The HPV 16 L1 VLP and HPV 18 L1 VLP proteins constitute the active ingredient of the vaccine and are produced with a recombinant Baculovirus expression system. The AS04 adjuvant is composed of an aluminum salt, Al(OH)3 and MPL. The MPL immunostimulant is a detoxified derivative of the lipopolysaccharide of the gram-negative bacterium Salmonella Minnesota R595 strain.

The authorized indication is for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of premalignant anogenital lesions (cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal) and cervical and anal cancers causally related to certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types.

A two dose (0.5 ml each) immunization schedule is recommended in children 9 to and including 14 years of age (the second dose is given between 5 and 13 months after the first dose) while a three dose (0.5 ml each) regimen is recommended in case of individuals ≥ 15 years of age given at 0, 1, and 6 months.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Clinical study 221785 (EPI-HPV-101 VE DB)

Efficacy/effectiveness of CERVARIX against grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse (CIN3, CIN3+) and cervical cancer. A systematic review and meta-regression analysis.

## Description

## Research question

What is the efficacy/effectiveness of the human papillomavirus vaccination with CERVARIX in girls and women against human papillomavirus on cervical cancer and grade 3 CIN or worse?

## Objectives

To conduct a meta-analysis and meta-regression analyses on the efficacy/effectiveness of CERVARIX on cervical cancer and CIN3 or worse (CIN3+) to provide estimates of the effect size adjusting by covariates such as age at vaccination, time since vaccination, study design, or analytical cohort (HPV baseline status of participants).

The analysis will be designed to respond to the following 6 questions:

1. What is the combined efficacy/effectiveness of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by vaccine HPV types?
2. What is the combined efficacy/effectiveness of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type?
3. What is the efficacy of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by vaccine HPV types?

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

4. What is the effectiveness of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by vaccine HPV types? (Observational studies only)
5. What is the efficacy of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type?
6. What is the effectiveness of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type? (Observational studies only)

## Methods

## Study Design

This study has been conceived as a systematic review to collect non-GSK data stemming mainly from long-term follow-up studies of RCTs, long-term observational studies and data from national surveillance from countries that implemented CERVARIX in their NIPs and that have been accruing over time. The aim was to analyze these data in a systematic and synthetic manner.

The objective of the present study is to determine effectiveness of CERVARIX (and not comparative effectiveness vs. any other HPV vaccine).

## Study Population and Setting

## Eligibility criteria

Studies were eligible if they compared the protection conferred by CERVARIX to prevent cervical cancer and CIN3 or worse (CIN3+) between CERVARIX vaccinated and non-vaccinated participants, be it a comparator arm in the case of RCTs (efficacy), or unvaccinated participants in case of observational/population-based surveillance/longitudinal studies (effectiveness). Vaccination has been considered if participants received at least one dose of the vaccine. No geographical limits, or race restrictions applied to the selection of articles.

## Inclusion criteria

All studies that meet the following criteria were included:

- Studies that report CERVARIX efficacy (randomized controlled trials, RCTs) or effectiveness (observational studies) against cervical cancer and/or CIN3 or worse (CIN3+).
- Studies that have a comparator group receiving either placebo or another vaccine, or a control group of unvaccinated participants.
- The intervention group was considered as vaccinated if participants received at least one dose of the vaccine.
- Studies published in journal articles between 1 January 2000 to 21 June 2022. The following databases were screened: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL.
- Studies with the following design could be included: randomized controlled trials and observational studies (cohort, cross-sectional, case-control, longitudinal, population-based surveillance)

## Exclusion criteria

Systematic reviews, reviews, modelling, economic studies (including cost-effectiveness and comparative effectiveness), letters to the editor, case reports, and case series were excluded. Conference abstracts and proceedings were excluded. Studies that have unreliable data for the extraction were excluded. Grey literature was not included.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Variables

## Outcome definition

The outcome for this study is the vaccine efficacy/effectiveness of CERVARIX to prevent cervical cancer and CIN3 or worse (CIN3+) as provided by the retrieved publications.

However, when vaccine efficacy or effectiveness results were not available in the selected papers but a measure of effect was provided instead, vaccine efficacy/effectiveness was estimated (including 95% confidence interval) from the relevant measure of effect: i.e., OR, IRR, as cervical cancer below 25 years of age is rare [Teixeira, 2021] and therefore, these measures of effect offer a reasonable approximation of the RR [Viera, 2008]. In those cases, vaccine efficacy/effectiveness was calculated as VE=(1-OR)*100, or VE=(1-IRR)*100.

In those studies where HPV type was determined, relevant and specific DNA sequencing and bioinformatic techniques were used. Cytology and histopathology for CIN cases were mainly reviewed by an independent pathology committee, usually masked to the vaccine allocation.

## Endpoints

CIN3, CIN3+, AIS, invasive cervical cancer (ICC)

## Confounders and effect modifiers

Post hoc studies of clinical trials and observational and longitudinal studies stemming from surveillance of NIPs were likely subject to the following confounders/effect modifiers :

- -Age at first vaccination (HPV acquisition, prevalent infection, or baseline HPV status).
- -Sexual behavior (HPV acquisition, prevalent infection, or baseline HPV status).
- -Time since vaccination or time of follow-up (immunogenicity, duration of protection).
- -Age at first cervical screening.
- -Healthcare seeking behavior.
- -Socioeconomic factors.

Residual confounding cannot be completely ruled out.

Please also refer to quality assessment subheading.

The following variables were designed to be included in the meta-regression analyses with the aim to allow for certain known confounders/effect modifiers:

- TVC/TVC naïve: This is a binary variable and reflects whether the analytical cohort was the total vaccinated cohort (irrespective of the baseline HPV status) or the total vaccinated cohort naïve (HPVnegative at baseline).
- Age at first vaccination (known confounders/effect modifiers) : This variable represents the age at which the participant received the first vaccine dose. Age will be modelled as a continuous variable. Nonlinearity will be checked.
- Time since vaccination (time of follow-up) (known confounders/effect modifiers): This variable is the time that passed between when the participant received the first dose of the vaccine and the conduct of the study.
- HPV type: vaccine efficacy/effectiveness is expressed against different HPV types. Including those that are vaccine-specific (i.e., HPV 16/18) or non-vaccine types, or even composite indexes (i.e., 12

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

high-risk HPV types). For the purpose of this study, the meta-analysis and meta-regression will be planned to answer research questions that entail two scenarios concerning HPV type: 'HPV 16/18' or 'Irrespective of HPV type'

· Study design (known confounders/effect modifiers): This variable will have two values: RCT and observational that includes observational studies such as cohort studies and longitudinal populationbased surveillance studies.

· Study correlation: This is a dummy variable created to adjust for potential correlation in studies. For instance, some study may contribute data from participants vaccinated at different age groups and two different analysis approaches (i.e., TVC naïve and TVC); in other instances, different studies may provide data from the same population but with different analytical approach (TVC naïve and TVC, respectively) and different components (RCT and observational study for vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness, respectively) or combinations of both.

## Exposure definitions

In this study, the exposure is vaccination with CERVARIX. For this study, a participant is considered as vaccinated if received at least one dose of the vaccine.

Selected RCTs in this systematic literature review had an intervention arm giving CERVARIX and an active comparator arm. Since the hepatitis A vaccine is not supposed to have any effect on CIN3+, subjects receiving this vaccine will be considered as non-exposed.

In the case of observational studies, the comparator arm used to determine vaccine effectiveness was a control group of unvaccinated participants, who will also be considered as non-exposed.

In the RCTs in this systematic review, CERVARIX vaccination was the intervention of the trial. Therefore, vaccination was registered within the trial. In observational studies that were post-hoc studies of clinical trials, the same procedure was followed. For longitudinal studies corresponding to surveillance of national immunization programs, individual vaccination status was retrieved from national registers and in some instances, when individual vaccination status was not available, researchers modelled the specific probability that a woman was vaccinated from the official national statistics for vaccination with three doses in the general population (i.e., [Rebolj, 2022]).

## Study size

Not Applicable. This meta-regression analysis was not conceived as a confirmatory study. There is not a prior hypothesis to test and therefore it is not necessary to establish a sample size that has sufficient power to reject the null hypothesis. However, since two of the observational studies are nationwide surveillance studies (including several birth cohorts) and the other observational and follow-up of RCTs studies included high number of participants that allowed statistically significant vaccine efficacy/effectiveness estimates, precision of the estimates produced by the meta-regression results is expected to be sufficient. The cohort sizes for the different studies included in the metaregression and the correspondent vaccine effect estimates and precision intervals are presented in Table 5.

## Data analysis

Meta-regression is a generalization of the meta-analysis that allows assessing the relationship between specific study-level covariates, such as age or time since vaccination, and the effect size. In particular, it may take into account the heterogeneity of the results that may come from different levels of covariates of the different studies.

Heterogeneity among selected studies is expected to be large, given the differences in settings (e.g., time at first vaccination, time of follow-up, study design, etc.) that are known to influence vaccine efficacy/effectiveness but a decision was made to pursue a quantitative synthesis exercise. To consider these factors in the calculation of global estimates, meta-regression models will be fitted. They will provide summary point estimates for vaccine efficacy/effectiveness for every scenario while adjusting for relevant covariates (i.e., correcting for study differences due to different levels of covariates). Residual heterogeneity not explained by the multiparametric model will be shown in the statistical outputs. If this heterogeneity is still large, it will be discussed and acknowledged among the limitations of the study.

Meta-regression allows the effects of multiple factors to be investigated simultaneously. It examines if characteristics of studies are associated with the magnitude and direction of the effect in the selected studies. The outcome variable will be the effect estimate. The explanatory variables are characteristics of studies that might influence the size of the effect. These are often called 'potential effect modifiers' or covariates. For this analysis, the outcome variable will be the effect estimate (CERVARIX efficacy/effectiveness). The explanatory variables will be study design (RCT/observational), age at first vaccination, the type of analytical cohort, and time since vaccination. Note that to increase the precision of the estimates, when possible, the MAH will split studies in different sub-studies given differences in terms of covariates. The correlations between the different sub-studies of a study will be taken into account in all subsequent analyses.

Meta-regression models will be fitted using a frequentist approach. For each question considered, the following strategy will be used:

- First a meta-analysis will be fitted (using the rma.mv function from R) using a REML estimation procedure allowing for Random Effect).
- Univariate meta-regressions (with Random Effect and REML) will be fitted to assess the impact of each covariate independently.
- A multivariate meta-regression (with Random Effect and REML) will then be considered.

## Regression

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regression is a statistical method that assesses the relationship between covariates and the dependent variable in a particular study . In this study, meta-regression will always have random effects and vaccine efficacy/effectiveness will be modelled as the log of the relative risk [log(1-VE)] as normally distributed. In this whole analysis, the statistical significance will be at p=0.05. However, this study is not considered as confirmatory and no prior hypothesis has been formulated. There is no intention to adjust for multiplicity. Confidence intervals will be two-sided and will be at a 95% level.

## Primary analysis

## Main Analytical approach

The following scheme will be followed to answer the research questions and scenarios.

Multiparametric meta-regressions adjusting for the following covariates: age at first vaccination, study design (RCT vs observational), analytical cohort (TVC vs TVC naïve), and time since vaccination (time of follow-up). An AIC (estimator of prediction error) approach will be used to assess the quality of the models for every given dataset allowing a data-driven selection of the best model.

One model will be selected for each of the 6 questions assessed:

1. What is the combined efficacy/effectiveness of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by vaccine HPV types?
2. What is the combined overall efficacy/effectiveness of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type?
3. What is the efficacy of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by vaccine HPV types?
4. What is the effectiveness of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by vaccine HPV types? (Observational studies only)
5. What is the efficacy of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type?
6. What is the effectiveness of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type? (Observational studies only)

However, prior to this, the following preliminary analyses will be considered:

1. Classical random effect meta-analysis without adjusting for covariates.

2. Univariate meta-regression with random effect of each potential covariate, e.g., age at first vaccination, study design (RCT vs observational), analytical cohort (TVC vs TVC naïve), and time since vaccination (time of follow-up)

## Sensitivity analyses

The analysis will be conducted following different scenarios (i.e., analyzing RCTs or observational studies independently, and pooling together data corresponding to both study designs) to assess how different values of the independent variables affect the outcome variable. In addition, uni-, and multivariate models will be considered.

## Quality control and Quality Assurance

The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA checklist /and in compliance to the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Review of Interventions [Higgins, 2023; PRISMA, 2023] and the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis [Jordan, 2019].

Expected sources of bias for observational studies are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Selection bias: selection of participants could be influenced by participant´s characteristic or outcome.
- Information bias: bias related to measurements in the intervention and of the outcome (methods for the identification of the outcome, time between vaccination and outcome and baseline status to rule out outcomes due to pre-existing infection at a given dose)
- confounding: assessing the probability of differences between the two study groups.

The risk of bias was assessed by two different tools:

- Cochrane risk of bias for randomized controlled trails (RoB2) [The Cochrane Collaboration, 2022a]
- Cochrane ROBINS-I tool for observational epidemiological studies specifically designed for use in systematic reviews [ The Cochrane Collaboration, 2022b].

## Limitations of the research methods

## Related to Data

- -Methodology of Systematic literature review (SLR)

A SLR suffers from intrinsic limitations. It can only review what is found, and an element of publication bias is always present, which will reflect in the meta-analysis.

- -Data availability

Absence of data about important covariates (needed for the meta-regression) can be a major limitation in the assessment of heterogeneity in meta-regressions.

The data included in the analysis is based on a systematic literature review. As such the analysis is limited by the detail and granularity of the data provided in published manuscripts.

- -Number of studies and power of analysis

In a meta-regression framework, the unit of analysis is the study, so the regression performance is determined by the number of studies in the meta-analysis, which is sometimes relatively low. Consequently, one should not expect much statistical power from the meta-regression, depending on the number of covariates included in the model [Bartolucci, 1994]. The power of a statistical analysis is limited, i.e., based on the available data. Consequently, if a covariate is not found to be significant, we cannot conclude that there is no effect of that covariate. i.e., there may be a true effect but there may be insufficient evidence to demonstrate the effect with the available data.

## -Assessment of publication bias

Publication bias occurs when published studies differ systematically from all conducted studies in relation with a topic. Publication bias arises when papers with statistically significant or positive results in a certain direction are more likely to be published than papers with non-statistically significant or negative results [Jordan, 2019], translating into a threat to the validity of the systematic review.

The minimal number of studies recommended for assessment of publication bias with existing tools (i.e., funnel plot, statistical test for funnel plot asymmetry, etc.) should be at least ten to ensure sound statistical power [Higgins, 2023; Jordan, 2019].

## Related to Methodology

- -Interpretation of associations and confounding variables

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The associations derived from meta-regression are observational and have a less rigorous interpretation than the associations obtained within a single study, particularly when averages of patients' characteristics are used as covariates in the regression.

· Aggregation bias occurs when the relationship with patient averages across trials may not be the same as the relationship with patients within trial.

· Bias by confounding (association with one of the study characteristics that reflects a true association with another known or unknown correlated characteristic) is a particular problem in meta-regression.

## -Assumptions of linearity and normality

In the majority of meta-regressions, there is no attempt to verify the underlying assumptions of normality of the residuals, or the linearity of covariates.

## -Assumptions on creation of age groups

The data included in the analysis is based on a systematic literature review. As such the analysis is limited by the detail and granularity of the data provided in published manuscripts.

## -Potential post-hoc data dredging

The principal pitfall in meta-regression is data-dredging.

· There are only a few studies included, and many characteristics that can explain heterogeneity. Each of these characteristics could potentially be analyzed, until associations are found. Such multiple or post hoc analyses lead to a high chance of false positive conclusions.

· Post hoc conclusions should be regarded as hypothesis generating, to be investigated in other data sets. However, in meta-analysis, the totality of evidence has been accumulated and there is no such external validation.

· Pre-specification of the covariates (prior to the literature search) to be investigated helps protecting against false positive conclusions. However, in order to be truly prespecified, a protocol should be drawn up without knowledge of any of the relevant literature, which is not really achievable in practice since experts have already strong scientific rationales.

· The number of covariates should be limited, to limit the false positive conclusions. Also a possibility is Bonferroni adjustment to the significance level for each covariate inclusion [Wasserstein, 2016].

· Unfortunately, in practice, after pre-specifying covariates, researchers often discover that for the originally chosen covariates, the information is not available, or that other new important covariates that have not been pre-specified should be included in the analysis.

This study is exploratory and should not be regarded as more than hypothesis generating.

## Results

## Search results and characteristics of selected studies

Across the searches through the databases, 2803 potentially eligible articles were identified (including one article retrieved by hand search), Figure 2. Of them, 913 duplicates were removed. Records were screened (n=1890) and n=1837 were excluded based on the eligibility, inclusion, or exclusion criteria. After title and abstract screening, n=53 papers were included for full-text review. Of these, 9 met the inclusion criteria. Of them, 5 studies were follow-up of RCTs [Wheeler, 2012; Lehtinen, 2012; Konno, 2014; Porras, 2020; Shing, 2022], 3 studies were retrospective population-based registry linked studies [Palmer, 2019; Falcaro, 2021; Rebolj, 2022] and 1 study was an observational post-hoc longterm follow-up of an RCT [Lehtinen, 2017] Table 6 and Table 7. Two of the RCTs had also an observational component [Porras, 2020; Shing, 2022]. Studies were conducted in Japan [Konno, 2014], Costa Rica [Porras, 2020; Shing, 2022], Finland [Lehtinen, 2017], Scotland [Palmer, 2019], England [Falcaro, 2021; Rebolj, 2022], and in multicountry sites [Lehtinen, 2012; Wheeler, 2012).

The following parameters were considered for the inclusion of the studies in the meta-analysis/ metaregression analyses:

1. Endpoint: CIN3+. Results on other endpoints [i.e., CIN3, AIS, or cervical cancer were reported by very few papers (one, one, and two papers respectively)]. Therefore CIN3+ was selected as endpoint for the meta-regression [Lehtinen, 2012; Konno, 2014; Lehtinen, 2017; Palmer, 2019; Porras, 2020; Shing, 2022; Rebolj, 2022].
2. Outcome: Vaccine efficacy/Vaccine effectiveness as reported by the different studies. In study by Palmer et al., vaccine effectiveness is calculated for as (1- OR)*100 (the measure of effect provided by the paper is OR) [Palmer, 2019]. In a study by Falcaro et al., vaccine effectiveness is calculated as (1IRR)*100 (the measure of effect provided by the paper is IRR) [Falcaro, 2021].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3. Number of doses. The information for the number of doses injected needed to be reported in the paper. For the analysis, the groups vaccinated with '3 doses' and 'At least 1 dose' from different studies will be pooled together if at least 75% of the participants of the 'At least 1 dose' group received 3 doses of the vaccine.
4. Age at first vaccination. The decision was to stratify by age in those studies with this data available to increase the number of observations allowing a more robust model. This is to use the most granular results at the level of the studies in terms of age groups. For example, if the VE was reported for 3 age categories in a study, the three VE results will be used in the meta-regression.
5. Time since vaccination (time from the analysis to vaccination or time of follow-up).

6. CIN3+, HPV31/33/35/39/45/51/52/56/58/59/66/68 (common non-vaccine types endpoint), Vaccine effectiveness/vaccine efficacy. There are very few papers reporting on non-vaccine types, one is an RCT and the other is an observational study. A decision was made not to pursue meta-regression for this endpoint of non-vaccine types. Description of the findings will be presented in the narrative review.

7. Cervical cancer, Histological diagnosis (no HPV testing results), Vaccine effectiveness. There are only two papers [Falcaro, 2021; Rebolj, 2022] referring to the same population and there is certain possibility of overlapping in the birth cohorts of interest. In addition, vaccine effectiveness against cervical cancer in a study [Rebolj, 2022] did not reach statistical significance due to the small number of cases. Therefore, results from these papers referring to the outcome cervical cancer will not be included in the meta-regression and will be included in the narrative alone.
8. For the CIN3+ vaccine effectiveness meta-regression focusing on the endpoint 'Irrespective of the HPV type' the decision is to also include a study as the vaccine effectiveness is calculated as overall since the endpoints are histology-based (no direct HPV testing of the samples) [Palmer, 2019]. Another study will also be included since vaccine effectiveness refers to 14 high-risk HPV types, which are considered the most relevant oncogenic types and responsible for cervical cancer (up to 99% of cervical cancer is caused by the high-risk HPV types) [Rebolj, 2022]. Therefore, this paper will be considered that reports the outcome 'irrespective of the HPV type) [Dunne, 2007].
9. Choice of the analysis group: TVC cohort and TVC-naïve cohort. The TVC cohort is the cohort closest to the real world (regardless of their HPV baseline status) and more relevant from the public health perspective. However, differences for vaccine efficacy/effectiveness between both cohorts are significant. Therefore, a decision was made to conduct meta-regression having each of them independently (binary covariate) to highlight how important it is for increased protection to vaccinate girls and teenagers before sexual debut (the natural path of acquiring an HPV infection). A decision was made to determine summary point estimates for RCTs and observational studies alone, and also the combined effects of RCTs and observational data pooled together. This approach allows a sensitivity analysis considering the different scenarios: different study design and different vaccine outcomes (vaccine efficacy/effectiveness against vaccine types HPV16/18 or irrespective of HPV type).

A total of seven studies were selected for the quantitative synthesis [Lehtinen, 2012; Konno, 2014; Lehtinen, 2017; Palmer, 2019; Porras, 2020; Shing, 2022; Rebolj, 2022] whereas two studies remained for the narrative review alone since there were not enough individual records to conduct a quantitative synthesis [Wheeler, 2012; Falcaro, 2021] (Table 4). Refer to Table 6 showing the  final outcomes and endpoints for the meta-regression analysis.

The majority of studies stratified by age at first vaccination, although age groups varied considerably.

None of the 9 studies mentioned above were excluded based on quality.

## Quality assessment of randomized controlled trials

The Cochrane RoB2 tool was applied to the selected RCTs and three studies showed low risk bias whereas the study by Konno et al., presented some concerns in the randomization and deviations from intended intervention domain because a) this study is a post hoc follow-up of an RCT and the follow-up was not blinded. However, laboratory staff that assessed the outcome was blinded to the vaccination

status. Therefore, a great impact on the efficacy was not expected; b) the study was not powered to evaluate vaccine efficacy against CIN3+, the reason why this result showed wide confidence intervals. The latter will be addressed when conducting the adjusting in the meta-regression analysis [Konno, 2014; The Cochrane Collaboration, 2022a].

Overall, completeness of all follow-up studies was quite high, and losses were not selective, leaving both arms balanced at completion of the study.

## Quality assessment of observational studies

The Cochrane ROBINS I tool for non-interventional studies was used to assess the risk of bias of observational studies and surveillance of national immunization programs studies [The Cochrane Collaboration, 2022b]. All the included studies were considered to have at least moderate risk of bias, and two of the five studies included were at high (serious) risk of bias. These two studies that were at serious risk of bias had one or two domains at high risk (mainly confounding and information of outcome) [Palmer, 2019; Rebolj, 2022]. Uptake of screening in fully vaccinated women aged 20 or 21 years was 51%, and only 23% in unvaccinated women and this may have overestimated vaccine effectiveness [Palmer, 2019]. On the other hand, authors adjusted by immunization status and age at which the first dose was administered, and by year of birth in unvaccinated women, respectively. The analysis also adjusted for socioeconomic status (deprivation and rurality score) [Palmer, 2019]. In the study by Rebolj et al., individual vaccination status was unknown. The age and calendar year specific probability that a woman was vaccinated was estimated from the official national statistics for vaccination with three doses in the general population, available by school cohort. However, these two studies were population-based retrospective cohort studies limiting the risk of selection bias. The overall judgement was that both studies addressed bias and confounding in an appropriate manner in the analytical phase considering the limitations of the retrospective population-based registry linked study design [Palmer, 2019; Rebolj, 2022].

An important source of confounding of observational studies is related to HPV acquisition. The population-based studies did not determine HPV-baseline status to assess for prevalent infection at the time of vaccination as pre-vaccination cervical screening is not standard of care. To address this, studies allowed for buffer time between the vaccination and outcome assessment (cervical screening). Other important source of confounding in observational studies determining HPV vaccine effectiveness is differences in risk of HPV acquisition between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. In those observational studies other than stemming from national surveillance, baseline characteristics of the participants were assessed, most importantly in relation to sexual behavior and activity and adjusted for [Porras, 2020; Shing, 2022] and in other instances, sexual debut age was very similar between the vaccinated and unvaccinated arms [Lehtinen, 2017].

In any case, a decision was made not to discard any observational study, to adjust for covariates instead, and to acknowledge the limitations of the studies.

The covariates considered in meta-regression analysis were age at vaccination, time since vaccination, study design, or analytical cohort (Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC, irrespective of HPV baseline status) and Total Vaccinated Cohort naïve (TVC-naïve, HPV-naïve at baseline)).

## Individual study results

This systematic review and meta-analysis/meta-regression analysis included data on CERVARIX effects on CIN3+ from roughly 290 000 participants aged 12 to 25 years at vaccination, and up to 11 years of follow-up. Population-based HPV surveillance data from England added 13.7 million-years of follow-up in relation to VE against CIN3, and cervical cancer.

In the 4-year follow-up of the PATRICIA trial [Lehtinen, 2012], the overall vaccine efficacy (VE) against CIN3+ caused by HPV 16/18 reached its highest in the TVC-naïve [VE= 100% (95% CI, 85.5-100)], and ATP-E cohort [VE= 91.7% (95% CI, 66.6-99.1)] whereas, vaccine efficacy was lower [VE= 45.7% (95%CI, 22.9-62.2) in the TVC whose participants received at least one dose of CERVARIX and were sexually active (Table 5). When stratified by age, usually vaccine efficacy decreased as vaccination age of participants increased (Table 5).

Konno et al, determined vaccine efficacy against CIN3+ caused by any HPV type at 100% (95% CI, 417.0-100) in the TVC naïve cohort, and 36.4% (95% CI,- 57.8-75.7) in the TVC cohort [Konno, 2014] (Table 5).

The 4-year post-vaccination analysis of the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial that Porras et al. conducted, established vaccine efficacy against CIN3+ caused by HPV 16/18 at 66.4% (95% CI, -175-97.3), and VE in a post-hoc observational study up to 11 years of follow-up at 100% (95% CI, 78.8-100). The analytical cohort for the 4-year follow-up was composed of women that were HPV 16/18 naïve and did not have CIN2+ or any LEEP treatment at enrollment (Table 5).

With a different analytical approach of the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial, Shing and colleagues established vaccine efficacy against incident CIN3+ caused by HPV 16/18 at 52.9% (95% CI, 22.4-72.1) in the 4year follow-up of the trial in the TVC. Vaccine efficacy was 25.2% (95% CI, -5.0-46.9), irrespective of the HPV type. The observational post-hoc 7-11 years post-vaccination follow-up found VE of 86.9% (95% CI, 65.3-91.1) against incident CIN3+ caused by HPV 16/18, whereas VE declined to 14.4% (95% CI, - 23.4-40.7) when it was caused by any HPV type (Table 5).

In the 10-year follow-up observational study of the Finnish component of the PATRICIA and HPV-012 trials, Lehtinen and colleagues [Lehtinen, 2017] determined VE against CIN3+ irrespective of HPV type at 66% (95%CI, 8.4-88) (Table 5). The VE against CIN3+ of three doses of CERVARIX in the population-based study carried out by Palmer and colleagues in Scotland [Palmer, 2019] was estimated at 86% (95%CI, 75-92) in the 12-13 years at vaccination age-group, decreasing in older vaccinated birth cohorts.

HPV:HumanPapillomavirus,RCT:randomized control trial,TVC:Total VaccinatedCohort.

The following graph represents the different pooled vaccine effect estimates (including 95% CI) obtained by simple meta-analysis and thus, without adjusting for covariates.

Results for all analyses are described in section 9.2 of the CSR. Statistical outputs for all analyses are included in Annex 2.

Irrespectively of the question, the unadjusted vaccine effect was large in every scenario (within a range of vaccine effect from 48% to 78%).

## When adjusting for covariates:

1. Results are consistent across all the analyses, CERVARIX´s effects (either from RCTs, or observational studies, or both designs combined) against CIN3+ caused by HPV 16/18 types or by any HPV type. The CERVARIX´s effects were dependent of 3 covariates and were
2. -higher the younger the age at the first vaccination of the participants,
3. -higher in the TVC naïve population (HPV negative at baseline) compared to the TVC (irrespective of the HPV baseline status),
- shorter the follow-up (shorter time since vaccination).
2. These identified covariates explained most part of the heterogeneity leading to good predictions relevant for decision-making.

## Secondary outcomes

The systematic literature review unveiled effects of CERVARIX on other endpoints (i.e., CIN3, AIS, cervical cancer), herd effects, and cross-protection. Since there were not enough individual records as to conduct a quantitative synthesis, a brief description of the findings is included.

## Vaccine effects of CERVARIX on CIN3 and cervical cancer

Falcaro and colleagues [Falcaro, 2021] determined the VE of CERVARIX after its implementation as part of the NIP in England from 2008 to 2012. The immunization was deployed as a school-based routine vaccination program directed towards girls 12-13 years old and there were also catch-up campaigns for older adolescents (14-18 years). Results from this nationwide population-based study revealed a VE on CIN3 ranging from 97% (95% CI, 96%-98%) among the 12-13 years old vaccinated cohort, through 75% (95% CI, 72%-77%) in the 14-16 years old group, to 39% (95% CI, 36%-41%) in the 16-18 years old vaccinated cohort (Table 5).

Furthermore, the researchers estimated the VE of the program on cervical cancer at 87% (95% CI, 72%-94%) among students vaccinated at 12-13 years, through 62% (95% CI, 52%-71%) in the cohort vaccinated at 14-16 years, to 34% (95% CI, 25%-41%) in the 16- 18 years old vaccinated group [Falcaro, 2021].

The authors concluded that they observed a substantial reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer and CIN3 after the introduction of the universal vaccination program with CERVARIX in England, especially among women offered the vaccine at 12-13 years. They affirmed that the vaccine almost eliminated cervical cancer in women born since 01 September 1995. Part of this success was likely due to the high annual vaccine coverage in England that for 2008-09 and 2011-12 ranged between 85.9% and 90.6% in the routine cohorts [Falcaro, 2021]. These results are very important because this was the first time ever that real-world HPV VE on cervical cancer was reported for CERVARIX.

Rebolj et al, reported VE results on cervical cancer corresponding to 14-17 years old adolescents vaccinated in England through the catch-up campaign. Overall VE against cervical cancer among this population group was established at 64% (95% CI, -91%- 93%). However, results were not statistically significant (p=0.14) as number of cases was small (n=32). Vaccine coverage in the catchup cohort ranged from 40% to 75%, depending on the birth cohort [Rebolj, 2022].

## Vaccine effects of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by non-vaccine types.

Wheeler et al. investigated the vaccine efficacy on CIN3+ caused by non-vaccine types (a composite index of 12 HR HPV types (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68) as part of the PATRICIA trial (Table 5). The vaccine efficacy in the TVC-naïve (participants who were HPV negative at baseline and received at least one dose of the vaccine) was 81.9% (95% CI, 17.1-98.1) and 40.0% (95% CI, 1.1-64.2) in the TVC (participants who received at least one dose of the vaccine, irrespective of their HPV baseline status). VE against CIN3+ caused by non-vaccine types reached 62.1% (95% CI, 21.882.9) in the ATP-E cohort (participants who received three doses of the vaccine and were HPV negative at baseline). In all the above cases, the analysis excluded HPV 16/18 co-infection [Wheeler, 2012]. These results are relevant because underpin cross-protection and effectiveness of CERVARIX on advanced lesions and cervical cancer (CIN3+) caused by non-vaccine HPV types [Wheeler, 2012].

## Vaccine effects of CERVARIX on AIS.

Lehtinen and colleagues reported vaccine efficacy against AIS HPV 16/18-related of 100% (95% CI, 15.5-100) in the TVC naïve whereas it was 70% (95% CI, -16.6-94.7) in the TVC. Vaccine efficacy against AIS irrespective of HPV DNA in the lesion in the TVC naïve and TVC, was 100% (95% CI, 31.0100) and 76.9% (95% CI, 16.0-95.8), respectively [Lehtinen, 2012].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other vaccine effects.

The systematic review also identified herd effects of CERVARIX on CIN3 as reported by Palmer et al. (Table 5). These authors investigated the impact of CERVARIX introduction in the NIP in Scotland among unvaccinated cohorts born in 1995 and 1996 (the same age than vaccine-eligible cohorts, 1213 years old), and found a VE against CIN3 estimated at 100% (95% CI, 69-100) compared with unvaccinated women born in 1988-1990. Most likely these effects relate to high vaccine coverage as the vaccine uptake among the 1995 birth cohort (13 years at vaccination) was 90% [Palmer, 2019].

## 2.3.2. Discussion on clinical aspects

Cervical cancer cases are caused by persistent genital high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Most HPV infections clear spontaneously but persistent infection with the oncogenic or high-risk types may cause cancer. Multiple modifiable risk-factors may contribute to the risk of acquiring HPV, including the age at sexual debut and the number of lifetime sexual partners. There is increased biological vulnerability in younger females associated with the cervical transformation zone that is undergoing active metaplastic changes. This, coupled with HPV-naïve immunogenicity and frequent sexual partner changes that are common among 15-24 year olds, makes this age group particularly vulnerable and correlates with observed HPV prevalence. The prevention of cervical neoplasms associated with HPV (especially related to HPV-16 and HPV-18) occurs through prophylactic vaccines, which, although safe and effective, cannot eliminate already established High-Grade Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN 2/3) lesions and have no effect on already established lesions caused by HPV 1 . Prophylactic HPV vaccines do not clear persistent high-risk HPV infection and/or cause regression of pre-cancerous lesions.

Recent systematic review and meta-analysis study results were published with important findings 2 . These demonstrated that the HPV vaccine is more effective when the vaccine series is initiated at younger ages in high-income settings. These data are consistent with data of a recently published meta-analysis 3 . In this meta-analysis 21 observational studies were identified that evaluated HPV vaccine effectiveness against different HPV-related disease outcomes by age at which the vaccine series was either initiated or completed. Seventeen of the 21 studies found the greatest vaccine effectiveness in the youngest age group evaluated with many of those studies also finding decreased vaccine effectiveness by later age at vaccine series initiation. Greater effectiveness of HPV vaccines at younger ages is likely due to administration of these prophylactic vaccines prior to natural exposure to HPV from sexual activity rather than a biologic mechanism independent of natural exposure. Though younger adolescents do produce higher levels of antibodies after vaccination, older adolescents and

adults also have a robust immune response that produces antibody levels much higher than natural infection that likely confers substantial protection.

The HPV vaccine is recommended between ages 9 and 14 years for girls by the World Health Organization. However, many individuals do not initiate the recommended vaccine series in this window, starting vaccination later in adolescence or in young adulthood. Many studies used late adolescence (18-20 years of age) as a cutoff point between different age groups, likely reflecting the average age of sexual debut. While some studies did find that the vaccine was still effective when administered after the age of 18, in general, the vaccine was substantially more effective in those who received the vaccine prior to the age of 18 against all outcomes, reflecting findings from clinical trials that have demonstrated higher efficacy when the vaccine is administered prior to exposure to HPV.

## Context of the study

Long-term efficacy and immunogenicity information is already a part of Cervarix´s label. However, the national immunization programs (NIPs) with universal Cervarix vaccination are being rolled out, observational studies are being conducted and real-world and long-term follow-up of clinical trials data on the long-term effects of Cervarix are accruing and becoming available.

The MAH conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis/meta-regression analysis (critical appraisal of the data to assess its quality, and robustness) with the aim of compiling all published data (including data not generated by the MAH).

## Methods

The objectives of the study was to first conduct a systematic literature review of the long-term efficacy/effectiveness of Cervarix on cervical cancer and CIN3 or worse (CIN3+) and second, to perform a meta-analysis/meta-regression analysis to provide estimates of the effect size of Cervarix on cervical cancer and CIN3 or worse (CIN3+) while adjusting for covariates such as age at vaccination, time since vaccination (time of follow-up), or type of analytical cohort (HPV baseline status), and study design.

The overall research question was

What is the efficacy/effectiveness of the (HPV) vaccination with Cervarix in girls and women against HPV on (CIN3) or worse (CIN3+)?

Six specific research questions were investigated which considered the efficacy, the effectiveness and the combined efficacy/effectiveness of Cervarix on CIN3+ caused by vaccine HPV types and irrespective of HPV types.

To answer the research questions and scenarios, a main analytical step-wise approach considered as first step a classical random effect meta-analysis without adjusting for covariates. The second step was to conduct univariate meta-regression with random effect of each potential covariate and third, followed by multiparametric meta-regressions adjusting for the covariates. Finally, an estimator of prediction error approach was used to assess the quality of the models for every given dataset allowing a data-driven selection of the best model. One model was selected for each of the 6 questions assessed.

Meta-regression analysis allows assessing the relationship between specific study-level covariates, such as age at vaccination or time since vaccination, and the effect size. In particular, it takes into account the heterogeneity of the results that may come from different levels of covariates of the different studies. This meta-regression analysis was not conceived as a confirmatory study. There was not a prior hypothesis to test and therefore it was not necessary to establish a sample size that has sufficient power to reject the null hypothesis.

## Results

## Systematic review results

Nine publications met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies were selected for the quantitative synthesis. Of these, 4 studies were follow-up of RCTs [Lehtinen, 2012;Konno , 2014; Porras , 2020; Shing , 2022] and 3 observational studies of which 2 studies were retrospective population-based registry linked studies [Palmer, 2019; Rebolj, 2022] and one study was an observational post-hoc long-term follow-up of an RCT [Lehtinen, 2017]. Two of the RCTs had also an observational component [Porras , 2020; Shing , 2022]. The studies included in this systematic review were conducted in Japan, Costa Rica, Finland, Scotland, England, and multi-country sites. Around 290 000 participants aged 12 to 25 years at vaccination, and up to 11 years of follow-up were included for the meta-regression analysis.

The risk of bias of the systematic literature review was assessed by Cochrane risk of bias for randomized controlled trails (RoB2) tool and risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. None of the 9 studies mentioned above were excluded based on quality. Based on these results, the MAH decided to conduct meta-regression analyses adjusting for covariates and discussing and acknowledging the limitations of the studies. The covariates considered in metaregression analysis were age at vaccination, time since vaccination, study design, or analytical cohort (Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC, irrespective of HPV baseline status) and Total Vaccinated Cohort naïve (TVC-naïve, HPV-naïve at baseline)).

This systematic literature review suffers from intrinsic limitations mainly concerning the ability to retrieve all available actual data as it was done for publications published up to June 2022. All the observational studies included in this systematic review were considered to have some degree of risk of bias but this is a well-known limitation.

## Meta-analysis results without adjusting for covariates

This meta-analysis/meta-regression analysis included data on Cervarix long-term effects (4 years for RCTs, and 10-11 years for observational studies) against CIN3+ from roughly 290 000 participants aged 12 to 25 years at vaccination. The different pooled vaccine effects estimates (including 95% CI) were obtained by simple meta-analysis. Irrespective of the question, the pooled vaccine effect was large in every scenario (within a range of vaccine effect from 48% [95% CI: 24.5, 64.0] to 78% [95% CI: -123.2, 97.9] - regardless of HPV DNA types.

## Meta-regression analysis with adjusting for covariates

Overall, the meta-regression analysis of each question showed that the vaccine effects decreased with increase in age at first vaccination and was lower in the TVC population (irrespective of HPV baseline status of participants) compared to the TVC naïve (HPV negative at baseline). Vaccine effects were higher in younger age at first vaccination of the participants, in the TVC naïve population (HPV negative at baseline) compared to the TVC (irrespective of the HPV baseline status), and the shorter the time since vaccination (time of follow-up). Results of cervarix´s long-term effects (either from RCTs, or observational studies, or both designs combined) against CIN3+ caused by HPV 16/18 types or by any HPV type were consistent across all the analyses.

Results are consistent with findings from pivotal clinical trials that demonstrated higher efficacy when the vaccine was administered before exposure to HPV. The meta-regression analysis unveiled that age at vaccination was impactful on VE when pooling data from observational studies, irrespective of the HPV type. This was also evident in the population-based studies (Palmer, 2019) where participants vaccinated at 17 years were more than three times as likely to be diagnosed with CIN3+ than those vaccinated at 12-13 years (Odds ratio= 0.55 [95%CI, 0.36-0.83] vs. Odds ratio= 0.14 [95%CI, 0.08-

0.25], respectively).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Further, results from the univariate models for combined effects (RCTs and observational studies) irrespective of HPV type (Analysis 2) showed higher vaccine effects for long-term follow-up observational studies compared to RCTs as most likely these results were driven by the large nationwide population-based studies in the dataset (Palmer, 2019; Rebolj, 2022).

In relation to the limitations of the statistical analysis, the regression performance was determined by the number of studies in the meta-analysis, which in this study was relatively low (9 studies). The power of the statistical analyses was limited mainly due to the small number of studies and their heterogeneity. Consequently, if a covariate is not found to be significant, it cannot be concluded that there is no true effect of that covariate as available data is plausibly insufficient. Hence, the precision of the estimates produced by the meta-regression results is insufficient to conclude on covariates effects. Furthermore, non-linearity for the covariate 'age at first vaccination' was not checked given the small number of observations.

## 3. CONCLUSIONS

This meta-analysis/meta-regression analysis included data on Cervarix effects on CIN3+ from roughly 290 000 participants aged 12 to 25 years at vaccination, followed-up for at least 4 years up to 11 years. Overall, results were consistent across all the analyses including Cervarix´s long-term effects (either from RCTs, or observational studies, or both designs combined) against CIN3+ caused by HPV 16/18 types or by any HPV type. Moreover, the vaccine effects (vaccine efficacy and/or effectiveness) were higher, the younger the age at the first vaccination of the participants, in the TVC-naïve population (HPV negative at baseline) compared to the TVC (irrespective of the HPV baseline status), and the shorter the follow-up (shorter time since vaccination). The evidence generated supports higher efficacy when vaccination is administered at a younger age, and long-term protection against CIN3+ conferred by Cervarix .

The additional data generated with this study via modelling may suffer from several limitations that may impact the robustness of the results. Indeed, the overall number of studies on which the analyses are based is low while the studies are widely different, inducing a strong heterogeneity that may not be entirely controlled by the models. The analysis is also descriptive in nature.

Nevertheless, findings from this systematic review and meta-regression analysis are consistent with clinical trials results which are already captured in the PI, including vaccine efficacy against advanced cervical lesions (i.e., CIN3+). The data generated supports high efficacy when vaccination is administered at a younger age, and long-term protection conferred by Cervarix. These findings do not justify a PI update as they are confirming previous findings which were already mentioned with observed data. SmPC includes wordings that reflect the limitations of vaccine efficacy in older population in 4.4 with cross-references to data description in section 5.1. No changes to the PI for Cervarix are considered necessary.

This analysis studied the combined effects of follow-up studies of RCT ([Lehtinen, 2012], including the TVC naïve and TVC; [Porras, 2020], TVC naïve) and observational studies ([Shing, 2022], TVC; [Rebolj, 2022], TVC) of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by HPV 16/18 types. The rationale behind the selection of studies for this dataset was to include RCTs and observational studies with outcome results on HPV 16/18 types. We excluded Lehtinen, 2017 from this analysis because participants partially overlapped with Lehtinen, 2012 [Lehtinen, 2012; Lehtinen, 2017]. The observational component of Shing, 2022 was included to consider the long-term follow-up of the CVT, although participants partially overlap with those of Porras, 2020, but with a different approach to the analytical cohort. The 'study correlation' variable was used to account for the partial overlapping [Porras, 2020; Shing, 2022].

## 1. Meta-analysis*.

## Pooled vaccine effects were determined at vaccine effect= 76.78 (95%CI, 28.15-92.49) (Figure 2).

*Meta-analysis was done on the log relative risk scale assuming normality. Then results were back transformed to the vaccine effect scale. Therefore, some differences may be found in 95%CI between the pooled vaccine effects provided in the datasets and those estimated in the meta-analysis.

The most remarkable aspect of this meta-analysis was that the lower limit of the 95%CI for some individual vaccine effect estimates are negative. This was the case of the Porras, 2020 study that showed a very wide 95%CI. In case of the Lehtinen, 2012 study, the point estimate for vaccine effect corresponding to the age group 21-25 years at first vaccination (Lehtinen 3), was negative whereas vaccine effect=100% for all age groups in the TVC naïve cohort for this particular study, indicated within-trial variability[Lehtinen, 2012]. Negative lower limits occured only for wide confidence intervals and were not given much weight in the model given their uncertainty and thus, it does not largely contribute to the pooled effect. Therefore, the pooled estimate for vaccine effect of all RCTs and observational studies against CIN3+ caused by HPV 16/18 types was vaccine effect=76.78 (95%CI, 28.15-92.49).

## 2. Univariate meta-regression analysis.

Results from this analysis showed that the variables 'age at first vaccination' (p=0.0086),

'study design' (RCT follow-up vs. observational study, p=0.0011) and 'time since vaccination' (0-4 years vs. 7-11 years, p=0.0011) presented strong association with the outcome vaccine effect (i.e., small p values in the univariate meta-regression analysis model). All estimates suggests that the vaccine effect decreases with age at first vaccination, it is lower in randomized trials compared with observational studies, and it is larger when time since vaccination is '0-4' years (RCTs) compared to '7-11' years (observational studies). vaccine effect is also larger when the analytical cohort is the TVC naïve (participants HPV negative at baseline). Figures below show the observed and the predicted vaccine effect (black line with 95%CI) as a function of the univariate covariates. Size of the bubbles is proportional to the inverse of the variance (corresponds to the weight in classical meta-analysis).

## 7. Multiparametric meta-regression analysis

All possible combinations of predictors were evaluated and compared using AIC (datadriven approach) to find the best model, and which predictors were the most important ones. This data-driven exploration conducted to a final model that includes the 'age at first vaccination' and 'analytical cohort' variables. After adjusting for the analytical cohort (TVC vs. TVC naïve), 'age at first vaccination' resulted as the most impactful variable on the outcome (p=0.0092). It is also interesting to mention that time since vaccination was not selected as one of the two main explanatory factors, which may indicate persistence of the effect of the vaccine over time. The heterogeneity explained by the selected model was R^2*= 62.18%.

The following figure shows the predictions (with 95% Confidence intervals, dotted line) from this datadriven selected model adjusting for 'age at first vaccination' and 'analytical cohort'. Red and green curves represent the predicted vaccine effect as a function of age for TVC and TVC naïve populations. Red and blue bubbles represent the observed Ves of the studies with TVC and TVC naïve population, respectively. Size of the bubbles is proportional to the inverse of the variance (it corresponds to the weight in a classical meta-analysis). Observed values seem to be relatively well approximated by the multiparametric model.

## 9.2.2. Analysis 2: What is the combined overall efficacy/effectiveness of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type? (RCTs and Observational studies combined).

This analysis studied the combined effects of follow-up studies of RCT ([Lehtinen, 2012], including the TVC naïve and TVC; [Konno, 2014], TVC and TVC naïve) and observational studies ([Shing, 2022], TVC; [Palmer, 2019], TVC; [Rebolj 2022], TVC) of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type. The rationale behind the selection of studies for this dataset was to include RCTs and observational studies with outcome results irrespectively of the causing HPV type. We excluded Lehtinen, 2017 of this analysis because participants partially overlapped with Lehtinen, 2012 [Lehtinen, 2012; Lehtinen, 2017]. The observational component of Shing, 2022 was included to consider the long-term follow-up of the CVT, as Porras, 2020 only reports on HPV 16/18 types [Porras, 2020; Shing, 2022].

## 1. Meta-analysis*.

Pooled vaccine effects were determined at vaccine effect= 56.19 (95%CI, 24.76-74.49) (Figure 8).

*Meta-analysis was done on the log relative risk scale assuming normality. Then results were back transformed to the vaccine effect scale. Therefore, some differences may be found in 95%CI between the pooled vaccine effects provided in the datasets and those estimated in the meta-analysis.

## Figure 8 Pooled estimated vaccine effects of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type (Analysis 2)

The most remarkable aspect of this meta-analysis is that the lower limit of the 95%CI for some individual vaccine effect estimates is negative. This is especially relevant for Konno, 2014 (TVC naïve cohort) (Konno 8), as already described in Section 7.8.1 [Konno, 2014]. However, the combined pooled estimate reached statistical significance and the lower limit is above '0' [vaccine effect= 56.19 (95%CI, 24.76-74.49].

## 2. Univariate meta-regression analysis

Results from this analysis showed that the variables 'analytical cohort' (TVC vs. TVC naïve, p=0.0104), 'age at first vaccination' (p&lt;0.001), and 'time since vaccination' (0-4 years vs. 7-11 years, p&lt;0.001), presented strong association with the outcome vaccine effect (small p values in the univariate meta-regression analysis model). All estimates (with exception of 'time since vaccination') suggests that the vaccine effect decreases with age at first vaccination, it is lower in randomized trials compared with observational studies, and it is higher as time since vaccination increases. vaccine effect is also clearly larger when the analytical cohort is the TVC naïve (participants HPV negative at baseline). Figures below show the observed and the predicted vaccine effect (black line with 95%CI) as a function of the univariate covariates. Size of the bubbles is proportional to the inverse of the variance (it corresponds to the weight in a classical meta-analysis).

All possible combinations of predictors were evaluated and compared using AIC (datadriven approach) to find the best model, and which predictors were the most important ones. This data-driven exploration conducted to a final model that includes the 'age at first vaccination' and 'analytical cohort' variables. After adjusting for the analytical cohort (TVC vs. TVC naïve), 'age at first vaccination' resulted as the most impactful variable on the outcome (p&lt;0.001). The heterogeneity explained by the selected model was R^2*= 87.47%.

The following figure shows the predictions (with 95% Confidence intervals, dotted line) from this datadriven selected model adjusting for 'age at first vaccination' and 'analytical cohort'. Red and green curves represent the predicted vaccine effect as a function of age for TVC and TVC naïve populations. Red and blue bubbles represent the observed vaccine effects of the studies with TVC and TVC naïve population, respectively. Size of the bubbles is proportional to the inverse of the variance (it corresponds to the weight in a classical meta-analysis).

## 9.2.3. Analysis 3: What is the efficacy of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by vaccine HPV types? (RCTs only)

This analysis studied the combined effects of follow-up studies of RCT ([Lehtinen, 2012], including the TVC naïve and TVC; [Porras, 2020], TVC naïve; [Shing, 2022], TVC) of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by HPV 16/18 types. The rationale behind the selection of studies for this dataset was to include RCTs with outcome results on HPV 16/18 types. The RCT follow-up component of Shing, 2022 was included to consider the long-term follow-up of the CVT, although participants partially overlap with those of Porras, 2020, but with a different approach to the analytical cohort [Porras, 2020; Shing, 2022] . The 'study correlation' variable was used to account for the partial overlapping.

## 1. Meta-analysis*.

Pooled vaccine efficacy was determined at vaccine efficacy= 47.84% (95%CI, 24.51-63.96) (Figure 14).

*Meta-analysis is done on the log relative risk scale assuming normality. Then results are back transformed to the vaccine effects scale. Therefore, some differences may be found in 95%CI between the pooled vaccine efficacy provided in the datasets and those estimated in the meta-analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Figure 14 Pooled estimated Vaccine efficacy of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by HPV 16/18 types (Analysis 3)

The most remarkable aspect of this meta-analysis is that the lower limit of the 95%CI for some individual vaccine efficacy estimates is negative. This is the case of the Porras 2020 study that shows a very wide 95% CI. In case of the Lehtinen, 2012 study, the point estimate for vaccine efficacy corresponding to the age group 21-25 years at first vaccination (Lehtinen 3), is negative whereas vaccine efficacy=100% for all age groups in the TVC naïve cohort, indicating within-trial variability [Lehtinen, 2012]. Negative lower limits occur only for wide confidence intervals. As wide negative confidence intervals are not given much weight in the model, the corresponding studies do not largely contribute to the pooled effect. Therefore, the pooled estimate for vaccine efficacy of all RCTs against CIN3+ caused by HPV 16/18 types was vaccine efficacy= 47.84 (95%CI, 24.51-63.96).

## 2. Univariate meta-regression analysis

Results from this analysis showed that the variables 'age at first vaccination' (p=0.0136), and 'analytical cohort' (TVC vs. TVC naïve, p=0.0751) presented association (even if weak for the 'analytical cohort' variable) with the outcome vaccine efficacy (small p values in the univariate metaregression analysis model). All estimates suggests that the vaccine efficacy decreases with age at first vaccination and is lower in the TVC population (irrespective of HPV baseline status of participants). Figures below show the observed and the predicted vaccine efficacy (black line with 95%CI) as a function of the univariate covariates. Size of the bubbles is proportional to the inverse of the variance (it corresponds to the weight in a classical meta-analysis).

## 9.2.4. Analysis 4: What is the effectiveness of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by vaccine HPV types? (Observational studies only)

This analysis studied the combined effects of follow-up studies of observational studies ([Shing, 2022], TVC; [Lehtinen, 2017], TVC; [Rebolj, 2022], TVC) of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by HPV 16/18 types. The rationale behind the selection of studies for this dataset was to include observational studies with outcome results on HPV 16/18 types. Shing et al was included (instead of the observational component of Porras, 2020) to align with the other observational studies that used the TVC as analytical cohort.

## Figure 18 Pooled estimated VEs of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by HPV 16/18 types (Analysis 4)

The most remarkable aspect of this meta-analysis is that the lower limit of 95%CI for an  individual VE estimate is negative. This is the case of the Lehtinen 2017 [Lehtinen 2] study that shows a very wide 95%CI [Lehtinen, 2017].

## 2. Univariate meta-regression analysis

Results from this analysis did not detect a strong univariate association between individual covariates and the outcome (VE) probably due to the small number of studies. Figures below show the observed and the predicted VE (black line with 95%CI) as a function of the univariate covariates. Size of the bubbles is proportional to the inverse of the variance (it corresponds to the weight in a classical metaanalysis).

## 3. Multiparametric meta-regression analysis

All possible combinations of predictors were evaluated and compared using AIC (datadriven approach) to find the best model, and which predictors were the most important ones. The analysis revealed that the model including 'age at first vaccination' and 'time since vaccination' showed a strong correlation between the two covariates. When these two covariates are included in the model, it becomes unstable, and the variance of the random effect makes it uninterpretable. Adjusting for covariates for this specific question is not meaningful.

The heterogeneity explained by the selected model was R^2*= 100%. However, this result should be interpreted cautiously as the model was unable to properly estimate the random effect likely because of the small number of studies included in the analysis with respect to the two covariates considered.

The following figure shows the predictions (with 95% Confidence intervals, dotted line) from this datadriven selected model adjusting for 'age at first vaccination' and 'time since vaccination'. Red and green curves represent the predicted VE as a function of age for the time since vaccination. Red and blue bubbles represent the observed VE of the studies with different time since vaccination, respectively. Size of the bubbles is proportional to the inverse of the variance (it corresponds to the weight in a classical meta-analysis).

## 9.2.5. Analysis 5: What is the efficacy of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type? (RCTs only)

This analysis studied the combined effects of follow-up studies of RCT ([Lehtinen, 2012], including the TVC naïve and TVC; [Konno, 2014], TVC and TVC naïve; [Shing, 2022], TVC) of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type. The rationale behind the selection of studies for this dataset was to include RCTs with outcome results irrespective of the HPV types. The RCT follow-up TVC component of Shing, 2022 was included to consider the long-term follow-up of the CVT [Shing, 2022]. Since results from Konno, 2014 for the two analytical cohorts (TVC naïve and TVC) were included, the 'study correlation' variable was used to account for the partial overlapping [Konno, 2014]. Overall, this approach was followed to maximize the amount of information for this analysis.

## Figure 22 Pooled estimated vaccine efficacy of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type (Analysis 5)

The most relevant feature of this Forest plot is that the lower limit of the 95%CI for some individual vaccine efficacy estimates is negative. This is especially relevant for Konno 2014 (TVC naïve cohort) (Konno 8), as already described in Section 7.8.1 [Konno, 2014]. Therefore, due to the strong weight of other studies, the combined pooled estimate reached vaccine efficacy=48.89 (95%CI, 19.84-67.41).

## 2. Univariate meta-regression analysis

Results from this analysis showed that the variables 'age at first vaccination' (p=0.0168), and 'analytical cohort' (TVC vs. TVC naïve, p=0.0172) presented association with the outcome vaccine efficacy (small p values in the univariate meta-regression analysis model). All estimates suggests that the vaccine efficacy decreases with age at first vaccination, and is lower in the TVC population (irrespective of HPV baseline status of participants) compared to the TVC naïve (HPV negative at baseline). Figures below show the observed and the predicted vaccine efficacy (black line with 95%CI) as a function of the univariate covariates. Size of the bubbles is proportional to the inverse of the variance (it corresponds to the weight in a classical meta-analysis).

## 3. Multiparametric meta-regression analysis

All possible combinations of predictors were evaluated and compared using AIC (datadriven approach) to find the best model, and which predictors were the most important ones. This data-driven exploration conducted to a final model that includes the 'age at first vaccination' and 'analytical cohort' variables. After adjusting for the 'analytical cohort', vaccine efficacy decreased with age at first vaccination.

The heterogeneity explained by the selected model was R^2*= 100%. This optimistic value is because the estimated between-trial variability is equal to '0'. Therefore, the interpretation of this result should be prudent. However, as shown in Figure 25, the model is predicting the data very well. The following figure shows the predictions (with 95% Confidence intervals, dotted line) from this data-driven selected model adjusting for 'age at first vaccination' and 'analytical cohort'. Red and green curves represent the predicted vaccine efficacy as a function of age for the time since vaccination.

## 9.2.6. Analysis 6. What is the effectiveness of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type? (Observational studies only)

This analysis studied the combined effects of observational studies ([Shing, 2022], TVC; [Lehtinen, 2017], TVC; [Palmer, 2019], TVC; [Rebolj, 2022], TVC) of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type. The rationale behind the selection of studies for this dataset was to include observational studies with outcome results irrespective of the causing HPV type. The long-term follow-up TVC component of Shing, 2022 was included to consider the long-term follow-up of the CVT. Overall, this approach was followed to maximize the amount of information for this analysis.

## 1. Meta-analysis*.

Pooled VE were determined at VE= 65.45 (95%CI, 42.02-79.41)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

*Meta-analysis is done on the log relative risk scale assuming normality. Then results are back transformed to the VE scale. Therefore, some differences may be found in 95%CI between the pooled VE provided in the datasets and those estimated in the meta-analysis.

## Figure 26 Pooled estimated VEs of CERVARIX on CIN3+ caused by any HPV type (Analysis 6)

The most relevant feature of this Forest plot is that the lower limit of the 95%CI for some individual VE estimates is negative. This is especially relevant for Palmer 8 ([Palmer, 2019], age at first vaccination ≥18 years). As wide confidence intervals are not given much weight in the model the corresponding studies may not largely contribute to the pooled effect. Therefore, due to the strong contribution of large studies such as Palmer (for the younger age groups) and Rebolj [Palmer, 2019; Rebolj, 2022], the combined pooled estimate reached VE=65.45 (95%CI, 42.02-79.41).

## 2. Univariate meta-regression analysis

Results from this analysis showed that the variable 'age at first vaccination' (p=0.0018), presented association with the outcome VE (i.e., small p values in the univariate metaregression model). The estimate is positive, suggesting that the VE decreases as age at first vaccination increases. However, 'time since vaccination' (time of follow-up) is not associated with VE (p=0.9273). Figures below show the observed and the predicted VE (black line with 95%CI) as a function of the univariate covariates. Size of the bubbles is proportional to the inverse of the variance (it corresponds to the weight in a classical meta-analysis).

All possible combinations of predictors were evaluated and compared using AIC (datadriven approach) to find the best model, and which predictors were the most important ones. This data-driven exploration conducted to a final model that includes the 'age at first vaccination' and 'time since vaccination' (time of follow-up) variables. The model fitted the data well and did not present extremely high correlation between variables. After adjusting for the 'time since vaccination', VE decreased with age at first vaccination.

The heterogeneity explained by the selected model was R^2*= 82.59%. The following figure shows the predictions (with 95% Confidence intervals, dotted line) from this data-driven selected model adjusting for 'age at first vaccination' and 'time since vaccination' for two selected values of time. Red and green curves represent the predicted VE as a function of age for the time since vaccination (the '0-2' years of 'time since vaccination' corresponds to the red curve, and the '7-11' years of 'time since vaccination' is depicted by the green curve). Colors of the different bubbles represent the

observed VEs of the studies with different time since vaccination. Size of the bubbles is proportional to the inverse of the variance (it corresponds to the weight in a classical meta-analysis). As observed in the graph VE decreases with age at first vaccination and it is lower among the '7-11' years of followup group. Even if the time of follow-up is shorter in this age group, the '0-2' years of time since vaccination group [Palmer, 2019], represents those vaccinated at older age (≥ 18 years) whereas the '7-11' years of followup group were vaccinated at a younger age (14-17 years).
