## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of Invirase. This scientific discussion has been updated until 1 October 2004. For information on changes after this date please refer to module 8B

## 1. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Composition

Capsules are supplied in amber glass bottle with a polypropylene screw closure, PVC sealing gasket and a polyurethane pad. No desiccant unit is included in the marketed pack.

## Active substance

Saquinavir possesses six chiral centres resulting in 64 possible stereoisomers but only one stereoisomer  is  selected  for  the  formulation  intended  for  marketing.  The  synthesis  of  the  active substance consists of a multi steps process. Following further development during the post-marketing phase, the synthesis has however been simplified to improve the efficiency of the process. The correct stereoisomeric  form  of  saquinavir  is  dependent  on  the  quality  and  chiral  purity  of  the  key intermediates used during the synthesis. The impurities arising from synthesis have been well specified. Product development and finished medicinal product Saquinavir is characterised by low aqueous solubility, low oral bioavailability (approximately 4 %) and bitter taste. The development of the formulation intended for marketing is adequate to deal with these characteristics. Invirase is presented in a hard gelatine capsule containing micronised saquinavir mesylate and standard excipients. Key steps of the manufacturing process (granulation, drying, batch homogeneity and capsule filling) are adequately described and validated and results of batch analysis demonstrate the consistency of the manufacturing process. Capsules are tested according to standard methods. Analytical methods are in general well described and validated. The dissolution limit for the capsules equivalent to 75 % after 45 minutes as proposed by the applicant was considered a tight limit. Stability Medicinal product no longer authorised

Stability results have been submitted. After storage for 12 months in glass bottles, neither physical nor chemical  changes  of  the  capsules  were  observed.  A  provisional  shelf  life  of  2  years  was  therefore acceptable without any special storage conditions. Further results of the on-going stability studies of the three full-scale production batches were submitted. The presented data demonstrated a consistent quality of the product up to the new proposed shelf life of three years. Based on these data, the change to extend the shelf life from 2 to 3 years was therefore acceptable.

## 2. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

The genome of HIV contains the retroviral genes gag and pol, which encode structural proteins, and enzymes, which are essential for the production of mature progeny virions. The protein products of the gag and pol genes are produced initially as precursor polyproteins, which must subsequently undergo post-translational  cleavage,  by  the  virus-encoded  aspartic  proteinase  to  generate  the  respective structural proteins and enzymes. The enzyme responsible for this cleavage is HIV protease, it encoded by the pol gene and released from the precursor polyprotein by autoproteolysis.

Inactivation of the HIV protease by competitive inhibition results in the production of immature, noninfectious HIV particles, thus blocking completion of the viral replication cycle.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  contrast  to  inhibition  of  reverse  transcriptase,  the  inhibition  of  the  activity  of  HIV  protease interferes  with  the  production  of  viral  particles  also  in  chronically-infected  cells  (i.e.  following integration of proviral DNA into host cell DNA).

Saquinavir  is  an  orally  active  peptidomimetic  inhibitor  of  HIV-1  and  HIV-2  aspartyl  proteases. Saquinavir is selective in its affinity for HIV protease and has little inhibitory activity against human aspartyl proteases.

## Pharmacodynamics

## Studies on pharmacodynamic effects with respect to the proposed indication

The in  vitro antiviral  activity  of  saquinavir  was  investigated  in  lymphoblastoid  and  monocytic  cell lines,  and  in  peripheral  blood  lymphocytes  using  mostly  the  p24  assay.  Saquinavir  had  a  potent antiviral activity against both HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains in acutely infected cells and in chronically HIV infected cells using a wide range of in vitro test systems. The mean values for EC50 and EC90 were 3.5 nM (range 0.75-28) for HIV-1 and 10 nM (range 0.3-200) respectively and about twice as high for HIV-2. Saquinavir demonstrated little or no effect on mammalian proteases with IC50 values higher than 10 000 nM against several human proteases. Although saquinavir metabolites, isolated from rat bile, showed a similar potency to the parent compound with regard to enzyme inhibition, the antiviral activity of all metabolites tested was very low.

In  order  to  evaluate  the  potential  for  combination  therapy  with  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors,  a number  of  experiments  were  conducted  to  define  synergy,  antagonism  or  additivity  between saquinavir  and  zidovudine  (ZDV),  zalcitabine  (ddC)  and  didanosine  (ddI).  In  double  or  triple combination  studies  saquinavir  exhibited  an  additive  effect  on in  vitro efficacy  without  enhanced cytotoxicity.

In  the  syncytium  reduction  assay,  the  average  IC90  was  21.5  nM  corresponding  to  a  free  drug concentration  of  0.91  nM,  taking  into  account  high  binding  to  serum  proteins.  Protein  binding  in human plasma was found equivalent to 98 %. An average plasma concentration of 45.6 nM would have therefore to be maintained to give similar free drug concentration (0.91 nM) in vivo . The dosage regimen  600  mg  tid  for  Invirase  gave  a  maximum  plasma  level  of  117.3  nM  and  a  minimum  of 26.1 nM. This indicated that sufficiently high levels of saquinavir can be attained in clinical therapy but also that higher doses would be appropriate to prevent low trough plasma levels. The potential reversibility of antiviral effect was investigated. There was evidence of resumption of viral proteolysis in cells and in virions after drug removal and the time for reversal of effect appeared related to the dose of the initial exposure. Saquinavir's  cytotoxicity  was  low  in  relation  to  its  effective  antiviral  activity.  A  therapeutic  index superior than 1000 has been established in vitro . The potential for HIV cross-resistance between protease inhibitors has not been fully explored.  Crossresistance  between  saquinavir  and  other  protease  inhibitors,  such  as  ritonavir  and  indinavir,  is  not expected to be extensive since mutations may affect protease codons other than those associated with saquinavir,  i.e.  G48V  and  L90M.  No  cross-resistance  between  saquinavir  and  reverse  transcriptase inhibitors was found. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The mechanism of action of saquinavir and its antiviral effect have been demonstrated in vitro .  The absence of in  vivo studies  was  justified  by  the  lack  of  properly  validated  animal  models  of  HIV  in animals.

Studies  intended  to  investigate  potential  secondary  pharmacological  effects revealed  limited effects on the central nervous system of saquinavir when administered orally in mice either as a single dose  or  daily  for  five  days.  No  significant  effects  were  observed  on  the  cardiovascular  system  of conscious or anaesthetised cats neither on the gastrointestinal system. Studies investigating the effect of saquinavir on the immune system and on human platelet aggregation did not show any significant effects. However the low exposure to saquinavir in these studies limited the value of the results.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  saquinavir  was  determined  in  several  species  using  radiolabelledsaquinavir material and adequate methods.

The  absorption  after  administration  of  a  single  oral  dose  of  radiolabelled  saquinavir  in  bile-duct cannulated  rats  was  low  (about  15  %)  with  corresponding  low  oral  bioavailability  (2.5  %).  In  all species studied, the binding of saquinavir to plasma proteins was more than 98 % and appeared to be independent of concentration. Tissue distribution was investigated in rats after a single oral dose of radiolabelled  saquinavir  equivalent  to  10  mg/kg  and  an  intravenous  dose  equivalent  to  1  mg/kg. Organ/plasma ratio after intravenous administration was about 6-8 and strong binding to melanin was evident. Saquinavir crosses the brain-blood barrier to a limited extent and levels in the central nervous system was found less than 10 % of plasma levels. These results suggest that saquinavir may be less active  against  viruses  localised  in  the  brain.  The  potential  passage  of  the  placenta  barrier  was  very low.

The metabolic profile  of  saquinavir  in  rat  bile  and  microsomes  was  very  similar  and  the  metabolic profile in microsomes was comparable across all species studied. Unchanged saquinavir accounted for 20 to 50 % of circulating drug-related material but identification of the metabolites in plasma could not be performed. Metabolites characterised consisted mainly  of  mono-  and  di-hydroxylated derivatives  and  it  was  demonstrated  that  CYP3A4  was  the  major  isoenzyme  responsible  for  the biotransformation of saquinavir.

After parenteral administration in laboratory animals, it was shown that the main elimination pathway was via the bile  and  faeces  (more  than  95  %)  and  in  rats  the  administered  dose  was  almost  totally recovered within 3 days. The renal elimination of saquinavir was negligible.

The pharmacokinetic profile after repeated administration was established based on toxicokinetic data obtained from the toxicology studies in rats, mice and marmosets. In rabbit and rat, the absorption and metabolism appeared saturable at medium to high doses.

## Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

Acute oral toxicity studies were performed in mice, rats and marmosets and results from these studies showed that saquinavir was well tolerated.

## Repeated dose toxicity

Repeated  dose  toxicity  was  studied  in  mice,  rats,  dogs  and  marmosets  up  to  one  year.  In  spite  of plasma  exposure  approximately  7  to  40  times  higher  than  clinical  exposure,  the  toxicity  profile  of saquinavir in animals could not be clearly or consistently identified. The toxicological findings in oral studies  were  mild  and  often  transient,  reversible,  inconsistent  in  nature  and  were  in  general  not accompanied by histological changes.

Functional evidence of hepatotoxicity, increases in serum amino transferases, alkaline phosphatases and  isocitric  dehydrogenase  was  noted  in  rats  and  in  high-dose  groups  of  marmosets  and  dogs.  A potential hepatotoxicity of saquinavir cannot be excluded at high exposure levels.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Saquinavir  was  shown  to  accumulate  in  the  uveal  tract  of  pigmented  rats,  indicative  of  binding  to melanin,  but  the  potential  for  phototoxic  and  photoallergenic  reactions  is  considered  low.  No oculotoxicity was reported in repeated dose toxicity studies.

A  study  was  performed  in  mice  to  evaluate  the  toxicity  profile  of  saquinavir  in  combination  with ZDV. The combination did not affect the characteristic haematological toxicity of ZDV or produce any new unexpected sign of toxicity. The combination of saquinavir and ddC was not investigated.

A special study was carried out in rats aged between 4 days and 9 weeks. After oral administration of saquinavir an increased susceptibility and increased mortality probably due to gastrointestinal changes was  observed.  These  adverse  effects  resulted  probably  from  to  local  irritancy  of  the  compound following  oral  administration  of  suspensions  of  high  concentration  in  the  immature  intestines.  This finding indicates that a risk of intestinal disturbances cannot be excluded if saquinavir is administered to neonates in the clinical setting.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reproduction toxicology

Results obtained from a complete programme of reproductive studies indicated that saquinavir was not associated with any reproductive, teratogenic, or developmental effects in rats and rabbits. Systemic exposure in these studies was 1.5 to 5 times higher than clinical exposure. During the post-marketing surveillance,  congenital  malformations,  birth  defects  and  other  disorders  (without  a  congenital malformation)  have  been  reported  rarely  when  pregnant  women  who  had  received  saquinavir  in combination  with  other  antiretroviral  agents.  The  actual  frequency  of  congenital  defects  possibly related  to  saquinavir  therapy  is  currently  unknown.  Appropriate  wording  has  been  included  in  the product information to recommend the use of saquinavir during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.

The secretion of saquinavir in milk has not been investigated.

The genotoxic potential has been investigated throughout a conventional battery of tests. There was no evidence of mutagenic and clastogenic potential in any of these tests.

Carcinogenicity  studies performed  in  rodents  did  not  evidence  any  carcinogenic  potential  of saquinavir.

## Local tolerance

<!-- image -->

Saquinavir did not induce a delayed type of hypersensitivity reaction in guinea pigs. No skin irritation or corrosion was observed when saquinavir was applied on the intact skin of the rabbit.

## Environmental risk

Data  submitted  to  evaluate  the  potential  risk  of  saquinavir  on  the  environment  suggested  that  no exposure levels of concern to the environment are to be expected.

## 3. Clinical aspects

Cytotoxicity  or  inhibition  of  human  proteinases  occurs  at  concentrations  1000-fold  higher  than concentrations associated with antiviral activity indicating a large therapeutic index.

The effective antiviral concentration in human plasma was determined to be twice as high as the in vitro concentration, taking into account differences in protein binding. At plasma levels over 35 ng/ml the  unbound drug  concentration  is  expected  to  be  higher  than  the  IC50  in  the  syncytium  reduction assay.

## Clinical pharmacology

The  pharmacokinetics  of  saquinavir  have  been  characterised  in  21  studies  involving  363  healthy volunteers  and  5  therapeutic  studies  with  270  HIV-infected  patients.  Plasma  concentration  of saquinavir  was  measured  using  either  a  well-described  and  adequately  validated  radioimmunoassay method or a liquid chromatography method with detection by ultra-violet or by mass spectrometry.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

After single oral administration of saquinavir, the absorption was defined as low, highly variable and greatly affected by food. The absolute bioavailability averaged 4 % for an oral dose equivalent to 600 mg [3,8 % for saquinavir capsule and 4 % for oral suspension: coefficient of variation (CV) 73 %, range: 1 % to 9 %]. The low bioavailability seemed to be related to an incomplete absorption and an extensive first pass metabolism, although the reason has not yet been elucidated. It was observed that in healthy volunteers the extent of absorption is substantially increased by food, with an increase in AUCo-8 from 24 ng.h/ml following a single 600 mg dose under fasting conditions to 384 ng.h/ml when given 2 h after food. An increase of Cmax was also measured from 3 ng/ml to 173 ng/ml respectively. Since the effect of food was shown to persist up to 2 hours, appropriate guidance was introduced to the Summary  of Product Characteristics (SPC). Mechanisms by which food improves the bioavailability of saquinavir have not been clearly defined. There are too limited data to evaluate the impact of diarrhoea on the bioavailability and /or pharmacokinetics of saquinavir. It is therefore not definitely known whether patients with such conditions could receive subtherapeutic levels.

The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous administration of 12 mg dose of saquinavir  was  estimated  to  be  approximately  700  litres  (CV  39  %).  The  erythrocyte/plasma  ratio

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(0.12)  suggested  a  low  penetration  of  saquinavir  into  erythrocytes.  Limited  data  obtained  from  two patients indicated that saquinavir is present in extremely low concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Saquinavir  was  highly  bound  to  plasma  proteins,  approximately  98  %,  which  was  independent  to concentration over the range 15-700 ng/ml. The nature of proteins involved is unknown. Displacement of saquinavir from plasma proteins is unlikely to affect the unbound concentration of saquinavir given its pharmacokinetic properties.

Systemic clearance of saquinavir was found to be high and constant after intravenous doses ranging from 6 to 72 mg. It was estimated to 1.14 l/h/kg (CV 12 %), which is slightly above the hepatic plasma flow. The mean residence time of saquinavir was 7 hours after i.v. administration to 8 volunteers.

The investigation of the metabolism using radioactive saquinavir revealed that the metabolite profiles are similar across species. Based on in vitro studies, saquinavir is rapidly metabolised to a range of mono- and di-hydroxylated via the cytochrome P450 system, mostly by the isoenzyme CYP3A4 (90 %). The metabolites formed seemed to have a very low antiviral activity. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of saquinavir was saturable at concentrations greater than 2 µ g/ml. The route of elimination is extensively hepatobiliary. In a mass balance study, after an oral administration of 600 mg of radioactive saquinavir (n = 8), 88 % and 1 % of the dose was recovered in faeces and urine respectively  within  4  days  of  dosing.  In  an  additional  four  subjects  administered  10.5  mg  of radioactive saquinavir intravenously, 81 % and 3 % of the radioactivity was recovered in faeces and urine respectively, within 4 days of dosing. In mass balance studies, 13 % of circulating saquinavir in plasma  was  present  as  unchanged  drug  after  oral  administration  and  the  remainder  present  as metabolites  compared  to  66  %  after  an  intravenous  administration.  The  large  difference  in  plasma levels of total radioactivity and parent drug after oral administration supported therefore the existence of a high first pass metabolism. After multiple oral administration of saquinavir corresponding to total daily doses ranging from 75 to 1800  mg,  exposure,  as  evaluated  by  AUC  and  Cmax,  increased  in  a  greater  manner  than  dose proportional following increasing doses. This non-linearity may be a result of a saturation of the first pass  metabolism with increasing dose. The steady state area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) following 600 mg tid was approximately 2 to 3 fold (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.6 to 3.8) higher than that observed after a single dose in HIV-infected patients (n = 29). HIV-infected patients (n = 113) administered saquinavir 600 mg tid after a meal, had AUC and Cmax values  which  were  about  twice  those  in  healthy  volunteers  (n  =  6)  receiving  the  same  treatment regimen.  The  mean  AUC-8  (dose  interval)  value  was  757.2  ng.h/ml  (CV  84  %)  in-patient  and 359 ng.h/ml (CV 46 %) healthy volunteers and the mean Cmax value was 253.3 ng/ml (CV 99 %) and 90.39 ng/ml (CV 49 %) respectively. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The dosing regimen 600 mg tid was shown to maintain mean plasma concentrations above the target concentration (based on in vitro IC90 values) for an 8-hour interval and to be well tolerated. However, approximately 30 % of the individual plasma concentration levels fell below the target concentration during  the  8  hours  dosing  interval.  The  intra-  and  interindividual  variability  in  pharmacokinetic parameters  were  very  high  after  oral  dosing.  This  high  degree  of  variability  was  suggested  to  be  a result of a variable absorption and first pass metabolism, and the fact that the drug is administered with food.

The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  saquinavir  was  not  defined  in  children  or  in  patients  older  than  60 years. No significant gender difference has been noticed for saquinavir.

Given  the  limited  role  of  the  kidney  in  the  elimination  of  saquinavir  no  significant  effects  were observed in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. No data in patients with severe renal impairment are available.

In  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  hepatic  impairment,  no  correlation  between  hepatic  function  and exposure  to  saquinavir  was  found  and  therefore  it  is  considered  that  there  is  no  need  for  dose adjustment. However given the lack of data in patients with more severe impairment, caution should be exercised, as increases in saquinavir levels may occur.

Considering the above-mentioned pathway for saquinavir metabolism, the potential pharmacokinetic interactions of saquinavir with drugs, which are either substrates of CYP3A4 isoenzyme or modify its

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

activity, were investigated. In addition, based on publications available during the post-authorisation phase, saquinavir was shown to be in vitro a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), as for other protease inhibitors. The exact clinical consequences of this finding are however unknown.

The main findings were as follows:

## Medicinal products used in the same indication

Co-administration  of  saquinavir  did  not  influence  ZDV  or  zalcitabine  pharmacokinetics  and  vice versa. These antiretrovirals have a different elimination pathway.

Possible interactions with other protease inhibitors have also been considered.

Co-administration of ritonavir, as a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, with saquinavir resulted in greatly increased saquinavir plasma concentrations. Compared to steady-state AUC and Cmax values obtained from 114 patients that received saquinavir 600 mg tid, saquinavir exposures from patients treated with a combination regimen of saquinavir 400 mg bid and ritonavir 400 mg b.i.d increased at least 17-fold and  14-fold  based  on  AUC  and  Cmax,  respectively.  Saquinavir  has  not  been  shown  to  alter  the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir following single or multiple oral doses in healthy volunteers. .

Combination therapy has been investigated with various dose regimens of ritonavir and saquinavir in a variety of studies submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder. The dosing recommendation was mainly  supported  by  data  from  pharmacokinetic  studies  and  the  observed  antiviral  effects  in  HIV infected subjects and healthy volunteers, as well as from clinical safety and efficacy, including results from an ongoing study of the combination of saquinavir/ritonavir 1000/100 mg bid.

In HIV-infected patients, Fortovase or Invirase in combination with ritonavir at doses of 1000/100 mg bid provides saquinavir systemic exposures over a 24-hour period similar to or greater than those achieved with Fortovase 1200 mg tid.  The pharmacokinetics of saquinavir are stable during long-term treatment.

The recommended dose of Invirase and ritonavir is 1000 mg Invirase and 100 mg ritonavir bid. Higher doses of ritonavir have been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of adverse events. Co-administration  of  saquinavir  and  ritonavir  has  led  to  severe  adverse  events,  mainly  diabetic ketoacidosis and liver disorders, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease.

Results from a collaborative study indicated that the co-administration of indinavir (800 mg q8h) and saquinavir  at  the  single  dose  of  600  mg  (hard  gelatine  capsule),  800  mg  or  1200  mg  (soft  gelatine capsule  formulation)  showed  an  approximately  5-fold  increase  in  the  saquinavir  plasma  AUC.  An increase of this magnitude is not expected to influence the safety profile of saquinavir. Currently the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

steady state saquinavir plasma exposures in presence of indinavir are unknown. No dose adjustment of either product is therefore currently recommended.

Results  from  a  collaborative  study  showed  that  the  co-administration  of  nevirapine  with  saquinavir resulted in a mean 24% decrease in the saquinavir AUC (95 % CI, 1-42%). No change in nevirapine exposure at steady state was observed. Although the clinical relevance of this potential interaction is unclear, the co-administration of both products is however contra-indicated.

Concomitant  administration  of  a  single  1200  mg  dose  of  Fortovase  on  the  fourth  day  of  multiple nelfinavir dosing (750 mg tid) to 14 HIV infected patients resulted in saquinavir AUC and Cmax values, which were 392%  and 179%  higher than those seen with saquinavir alone. Concomitant administration of a single 750 mg dose of nelfinavir on the fourth day of multiple Fortovase dosing (1200 mg tid) to the same patients resulted in nelfinavir AUC values which were 18% higher than those seen with nelfinavir alone, while Cmax values remained unchanged. Quadruple therapy, including Fortovase  and  nelfinavir  in  addition  to  two  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  gave  a  more durable  response  (prolongation  of  time  to  virological  relapse)  than  triple  therapy  with  either  single protease inhibitor. The regimens were generally well tolerated. However, concomitant administration of nelfinavir and Fortovase resulted in a moderate increase in the incidence of diarrhoea.

Co-administration  of  ketoconazole  (400  mg once  daily)  and Fortovase (1200  mg  tid)  to  12  healthy volunteers  increased  saquinavir  exposure  at  steady  state  (day  7  of  treatment)  by  190%  and  171%, based  on  AUC0-8  and  Cmax0-8  respectively.  Ketoconazole  exposure  was  essentially  unchanged  (6% decrease in AUC0-8 and 1% increase in Cmax0-8). No dose adjustment is required when the two drugs are co-administered for a limited time at the doses studied.

As part of the post-authorisation data submitted, it was showed that concomitant use of delavirdine (400  mg  tid)  and  saquinavir  (600  mg  tid)  caused  a  4.5  fold  increase  in  plasma  concentrations  of saquinavir, with no increase in the elimination half-life or any changes in the absorption rate. With respect  to  delavirdine,  there  appeared  to  be  a  slight  decrease  in  the  mean  values  of  delavirdine pharmacokinetics.  On  the  basis  of  these  results,  no  dose  adjustment  of  either  drug  is  therefore required. Although no specific interaction studies have been performed, the potential risk of interaction between saquinavir and efavirenz has been considered. Appropriate statements have therefore been added to the Summary of Product Characteristics. Other medicinal products Co-administration of rifampicin 600 mg once daily, which is an inducer of CYP3A4 activity, led to a decrease in plasma concentration of saquinavir of 80 %, which is likely to result in sub-therapeutic concentrations. A qualitatively similar effect is expected with other inducers. Results obtained from the interaction study with rifabutin (300 mg  qd)  revealed a decrease in saquinavir  plasma concentration  of  40  %. Invirase,  when  used  as  the  sole  protease  inhibitor  (without  ritonavir)  in  a combination regimen with other antiretroviral therapy, should not be administered concurrently with rifabutin or rifampicin as co-administration results in significantly reduced plasma concentrations of saquinavir.  Limited  data  support  the  use  of  saquinavir  with  rifampicin  when  co-administered  with ritonavir. Ketoconazole Medicinal product no longer authorised

A similar increase in plasma concentration of saquinavir could occur with other compounds that are inhibitors of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme, such as e.g. fluconazole, itraconazole and miconazole. If those medicines are taken concomitantly with saquinavir, monitoring for saquinavir toxicity is recommended.

## Clarithromycin

Co-administration of clarithromycin (500 mg bid) with saquinavir soft gelatine capsules (1200 mg tid) resulted in a 1.8 fold increase in saquinavir plasma AUC, a 45 % increase in clarithromycin AUC and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

a 24 % decrease in clarithromycin 14-OH metabolite AUC. No dosage adjustments for either drug is required when the two drugs are co-administered at the dosed studied.

## Erythromycin

Concomitant administration of erythromycin (250 mg qd) and Fortovase (1200 mg tid) to 22 HIVinfected patients resulted in steady-state saquinavir AUC and Cmax values which were 99% and 106% higher than those seen with saquinavir alone. No dose adjustment is required when the two drugs are co-administered

## Midazolam

Co-administration of a single oral dose of midazolam (7.5 mg) after 3 or 5 days of Fortovase (1200 mg tid) to 12 healthy volunteers in a double-blind cross-over study, increased midazolam Cmax to 235% and AUC to 514% of control. Saquinavir increased the elimination half-life of oral midazolam from 4.3  to  10.9  hours  and  the  absolute  bioavailability  from  41%  to  90%.  Volunteers  experienced impairment in psychomotor skills and an increase in sedative effects. Consequently the dose of oral midazolam should be greatly reduced when given with saquinavir and the combination should be used with  caution.  When  combined  with  intravenous  midazolam  (0.05  mg/kg),  saquinavir  decreased  the clearance of midazolam by 56% and increased its elimination half-life from 4.1 to 9.5 hours, however, only the subjective feeling to the drug effects was increased. Therefore, bolus doses of intravenous midazolam can be given in combination with Fortovase. During prolonged midazolam infusion, a total dose reduction of 50 % is recommended (see 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use).

Further to the publication of results from a clinical study in healthy volunteers showing a significant reduction of indinavir plasma concentrations when co-administered with St John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ), the CPMP considered that this interaction was also applicable to other protease inhibitors and non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors considering the same metabolism pathway of these substances as indinavir. The interaction seems to involve two different mechanisms: an induction of the metabolism by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 and the P-glycoprotein transporter. Since it may  result  in  the  loss  of  therapeutic  effect  and  development  of  resistance,  it  was  agreed  to contraindicate  the  use  of  St  John's  wort  in  patients  taking  protease  inhibitors  and  non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

Since  the  inhibiting  effect  of  saquinavir  may  lead  to  increase  the  concentrations  of  astemizole  or cisapride, products that have a low therapeutic margin, it was recommended to contra-indicate such co-administrations.  Similarly  co-administration  of  terfenadine  (60  mg  bid)  and  saquinavir  base presented as soft gelatine capsule (1200 mg tid) resulted in a 3.7 fold increase in plasma terfenadine exposures (AUC) and a 1.2 fold increase in AUC of the acid metabolite of terfenadine. The increased levels  of  unmetabolised  terfenadine  were  associated  with  6  %  prolongation  of  QTc  (cardiac repolarisation),  which  is  considered  clinically  relevant.  Therefore  it  was  recommended  to  include terfenadine as a contra-indication. To  reflect  the  results  observed  during  interaction  studies  or  post  marketing  surveillance,  adequate descriptions and warnings have been introduced to the SPC. Grapefruit juice Co-administration  of  600  mg  saquinavir  SGC  and  quadruple  strength  grapefruit  juice  as  single administration  in  healthy  volunteers  results  in  54  %  (95  %  CI;  9-117)  increase  in  exposure  to saquinavir. This increase, which is less than that observed with saquinavir hard capsule is not expected to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended. St John's wort Medicinal product no longer authorised

Likewise, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, which are highly dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism, such as  lovastatin  and  simvastatin,  are  expected  to  have  markedly  increased  plasma concentrations when co-administered with Invirase. Since increased concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may cause myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combination of these medicinal products with Invirase is  not  recommended.  Atorvastatin  is  less  dependent  on  CYP3A4  for  metabolism.  When  used  with Invirase,  the  lowest  possible  dose  of  atorvastatin  should  be  administered.  The  metabolism  of pravastatin  and  fluvastatin  is  not  dependent  on  CYP3A4,  and  interactions  are  not  expected  with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

protease  inhibitors.  If  treatment  with  a  HMG-CoA  reductase  inhibitor  is  indicated,  pravastatin  or fluvastatin is recommended

During the post-marketing phase, a pharmacokinetic interaction study showed that saquinavir as a soft capsule formulation at steady state (1200 mg tid) with sildenafil (single dose 100 mg) resulted in a 140 % increase in sildenafil Cmax and a 210 % increase in sildenafil AUC. On the other hand ritonavir led to an 11-fold increase in the AUC of sildenafil.

Although  specific  studies  have  not  been  performed,  co-administration  with  drugs  that  are  mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. calcium channel blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, amiodarone, quinidine, warfarin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ergot derivatives, carbamazepine, fentanyl, alfentanyl, alprazolam, triazolam, and nefazodone) may  have elevated plasma concentrations  when  coadministered with saquinavir, therefore these combinations should be used with caution.  Appropriate statements have therefore been added to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Racemisation of saquinavir under physiological conditions is extremely unlikely since it would require inversion of the configuration of all stereogenic centres.

The  relationship  between  the  pharmacokinetics  of  saquinavir  and  its  antiviral  activity  has  been investigated with saquinavir monotherapy or in combination. It was shown that the improvement in biological markers (CD4 cell counts and viral load) was correlated with saquinavir exposure at steady state. The  capsules  of  saquinavir  used  during  the  clinical  programme  and  the  capsules  intended  to  be marketed have been shown to be bioequivalent. Viral resistance HIV  isolates  with  reduced  susceptibility  to  saquinavir  have  been  selected  after  extensive in  vitro passage  using  increasing  concentrations  of  the  compound.  Analysis  of  the  protease  amino  acid sequence  in  these  isolates  shows  substitutions  at  positions  48  (glycine  to  valine  =  G48V)  and  90 (leucine to methionine = L90M). The  mechanism  of  mutation  was  adequately  investigated.  Individual  mutations  led  to  a  modest decrease in sensitivity, about 2 to 10 fold, whereas double mutations led to a 20 to 100-fold sensitivity. Phenotypic  and  genotypic  changes  in  HIV  isolates  from  patients  treated  with  saquinavir  either monotherapy or in combination were monitored during phase I/II clinical trials. Phenotypic resistance was defined as a 10-fold decrease in sensitivity (IC50) from baseline. Two viral proteinase mutations, found in treated patients, occurred mostly at codon G48V and/or at codon L90M, which is consistent with preclinical observations. The incidence across studies of phenotypic and genotypic changes in the subgroups  of  patients  studied  for  a  period  of  16-74  weeks,  with  a  median  observation  time approximately of 1 year was low (38 % corresponding to 15 out of 39 patients). . Medicinal product no longer authorised

In one study, 24 clinical isolates containing G48V and/or L90M after therapy with Invirase used as a single protease inhibitor showed a geometric mean reduction of susceptibility (increase in IC50) of 7.3fold relative to baseline virus (range 1.2 to 97-fold). In another study, 32 saquinavir-naïve patients, of whom  26  were  resistant  to  ritonavir  and/or  indinavir,  were  treated  with  Invirase  1000  mg  in combination with ritonavir 100 mg both two times daily, efavirenz and nucleoside analogues. 19/32 were sensitive to saquinavir at baseline. HIV RNA levels below 50 copies /ml were achieved at week 24 for 58% of those patients carrying saquinavir-sensitive virus and for 25% of those carrying virus with reduced ( &gt;10 fold) sensitivity to saquinavir.

Secondary  mutations  (e.g.  L10I/V,  K20R,  M36I/L,  A71T,  V82X)  may  accompany  or  proceed  the primary resistance mutations and give rise to greater reductions in susceptibility to saquinavir.

The  overall  incidence  of  protease  genotypic  resistance  to  saquinavir  observed  in  a  cohort  of  51 antiretroviral naïve subjects after a mean of 46 weeks (range 15 to 50 weeks) treatment with Fortovase 1200 mg tid in combination with 2 NRTIs was 4%.

## Cross- resistance

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cross-resistance  between  saquinavir  and  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors: Cross-resistance  between saquinavir  and  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  is  unlikely  because  of  their  different  enzyme  targets. HIV isolates resistant to zidovudine are sensitive to saquinavir, and conversely, HIV isolates resistant to saquinavir are sensitive to zidovudine.

Cross-resistance to other protease inhibitors: In a study of virus isolates from four clinical trials with Invirase as the sole protease inhibitor, 22 virus isolates were identified as being resistant to saquinavir following  treatment  for  24-147  weeks.  Susceptibility  of  each  isolate  was  assessed  to  indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir and amprenavir. Of the isolates, 6/22 did not show cross-resistance to the other inhibitors, while 4/22 showed broad cross-resistance. The remaining 12/22 retained activity against at least one other protease inhibitor.

Cross-resistance with lopinavir is as yet undetermined in clinical isolates, although laboratory strains with substitutions at residues 10, 84 and 90 or 10, 48, 82 and 90 did not show significant reduction in susceptibility to lopinavir.

Cross-resistance from other protease inhibitors: Subjects with high level resistance to other protease inhibitors  do  not  necessarily  show  cross-resistance  to  saquinavir.  Studies  of  molecular  clones containing resistance mutations associated with ritonavir, nelfinavir or amprenavir showed significant resistance to these individual protease inhibitors, but not in all cases to saquinavir. In a clinical study of individuals pre-treated with indinavir or ritonavir, 81% showed reduced susceptibility to indinavir and 59% to ritonavir at baseline. Of these, 40% showed reduced (&gt;10 fold) susceptibility to saquinavir at baseline. Following 24 weeks of therapy with Invirase 1000 mg in combination with ritonavir 100 mg both two times daily, efavirenz and nucleoside analogues, the median decrease in plasma HIVRNA was 0.9 log 10 copies/ml for patients with phenotypic resistance to saquinavir versus 1.52 log10 copies/ml  for  those  without  resistance  (p=0.03).  The  median  number  of  resistance  mutations  in  the protease gene in individuals with phenotypic resistance to saquinavir was 5.5 (range 4-8), whereas it was  3  (range  0-6)  in  those  sensitive  to  saquinavir  (p=0.0003).  However,  extensive  treatment  of subjects with protease inhibitors after failure can lead to broad cross-resistance in a complex, dynamic process. Hypersusceptibility to mutant virus: Some virus isolates with reduced susceptibility to other protease inhibitors  can  have  enhanced  susceptibility  (hypersusceptibility)  to  inhibition  with  saquinavir,  for example  viruses  containing  the  D30N  substitution  after  nelfinavir  therapy  and  viruses,  carrying complex substitutions patterns including I50V after amprenavir therapy. Many  viruses with substitutions at residue 82, commonly selected by indinavir or ritonavir therapy, either retain, or show enhanced susceptibility to saquinavir. The clinical significance of hypersusceptibility to saquinavir has not been established. Clinical experience Medicinal product no longer authorised

At  the  cut-off  for  the  submission  of  the  dossier,  a  total  of  920  patients  [intention-to-treat  (ITT) analysis]  involved  in  4  major  double  blind,  multicentre,  randomised  phase  I/II  studies (O-13328; V-13329; V-13330 and NV-14255/ACTG229) have been reported. In addition, an interim analysis on changes of the biological markers of one of the two ongoing phase III studies (NV-14256) has been included.

Two of the phase I/II trials were dose-ranging studies, up to a maximum dose equivalent to 600 mg tid in either asymptomatic, ZDV-naive patients (study O-13328) or in patients with advanced infections previously  treated  with  ZDV (study  V-13329) .  Results  from  these  studies  showed  a  better  doseresponse in CD4 cell counts for saquinavir 600 mg tid monotherapy than for other doses tested. The mean change from baseline over 16 weeks (DAVG 16) in CD4 cell counts was 32 cells/mm 3 in naive patients and 18 cell/mm 3 in  ZDV-experienced patients respectively. However, the optimal dose was not determined and the possible benefits of saquinavir in monotherapy were considered very limited due to the lack of antiviral effects as determined by measurements of viral load.

Study V-13330 aimed to investigate the efficacy of combination therapy (saquinavir 75/200/600 mg tid  +  ZDV  200  mg  tid)  in  92  advanced  HIV-infected  ZDV-naive  patients  (CD4  cell  counts = 300 cells/mm 3 ) versus ZDV and saquinavir monotherapy, most of them belonging to CDC class III-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IV. The blinded treatment period of 16 weeks was followed by an extension phase and therefore the median duration of treatment was between 36 and 52 weeks.

The overall results showed that at the dose of 600 mg, saquinavir-ZDV combination achieved better increases in CD4 cell counts and viral load suppression than either of both medicinal products alone.

The  combination  yielded  a  DAVG  16  of  52  cells/mm 3 and  a  decrease  in  plasma  HIV  RNA (-1.1 log 10 copies/ml for DAVG16). The combination resulted also in decrease of other markers such as β 2 microglobulin, p24 antigen.

The  fourth  phase  II  study (NV-14255/ACTG  229) was  designed  to  compare  the  efficacy  and tolerability of triple therapy saquinavir/ZDV/ddC at doses equivalent to 600/200/0.75 mg tid versus saquinavir/ddC and ddC/ZDV at the same regimen. The primary endpoints were changes in plasma HIV RNA as measured by PCR technique and CD4 cell counts.  This  trial  involved  295  advanced HIV-infected, ZDV-experienced patients in the ITT analysis who had CD4 cell counts between 50 and 300 cells/mm 3 . The treatment duration was 24 weeks followed by a double-blind extension for at least 12  weeks  and  170  patients  remained  at  48  weeks  for  assessment  of  plasma  HIV  RNA  by  PCR technique.

The  statistical  analysis  at  the  primary  timepoint  (week  24)  showed  that  the  triple  combination  was significantly  superior  in  increasing  CD4  cell  counts  and  decreasing  viral  load  (as  measured  by peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures which was the protocol defined endpoint) when compared with  the  ZDV/ddC  double  combination.  The  triple  combination  appeared  to  be  superior  to  the saquinavir/ZDV combination only for effect on viral load and approached significance in the pairwise combination for CD4 cell counts.

The efficacy of the triple combination versus the two double combinations was also evaluated on the basis of clinical endpoints. The study was however not designed to assess the statistical differences in AIDS-defining events between the three study arms. Two confirmatory studies, both with 600 mg tid are ongoing to evaluate the long term clinical benefit of treatment with Invirase in combination with zalcitabine and/or zidovudine. The clinical benefit will be assessed in terms of both clinical endpoints (time to first AIDS-defining events and/or death) and improvement in biological markers (viral load and CD4 cell counts). The  first  study (NV14256) involves  ZDV-experienced  patients  (prior  ZDV  therapy  for  at  least 16 weeks) who received either saquinavir/ddC combination or saquinavir or ddC monotherapy during at least 48 weeks. Of the total of 978 patients randomised, 940 were evaluable for the clinical endpoint intent-to-treat analysis (saquinavir/ddC n = 308; saquinavir n = 318 and ddC n = 314). Patients were balanced across the three treatment arms, with respect to baseline viral load, baseline CD4 counts, sex, age, race and reason for discontinuing prior ZDV. The primary endpoint is time to first AIDS defining event (ADE) or death. The analysis of clinical endpoints showed that saquinavir/ddC reduced the risk for a patient of having a ADE or dying by 53 % (p = 0.0002 with logrank test) as compared with ddC monotherapy. For death alone the risk is reduced by 72 %. This corresponded to a reduction in the rate of an ADE or death from 29,4 % to 16 % over 18 months. For death alone, the rate was reduced from 8.6 % to 4.1 % over 18 months. There was no statistically significant difference neither in time to first AIDS defining event or death nor death alone between saquinavir and ddC monotherapies. In the three treatment groups, median treatment duration was 11 to 13 months and median follow-up has been 17 months. Medicinal product no longer authorised

At the cut-off for the submission, an interim analysis on changes in biological markers was performed. Results showed a significant superiority of the combination regimen over monotherapies for both viral load as measured by RNA PCR technique and CD4 cell counts over the first 16 weeks of treatment (refer to the tables below). The response was stable and maintained over the 16-week period.

A subgroup analysis revealed that patients with a baseline CD4 cell count ≥ 100 cells/mm 3 had greater benefit  for  reduction  in  viral  load  compared  to  a  baseline  value  &lt;  100  cells/mm 3 (p  =  0.006).  No influence on the improvement of CD4 cell counts in response to therapy was observed. In both strata the combination therapy was better than either monotherapy.

Final results of the study showed that over 48 weeks the saquinavir + ddC treatment group obtained the  larger  median  decrease  (-0.4  copies  /ml)  compared  to  either  the  saquinavir  treatment  group (-0.1copies/ml)  or  the  ddC  group  (-0.3  copies/ml).  The  median  change  in  CD4  cell  counts  over  48 weeks was + 20.4 cells/mm 3 in the saquinavir + ddC arm compared to -0.4 cells/mm 3 in the saquinavir monotherapy group and -6.2 cells/mm 3 in the ddC group.

Statistical  analyses  were  performed  to  describe  the  relationship  between  the  surrogate  marker responses  and  the  clinical  outcome.  Although  the  study  was  not  primarily  set  up  to  address  the surrogacy  of  biological  markers  viral  load  and  CD4  cell  counts  for  clinical  endpoint  outcome,  the results  merely  indicated  a  positive  correlation  between  the  effects  on  these  biological  markers  and clinical endpoints outcome. The second study SV-14604 was a double blind, randomised study designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy  of  the  triple  combination  saquinavir/ZDV/ddC  versus  ZDV/ddC  and  ZDV/saquinavir  in antiretroviral naive patients (less than 4 months of prior ZDV therapy) with CD4 cell counts between 50-350-cells/ mm 3 . A fourth treatment arm of ZDV monotherapy was discontinued; patients originally on  ZDV  monotherapy  were  switched  to  saquinavir/ZDV/ddC,  constituting  a  delayed  triple  therapy group. Primary endpoint was time to first AIDS defining event (ADE) or death. Of the total of 3591 patients randomised, 3485 were evaluable for the ITT analysis. Median baseline CD4 across the three arms  was  199-204  cells/mm 3 ,  and  median  baseline  HIV  RNA  was  5.0-5.1  log10  copies/ml.  Median duration of study drug treatment was approximately 14 months and the median duration of follow-up for ADE and death approximately 17 months. The absolute numbers of ADE and death in all ITT patients were as follows: ZDV ZDV + ddC N 653 942 Medicinal product no longer authorised

Using different test analysis, results demonstrated a statistically significant advantage in favour of the triple combination over the double combination in reducing the risk for a patient of having an ADE or dying (p = 0.0001).

The  study  was  not  powered  to  detect  a  difference  in  death  alone  as  an  endpoint.  An  exploratory comparison of  initial  saquinavir  +  zidovudine  +  zalcitabine  compared  to  the  delayed  triple  therapy group showed superiority of initial triple therapy including saquinavir with 76 AIDS defining events or  deaths  on  initial  triple  therapy  versus  116  on  the  initial  zidovudine  monotherapy-delayed  triple therapy regimen (p = 0.001).

The secondary objectives of this study included changes in biological markers. With respect to viral load, results showed that over 48 weeks the saquinavir + ddC + ZDV treatment group obtained the larger median decrease in area under the curve minus baseline over 48 weeks (-1.3 log10  copies/ml) compared to either the saquinavir/ZDV treatment group (-0.4 log10 copies/ml) or the ddC/ZDV group (-0.8 log10 copies/ml). Only a small proportion of about 25 % patients had values of viral load under the limit of detection of the PCR assay (400 copies/ml) between weeks 4 and 48. The median change in  CD4  cell  counts  over  48  weeks  was  approximately  +  60  cells/mm 3 in  the  triple  combination treatment arm compared to 25.0 cells/ mm 3 in  the  saquinavir/ZDV group and 24.2 in the ddC/ZDV group. Although in study SV-14604 saquinavir was given only in combination with other drugs, the nature  and  percentages  of  adverse  events  were  well  comparable  to  those  already  known  for  this product. No unknown clinical or toxicity findings related to saquinavir were detected.

The efficacy of saquinavir in combination has not been investigated in paediatric population nor in patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment.

## Safety

The safety profile of saquinavir was established on the basis of results obtained from 574 patients who received saquinavir 600 mg tid alone or in combination with ZDV or ddC.

Appropriate information to inform both health professionals and patients has been introduced in the warning section of the Summaries of Product Characteristics and in the Package Leaflets of all the protease inhibitors agents.

From these studies,  only  one  death  due  to  cardiac  failure  was  considered  to  be  remotely  related  to saquinavir 600 mg tid treatment. The majority of adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal were related to HIV disease or associated infections. In study NV14256, the incidence of withdrawal was higher in the ddC monotherapy group due to buccal ulcerations and peripheral neuropathy (frequent serious events associated to nucleoside analogues) than in the other groups. The  most  common  adverse  events  reported  across  studies  are  related  to  gastrointestinal  disorders including  diarrhoea  (37  %  in  saquinavir  600  mg  monotherapy  and  combination  arms),  abdominal pains and nausea. Central nervous system disorders were also frequently reported, especially headache (20 %). With regard to potential hepatotoxicity, data provided revealed that there is no evidence that the combination saquinavir/ZDV/ddC is associated with an elevation of transaminases when compared respectively with ZDV or ddC monotherapy. The potential hepatotoxicity associated with saquinavir is therefore very low. The majority of adverse events occurring were mild and the addition of saquinavir to ZDV and/or ddC did not seem to enhance the toxicities of the latter agents. Saquinavir appeared therefore to be well tolerated. The updated database includes over 4000 patients and corroborates the initial findings. There  have been reports of increased bleeding  including  spontaneous  skin  haematomas  and hemarthroses in type A and B haemophiliac patients treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than a half of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced if treatment was discontinued. A causal relationship has been suggested  although  the  mechanism  of  action  has  not  been  elucidated.  As  these  reports  involved ritonavir, saquinavir and indinavir, a class-related side-effect has been suggested. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Post-marketing data confirmed that the most frequent adverse events were related the gastro-intestinal system,  the  body  as  a  whole,  the  skin  and  appendages,  metabolic  and  nutritional  disorders  and  the peripheral  and  central  nervous  system.  The  frequency  of  the  reported  adverse  events  was  however amended. The listing of a number of new adverse events not yet reported into the Summary of Product Characteristics (pruritus, myalgia, depression, anxiety, somnolence, hepatitis allergic reaction, abnormal renal function, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and fever) was considered necessary. In addition, liver disorders have been reported when ritonavir is administered with saquinavir.

In cases of mild impairment no initial dosage adjustment is necessary at the recommended dose. The use of Invirase (alone or in combination with ritonavir) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment has  not  been  studied.  In  the  absence  of  such  studies,  caution  should  be  exercised,  as  increases  in saquinavir levels may occur.  There have been reports of exacerbation of chronic liver dysfunction,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

including  portal  hypertension,  in  patients  with  underlying  hepatitis  B  or  C,  cirrhosis  or  other underlying liver abnormalities

Following reports on adverse effects reactions related to new onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or exacerbation of existing diabetes mellitus in patients receiving protease inhibitors, the CPMP agreed that appropriate statement to inform both health professionals and patients had to be included in the relevant section of the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflets of all protease inhibitor agents.

## Events of special interest

Further  to  reports  from  literature  and  product  information  on  the  association  of  protease  inhibitors with  adverse  events  such  as  fat  redistribution  and  other  metabolic  disorders,  additional  information were presented. These confirmed that combination antiretroviral therapy, including regimens containing  a  protease  inhibitor,  was  associated  with  redistribution  of  body  fat  in  some  patients, including loss of peripheral subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump). Protease inhibitors are also associated with metabolic abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia.  The  data  provided  did  not  permit  any  conclusion  about  the  causality.  A  class labelling  wording  was  however  included  into  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  of  all  the protease inhibitors products, and further investigation will be performed to better define this adverse event.

The review of the MAHs' responses has essentially confirmed that co-infected patients and patients with underlying liver disorders are at increased risk for adverse events, essentially confined to liver events.  Overall,  there  is  a  disturbing  lack  of  general  and  product  specific  knowledge  (e.g.  relevant pharmacokinetic data in patients with liver impairment), but there are ongoing activities. For  some  of  the  products  still  undergoing  drug  development,  the  MAHs  have  confirmed  that  coinfected  patients  will  not  be  excluded  from  participation  in  the  studies.  The  CPMP  stressed  that whenever  feasible  a  minimum  number  of  co-infected  patients  should  be  included  in  forthcoming studies in order to provide a reasonable basis for a relevant safety (and efficacy) analysis. Following the review of responses submitted by all MAHs of antiretroviral medicinal products, a class labelling  on  'liver  disease'  has  been  agreed  and  implemented  in  the  product  information  for  all antiretroviral medicinal products.

Increased  CPK,  muscle-related  reactions  (myalgia,  myosis  and  rarely  rhabdomyolysis)  have  been reported with protease inhibitors. Although it was difficult to determine the causality of these reactions due to confounding factors and scanty information, it was nevertheless considered necessary to update the relevant information on muscle-related adverse reactions of the Summary of Product Characteristics and to reflect this effect in the Package Leaflet according to the agreed class labelling. Liver impairment in HIV positive patients Further to the discussions held by the Ad-hoc Group of Experts on Anti-HIV medicinal products in November 2001, the CPMP agreed that liver impairment was of increasing concern in HIV positive patients  both  in  the  form  of  adverse  hepatic  effects  in  patients  with  normal  liver  function  prior  to antiretroviral treatment (ART) and as regards patients with chronic liver disease treated with ART. In January 2002 the CPMP requested the MAH for all authorised anti-retroviral medicinal products to conduct a retrospective review of clinical trials  and  post marketing data relating to the use of their product(s)  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  and/or  HBV/HCV co-infection. Following review of the  submitted responses and discussions held during the CPMP meeting and the Pharmacovigilance Working Party meeting in October 2002, the CPMP adopted a list of questions (including general, product specific and SPC wording recommendations).

## POST-MARKETING STUDIES OF SPECIAL INTEREST

The MaxCmin1 trial was designed as an open-label study to assess whether the two protease inhibitors (PIs)  indinavir  800  mg  twice  daily  and  saquinavir  1000  mg  twice  daily  (both  in  combination  with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ritonavir  100  mg  twice  daily)  have  differences  in  virological  efficacy  and  toxicity  among  HIV-1 infected  adult  patients  with  a  clinical  need  for  a  ritonavir-boosted  PI  treatment.  All  subjects  also received at least two (non) nucleoside reverse transcriptase analogues (NRTIs/NNRTIs).

Enrolled subjects were both protease inhibitor treatment naïve- and experienced. In approximately 6 months, the trial enrolled 317 subjects of which 306 initiated the assigned treatment. Subjects were enrolled from 28 sites in 13 countries in Europe, South and North America. All subjects were followed for the duration of the trial (48 weeks). The median HIV-RNA plasma level was 10,000 copies/ml, and 40% had less than 400 copies/ml at baseline. Nadir CD4+ cell count was 110 10 6 /l (median). Thirty per cent of subjects had had a previous clinical AIDS defining disease.

The primary efficacy analysis, incidence of virological failure, including all subjects that took at least one dose of the study medication (ITT/exposed population), showed no difference between the study two  arms  (hazard  ratio  of  indinavir/ritonavir  versus  saquinavir/ritonavir:  1.0  (95%  confidence intervals:  0.7-1.6).  This  was  also  the  case  in  the  on  treatment  analysis  including  all  subjects  that remained  on  the  study  medication  (1.2  (0.6-2.4)).  In  the  analysis  where  switch  from  the  assigned treatment  was  counted  as  virological  failure  (ITT/e/s  =  failure),  more  failures  were  seen  among subjects  in  the  indinavir/ritonavir  arm  compared  to  the  saquinavir/ritonavir  (1.6  (1.1-2.2)).  This difference was due to more switches from the assigned treatment in the indinavir/ritonavir arm (64/158 (40%) subjects versus 40/148 (27%) subjects in the saquinavir/ritonavir arm, p=0.01)). The primary reason for switch was non-fatal clinical adverse events.

A total of 100 patients developed at least one adverse event of grade 3 and/or 4 - 65/158 (41%) in the indinavir/ritonavir arm versus 35/148 (24%) in the saquinavir/ritonavir arm (p=0.002). In  conclusion,  saquinavir/ritonavir  had  a  more  favourable  toxicity  profile  and  comparable  antiviral effects  to  indinavir/ritonavir  in  the  doses  studied.  More  subjects  in  the  saquinavir/ritonavir  arm remained  virologically  suppressed  on  the  study  drug  at  Week  48  -  probably  because  of  a  better toxicity profile. The MaxCmin2 trial was a phase IV randomised, open label, multi-centre trial, which was designed to assess whether the two protease inhibitors (PIs), lopinavir 400 mg twice daily and saquinavir 1000 mg soft  capsules  twice  daily  (both  in  combination  with  ritonavir  100  mg  twice  daily),  have  equal virological  efficacy  and  toxicity  among  HIV-1  infected  adult  subjects  with  a  clinical  need  for  a ritonavir-boosted  PI  treatment.  All  subjects  also  received  at  least  two  (non)  nucleoside  reverse transcriptase analogues (NRTIs/NNRTIs). Enrolled subjects were both protease inhibitor treatment naïve- and experienced in order to reflect the average outpatient clinic population. In approximately 6 months, the trial enrolled 339 subjects (167 on lopinavir/ritonavir, 172 on saquinavir/ritonavir) of which 324 (163 on lopinavir/ritonavir, 161 on saquinavir/ritonavir)  initiated  the  assigned  treatment.  Subjects  were  enrolled  from  36  sites  in  12 countries in Europe, South and North America. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The intention was that all subjects were followed for the duration of the trial (48 weeks). At baseline the median HIV-RNA plasma level was 4.6 log10 (approximately 40,000) copies/ml, and 21% had less than 400 copies/ml. Median nadir CD4+ cell count was 101 10 6 /l. Thirty-one percent of subjects had a previous clinical AIDS defining disease.  33 % of the study population was antiretroviral treatment naïve, and 48 % of the study population had not previously been exposed to PIs. None of the subjects in the lopinavir/ritonavir arm had been exposed to lopinavir prior to randomisation whereas 16 of the subjects in the saquinavir/ritonavir arm had previously been exposed to saquinavir.

In  the  primary  efficacy  analysis,  incidence  of  virological  failure,  including  all  subjects  that  took  at least one dose of the study medication (ITT/exposed population), fewer failures (29) were observed in the lopinavir/ritonavir arm as compared to saquinavir/ritonavir arm (53 failures; hazard ratio (HR) of lopinavir/ritonavir versus saquinavir/ritonavir: 0.5 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.3-0.8). Comparable findings were made in the analysis where discontinuation (d) of the assigned treatment was counted as virological failure (ITT/e/d = failure; lopinavir/ritonavir: 40 subjects; saquinavir/ritonavir: 63 subjects: HR: 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4-0.9)). In this analysis the better outcome in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lopinavir/ritonavir arm was associated with a reduced risk of discontinuation of the assigned treatment due  to  factors  not  linked  to  antiviral  activity:  The  treatment  was  stopped  by  12  patients  in  the lopinavir/ritonavir arm, but by 24 patients in the saquinavir/ritonavir arm.

In the on treatment analysis including all subjects that remained on the study medication no significant difference  was  observed  between  the  two  study  arms  (HR  0.8  (95  %  CI:  0.5-1.4,  p  =  0.48)).  The proportion  of  subjects  with  HIV-RNA  below  50  copies/ml  at  Week  48  (ITT/e)  was  65%  in  the lopinavir/ritonavir arm and 57% in the saquinavir/ritonavir arm, respectively.

More subjects in the saquinavir/ritonavir arm prematurely discontinued the assigned treatment (30%, lopinavir/ritonavir: 14%, p = 0.001). The primary reasons for premature discontinuation was non-fatal adverse events (lopinavir/ritonavir: 12/163; saquinavir/ritonavir: 21/161 , p=0.09) and subject's choice (lopinavir/ritonavir: 7/163; saquinavir/ritonavir: 8/161). A total of 74 subjects developed at least one adverse  event  of  grade  3  and/or  4  without  difference  between  the  study  arms  -  38/163  in  the lopinavir/ritonavir arm versus 36/161 in the saquinavir/ritonavir arm.

Adjustment  for  protocol  confounders  such  as  subjects  with  and  without  prior  PI  treatment  did  not substantially  alter  the  unadjusted  ratios  for  comparing  the  outcome  in  the  lopinavir/ritonavir  arm relative to the saquinavir/ritonavir arm.

In conclusion, the primary finding of differences in efficacy between the two treatment arms is most likely  not  explained  by  differences  in  intrinsic  potency  or  in  risk  of  severe  toxicity  but  rather  by differences in subjective tolerability and desire to adhere to the assigned treatment. 4. Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment Saquinavir was  the first representative of the protease inhibitors class seeking a marketing authorisation for the treatment of HIV infected patients. Although  additional  information  was  to  be  submitted  with  regard  to  chemical  and  pharmaceutical aspects, the data submitted were acceptable to ensure the quality and the consistency of the capsules. The preclinical efficacy and safety of saquinavir has been adequately investigated and data generated in the studies did not give significant concerns for the clinical use of saquinavir. During  the  review  process  it  was  considered  that,  on  the  basis  of  the  contemporary    efficacy  and safety  data  available,  the  provisional  overall  benefit/risk  ratio  for  Invirase  was  favourable  as combination  therapy.  Consequently,    a  favourable  opinion  for  granting  a  marketing  authorisation under exceptional circumstances was provided  for Invirase capsules 200 mg. The approved indication was the following: Invirase in combination with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adult patients. This opinion was based on the beneficial effect of 600 mg of Invirase administered three times daily in combination therapy with ddC in patients with advanced HIV  disease,  as  measured  by  clinical  endpoints  including  a  decrease  in  mortality  and  disease progression. Moreover, the combination with ZDV in ZDV-naive patients showed a sustained impact on viral load in serum. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The provision of the final reports on the confirmatory trials was part of the specific obligations to be fulfilled by the MAH. On the basis of the data submitted throughout the year, in particularly results from  the  two  clinical  studies  SV-14604  and  NV-14256,  the  clinical  benefit  of  saquinavir,  as  hard gelatine  capsules,  in  combination  therapy  was  confirmed  as  well  as  its  tolerability.  The  effects  of saquinavir on biological markers were rather modest in both trials. The CPMP considered appropriate to include a warning related to the risk of undertreatment with saquinavir in view of the limited and/or variable bioavailability and that saquinavir soft capsules should be used when initiation of saquinavir therapy  is  considered.  Since  the  granting  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  for  Invirase,  new  adverse events  have  been  reported  and  new  pharmacokinetic  interactions  identified.    Overall,  there  was  no indication  that  the  risk/benefit  profile  is  changed  for  saquinavir.      The  proposal  to  amend  the indication  related  to  the  replacement  of  'nucleosides  analogues'  by  'other  antiretroviral  medicinal products'  was  acceptable  since  the  protease  inhibitors  are  not  only  combined  with  nucleoside analogues  but also with other protease inhibitors. Supporting  literature on several  examples concerning saquinavir used in combination with protease inhibitors have been submitted. Further data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

support its use at 1000mg two times daily in combination with ritonavir 100mg two times daily and with other antiretroviral agents.

The approved indication for Invirase 200 mg hard capsules has therefore been changed into:

'Invirase is indicated for treatment of HIV-1 infected adult patients.  Invirase should only be given in combination with ritonavir and other antiretroviral medicinal products..

In  addition,  the  CHMP  considered  that  there  were  no  remaining  grounds  to  keep  the  Marketing Authorisation under exceptional circumstances since all the specific obligations have been fulfilled. Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the benefit/risk profile of Invirase remained favourable in the approved indication.
