## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  for  the  approval  of  Rapamune.  This  scientific discussion has been updated until 1 October 2004. For information on changes after this date, please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Composition

## Oral Solution

The product is formulated as a clear viscous solution of 1 mg/ml sirolimus as active ingredient.  It contains polysorbate 80 as dispersant and Phosal 50 PG as a solubiliser consisting of phosphatidylcholine,  soya-fatty  acids,  ethanol,  mono/diglycerides,  propylene  glycol,  and  ascorbyl palmitate.    Polysorbate  is  derived  from  tallow.    Furthermore,  several  materials  of  animal  origin  are used in the production of the master and/or working cell banks.  The measures to prevent transmission of  TSE  are  sufficient.    It  is  packed  in  either  single-dose  aluminium  laminate  sachets  or  multidose amber  glass  bottles with  dosing  syringe.    The  packaging  materials  comply  with  the  PhEur specification.

## Coated Tablets

The  product  is  approved  in  tablet  form  consisting  of  2  strengths,  1mg  and  2mg.    Rapamune  2  mg coated tablets differs from Rapamune 1 mg coated tablets in that the tablets contain yellow and brown iron oxides (E172) therefore resulting in a different colour to the 1 mg tablets namely yellow to beige compared to white.

The inert tablet cores for both tablet strengths are composed of lactose monohydrate (diluent, PhEur), macrogol 8000 (binder, PhEur), magnesium stearate (lubricant, PhEur), and talc (glidant, PhEur).

The  tablet  coating  for  both  strengths  is  composed  of  several  layers  of  coatings  consisting  of  the Nanodispersion  (sirolimus  and  stabiliser), macrogol  20000  (plasticizer,  in-house  specification), glyceryl  monooleate  (plasticizer,  in-house  specification),  pharmaceutical  glaze  (shellac,  coating agent),  calcium  sulphate  anhydrous  (coating  agent),  microcrystalline  cellulose  (reinforcing  agent, PhEur),  sucrose  (filler,  PhEur),  titanium  dioxide  (colorant,  PhEur),  povidone  (binder,  PhEur), carnauba wax (polishing agent, PhEur) with a red printing ink.  The composition of this proprietary ink  is  presented.    In  addition,  Rapamune  tablets  2mg  contain  iron  oxides  as  colouring  materials  to distinguish them from the 1mg (white) tablets.

The  tablets  are  presented  in  both  PVC/PE/Aclar/foil  blisters  within  cartons  and  two  pack  sizes  are available, 30 &amp; 100.

## Active substance

Sirolimus is  chiral  (15  stereogenic  centres)  but  the  method  of  manufacture  described  in  the  dossier uniformly  produces  a  single  defined  stereoisomer  in  the  solid  state.    However,  in  solution  this interconverts between three isomers: A, B and C.  In solution sirolimus exists primarily as isomer B, which contains an intramolecular hemiketal, forming a six-membered ring. Isomer C also contains an intramolecular hemiketal, but with a neighbouring keto group, and thus forming a seven-membered ring (oxepane).  Isomer A is believed to be the transient intermediate, lacking hemiketal.

Sirolimus is produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus .  For the commercial fermentation a two-tiered cell  bank  system  is  employed.    A  master  cell  bank  (MCB)  of  strain  B-1251  consisting  of  a  spore suspension in glycerol has been prepared and this cell bank is used to generate working cell banks (WCBs).  The MCB is tested for lack of microbial contamination, culture homogeneity and the ability

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to successfully produce a WCB able to give rise to a specified sirolimus production.  The master cell bank  is  stored  at  -60°C.    In  process  controls  consist  of  tests  with  regard  to  identity,  assay,  purity, residual solvents, and water content.

Raw material used during preparation of the sirolimus crude oil has been specified.  The specifications are acceptable.

Five raw materials of animal-derived origin are used in the culture media for either the master cell bank,  the  working  cell  bank  or  in  the  production  of  the  sirolimus  crude  oil.    Gelatine  is  porcinederived.   Casein  and  the  casein  hydrolysate,  NZ-amine  Type  A,  are  Category  IV  materials  with  no detectable  infectivity.    Beef  extract  is  derived  from  bovine  skeletal  muscle,  which  is  considered  a Category IV material with no detectable infectivity.  (Animal material used in the preparation of this product  is  sourced  from  Australia).    Glycerol  (derived  from  tallow  from  animal  from  USA,  Japan, Canada  &amp;  China)  is  used  in  both  the  master  and  working  cell  banks  but  is  not  used  in  the  spore inoculation process.  All bovine-derived raw materials used in the fermentation process are sourced in compliance with Directive 1999/82/EC amending the Note for Guidance for Minimizing the Risk of Transmitting Agents causing Spongiform Encephalopathy via Medicinal Products.

All components and/or the media are sterilised in an autoclave.  All of the sterilising conditions were validated.

The end-point of the fermentation process is sirolimus crude oil.

Further purification techniques result in a crystalline solid, which is the active substance.

The conditions employed in the recovery and purification steps, e.g., solvent extraction, evaporation at high temperature; crystallisation from organic solvents will result in denaturation and degradation of DNA from the production strain.  It is highly unlikely that intact DNA would be carried through these purification steps.  In addition, the S. hygroscopicus production strain is not known to be pathogenic to humans,  animals  or  plants  or  to  contain  plasmids  or  other  potential  gene  transfer  vectors  such  as viruses that confer resistance to known therapeutic antibiotics.

## Active Substance Specification

The  sirolimus  particle  size  was  not  a  concern  for  the  initial  product,  that  is,  the  oral  solution. However, all batches were monitored and routinely milled.

Process impurities are individually controlled in the active ingredient specifications.  In addition, there is a limit for 'Total impurities' and a limit for 'Any single unknown impurity'.

The risk for carrying over of living matter from the fermentation is considered to be negligible.

Since this is a fermentation product, the ICH guideline on impurities in drug substances is formally not applicable.    Nevertheless  the  proposed  specification  limits  have  been  justified  with  reference  to  all batches used in the toxicological studies and in clinical trials.

Results of batch analyses for three batches are reported and the results confirm a consistent quality and in general justify the proposed limits.

Some changes  to  the  specification  and  controls  of  the  active  substance  were  required  for  the  solid dosage form.  At the same time, changes were made to generally update the active substance sections of the dossier. A  separate limit was added to the specification for Group  II impurities (impurities/degradants) as these are observed to increase with storage time of the coated tablets.  The method used is that previously approved for the purity determination.  A test and limits for particle size was included, the limit for the largest single impurity was tightened, and new limits were included for  both  sirolimus  isomer  A  and  total  unknown  impurities.    Three  new  or  revised  methods  were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

presented and these were satisfactorily validated.  Additional batch analyses data were also provided, from more recently produced batches.

## Stability

Formal  stability studies on  three batches of  sirolimus,  which  have  been  stored  at  5°C  and 25°C/60%RH for eighteen months in a package simulating the bulk storage package, were provided. The studies at 5°C will continue.  Studies at higher temperatures (40°C, 40°C/75%RH, 51°C) and in light have also been  performed. The  strength remained  essentially  unchanged  at  5°C  and 25°C/60%RH, but losses were found when exposed to light in flint glass bottles.  These changes are not considered significant for sirolimus stability.

The  stability  data  presented  for  the  active  substance  was  extended  (during  the  application  for  the coated  tablets)  from  that  initially  presented  (for  the  oral  solution  formulation)  by  more  recently produced data, and the claimed retest period was fully justified.

## Other ingredients

## Oral Solution

Nitrogen  and  polysorbate  80  comply  with  the  current  PhEur.    Phosal  50  PG  is  not  described  in  a pharmacopoeia.  It is prepared from propylene glycol, phosphatidylcholine derived from soy lecithin and some additional compounds needed for processing, preservation and stability purposes.

## Coated Tablets

With  the  exception  of  the  macrogol  20  000,  glyceryl  monooleate,  calcium  sulphate  anhydrous, pharmaceutical glaze and the proprietary printing ink, all the excipients comply with the appropriate specifications of the current PhEur. The calcium sulphate anhydrous complies with the current PhEur specification  for  calcium  sulphate  dihydrate  except  for  the  limits  for  water;  hence  the  proposed specification is satisfactory.

Satisfactory  control  specifications  are  provided  for  the  macrogol  20  000  (for  which  the  PhEur specification is not suitable as it is only for a linear chain polymer, which is not suitable for use with this product), glyceryl monooleate and the proprietary printing ink.

A  PhEur  Certificate  of  Suitability  (TSE)  is  provided  for  the  magnesium  stearate  from  the  stated manufacturer.  An assurance is provided that the lactose is TSE-free and that all other substances in the coated tablet formulation are not of animal origin.

Solvents such as methanol which are used during the manufacture of the product, for example, for the preparation  of  the  tablet  polish  suspension,  for  the  preparation  of  the  shellac  seal  coating  and  for preparation of the printing ink solution, have all been demonstrated to be removed during processing, resulting  in  no  detectable  levels  in  the  finished  product.    Suitable  specifications  have  also  been provided.

The  containers  selected  for  the  coated  tablets  are  (PVC/PE/Aclar)  film/aluminium  foil  blisters  and adequate details have been provided of their specifications.

## Product development and finished products

## Oral Solution

The development pharmaceutics have been addressed satisfactorily.  The use of a non-aqueous vehicle eliminates  major  concerns  with  regard  to  the  solid-state  properties  of  the  drug  substance,  such  as potential for polymorphic forms, particle size, surface area and intrinsic dissolution rate.  Phosal 50

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PG,  a  propylene  glycol-based  vehicle  containing  phosphatidylcholine,  was  chosen  as  the  major vehicle.  Polysorbate 80 was included to enhance the solubility upon dilution.

No antimicrobial preservative was required since it was determined that the active drug solution was self-preserving and passed the PhEur test for efficacy of antimicrobial preservative.

The  clinical  trials  for  sirolimus  oral  solution  were  conducted  with  1  mg/ml  (proposed  commercial formulation),  2.5  mg/ml,  5  mg/ml  and  10  mg/ml  oral  solutions,  6  mg/ml  and  50  mg/ml  injection concentrates, and several solid dosage forms.  However, the intended sirolimus oral solution market formulation (1 mg/ml) is quantitatively identical to the formulation used in Phase III studies.

The  manufacturing  process  basically  consists  of  dissolving  the  ingredients,  whilst  stirring  under nitrogen.

Validation  data  generated  from  three  production  batches  provided  show  that  all  batches  met  the acceptance criteria, demonstrating that each manufacturing stage can be reproducibly carried out.

## Coated Tablets

In  order  to  facilitate  dosing  and  patient  compliance,  different  approaches  to  finding  a  stable  solid dosage form of sirolimus were investigated.  In order to improve the stability and bioavailability of the coated  tablet,  the  active  substance,  sirolimus,  has  been  incorporated  in  a  NanoCrystal  Colloidal Dispersion (Nanodispersion) in which the drug particle size is reduced to nanometer dimensions in the presence of a stabiliser (poloxamer 188).  The Nanodispersion containing sirolimus and the stabiliser is  added  to  a  sugar  coating  suspension,  used  to  coat  inert  tablet  cores  previously  overcoated  with shellac  and  inert  filler  coats.  The  last  coat  is  the  colour  coat.  The  specification  proposed  for  the Nanodispersion is considered adequate to control the relevant physico-chemical characteristics. Batch analyses data are also provided.

Initially three different tablet strengths were developed (1 mg, 2 mg and 5 mg). The 2 mg tablets were not registered as the same time as the 1 mg tablets, but they were later proposed for marketing in order to reduce the pill burden and aid patient compliance and convenience. (Proprietary formulation information - should not be included)

The inert tablet cores were prepared by a direct compression manufacturing process typical for this type of product.  Then two different coating layers were applied, a shellac seal coating and a filling suspension coating. The manufacturing process of the 2 mg strength is almost identical to the process for the 1 mg strength apart from the thin sugar seal introduced between the colour and the active coat.

For the 1 mg strength, the change from the initially oval shaped tablet to the final triangular shape was supported  by  extensive  dissolution  data  obtained  from  physiologically  relevant,  discriminatory dissolution conditions from pre-change and post-change batches.  Equivalence between the oval and triangular shapes, to a high level of statistical confidence, was shown.  Additionally an in vivo/in vitro correlation (IVIVC) study provides some support for equivalence between the batches used in clinical trials (oval-shaped) and the batches proposed for marketing (triangular-shaped).

Satisfactory process validation data have been provided.

## Finished product specifications

## Oral Solution

The finished product specifications include tests for identity (TLC), assay (HPLC) (sum of isomers B and  C),  seco-rapamycin  (HPLC),  purity  (total  other  degradation  impurities,  largest  single  other degradation impurity), peroxide value, deliverable volume for sachets, deliverable volume for bottles, moisture  (KF),  total  aerobic  count  including  yeast  and  mould,  presence  of E.  coli ,  presence  of Salmonella species, and presence of P. aeruginosa .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The purity specification for the active substance limits the amount of related impurities in the finished product.  All the methods applied to this product are reasonable, sensitive, accurate, and validated.

On-going  stability  studies  of  both  clinical  and  registration  lots  show  seco-rapamycin  (seco)  is  the major degradation product.  The specification limit for this impurity is supported for safety studies. Regarding the level of unknown impurities in toxicological/clinical studies data from repeated-dose toxicity  studies,  which  support  the  proposed  limit  for  largest  single  unknown  impurity,  have  been included.

Satisfactory certificates of analysis have been provided for three batches of the finished product.

## Coated Tablets

The  finished  product  specifications  are  comprehensive  and  include  justified  tests  and  limits  for identity (active substance and colorant), content uniformity, microbial contamination, assay, impurities (specified, unidentified single, and total impurities) and moisture content. The dissolution specification includes limits at 30 minutes and 120 minutes, and these have been justified.  The lack of a test for residual solvents has been justified.

All the methods have been adequately validated.

Batch analyses data have been provided for seven batches both tablet strengths and these demonstrate consistency of manufacture and compliance with the proposed specifications.

## Stability of the products

## Oral Solution

Stability  studies  were  conducted  on  three  commercial  sized  batches  for  up  to  18  months  at  5°C, 15°C/60%RH and 25°C/60% RH.  The packaging systems used for these batches were 2-oz (60 ml) and 5-oz (150 ml) amber glass bottles with child-resistant caps and 1, 2 and 5 ml polyester/low density polyethylene aluminium foil laminate sachets (pouches), all with nitrogen headspaces.

Testing was performed periodically for up to eighteen months at 5°C, twelve months at 15°C/60%RH and six months at 25°C/60%RH.

Batches were tested for physical appearance and description, strength, degradation products, identity, deliverable  volume,  peroxide  value,  ethanol  content,  moisture,  microbial  limit  and  antimicrobial effectiveness.  Stability on exposure to light, freeze/thaw cycling and under the simulated conditions of use were also determined.

At 5°C total sirolimus content decreased, but all samples were within specifications. At 15°C/60%RH, the intermediate accelerated storage condition, samples were still within specifications, but the loss of sirolimus content was greater.  At 25°C/60%RH (primary accelerated conditions), the decrease in active substance content was more pronounced, with one sample below the specification limit  at  six  months.    All  results  for  the  simulated  use,  photostability  and  freeze/thaw  tests,  in  the proposed packaging for marketing, were satisfactory.  These results support a shelf life of 18 months at 5°C.

## Coated Tablets

## 1 mg coated tablets

The major stability studies were performed on four batches of the triangular shaped tablets, packed in both 40 ml HDPE bottles with child-resistant caps (used only for development studies - the bottles will not be marketed at this time) and PVC/PE/Aclar/foil blisters.  18 months data are provided for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tablets stored at 25°C/60%RH although the studies will continue up to 36 months.  The tablets have also been stored for 12 months at 30°C/60%RH and for 6 months at 40°C/75%RH, respectively. Photostability studies under ICH option 2 light conditions and room light have also been performed on batches packed as above.

Generally,  all  results  for  the  triangular  tablets  comply  with  the  specifications,  independent  of  the storage  conditions  and  time.    Exposure  of  tablets  to  ICH  option  2  light  conditions  or  room  light resulted in little or no change in the Group II degradant levels.  However, with increasing temperature an increase in Group II degradant levels was observed.  The product information therefore carries a recommendation to 'Keep the blister in the outer carton'.

Supportive  stability  data  are  provided  for  three  batches  (of  the  same  composition)  but  where  the tablets  were  oval  shaped.    Since  the  difference  in  size  and  exposed  area  between  the  oval  and triangular tablets is negligible, these results strongly support the previous results.  From representative batches, 24 months data are available at 25°C/60%RH and these studies will continue for 36 months. 12 months data at 30°C/60%RH and 6 months data at 40°C/75%RH are also available. Also the results for oval shaped tablets comply with the specifications, independent of storage conditions and time.

The limited number of stability studies on commercial scale batches does not yet provide sufficient data  on  which  to  tighten  the  shelf-life  specification  for  sirolimus  content.    However,  when  further commercial  scale  batch  data  become  available  the  data  will  be  re-examined  and  the  shelf-life specification tightened or justified.

In  conclusion,  the  stability  studies  submitted  supported  a  shelf  life  of  18  months  for  the  triangular tablets, independent of storage conditions. The absence of a temperature-specific storage recommendation is therefore justified.

## 2 mg coated tablets

23  months  stability  data  were  provided  for  one  production  scale  batch  and  two  pilot  scale  batches under long-term study (25C/60% H.R). Accelerated stability studies were performed at 40C/75% H.R over  6  months  duration.  Additional  long-term  stability  studies  were  conducted  at  the  intermediate condition  of  30C/70% H.R. over a 18 months duration. A photostability study was also performed. The methods used for drug product stability have been validated, and shown to be stability indicating. The results presented support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions defined in the SPC.

## 2. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

## Pharmacodynamics

## Pharmacodynamic effects related to the proposed indication

Sirolimus was initially identified as an antifungal agent. Further pharmacological evaluation revealed its immunosuppressive activity in a rat model of T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Additional in vitro and in  vivo pharmacology studies demonstrated that  sirolimus is an immunosuppressive agent that  inhibits  lymphocyte  proliferation  and  prevents  allograft  rejection  in  animal  models  of  organ transplantation.

The macrocyclic immunosuppressive agents, including sirolimus, tacrolimus, and CsA bind to specific cytosolic  proteins  called  immunophilins  to  gain  their  immunosuppressive  activity.  The  complex  of tacrolimus or CsA with their respective immunophilins inhibits calcineurin, a phosphatase required for the production of cytokines and early activation of T cells (G0 to G1). Although sirolimus binds to the same immunophilin as tacrolimus, the sirolimus:immunophilin complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. Rather, this complex binds to a specific cell cycle regulatory protein called the m ammalian t arget o f r apamycin  (mTOR)  and  inhibits  its  activation.  It  is  likely  that  phosphorylation  mediated activation of one or more phosphatases or kinases by mTOR is the first step in the cascade of events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that are affected by sirolimus. The inhibition of mTOR supresses cytokine-induced cell proliferation, inhibiting the progression from G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle.

## In vitro studies

Sirolimus inhibits cell proliferation induced by specific stimuli including cytokines and growth factors and non-specific stimuli such as lectins and phorbol ester. This effect is observed in T cells, B cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, keratinocytes, and tumor cells.

## In vivo studies

Sirolimus prolongs graft survival in different models of transplantation (mouse, rat, dog, rabbit, pig, primates),  and  for  heterotopic  and  orthotopic  organ  grafting  given  orally  and/or  intravenously. Additional  studies  have  demonstrated  the  efficacy  of  sirolimus  in  preventing  the  rejection  of  skin grafts, islet cells, and bone marrow in the mouse.

The efficacy of two different tablet formulations (spray-dried powder and NanoSystems dispersions) were compared with that of the oral liquid formulation (all given at 1.5 mg/Kg/day for 14 days) in a heterotopic heart transplant model in male rats. Controls were either untreated or given phosal-based liquid formulation. There was no difference among sirolimus-treated groups as regards mean survival time  of  allografts,  which  was  30.5 ± 3.7  days,  30.5 ± 2.4  days,  and  28.7 ± 2.6  in  animals  treated  with spray-dried powder, NanoSystems and oral liquid formulation, respectively, as compared with 6.3 ± 0.5 days in controls.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

The  majority  of in  vitro and in  vivo studies  indicate  that , sirolimus  and  CsA  act  synergistically  to inhibit T cell responses to different stimuli.

## General and safety pharmacology programme

Studies in rats, mice and guinea pigs did not indicate any major effects of sirolimus on the CNS, the cardiovascular or respiratory system.

In contrast to the structurally related tacrolimus and CsA, renal effects seem to be significantly less marked  with  sirolimus.  These  observations  are  in  line  with  the  fact  that  nephrotoxic  effects  of tacrolimus and CsA have been suggested to involve inhibition of calcineurin, and sirolimus does not seen to interact with calcineurin. However, combination toxicity studies of sirolimus in conjunction with CsA resulted in a potentiation of CsA-induced nephrotoxic effects in rats. It is not clear whether this is a consequence of the increased blood levels of CsA due to the combination.

The  nephrotoxic  effects  of  CsA  have  been  suggested  to  include  effects  in  vasodilatory  and vasoconstrictor  substances.  The  effect  of  sirolimus  and  tacrolimus  on  prostacyclin  and  endothelin release  was  determined  in  cultured  rabbit  mesangial  and  endothelial  cells.  Sirolimus  significantly increased  release  of  prostacyclin  (PGI2)  and  endothelin  in  TGFβ treated  endothelial  cells  while tacrolimus caused a decrease in PGI2, but an increase in endothelin. Both sirolimus and tacrolimus have the capacity to affect release of vasoactive substances in vitro.

## Haematological effects

Human  platelet  aggregation  induced  by  Ca 2+ -dependent  and  Ca 2+ -independent  pathways  were  not affected  by  sirolimus  or  tacrolimus  at  concentrations  up  to  100  nM.  Mitochondrial  respiration  and induced swelling was not affected, while 10 µ M CsA partially inhibited respiration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other effects

Sirolimus has no antibacterial effects. Neither sirolimus nor CsA  reactivated latent murine cytomegalovirus  infection;  the  ability  of  the  host  to  control  active,  replicating  virus  was,  though, impaired.

In a receptor binding study sirolimus showed no activity in most assays, but histamine I binding was inhibited with IC50 values of 100-500 nM.

Sirolimus inhibited cell proliferation in several models in vivo and in vitro and was active in various models of acute and chronic inflammation (e.g. arthritis, uveoretinitis, encephalomyelitis, myocarditis, carrageenan oedema) in the rat.

## Pharmacokinetics

## Studies performed

Pharmacokinetic  studies  of  sirolimus  have  been  done  primarily  in  mice,  rats  and  cynomolgus monkeys, these being the species used in the toxicity studies. The concentrations of sirolimus were determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatographic or liquid chromatographic/tandem spectrometric methods. In some studies radiolabelled sirolimus was employed.

## Linearity

After repeated oral dosing of sirolimus, exposure to the drug was generally comparable to that after a single  dose.  In  rats  receiving  repeated  sirolimus,  for  a  seven-day  dosing  period  there  was  only  a modest increase (34%) in sirolimus exposure compared to a single dose.

## Pharmacokinetic characteristics

The main pharmacokinetic characteristics are given in Table 1.

Table 1: Animal pharmacokinetic data

| Absorption                        | Low oral bioavailability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Presystemic metabolism            | Studies in rats have indicated that limited absorption from the gut and first-pass hepatic and extra-hepatic oxidation and degradation play a role in limiting the bioavailability of oral sirolimus.                                                                                      |
| Distribution                      | Uptake into blood. High protein binding. High volume of distribution. Tissues that accumulated radioactivity after IV [ 14 C]-sirolimus were the gastrointestinal tract (due to biliary excretion of metabolites), liver, lungs, pancreas, brain, lymph nodes, testes and urinary bladder. |

## Transferability of compound across the placenta and distribution into milk

Following  administration  of  radiolabelled  sirolimus,  radioactivity  crosses  the  placental  barrier  and distributes into the amniotic fluid and foetal tissues with relatively slow elimination of radioactivity from  these  tissues,  suggested  that  accumulation  might  occur  with  repeated  dosing.  Radioactivity  is also excreted in the milk of lactating rats.

Rapamune  should  not  be  used  during  pregnancy.  Breast-feeding  should  be  discontinued  during therapy .

## Drug interactions

Ketoconazole, nicardipine and CsA, inhibitors of CYP3A4, inhibited sirolimus metabolism in human liver microsomes.

The bioavailability of sirolimus is increased by a factor 2-11 and the bioavailability of CsA by a factor 2-3  when  both  compounds  are  administered  together.  Combination  toxicity  studies  in  rats  with sirolimus  and  CsA  also  indicated  potentiated  toxicity  that  is  in  line  with  exposure  increasing  in combination.

## Systemic exposure in animals

Exposure to sirolimus in patients is generally higher than in animals.

## Bioequivalence

The  bioavailability  of  various  oral  formulations  of  Rapamune  was  evaluated  in  a  non-randomised crossover study in six male cynomolgus monkeys at doses from 0.25 to 1 mg/kg. The formulations tested  were  the  liquid  formulation,  the  spray-dried  tablet  formulations  and  the  Nanosystems  (an intermediate developed for processing into tablet formulations).

The absolute bioavailability of the drug from all oral formulations was determined by comparing their respective (dose-normalised) area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC) to the AUC from an intravenous dose of 0.025 mg/kg.  The relative rates of absorption from the oral formulations were determined  by  comparing  maximum  concentrations  (C max )  and  the  time  of  its  occurrence  (t max ). Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics by formulations on AUC, C max   and t max  and on the extent of absorption (absolute bioavailability). Analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of differences in absolute bioavailability between the oral formulations. Blood samples were analysed by LC/MS at TexMS, Houston.

The absolute bioavailability of the clinical oral liquid formulation (2.1%) was consistent with that seen in previous studies in monkeys (2.4%) (GTR-24235). However, it gave lower bioavailability than the solid  oral  formulations  and  the  Nanosystem  dispersions. Two of the solid oral formulations yielded bioavailability around 6% and the remainder, including the three strengths of the Nanosystems tablets (1,  2  and  5  mg),  gave  values  in  the  range  of  10-15%  as  evidenced  by  the  late  t max  values,  which ranged from 6 to 11 h.

The rate and extent of Rapamune Nanodispersion tablets manufactured from two different particle size dispersions  were  evaluated  in  a  further  study  in  six  male  cynomolgus  monkeys.    Each  monkey received a single oral dose of 3 x 1 mg tablets according to a randomised two-period, two-treatment crossover design. The relative bioavailability of the drug for the two tablets with different particle size dispersions  was  assessed  by  comparing  the  blood  AUC 0-24 ,  C max and  t max .  Differences  in pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  the  two  lots  were  less  than  20%,  indicating  that  both  particle  size dispersions were bioequivalent in the monkey (GTR-37178).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  study  in  monkey  indicated  that  the  tablet  formulation  could  enhance  bioavailability  compared with the liquid formulation. This observation does not seem relevant to the human situation as such a difference was not noted in renal transplant patients.

## Toxicology

The  toxicity  of  sirolimus  has  been  characterised  in  studies  up  to  one  year,  in  mouse,  rat,  dog  and monkey. In general, mice tolerated higher doses than other species. Overall exposure to the different intermediates seemed to be covered in the species used in toxicology studies.  There were no obvious specifics indicating a particular relevance of one species.

A developmental toxicity study in rats indicated an increased risk to foetal development (mortality, curved/kinked tail) of the combination sirolimus and cyclosporine, and embryotoxicity seemed thus enhanced in comparison with sirolimus alone.

A 28-day repeated dose toxicity study in rats with Group II impurities at levels from 0.4 to 11%, was conducted. Group II impurities consisted of multiple oxidation/hydrolysis degradation products found at relative retention times from 0.0 to 0.6 and which could not be resolved because of &gt;100 different impurities.  There  were  no  relevant  differences  in  the  toxicological  profile  between  0.4  and  11% impurities. Further, Group II and other relevant impurities have been present in batches used in earlier studies, including studies on genotoxicity .

## Single dose toxicity

Sirolimus  had  low  acute  toxicity  in  mouse  and  rat.  In  rats,  single  oral  doses  did  not  significantly influence CNS,  cardiovascular, respiratory or gastrointestinal function, but effects were  only monitored for a short time period in some studies.

## Repeated dose toxicity

## Introduction

Toxicity studies with sirolimus were conducted in mice, rats (up to 1 year), dogs and monkeys (1-6 month studies).  A  wide  range  of  toxic  responses,  in  a  few  cases  partially  reversible,  was  recorded. Effects  such  as  increases  in  red  cell  blood  parameters  and  decreases  in  lymphocytes  and  platelets seemed  primarily  related to haemoconcentration  secondarily  to a diabetogenic state and  the immunosuppressant  activity.  Prominent  changes  in  clinical  chemistry  included  increases  in  glucose (males), triglycerides (females) and fibrinogen levels. The toxicity of sirolimus according to organs affected is outlined below. Generally no relevant margins of exposure relative to the expected clinical exposure could be identified. However, the toxicity to become first manifest was usually directed at reproductive  organs  (atrophy),  heart  (myocardial  degeneration),  pancreas  (islet  cell  vacuolation), spleen,  thymus,  lymph  nodes  (atrophy),  gastrointestinal  tract  (diarrhoea,  colitis,  typhlitis),  lungs (phospholipidosis) and eyes (cataracts). At higher doses involvement of skin (ulcers), bone (fractures) and liver (haematopoiesis) became apparent.

## Pancreas

Islet cell vacuolation was seen in rats and associated posterior polar cataracts; increased food intake and  decreased  body  weights  were  noted.  Effects  were  also  accompanied  by  changes  in  clinical chemistry  parameters  consistent  with  an  uncontrolled  diabetic  state  and  males  seemed  particularly sensitive.  There  are  reports  that  tacrolimus  and  CsA  also  affect  pancreatic  function  although apparently  cataracts  were  not  evident  in  those  studies.  Effects  of  sirolimus  on  the  pancreas  were considered as primary effects and morphological changes were reported in rat studies, only. Glucose levels were increased in female monkeys given intravenous doses; however, there were no pancreatic lesions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Heart

Myocardial  degeneration  was  observed  in  rat  studies.  In  rats,  the  finding  was  ascribed  to  an exacerbation of a spontaneous lesion related to endogenous orphan parvovirus. This was supported by results  from  special  toxicity  studies.  Overall,  males  seemed  more  sensitive  although  this  was  not coupled to differences in systemic exposures.  CsA and tacrolimus have also been reported to induce myocardial  degeneration.  Cardiotoxicity  with  sirolimus  was  noted  in  dogs  in  1-month  intravaginal studies. Effects included ECG changes. In the dog, cardiac toxicity was considered secondary to acute necrotising fibrinoid vasculitis. Inconsistent findings of cardiotoxicity have also been reported in mice.

## Reproductive organs

In  male  rats  testicular  tubular  atrophy  and  giant  cells  in  tubules  were  reported  in  intravenous  oral studies.  Similar  changes  were  found  in  mouse  studies  at  oral  doses  of  5  mg/kg  and  also,  less consistently, in the monkey. Some reports also suggest that tacrolimus has adverse effects on testes function and morphology. Priapism in rat studies with sirolimus was considered a non-specific effect. The  effects  on  male  reproductive  organs per  se are  unlikely  to  constitute  a  clinical  safety  concern during treatment, but in as much a decrease in testosterone levels may be involved, depressed hormone levels may result in an increased risk for secondary adverse effects.

## Thymus, spleen, lymph nodes

Lymphoid  atrophy  and  decreases  of  lymphocyte  numbers  in  mouse,  rat,  dog  and  monkey  were observed as expected for the mechanism of action.

## Gastrointestinal tract

Acute gastritis was reported in a 3-month rat study and diarrhoea was occasionally evident in rat as well  as  mouse  studies.  In  dogs,  colonic  cecal  lymphoid  necrosis,  gastric  ulcers  and  oral  mucosal ulceration  occurred.  Colitis  and  typhlitis  with  diarrhoea  were  observed  in  monkey  and  considered secondary to immunosuppression or the antifungal effect. Tacrolimus may cause severe diarrhoea in monkey.

## Kidney

Effects on renal function seemed minor in repeated dose studies with sirolimus given orally. In a 3month study in rats non-specific renal effects, haemosiderosis in kidney and renal mineralisation were reported. In one dog study, kidney tubular degeneration was recorded and kidney tubular vacuolation in  one  mouse  study  was  considered  artifactious.  Findings  were  not  consistent  and  overall  sirolimus seems to  have  a  lower  potential  for  renal  toxicity  than  tacrolimus  or  CsA.  In  combination  toxicity studies, CsA induced renal toxicity was potentiated by sirolimus in one study, possibly in part due to a pharmacokinetic interaction.

## Lung

Upon  treatment  with  sirolimus  pulmonary  alveolar  macrophages  gained  characteristics  common  to phospholipidosis.The  clinical  relevance  of  this  change  is  not  clear.  Further  responses  specific  for sirolimus were haemosiderosis and increased haematopoiesis in liver and spleen.

## Bone

Six studies were performed to elucidate the reduction of bone strength. The mechanism of this effect is not  fully  known,  the  effects  of  sirolimus  on  body  weight,  cytokines,  testosterone  and  also  its diabetogenic effect may contribute to the detrimental effects on bone structure. The results indicated partial reversibility and a particular sensitivity of young rats. Testosterone replacement only partially counteracted bone effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Combination studies

Combination toxicity studies showed that CsA had additive effects on the severity of pancreas islet cell vacuolisation, thymic atrophy and testicular atrophy while sirolimus induced hyperglycaemia was potentiated.  Further,  sirolimus  potentiated  CsA  induced  tubular  basophilia.  A  pharmacokinetic interaction between CsA and sirolimus may partly explain the toxic interactions. Although CsA is also known to affect bone integrity, limited studies in rats with low doses of sirolimus and CsA did not indicate any interactions on bone effects.

## Conclusion

Sirolimus induced a variety of toxic effects in laboratory animals. Most of the toxic effects have been reported with other immunosuppressants or represented expected exaggerated pharmacological effects. Reactions  that  appeared  'unique'  for  sirolimus  were  pulmonary  alveolar  macrophages,  increased haemosiderosis and haematopoiesis, indicative of an increase in red blood cell turnover, and possibly skin toxicity (ulcers mainly in mouse).

## Reproduction toxicity

Effects of sirolimus on the different stages of the reproductive process have been adequately studied. In most studies maximum tolerated doses were reached, but exposure levels were lower than expected clinical levels. Male rats treated had decreased fertility and atrophy of testes; giant cells in testes and hypospermia in testes and epididymides were evident. These effects on male reproductive organs are not unexpected with an agent with antiproliferative properties. Female fertility was not affected, but early resorptions, decreased uterine weights, foetal body weights and foetal toxicity were noted. In a rat developmental toxicity study no teratogenic effects of sirolimus were observed. Reduced vertebral ossification  and  vertebral  variations  were  increased.  In  rabbits,  treatment  with  sirolimus  seemed related to an increase in abortions.

Interactions  of  sirolimus  with  oral  contraceptives  are  expected  due  to  the  involvement  of  CYP3A. Special studies in lactating rats showed that the compound-derived radioactivity passes into milk to a large extent.

## Genotoxicity

Sirolimus did not induce any significant mutagenic or clastogenic effects in the standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests for genotoxicity with or without metabolic activation.

## Carcinogenicity

One carcinogenicity study in mice was terminated at week 29 (males) and week 86 (females) due to severe skin ulcerative lesions. The low dose resulted in Cmax levels approx. x14 the expected clinical levels. An increased incidence of lymphomas, involving multiple organs, was recorded in the female groups at all doses, but particularly in the high dose group, where lymphomas were a major cause of death.  In  males  the  causes  of  death  or  moribundity  were  mainly  attributed  to  skin  lesions,  GI distension, meningitis/meningoencephalitis and gavage errors.

In the second mouse carcinogenicity study the maximum dose reduced survival to approximately 20% due to the occurrence and progression of skin lesions which occurred early in the study and progressed throughout.   A variety of haematological and histological changes were reported including lymphoid atrophy, testicular tubular degeneration and myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow. Neoplastic changes consisted of hepatocellular tumours and lymphomas in males, lymphomas and granulocytic leukaemia in  females.  These  were  considered  related  to  the  immunosuppression.  Liver  tumours,  including carcinomas, although statistically significantly increased were within historical control ranges. Liver tumours  were  seen  only  in  male  mice  and  it  was  concluded  that  these  were  due  to  non-genotoxic promotion of spontaneous neoplasms. A no-effect level for this change could not be identified as an increase was noted at the lowest dose that corresponded to approx. 2x expected clinical exposure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The high dose in the rat carcinogenicity study was based on the maximum tolerated dose in a 52-week study. In terms of systemic exposure, margins to expected clinical levels were less than 1. An increase in testicular interstitial cell adenomas was recorded. Although not directly measured in the study, it is conceivable  that  this  increase  may  be  related  to  altered  LH  levels  secondary  to  decreased  serum testosterone levels. As luteinising hormone receptors are different in humans and rats and the age of onset of the tumours is also different, the increased incidence in rats may therefore be considered not predictive for humans.

Overall  it  can  be  concluded  that  carcinogenicity  studies  with  sirolimus  indicate  that  the  intrinsic potential for carcinogenicity was secondary to that induced by the pharmacological action.

## Skin cancers

Immunosuppressants may enhance UV induced skin tumours. Clinical observations are in line with that of combinations of CsA and immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and prednisolone, which hasten development of skin cancers. Clinical data with sirolimus are available for 2 years and to date do not indicate an increase over control therapy.

The potential phototoxicity of sirolimus has been assessed in a study in rabbits given oral doses of 8methoxypsoralen (8-MOP), vehicle or sirolimus. The results were overall inconclusive and the study will be repeated in a different model.  The available clinical experience to date would indicate that acute photoirritant reactions are not a major concern.

## Local tolerance

The irritation potential of sirolimus and vehicle was similar (mild to moderate) in rabbits given the compound intravenously for one week. Rabbits treated with a single dermal application of sirolimus in petrolatum did not show any dermal irritation or other adverse effects.

## Impurities

In  a  28-day  study  a  specific  impurity  (WAY-124854)  was  tested.  The  toxicological  profile  of rapamycin did not change in the presence of this impurity. In studies on the genotoxic potential high concentrations  and  high  doses  of  sirolimus  were  used  and  impurities  were  present  at  considerable amounts. Furthermore, carcinogenicity studies with sirolimus showed that doses or systemic exposures lower than expected therapeutic levels resulted in positive findings and therefore the potential effects of the impurities may be considered less relevant.

A 28-day repeated dose toxicity study in rats with Group II impurities at levels from 0.4 to 11% was conducted. Group II impurities consisted of multiple oxidation/hydrolysis degradation products found at relative retention times from 0.0 to 0.6 and which could not be resolved because of &gt;100 different impurities.  There  were  no  relevant  differences  in  the  toxicological  profile  between  0.4  and  11% impurities. Further, Group II and other relevant impurities have been present in batches used in earlier studies, including studies on genotoxicity .

## 4. Clinical aspects

## Clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

Sirolimus is an immunosuppressive agent that exerts anti-rejection activity in vitro and in vivo through inhibition of the proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes. Sirolimus also inhibits the proliferation of a variety of transformed cell lines and inhibits growth factor-mediated proliferation of smooth muscle cells in vivo .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pharmacodynamic  analyses  indicate  that  the  sirolimus  formulation  (tablet  or  solution)  is  not  a predictor of efficacy or safety events. Tablet and solution can be used interchangeably and the same target trough concentrations can be used for therapeutic drug monitoring. In the open-label study 309, the  treatment  formulation  was  not  a  significant  predictor  of  acute  allograft  rejection  or  laboratory results.  HLA mismatches and average concentrations of sirolimus (tablet or solution) were the only meaningful  predictors  of  acute  rejection  and  significant  associations  were  found  between  sirolimus exposure  (measured  by  concurrent  trough  concentrations)  and  the  laboratory  parameters  LDH, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).

## Pharmacokinetics

## Oral solution

## Introduction

Pharmacokinetic information was gathered in 44 clinical studies (n=690), of which 16 were performed in healthy volunteers (n=335). Twenty clinical studies were carried out in patients with stable allograft function (n=117). Other studied groups were renal allograft patients with renal complications (n=32), renal allograft patients at high risk of chronic rejection (n=12), psoriasis patients (n=77), stable liver allograft recipients (n=8), hepatically impaired patients (n=19), post renal transplant recipients (0-12 months  after  transplantation,  n=70)  and  paediatric  dialysis  patients  (n=20).  The  majority  of  studies displayed full pharmacokinetic profiles, whereas a few studies measured sirolimus trough levels only.

Three  different  analytical  techniques  were  used  to  analyse  whole  blood  and  plasma  samples  from clinical trials. The methods were HPLC with mass spectrometric detection, HPLC with UV detection and  an  immunoassay.  Cross-validations  have  been  performed.  Based  on  results  from  the  European central  laboratory,  both  chromatographic  techniques  yield  results  0.8  times  the  immunoassay.    The immunoassay  is  not  currently  available.  In  order  to  assist  centres  in  establishing  an  HPLC-UV  or LC/MS  assay,  the  Applicant  has  developed  a  program  to  assure  that  Therapeutic  Drug  Level Monitoring  (TDM)  is  available  to  transplant  centres  throughout  Europe.  The  program  consists  of providing analytical standards, assay methods, technical assistance and TDM documentation.

## Absorption

Following oral administration, sirolimus is rapidly absorbed, with a time to peak concentration of 1 hour  in  healthy  subjects  receiving  single  doses  and  2  hours  in  patients  with  stable  renal  allografts receiving multiple doses. Upon repeated administration, the average blood concentration of sirolimus is  increased  approximately  3-fold.  The  absolute/oral  availability  of  sirolimus  in  combination  with simultaneously  administered  CsA  is  approximately  14%.  The  bioavailability  was  estimated  in  the presence  of  CsA  administered  simultaneously  to  sirolimus.  In  the  clinical  situation,  CsA  will  be administered 4 h apart during the initial 2-3 months, and without CsA thereafter.  It can therefore be expected that the bioavailability in the clinical situation will be lower.

## Distribution

Sirolimus is extensively partitioned into formed blood elements; the blood to plasma ratio is 36. The in vitro protein  binding  studies  demonstrated  that  sirolimus  is  approximately  92%  bound,  mainly  to serum  albumin  (97%).  No  significant  relationship  has  been  found  between  hematocrit  values  and clearance  and  any  changes  in  RBC  count  over  time  are  therefore  unlikely  to  have  an  effect.  In  the healthy  population,  the  apparent  distribution  volume  (Vss/F),  based  on  whole  blood  concentrations, was 19 l/kg, whereas in the target population (renal allografts) Vss/F was significantly lower, 11.6 l/kg.

## Metabolism

Sirolimus is  extensively metabolised. The primary enzyme involved in the  metabolism of sirolimus was  CYP3A4,  catalysing  demethylation  at  the  41-O-,  32-O-  and  7-O-methyl  positions  to  form  the corresponding O-demethylated metabolites and the hydroxylation of sirolimus. The immunosuppressive activity of the metabolites is less than 30% of the sirolimus activity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Excretion

After a single dose of [ 14 C] sirolimus in healthy volunteers, the majority (91.1%) of radioactivity was recovered  from  the  faeces,  and  only  a  minor  amount  (2.2%)  was  excreted  in  urine.  Approximately 90% of the radioactivity was excreted after 5 days. After multiple oral doses, the terminal half-life in stable renal transplant patients receiving CsA and steroids concomitantly was 62 ± 16h. The effective half-life, however, is shorter and mean steady-state concentrations were achieved after 5 to 7 days.

## Special populations

## Impaired renal function

Renal excretion of sirolimus is very small (in a study in healthy volunteers only 2.2% was excreted in the urine, see above). The pharmacokinetics of sirolimus are similar in various populations with renal function ranging from normal to absent (dialysis patients).

## Impaired hepatic function

In mild and moderate hepatically impaired patients (Child-Pugh classification of A or B), mean values for sirolimus AUC and t1/2 were increased 61% and 43% respectively and CL/F was decreased 33% compared to normal healthy subjects. Sirolimus pharmacokinetics were not evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. It is recommended that sirolimus whole blood trough levels be especially closely monitored in patients with impaired hepatic function.

## Race and gender effects

## Black recipients

There is limited information indicating that black renal transplant recipients (predominantly AfricanAmerican)  require  higher  doses  and  trough  levels  of  sirolimus  to  achieve  the  same  efficacy  as observed  in  non-black  patients.  Currently,  the  efficacy  and  safety  data  are  too  limited  to  allow recommendations for use of sirolimus in black recipients.

## Women

A gender effect was detected for CL/F and t½, in the two-stage analysis of Phase I, II and III-data. CL/F was increased in women (260 ml/h/kg) compared with men (233 ml/h/kg) and, consequently, t½ was shortened. The difference was not considered clinically important.

## Elderly

Clinical  studies  of  sirolimus  did  not  include  a  sufficient  number  of  patients  &gt;  65  years  of  age  to determine whether they will respond differently than younger patients. Sirolimus trough concentration data in 35 renal transplant patients &gt; 65 years of age were similar to those in the younger population (n=822) from 18 to 65 years of age.

## Children and adolescents

In  paediatric  patients  on  dialysis  (30%  to  50%  reduction  in  glomerular  filtration  rate)  within  age ranges of 5 to 11 years (n=9) and 12 to 18 years (n=9), the mean weight-normalised CL/F was larger for younger paediatric patients (580ml/h/kg) than for older paediatric patients (450ml/h/kg) or adults (287ml/h/kg). There was a large variability for individuals within the age groups. There is insufficient experience to recommend the use of sirolimus in children and adolescents.

## Interaction studies

## Interactions with other medicinal products

Ten interaction studies were performed in healthy volunteers mainly regarding substrates of CYP3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein (PgP). The majority of studies included healthy males and females, 18-45 years of  age,  and  sirolimus  concentrations  were  followed  for  144h.  It  should  be  noted  that  CsA,  being  a substrate  and  also  an  inhibitor  of  both  CYP  3A4  and  PgP,  was  not  administered  together  with sirolimus, which is likely to be done in the clinical situation. Hence, any recommendations based on these studies must be interpreted having this in mind. In order to address this issue, Therapeutic Drug concentration  Monitoring  (TDM)  in  all  patients  is  advised  and  co-administration  of  sirolimus  with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

strong  inducers  (e.g.  rifampin,  rifabutin)  or  inhibitors  (e.g.  ketoconazole)  of  CYP3A4  is  not recommended unless the benefit outweighs the risk (see below ).

No  clinically significant interactions  were detected for acyclovir, atorvastatin, glibenclamide, nifedipine, digoxin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole. Sirolimus slightly increased the glibenclamide exposure by 14 % and Cmax by 20% .

Cyclosporin  A  (CsA) (CYP3A4/P-gp  substrate  and  inhibitor): The  rate  and  extent  of  sirolimus absorption  was  significantly  affected  by  CsA.  Microemulsion  CsA,  administered  4  hours  prior  to sirolimus,  increased  the  sirolimus  AUC, Cmax,  and  tmax 1.8-fold,  1.4-fold,  and  1.6-fold,  respectively. Single-dose  sirolimus  did  not  affect  the  pharmacokinetics  of  CsA  (microemulsion)  in  healthy volunteers when administered simultaneously or 4 hours apart. Based on the design of large Phase III clinical trials, it is recommended that sirolimus be administered 4 hours after CsA (microemulsion). Implementation  of  TDM  in  all  patients  and  the  recommendation  to  give  CsA  and  sirolimus  at  a consistent time interval are adequate measures.

Rifampicin (strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducer) : Administration of multiple doses of rifampicin decreased sirolimus  whole  blood  concentrations  following  a  single  10  mg  dose  of  sirolimus  oral  solution. Rifampicin increased the clearance of sirolimus by approximately 5.5-fold and decreased AUC and Cmax by approximately 82% and 71%, respectively. Co-administration of sirolimus with rifampicin is not  recommended  unless  the  benefit  outweighs  the  risk  due  to  this  interaction.  If  rifampicin  is administered  with  sirolimus,  the  dose  of  sirolimus  should  be  initially  increased  to  8-times  the maintenance dose, followed by trough sampling within 5 to 7 days for purposes of therapeutic drug monitoring.    Upon  termination  of  rifampicin  therapy,  the  dose  of  sirolimus  should  be  gradually reduced to the original maintenance dose.

Ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4/p-gp inhibitor): Multiple-dose ketoconazole administration significantly affected the rate and extent of absorption and sirolimus exposure as reflected by increases in sirolimus Cmax, tmax, and AUC of 4.3-fold, 1.4-fold, and 10.9-fold, respectively. Co-administration of sirolimus with ketoconazole is not recommended unless the benefit outweighs the risk due to this interaction.  If  ketoconazole is  administered with  sirolimus, the dose of sirolimus should be initially reduced to 1/6th the maintenance dose, followed by trough sampling within 5 to 7 days for purposes of therapeutic drug monitoring.  Upon termination of ketoconazole therapy, the dose of sirolimus should be increased to the original maintenance dose.

Diltiazem (CYP3A4/P-gp substrate and inhibitor): The simultaneous oral administration of 10 mg of sirolimus oral solution and 120 mg of diltiazem significantly affected the bioavailability of sirolimus. Sirolimus Cmax, tmax, and AUC were increased 1.4-fold, 1.3-fold, and 1.6-fold, respectively. Sirolimus did  not  affect  the  pharmacokinetics  of  either  diltiazem  or  its  metabolites  desacetyldiltiazem  and desmethyldiltiazem.  If  diltiazem  is  administered,  sirolimus  blood  levels  should  be  monitored  and  a dose adjustment may be necessary.

Other possible interactions in connection with cytochrome P450 : Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase  the  absorption  of  sirolimus  and  increase  sirolimus  blood  levels  (e.g.  calcium  channel blockers: nicardipine, verapamil; antifungal agents: clotrimazole, fluconazole, itraconazole; macrolide antibiotics: clarithromycin, erythromycin, troleandomycin; gastrointestinal prokinetic agents: cisapride, metoclopramide; other substances: bromocriptine, cimetidine, danazol, protease inhibitors). Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease the absorption of sirolimus and decrease sirolimus blood levels  (e.g.  St.  John's  wort  ( Hypericum perforatum), anticonvulsants:  carbamazepine,  phenobarbital, phenytoin;  antibiotics:  rifabutin).    Although  sirolimus  inhibits  human  liver  microsomal  cytochrome P450  CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 in  vitro ,  the  drug  is  not  expected  to  inhibit  the activity of these isozymes in vivo since the sirolimus concentrations necessary to produce inhibition are much higher than those observed in patients receiving therapeutic doses of sirolimus.

Norgestrel/ethinyl  estradiol :  No  clinically  significant  pharmacokinetic  interaction  was  observed between sirolimus and 0.3 mg norgestrel/ 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol. The results of a single dose drug interaction  study  with  an  oral  contraceptive  cannot  exclude  the  possibility  of  changes  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pharmacokinetics that might affect the efficacy of the oral contraceptive during long-term treatment with sirolimus. This is of particular relevance in view of the fact that effective contraception must be used during sirolimus therapy and for 12 weeks after sirolimus has been stopped.

## Interactions with food and drink

The influence of orange juice, Tang and water on the blood profile of sirolimus was investigated in 19 healthy  volunteers.  Compared  to  water,  orange  juice  did  not  affect  either  the  rate  or  extent  of absorption of sirolimus.  Tang increased the sirolimus tmax and AUC by 20% and 17%, respectively. Grapefruit juice is known to significantly affect the activities of CYP3A4 and P-pg in the intestine and must therefore be avoided.

The  pharmacokinetics  was  significantly  changed  after  a  high  fat  meal  as  compared  with  fasting conditions.  In  healthy  volunteers  not  receiving  concomitant  CsA,  there  was  a  34%  decrease  in  the peak  concentration  (Cmax),  a  3.5-fold  increase  in  the  time  to  peak  concentration  (t max ),  and  a  35% increase  in  total  exposure  (AUC).  The  half-life  did  not  change  as  a  result  of  the  different  feeding conditions.  It  is  recommended  that  sirolimus  be  taken  consistently  either  with  or  without  food.  In phase III trials, sirolimus was given approximately 4 hours after the morning dose of CsA.

## Coated Tablets

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of sirolimus tablet formulations were evaluated in seven studies, two of which were conducted in renal transplant patients. The oval 1mg tablet and the solution were not bioequivalent after single dose (1mg) to healthy volunteers. AUC and tmax were increased by 27% and 82%, respectively, whereas Cmax was decreased by 35% for the tablet compared with the solution. The bioavailability  of  the  tablet  was  approximately  17%,  which  should  be  compared  with  the  14% estimated  for  the  solution.  The  half-life,  approximately  70h,  was  comparable  between  the  two formulations, which suggests that the elimination of sirolimus was not affected by formulation. After a high-fat meal, the increase in bioavailability is in the same range as that seen for the oral solution. It is recommended  that  the  tablet  should  be  taken  consistently  with  or  without  food  to  minimise  intraindividual variability. Triangular 1 and 2mg tablets were bioequivalent in Cmax, and AUC after single doses to healthy volunteers, but tmax for 2mg tablets was increased 18%. The exposure was essentially linear in the studied dose range of 5 - 40mg (oval tablets) and 2 - 5 mg (triangular tablets). However, the dose-linearity study with oval tablets was performed using a 5mg tablet.

In patients, an oval tablet formulation was comparable with the oral solution comparable with respect to Cmax and AUC, but tmax was prolonged for the tablet. In Study 310, the sirolimus dose without CsA was approximately four times the dose given in combination with CsA. The dose increase after CsA withdrawal reflects the increase in trough levels needed when sirolimus is administered without CsA and the vanished interaction effect of CsA. The distribution of trough levels was comparable between formulations and the same therapeutic interval as for the solution may be used also for the tablet. As described for the solution, the intra- and inter-individual variability in trough levels is high (40-50%). When switching formulations, blood concentration monitoring is recommended after 1-2 weeks. CsA given 4h prior to the tablet had a significant effect on absorption and bioavailability of sirolimus in  healthy  subjects.  The  effect  was,  however,  less  pronounced  than  for  the  solution.  Thus,  the formulation affects the interaction potential of sirolimus.

In the clinical trial, an oval tablet was used, whereas a triangular form is proposed for marketing. The triangular shaped tablet tends to give slightly higher drug levels compared with the oval form (interstudy comparison). No formal bioequivalence study was conducted. Given the inter-patient variability, the  difference  between  the  two  formulations  is  not  considered  of  clinical  importance.    Indeed,  any minor  differences  in  bioavailability  between  the  oval-  and  triangular-shaped  tablets  would  be extremely small compared to the large inter-individual differences in bioavailability, the consequences of which are minimised by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).  The applicant re-iterated that Study 310,  in  which  a  tablet  (oval)  was  the  only  sirolimus  formulation  given  to  patients,  was  the  largest concentration-controlled  trial  that  tested  the  feasibility  of  cyclosporine  withdrawal.    Therefore,  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sirolimus trough concentrations observed are the basis for the recommendations in the current SmPC for the oral solution.

Sirolimus  whole  blood  trough  concentrations  should  be  monitored  in  all  patients.    In  the  SmPC, separate  target  ranges  are  recommended  for  the  initial  period  when  sirolimus  is  given  with cyclosporine and for the maintenance period after cyclosporine is withdrawn.  Recommended loading and starting doses of sirolimus are 6 mg and 2 mg, respectively.  This regimen has been tested in a large number of patients who received either the oral solution or tablet formulations.

In the assessment, the following is considered relevant:

- Sirolimus  pharmacokinetics  is  characterised  by  high  variability  (modest  bioavailability,  food effect, CsA interaction) resulting in intersubject CV ≥ 40%. The clinical relevance of differences between formulations must be viewed in the light of this high variability.
- TDM  has  been  accepted  as  an  adequate  tool  for  dosing  of  sirolimus,  based  on  the  good correlation between Cmin and AUC. TDM should be used in all patients and the applicant has previously  documented  that  methods  and  equipment  for  this  are  adequately  available  to transplantation centres.
- The  currently  approved  dosing  regimen  for  sirolimus  oral  solution  is  based  mainly  on experience  from  trial  310,  which  used  the  oval  Rapamune  tablet  as  the  only  sirolimus formulation.  In  view  of  the  reasoning  above,  CPMP  considered  adequate  an  extrapolation  of these data to the commercially available oral solution.
- The new triangular tablet has shown in vitro sirolimus release rates not significantly different from those obtained with the clinically tested oval tablet.
- Compared with the oval tablet (inter-study), the triangular tablet showed 21% higher AUC and 45%  higher  Cmax.  The  triangular  tablet  showed  lower  dose  normalised  Cmax  (57%)  and moderately  higher  dose  normalised  AUC  (14%),  in  an  inter-study  comparison  with  the  oral solution.  Variability  was,  as  expected,  high.  Compared  with  overall  variability,  these  mean differences are of questionable relevance.
- Other relevant pharmacokinetic characteristics were shown to be equivalent between triangular tablet and oral solution.

In summary, the proposed triangular tablet has been shown to provide an adequate source of sirolimus. Any small difference between tablet and oral solution could be of no matter whatsoever during TDMbased maintenance therapy, recommended for all patients. The single dose comparative trial between tablet and oral solution, simulating the loading dose situation, indicated a lower Cmax with the tablet, which should be reassuring from the toxicity viewpoint and adequate exposure to sirolimus (AUC), which should be the first priority in this situation.

To confirm the relative bioavailability and pharmacokinetic linearity of the 1-mg and 2-mg tablets, a study  was  conducted  in  healthy  volunteers.  It  was  a  single-dose,  open-label,  randomised,  3-period crossover  study.    Study  0468H1-186-UK  assessed  the  dose  proportionality  of  sirolimus  triangular tablets  over  a  dose  range  of  2  to  5  mg,  following  single-dose  administration  of  2 mg  (2  x  1-mg tablets), 4 mg (2 x 2-mg tablets), and 5 mg (5 x 1-mg tablets) of sirolimus in healthy subjects.  The pharmacokinetics  for  the  1-  and  2-mg  tablets  was  evaluated,  although  not  at  equivalent  doses. Following  dose  corrections,  AUC  and  Cmax  were  considered  bioequivalent.  For  the  2mg-tablet,  tmax was slightly longer, but this is not considered to be of clinical relevance.

## Clinical efficacy

## Oral solution

## Introduction

Efficacy of sirolimus combined with CsA and steroids was primarily studied in two large, double blind trials  (301  and  302).  Altogether  1,295  patients  were  included,  of  whom  1,004  were  randomised  to sirolimus at fixed doses of 2 or 5 mg/d as add-on to CsA and corticosteroids (CS). Six-month and oneyear data from these trials were provided in the initial submission.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Supplementary submissions provided data on sirolimus as base immunosuppressant after discontinuation  of  CsA  and  with  dosing  based  on  concentration  monitoring  (studies  212  and  310). These trials included a total of 770 patients, all treated with sirolimus. Six-month data was submitted for study 212 and 12-month data was available for study 310.  Subsequent updates on study 310 have provided follow up through 36 months.

The  clinical  trials  were  performed  according  to  GCP  standards  and  agreed  international  ethical principles.

## Dose-response studies and main clinical studies

## Dose response study of the sirolimus-CsA combination (203)

The daily sirolimus doses of 2 and 5 mg were chosen for the phase III studies, based on the phase II study  203-GL.  In  this  study,  there  was  little  difference  among  the  actual  doses  of  sirolimus administered within a given dose group, suggesting that dose administration by body surface area was unnecessary. Therefore, two fixed dose levels of 2 mg/day and 5 mg/day, which represented central values for the two surface area dose levels of 1mg/m 2 /day and 3 mg/m 2 /day, were chosen for phase III. The need for a loading dose was suggested by the performed Phase I studies.

## Pilot studies comparing sirolimus to CsA (207 and 210)

Two  pilot  studies  in  renal  transplantation  compared  sirolimus  to  CsA  in  combination  with  either azathioprine (AZA)  or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).  All patients received corticosteroids. Sirolimus therapy was concentration-controlled by adjusting doses to obtain sirolimus blood troughs of  30  ng/mL for 8 weeks, and 15 ng/mL thereafter. The outcomes in sirolimus and CsA, treatment arms regarding 12-month patient and graft survival was comparable whereas the renal function was better with sirolimus at most time-points (see table below).

## Phase III studies of the sirolimus-CsA combination (301 and 302)

There  were  two  trials  (301-US  and  302-GL)  of  similar  design.  The  main  characteristics  of  these studies are given in Table 3. In both trials, sirolimus 2 mg/d and 5 mg/d, started as a loading dose of 6 mg  and  15  mg,  respectively, 24-48 h post-transplant were evaluated as add-on therapy to conventionally dosed CsA and corticosteroids. Antibody induction therapy was prohibited, as was the addition  of  other  immunosuppressive  agents.  The  comparators,  azathioprine  (AZA,  trial  301)  and placebo (trial 302) are not fully representative of current medical practice, but have been accepted in recent applications in this therapeutic field.

Stratification by investigator and donor origin                                                                                                                                              | 576 patients sirolimus (2 and 5 mg/day): 446 Placebo, 130              | Three year                  | The major inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical. The trials enrolled primary recipients ≥ 13 years of age of cadaveric or (HLA- mismatched) living-donor grafts. Patients with a history of malignancy or with recent severe atherosclerotic heart disease (unstable angina, recent acute MI) were excluded. Concomitant, protocol-defined, anti- infectious therapy was similar. All patients were required to use pneumocystis carinii (PCP) prophylaxis (preferentially TMP- SMX) during the first year post- transplant, and continued prophylaxis after the first year was recommended. All CMV -ve patients receiving grafts from CMV +ve donors were required to use CMV prophylaxis for the first three months post-transplant, and such prophylaxis was recommended in all patients. The use of antilymphocyte antibody induction therapy was prohibited. | Primary end-point: Efficacy failure within the first 6 months after transplantation. The 6- month window was defined from 154 to 194 days after transplantation. Efficacy failure was defined as the first occurrence of 1) biopsy-confirmed acute rejection, 2) graft loss (functional [>56 days of continuous dialysis] or physical), or 3) death. Patients defined as lost to follow-up were scored as efficacy failures, regardless of treatment assignment. The secondary end-points included time to first acute rejection episode |

## Study populations/accountability of patients

Demographic and baseline characteristics for the 301 and 302 trials are given in Tables 4 and 5. Regarding patient distribution with respect to ethnic and graft origin, a higher proportion of black patients were enrolled in  study  301  than  in  study  302  (23%  and  11%,  respectively),  and  a  lower  proportion  of  patients  received cadaveric grafts in study 301.

The patient populations were, generally, not at high immunological risk; mean percentage of PRA was &lt;4% in  all  treatment  groups.  The  average  number  of  HLA  mismatches  was  approximately  3.5  in  all  treatment groups. Only primary transplants were enrolled.

During  the  period  of  primary  evaluation  (months  0-6),  the  percentage  of  patients  withdrawing  without reaching an endpoint was 12-14% in sirolimus 2 mg groups, 18-26% in sirolimus 5 mg groups, and 14-19% in control therapy groups. The higher figures for sirolimus, 5 mg were accounted for by a higher incidence of adverse events in this group. These withdrawal rates were high but not exceptional for this type of trial.

## Efficacy analysis

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  efficacy  failure  (defined  as  biopsy-proven  rejection,  death,  or functional  or  physical  graft  loss  at  six  months).  A  biopsy-proven  acute  rejection  was  any  episode grade ≥ 1,  according  to  the  Banff  1993  criteria,  irrespective  of  whether  anti-rejection  treatment  was instituted. Local biopsy readings were used to define acute rejection. Based on historical data and the results of a phase II study (study 0468E1-203-GL), the efficacy failure rates were estimated to be 18% for sirolimus, 40% for the placebo group and 36% for the AZA group. Each comparison of a sirolimus treatment  group to the  control  was  made by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by investigator and by either race (301) or donor source (302). A Bonferroni correction for comparisons between each dose and controls was used at the α -level of 0.025. These studies were not powered to show a difference in the primary end-point between 2 and 5 mg/day. All randomised patients were included in the primary efficacy evaluation on an Intent-To-Treat (ITT) basis.

With this, sirolimus therapy (2 and 5-mg/day) was found statistically significantly superior to placebo at 6 and 12 months for both the primary endpoint of efficacy failure and the secondary end-point of acute  rejection.  In  comparison  with  AZA  (trial  301),  superiority  regarding  efficacy  failure  was  not maintained at 12  months.  The incidences of efficacy failure  and  of  acute  rejection  are  given  in  the tables below.

The lack of statistical significance in the rate of efficacy failure for the 2-mg/day cohort in study 301 at  month 12 (versus AZA) was mainly due to a disproportionate number of events in the 2-mg/day group between months 6 and 12 (intent-to-treat analysis).

In both studies, the rate of acute rejection remained significantly lower for both doses at month 12. This  held  true  for  the  intent-to-treat  as  well  as  the  on-therapy  analyses.  The  data  from  two  CsA withdrawal  studies  (212-GL  and  310-GL,  see  below)  provided  additional  data  on  the  efficacy  of sirolimus as add-on to CsA in preventing acute rejection in the early post transplant period.

## Graft function

Group  means  calculated  GFR  up  to  12  months  are  given  in  Table  8.  The  findings  provide documentation that the sirolimus - CsA combination is associated with inferior average graft function, compared with CsA alone or CsA plus AZA. This effect is more pronounced at the 5 mg/day dose. At the 2 mg/day dose, there was no difference with placebo at 3 months.

An attempt was made to correlate graft function to CsA and sirolimus levels. It could be noted that, in both trials 301 and 302, mean CsA trough levels at different time points were at the upper end of the intended concentration window. There was, however, no difference in CsA levels between sirolimus and AZA/placebo groups at any time point post-transplantation. A mixed linear regression analysis was performed, which did indicate a moderate impact of CsA and sirolimus trough levels on GFR.

## Special populations

## Race and gender effects

In study 301, black patients treated with sirolimus 5-mg/day, but not those treated with sirolimus 2mg/day,  had  efficacy  failure  and  acute  rejection  rates  lower  than  those  treated  with  azathioprine. Patients  in  this  study  were  prospectively  stratified  by  ethnic  origin,  in  anticipation  of  safety  and efficacy differences in black versus non-black patients.

The  information  above  indicates  that  black  renal  transplant  recipients  (predominantly  AfricanAmerican)  require  higher  doses  and  trough  levels  of  sirolimus  to  achieve  the  same  efficacy  as observed in non-black patients, although there are no indications that the dose/exposure relationship is different in black, compared with non-black individuals. Compared with AZA, a moderately effective immunosuppressive in this setting, there is no apparent benefit of the 2-mg dose of sirolimus in the black population. Currently, the efficacy and safety data are too limited to allow specific recommendations for use of sirolimus in black patients.

## Elderly patients, children and adolescents

As expected  in  this  type  of  trials,  the  enrolment  of  elderly  patients  was  limited.  Very  few  patients below  18  years  old  were  studied  and  the  documentation  is  considered  insufficient  for  a  paediatric indication for sirolimus.

## Sirolimus as base immunosuppressant after discontinuation of CsA (212 and 310)

Trials 212 and 310 provide data for the dosage regimen finally proposed by the applicant.

## Trial 212-GL

This was a 12-month Phase II trial. Six-month data were reported in the submission. The trial enrolled recipients of a primary cadaveric renal allograft and randomised only those who had established graft function within seven days post transplantation. Two sirolimus-containing regimens were compared:

- ¾ Group A: A fixed dose of sirolimus, 2 mg/d (following an initial loading dose of 6 mg) as addon  to  conventional  doses  of  CsA  and  corticosteroids.  The  targeted  CsA  through  level  was slightly lower than that used in trials 301and 302 (200-400 ng/ml during the first month, 150250 ng/ml after month four).
- ¾ Group  B:  In  this  group,  sirolimus,  20  mg/d  was  given  for  three  days,  followed  by  10  mg/d during days 4-9. After this, dosing was based on Therapeutic Drug Monitoring, targeting trough levels of 10-20 ng/ml. CsA was given with target trough levels of 100-175 ng/ml during the first two months. During month three, CsA was tapered to discontinuation in patients who had stable graft function, stable and adequate sirolimus levels, and no history of recent rejection.

A 'rescue' group C was available for patients who had not established graft function by seven days, or who could not be managed according to the intended regimens.

The primary analysis was for graft function at six months in the evaluable efficacy population, defined as  those  patients  who  were  on  assigned  therapy  and  had  not  experienced  an  acute  rejection  since transplantation. Results are given in Table 11.

Biopsy-confirmed acute rejection at six months was evaluated as a secondary parameter (ITT population). Results are given in Table 12.

Graft and patient survival was high and similar in groups A and B.

## Trial 310-GL

This is a trial, extended to 5 years follow up, with the primary objective of comparing functional graft survival for two sirolimus-containing regimens. The submission now contains 36-month data for all patients. The trial enrolled recipients of primary or secondary renal allografts from cadaveric or living donors (see demography table below). The study population was strongly dominated by Caucasians (93-95%).  Initial therapy  for all patients during  the  first  3  months  was  CsA  (target  trough concentration  during  month  1:  200-400  ng/ml,  thereafter  150-300  ng/ml)  plus  sirolimus  ([SRL] nominal  daily  dose  2  mg,  adjusted  to  target  trough  concentration  &gt;5  ng/ml,  immunoassay)  plus corticosteroids (CS).

Randomisation occurred at 3 months ± 2 weeks in patients who

- ¾ had not had Banff grade 3 rejection or vascular rejection during the last four weeks
- ¾ had serum creatinine &lt;400 µmol/l
- ¾ were not on dialysis
- ¾ had sufficient renal function to support CsA withdrawal according to investigator's discretion.

Randomisation was to one of two groups:

- ¾ Group A: CsA reduced to target trough concentration 75-200 ng/ml through month 24 and then 50 - 150 ng/ml thereafter, plus sirolimus 2mg/d, adjusted to targeted trough concentration &gt;5 ng/ml (immunoassay), plus CS
- ¾ Group  B: CsA  tapered to discontinuation plus sirolimus increased to targeted trough concentration 20-30 ng/ml (immunoassay) until month 12 then 15 to 25 ng/mL, thereafter, plus CS.

Discontinuation  of  CsA  (group  B)  was  to  take  place  over  4-6  weeks,  but  took  longer  in  48%. Discontinuation was eventually successful in 92% of patients randomised to this treatment arm. By day 116, all patients in group B had discontinued CsA or left the study (23%). Patients that had failed initial treatment (n=79) or were not eligible for the second randomisation (presence of Banff grade 3 rejection or vascular rejection during the last 4 weeks, serum creatinine &gt; 400 µ mol/l or insufficient renal function to support CsA withdrawal according to investigator's discretion; n=16) discontinued protocol  treatment  (n=95).    These  patients  are  being  followed  through  5  years  on  an  intent-to-treat (ITT) basis for graft survival, patients survival, acute rejection, renal function and malignancy.  The demographic  characteristics  of  patients  enrolled  into  study  310  were  similar  to  those  in  recent registration  trials  for  other  immunosuppressive  agents.  There  were  no  notable  differences  between patients  randomised  to  groups  A  and  B.  Moreover,  the  demographics  were  representative  of  the European  patient  population.  Thus,  an  important  selection  bias  due  to  patient  withdrawal  prior  to randomisation was excluded.

## Patient disposition

There was no difference in the rates of discontinuation at month 24 (Figure 1); however, there were significantly  more  discontinuations  in  the  SRL+CsA  group  by  month  36  (Table  14).  The  low-risk nature of the randomised population is evident in comparison with the non-randomised subset.

## Graft survival - study 310

The primary endpoint was graft survival at 12 months, and the noninferiority of group B compared to group B was established. Graft survival at 36 months was a secondary endpoint.  According to the protocol,  non-inferiority  of  group  B  to  group  A  would  be  established  at  36  months  if  the  95% confidence interval of the difference (rate in group A minus rate in group B) of graft survival crossed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

zero and if the upper limit of the confidence interval was no more than 10%.  Graft survival at 36 months is given in Table 15 and the time to graft loss is plotted in Figure 2.  These data confirmed the non-inferiority of group B compared to group A and growing difference in graft survival in favour of group B (CsA withdrawal).

Graft and patient survival rates were similar between groups and compare well with overall UNOS data. There were no differences between groups A and B regarding cause of graft loss

Patient survival - study 310

At 36 months, there were more deaths in group A, but the difference in patient survival was not significant (Table 16).

Renal function - study 310

Serum  creatinine  levels  at  36  months  were  significantly  better  after  CsA  withdrawal,  either  when measured in patients remaining on therapy (163 vs 127 µ mol/L, P &lt; 0.001) or when including values from discontinued patients in the ITT analysis (168 vs 145 µ mol/L, P = 0.002).  The same was true of calculated GFR; the on therapy values are plotted in Figure 4 and the ITT analysis are presented in Table 18).  Additional analyses of renal function over time (slope analyses) indicated that the slopes were  significantly  negative  for  SRL+CsA  therapy,  indicating  a  loss  of  renal  function,  whereas  the slopes were positive for SRL therapy.  The differences in slopes were significant (p&lt;0.001) in favour of CsA withdrawal.

Additional follow up after 36 months - study 310In addition to the 36-month, the CPMP also received cumulative data (up to 54 months) for graft survival, acute rejection and patient survival.  These data were  reviewed  during  September  2003  meeting.    Of  note,  the  cumulative  graft  survival  rate  was significantly  better  in  group  B  (81.4%  vs  89.8%;  difference  [CIs],  -8.4%  [-15.0,  -1.8%]).    The  36month and cumulative data provide further indications that SRL plus standard or near-standard dose CsA,  as  used  in  group  A,  is  an  unsuitable  combination  for  long-term  use,  especially  as  regards evolution of graft function and some other indices of CsA toxicity.

Based on the growing differences in renal function and graft survival as well as lower blood pressure in  the  favour  of  the  CsA-withdrawal  group  (group  B),  the  MAH  took  the  decision  to  discontinue treatment arm A. These patients have been transferred to treatment according to group B or to other regimen according to investigator's discretion. All enrolled patients will be followed for five years on an ITT basis.

## Coated Tablet

## Introduction

The clinical experience with the tablet formulation of Rapamune derives from trials 309 and 310. The data from trial 310 were extensively reviewed during the initial dossier evaluation and appeal process for Rapamune.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Main clinical studies

## Trial 309

## Description of the study

This  was  a  phase  III,  randomised,  open-label,  dose-controlled,  comparative  study  conducted  at multiple  centres  in  the  United  States,  Canada  and  Australia,  it  compared  the  efficacy  and  safety  of tablet (1 mg strength) and solution (1 mg/mL) formulations of sirolimus for the prevention of acute rejection  in  renal  allograft  recipients.  The  primary  objective  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  and determine  the  equivalence  of  sirolimus  oral  solution  (liquid  and  sirolimus  tablets  administered concomitantly with cyclosporine (CsA) and corticosteroids in de novo renal allograft recipients. The primary efficacy end-point was the rate of the composite efficacy failure (first biopsy-confirmed acute rejection, graft loss or death) within the first three months after transplantation.

Before surgery, recipients of a primary or non-primary renal allograft were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either sirolimus solution (2 mg/day) or sirolimus tablets (2 mg/day). An initial loading dose of 6 mg sirolimus 24 to 48 hours after transplantation was followed by a 2-mg dose once a day. The 1-mg tablets were given together, to equal the intended daily dose of 6 mg initially followed by 2 mg  once  a  day.  Both  groups  received  a  standard  immunosuppressive  regimen  consisting  of  CsA microemulsion (Neoral)  and  protocol-defined  corticosteroids.  In  the  event  of  acute  tubular  necrosis (ATN)  or  delayed  graft  function  in  the  early  post-operative  period,  patients  were  allowed  anti-T lymphocyte antibody therapy with sirolimus until renal function improved and CsA could be started. Sirolimus  could  also  be  given  concomitantly  with  anti-T  lymphocyte  antibody  therapy  for  the treatment of acute rejection. Pre-planned induction therapy  with  anti-T  lymphocyte  antibody preparations was, however, a criterion for exclusion.

Four hundred and seventy-seven (477) patients were enrolled, including those who received primary (92%),  secondary  (7%),  or  tertiary  (&lt;1%)  renal  allografts  from  cadaveric  (69%)  or  living  /31%) donors.  The  principal  ethnic  origins  were  white  (58%)  and  black  (24%).  There  were  no  significant differences  in  demographic  variables  between  the  two  treatments.  Of  these  238  were  randomly assigned  to  sirolimus  solution  and  239  to  the  tablets,  and  were  evaluated  for  efficacy.  Twenty  (9 randomly assigned to solution and 11 randomly assigned to tablet) actually never received the study drug; nevertheless, they were included in the intent-to-treat analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint.

## Primary endpoints

The next table summarises the incidence of the primary composite endpoint (efficacy failure) in each treatment group after transplantation, at time-point 12 months.

At time-point 3 months, the overall rate of failure in the tablet group (24.7%) was the same as with the solution  (23.5%).  The  criteria  for  equivalence  were  met:  the  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  for  the difference in rates (-6.5 to 8.8) included zero and the upper limit was less than 20%. The rate of failure was also equivalent between treatment groups when stratified by HLA mismatches, donor origin, age, ethnic  origin,  sex,  and  primary  or  non-primary  transplant.  Similarly,  at  6  months,  there  was  an equivalent overall rate of failure in the tablet (27.2%) and in the solution groups (26.1%) and, again, the criteria for equivalence were met.

The  incidence  of  the  primary  endpoint  (efficacy  failure)  in  each  treatment  group  (tablet:  31.4%; solution: 30.3%) was also equivalent at 12 months of follow-up.

Looking  at  the  more  specific  analysis  of  efficacy  sub-populations,  while  the  incidence  of  biopsyproven acute rejection or death was comparable in the two groups at the three time points of analysis, the  incidence  of  graft  loss  in  patients  given  sirolimus  tablets  was  numerically  higher  than  with  the solution at 3 months (6.3% versus 3.4%), 6 months (6.3% versus 3.4%) and 12 months (6.7% versus 3.4%). These differences, however, did not reach statistical significance.

It was noted that efficacy failure occurred more often in patients with living donor transplants when treated with the tablet formulation (difference 9-11% to solution). These differences were observed at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

6 months (rates at 6 months in patients with living donor were 18.8% for the oral solution and 27.5% for the tablet with a difference of 8.5%) and at 12 months (rates at 12 months were 22.5% for the oral solution and 33.3% for the tablet with a difference of 10.8%).  Among the 18 sirolimus oral solutiontreated patients (22.5%) who had efficacy failure, 17 (21.3%) were due to acute rejection and 1 (1.3%) due to graft loss.  Among the 23 sirolimus tablet-treated patients (33.3%) who had efficacy failure, 19 (27.5%) were due to acute rejection, 3 (4.3%) due to graft loss, and 1 (1.5%) due to death.  Neither the overall rates of efficacy failure nor the distributions of the individual components contributing to the efficacy failure were significantly different between the treatment arms.

As a  matter  of  comparison,  in  study  310  the  efficacy  failure  rate  at  12  months  in  57  tablet-treated patients with transplants from living donors was 21.1%.  This rate was close to the efficacy failure rate of  22.5%  in  the  oral  solution-treated  patients  with  transplants  from  living  donors  in  study  309. Therefore, the efficacy failure rate of 33.3% observed for the tablet-treated patients with living donors in study 309 was not confirmed in the subsequent clinical study 310.

The secondary objectives of study 309 included patient and graft survival over the 12-month followup.  At three months, patient survival rates in the tablet (98.7%) and solution groups (97.5%) were not significantly  different  (p=0.339).  There  was  also  no  difference  between  formulations  in  patient survival at six months (tablet 97.9% versus solution 97.1%) and 12 months (tablet 96.2 versus solution 95.8%).

Similarly, at six months, the graft survival rates in the tablet and solution groups were not significantly different (90.8% and 94.1%) and (p=0.225). The results were confirmed at 12 months (tablet 88.7%; solution 92.0%). Overall, the most common causes of graft loss were death with a functioning graft and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Both groups had comparable rates of graft loss due to death with a functioning graft. However, there was a numerically higher rate of graft loss due to ATN in the tablet group (2.8% vs 0.8%).  This was not confirmed in study 310; only 1.0% of 525 patients receiving the tablet formulation experienced graft loss due to ATN.

## Trial 310

## Description of the study

This was one of the key studies in the original submission. This was an open-label study conducted in Europe,  Australia,  and  Canada.  A  total  of  525  primary  (90%)  or  secondary  (10%)  renal  allograft recipients from cadaveric (89%) or living (11%) donors received sirolimus (SRL) 2 mg (trough level &gt;5 ng/mL, immunoassay), CsA and corticosteroids when enrolled. At 3 months + 2 weeks, eligible patients were randomised (1:1) to remain on sirolimus-CsA-corticosteroids (SRL-CsA-CS), or to have CsA  withdrawn  and  continue  maintenance  therapy  with  SRL  (trough  level:  20  to  30  ng/mL)  and corticosteroids (SRL-CS).

The study was designed to allow for the randomisation of 408 patients: 204 in each treatment group. Enrolment was monitored during the course of the study to achieve this goal as closely as possible. However,  given  the  time  lag  between  enrolment  and  randomisation,  a  total  of  430  patients  were randomly assigned to either group A or B after three months.

The efficacy results have been discussed earlier in this document. (Tables 13-18 and Figures 1-4).  All patients have completed 36 months;post-transplantation follow-up is still ongoing through 5 years. Treatment arm A has been discontinued.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

Nearly all data submitted for assessment referred to kidney transplant recipients at low to moderate immunological risk.

## Sirolimus as add-on to CsA

Trials 301 and 302 tested fixed doses of sirolimus, 2 or 5 mg/d as add-on to conventionally dosed CsA and CS. Both doses were efficacious.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  immunosuppressive  efficacy  of  sirolimus  added  to  CsA  and  CS  is  considered  acceptably documented as regards prevention of acute rejection. Beyond three months, average graft function was lower in the arms combining sirolimus with CsA than in the control groups. This is probably due to potentiation by sirolimus of CsA nephrotoxicity. Long-term use of the combination of sirolimus plus CsA is,  thus,  not  recommended.  There  is  limited  information  indicating  that  black  renal  transplant recipients  (predominantly African-American) require higher doses and trough levels of sirolimus to achieve the same efficacy as observed in non-black patients. At present, the efficacy and safety data are too limited to allow recommendations for use of sirolimus in black recipients.

In trial 309, sirolimus was given as add-on to dual therapy of CsA and CS, at a nominal dose of 2 mg/day. The regimen was, thus, similar to that used in trials 301 and 302 as well as the first 3 months of study 310.  The data from study 309 documented the similar efficacy profiles of oral solution and tablet formulations.

## Sirolimus as base immunosuppressant after early discontinuation of CsA

This is the regimen proposed by the Applicant for use in patients of low to moderate immunological risk. Trials 212 and 310 provided evidence that sirolimus added to CsA and corticosteroids for 2 to 3 months, followed by progressive elimination of CsA, is associated with:

- ¾ low rates of acute rejection up to 3 months in a general Caucasian population of recipients of cadaveric and living-donor allografts.
- ¾ a small and transient rise in mild to moderate acute rejection in association with CsA tapering, but  high  graft  and  patient  survival  in  patients  suited  for  CsA  withdrawal,  which  represented approximately 80% of the enrolled patients.
- ¾ improvements in graft function and blood pressure following CsA withdrawal.

In these trials, sirolimus was used initially at 2 mg/d (212) or at a nominal 2 mg/d with target trough levels &gt;5 ng/ml (310). In study 310, this regimen resulted in an initial average daily dose of 2.1 mg and a mean trough sirolimus level of 9.8 ng/ml. The CsA regimen used resulted in exposures 30-40% lower than those in the previous 301 and 302 trials. Observed CsA troughs (10 th -90 th percentiles) in study  310  were  155-424  ng/ml  and  139-330  ng/ml  during  month  1  and  months  2-3,  respectively. When  CsA  was  withdrawn,  sirolimus  trough  levels  were  adjusted  to  10-20  ng/mL  (212)  or  20-30 ng/mL (310). The average sirolimus doses following CsA withdrawal through month 12 were 6.1 and 8.2 mg/d in studies 212 and 310, respectively. The proposed sirolimus trough range for maintenance therapy after eliminating CsA is 15-25 ng/mL by immunoassay, which corresponds to 12-20 ng/mL by HPLC-UV or LC-MS/MS.

With regard to the perceived need for new therapies, sirolimus acts selectively on activated T-cells instead of on all T-cells. There is a need for agents with the same efficacy as calcineurin inhibitors and a  different  safety  profile.  Furthermore,  an  alternative  is  needed  for  those  patients  who  fail  on calcineurin inhibitors and MMF, as well as agents that may be safer for marginal kidneys and patients with delayed graft function.

Trial 310 (performed entirely with the tablet formulation) was considered the pivotal evidence supporting the positive CPMP opinion for Rapamune oral solution. In this sense, the clinical usefulness of a tablet formulation of Rapamune, when used according to the approved indication and in a TDM-based regimen, had already been acknowledged at time of initial approval.

## Clinical safety

## Oral solution

## Patient exposure

In  the  overall  clinical  programme,  more  than 3,500  patients  and  subjects  were  enrolled  in  50  studies (2,247 of whom received at least one dose of sirolimus). The primary source of data for safety is the combined twelve-month data from the two phase III blinded trials, in which 977 (976 actually received drug) patients received at least one dose of sirolimus (500 initially received 2 mg/day and 477 initially received 5 mg/day). The control groups were 159 patients who received at least one dose of AZA and 124 patients who received at least one dose of placebo. A total of 771 patients received sirolimus in the CsA withdrawal trials (212 and 310). Additional safety data are available for 811 patients who received one or more doses of sirolimus in the completed phase I, completed phase II, and ongoing phase II and phase  III  studies.  Three  hundred  sixty-five  (365)  healthy  subjects  were  given  sirolimus  in  clinical pharmacology  studies  and  &gt;200  patients  have  been  treated  with  sirolimus  on  an  emergency  or investigator-sponsored  basis.  The  principal  populations  contributing  safety  information  are  listed  in Table 19.

## Adverse events and serious adverse events/deaths

## Adverse events in Phase III studies of the sirolimus-CsA combination (301 and 302)

For treatment Emergent Adverse Effects (TEAEs), occurring in at least 20%  of patients, hypercholesterolemia,  hyperlipemia,  and  peripheral  oedema  were  significantly  increased  in  patients treated with both 2 mg/day or 5 mg/day sirolimus, when compared with either the AZA or placebo groups. Anaemia, arthralgia, diarrhoea, and thrombocytopenia were significantly more common with 5 mg/day sirolimus than with 2 mg/day sirolimus, AZA (except anaemia), or placebo (except diarrhoea). Hyperkalemia  was  significantly  less  common  in  both  sirolimus  groups  when  compared  with  either AZA or  placebo.  Nausea  was  significantly  more  common  in  the  AZA  group  than  either  sirolimus group.  Two  other  common  events  that  differed  significantly  by  treatment  were  dyspepsia  (more common in the placebo group than all other groups), and fever (less frequent in the sirolimus 2 mg/day group than the sirolimus 5 mg/day group or AZA group).

For TEAEs occurring at a frequency of &lt; 20%, lymphocele was significantly more common in both sirolimus groups compared with both control groups. Epistaxis and increased LDH were significantly more common in the 5 mg/day sirolimus group compared with all other groups. Chills, face oedema, hypotension,  and  rash  were  more  common  in  the  5  mg/day  sirolimus  group  compared  with  the  2 mg/day  sirolimus  and  AZA  groups.  Insomnia  was  significantly  more  frequent  in  the  5  mg/day sirolimus  group  compared  with  the  2  mg/day  sirolimus  or  placebo  groups.  Leukopenia  was significantly  more  common  in  the  5  mg/day  sirolimus  group  compared  with  the  2  mg/day  group; leukopenia was also significantly more common in the AZA group than in the 2 mg/day sirolimus and placebo groups. Hypokalemia was more common in the 5 mg/day sirolimus group than in the AZA or placebo groups. Tachycardia was significantly more common in both the sirolimus groups compared with the AZA group and significantly more common in the 5 mg/day sirolimus group compared with the placebo group.

## Adverse events in pilot studies comparing sirolimus to CsA (207 and 210)

There was a significantly higher incidence of the following common TEAEs in the sirolimus group than in the CsA group: pain, diarrhoea, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hyperlipemia, hypercholesteremia, hypokalemia, and increased LDH. For less frequently occurring TEAE (between 5%  and  20%  of  patients),  the  sirolimus  group  had  a  significantly  higher  incidence  of  sepsis, hypophosphataemia,  increased  AST,  arthralgia,  epistaxis,  kidney  tubular  disorder;  while  the  CsA group had a significantly higher incidence of asthenia, chest pain, gum hyperplasia, hyperuricemia, and  tremor.  There  was  no  difference  between  the  sirolimus  and  CsA  groups  in  the  incidence  of diabetes. The sirolimus group had a lower incidence of increased creatinine level and hypertension, but these differences were not significant.

## Adverse events with sirolimus as base immunosuppressant after discontinuation of CsA (310)

The  table  below  presents  the  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  that  were  significantly  different between randomized groups in study 310. It includes 36- month data for all patients.

PTLD=posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease

## Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis

The  review  of  the  global  safety  database  for  sirolimus  disclosed  30  cases  of  interstitial  lung disease/pneumonitis. Nine cases emanated from one centre (compassionate use programme), but other cases were found in the majority of clinical trials (enrolling altogether more than 3,000 patients). It is pointed out that similar cases have been reported with AZA, CsA and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in transplant populations. Of the 30 cases, 11 had few or no obvious confounding factors and evidence of a positive dechallenge.

## Opportunistic and other severe infections in Phase III studies of the sirolimus-CsA combination (301 and 302)

Twelve-month data for opportunistic infections for studies 301 and 302 are given in Table 25. Low rates of CMV disease are reflective of prophylaxis given, recommended to be continued three months post  transplantation. Pneumocystis  carinii pneumonia  (PCP)  was  seen  only  in  sirolimus-treated patients,  which were not receiving anti-PCP prophylaxis. Observed rates during the first 12 months were low, supporting efficacy of prophylaxis, recommended as mandatory for that period.

Of 10 cases of mycobacterial infections, nine were seen with sirolimus. Overall, the incidence is not different from that reported for CsA in some published trials. According to the review of published data provided, the incidences of Herpes simplex and zoster infections seen with sirolimus are in the same range as that observed with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus in this population.

Overall, the risk for opportunistic infections during the first year with sirolimus appears comparable with that observed with MMF and tacrolimus, but higher than with the IL-2 receptor antibodies.

An  analysis  was  provided  of  the  overall  risk  of  infection  in  relation  to  sirolimus  trough  levels recorded. As expected a trend towards higher rates of infections was noted with increasing sirolimus levels for the first six months post transplantation

## Opportunistic  and  other  severe  infections  with  sirolimus  as  base  immunosuppressant  after discontinuation of CsA (310)

At 36 months, the only significant difference between groups was a higher incidence of Herpes Zoster (6.5% vs 0.9%) in patients continuing on triple-therapy, group A.

## Deaths

In studies 301 and 302, the overall patient survival at 12 months for 1004 patients receiving sirolimus was  96.2%,  comparable  with  that  for  patients  receiving  either  comparator  (96.6%).  Overall  patient survival at 12 months in the 525 patients enrolled in the larger of the CsA-withdrawal studies (310) was  94.7%,  and  there  was  no  difference  in  rates  between  patients  randomised  to  remain  on  tripletherapy (97.2%) and those in whom CsA was withdrawn (98.1%).

## Laboratory findings

## Cholesterol and triglycerides

Mean serum cholesterol and triglycerides for studies 301 and 302 are provided in the tables below. Serum lipid concentrations, which peaked at 2 months after transplantation in most sirolimus-treated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and  control  patients,  decreased  progressively  in  both  groups  thereafter.    The  magnitude  of  the differences in blood lipid concentrations between the groups also tended to decrease progressively.

Fasting  cholesterol  and  triglycerides  were  lower  in  the  310  CsA-withdrawal  study  (see  below), probably  due  to  better  recommendations  for  treatment  with  lipid-lowering  agents.  HDL-cholesterol levels were also measured in this study; they were normal or high in most patients.

## Efficacy and safety of concomitant lipid-lowering therapy

In  trials  301  and  302,  statins  were  used  in  47  and  27%  of  patients  receiving  sirolimus  and  control therapy,  respectively.  Fibrates  were  given  to  11%  of  sirolimus-treated  patients  and  4%  of  control patients.  In  study  310  at  36  months,  cumulative  use  of  statins  (75%  vs  78%)  and  fibrates  (25%  vs 26%) to control serum lipids was comparable between group A vs group B, respectively.

Lipid-lowering therapy is indicated in the majority of transplant recipients treated with sirolimus. The experience so far is that statins and/or fibrates are efficacious and can be given without remarkable increases  in  incidence  of  adverse  events.    In  study  310,  the  most  frequently  used  statin  and  fibrate were atorvastatin and gemfibrozil, respectively.

There were no observations supporting an increased risk of pancreatitis, disturbed liver function or thrombosis with sirolimus, compared with controls receiving lipid-lower therapy or related to serum lipid elevations.

## Other laboratory findings

Serum levels of LDH, AST, ALT, and CK were followed. In studies 301 and 302, mean levels of all four enzymes were generally higher in the sirolimus arms. AST and ALT levels were also higher in group  B  patients  of  study  310;  these  patients  received  higher  doses  of  sirolimus.  Generally,  the observed group mean differences were of moderate magnitude and doubtful clinical relevance.

Fasting glucose was not affected by sirolimus in any of the studies. Overall, there are no indications of a specific diabetogenic effect of sirolimus.

Sirolimus results in lower serum potassium levels and increases the frequency of hypokalemia. This is not considered to be of major clinical importance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A dose-dependent, reversible reduction in platelet counts was noted with sirolimus. Over a period of 12 months in studies 301 and 302, the incidence of treatment discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia was  0.6%  and  1.7%  in  the  sirolimus  2  mg/day  and  5  mg/day  groups,  and  1.9%  and  0.8%  in  the azathioprine and placebo groups, respectively.  As a TEAE, thrombocytopenia was reported in 13% and 24% of patients in the sirolimus 2 mg/day and 5 mg/day groups, respectively, and epistaxis, in 5% and 9% of patients, respectively. Only 1 patient in the 5-mg/day sirolimus group was reported to have experienced thrombocytopenia and mild epistaxis concurrently. Two cases of severe thrombocytopenia  (&lt;20  x  10 9 /L)  were  observed.  Discontinuations  due  to  thrombocytopenia  were mainly seen in patients subsequently diagnosed with HUS/TTP.  Leukopenia was less frequent with sirolimus  compared  with  AZA  in  trial  301(discontinuation  for  leukopenia  &lt;1%  with  sirolimus,  4% with AZA).

In  study  310  at  36  months,  mean  hemoglobin  values  (126.4  vs  132.4  g/L, P &lt;  0.001)  were significantly higher in group B patient, perhaps secondary to better renal function.  One (1) patient in the  group  A  (posttransplantation  day  378)  and  2  in  the  group  B  (days  113  and  217)  discontinued because of anemia.  White blood cell counts (7.81 vs 7.45 x 10 9 /L, group A vs group B) and platelet counts (228 vs 227 x 10 9 /L) were not significantly different between treatment groups at month 36. One (1)  SRL+CsA  patient  discontinued  because  of  leukopenia  (posttransplantation  day  395)  and  1 discontinued because of thrombocytopenia (posttransplantation day 792); no patients in the SRL group discontinued for either leukopenia or thrombocytopenia.

## Blood pressure

In studies 301 and 302, blood pressure in the sirolimus-treated patients was not significantly different from  controls.    In  study  310,  both  diastolic  and  systolic  blood  pressures  were  significantly  lower shortly following CsA withdrawal.  At 36 months, the differences in systolic (140.1 vs 131.3 mm Hg, P = 0.002) and diastolic blood pressures (81.2 vs 76.3 mm Hg, P = 0.006) remained statistically and clinically  significant  (group  A  vs  group  B,  respectively).    These  differences  were  observed  despite significantly ( P = 0.001) lower use of antihypertensive medication in-group B.

## Coated Tablets

The safety profile of sirolimus tablets was assessed in the same two trials as efficacy endpoints. In both instances the safety cannot be compared formally with non-sirolimus-containing immunosuppressive regimens.

Of the 477 patients enrolled in study 309, 457 received at least one dose of sirolimus; 229 received the solution formulation and 228 received the tablet.

The overall safety profile of sirolimus was similar to that in the previous blinded trials (301 and 302). There  were  no  differences  between  the  tablet  and  solution  groups  in  the  incidence  of  clinically relevant adverse events including tachycardia, diabetes mellitus, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, TTP, hyper- and hypokalemia, arthralgia, epistaxis, and rash. The incidence of selected, clinically important infections (sepsis, CMV infection, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and EBV) was also similar:

The overall number of deaths is 19 in the first 12 months after transplantation.  Twelve patients died during the first six months after transplantation and an additional seven died within the next 6 months. There was no significant difference in the incidence of death in the tablet (3.8%) and solution groups (4.2%). Malignancies were few: nineteen patients had histologically-confirmed malignancies during the  first  12  months  after  transplantation.  Twelve  were  from  the  tablet  group  and  seven  from  the solution group.  However, the incidence of skin carcinoma was higher in Australian patients treated with  sirolimus  compared  with  patients  from  outside  Australia,  and  overall  more  patients  in  the sirolimus  tablet-group  developed  a  skin  carcinoma  compared  with  patients  in  the  solution-group (irrespective  of  the  country). . No  reason  to  suspect  the  tablet  formulation  is  evident,  which  is corroborated by findings from trial 310.  In study 310, the rate of skin carcinoma at 12 months was 1.9% among the 525 enrolled patients; very similar to the rate of 1.7% observed for the oral solution arm in study 309.  Furthermore, no skin carcinoma cases were reported in study 310 from the time of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

randomisation  (month 3 ± 2  weeks)  through  month  12,  in  those  patients  who  had  an  increase  in sirolimus tablet dose and withdrawal of CsA, as specified in the SmPC.  With respect to this issue, the scientific Committee observed that skin tumour numbers are too small for any conclusions. However, this issue should be further monitored.

At 3 months in study 309, there was a numerically higher incidence of renal graft loss in the tablettreated group than in the oral solution-treated group (8.4% vs 5.5%, tablet vs oral solution, p = 0.270). This difference was due principally to the higher incidence of graft loss secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the tablet-treated group (incidence, 2.9%) than in the oral solution-treated group (incidence, 0.8%).  In study 310, in which more patients received the tablet formulation than in study 309 (525 in study 310 and 239 in study 309), only 1.0% of patients had a graft loss that was related to ATN.  There is no evidence to suggest that the rate of ATN-related graft loss is increased by the tablet formulation.

In study 309 at 3 months, the incidence of myocardial infarction for the tablet formulation was 1.3% (3 events; n = 228) and 0% for the oral solution formulation (n = 229).  At the study's conclusion (12 months), the incidence of myocardial infarction was 2.2% (5 events) and 0.4% (1 event) for the tablet and oral solution formulations, respectively.  In both cases, the differences were not significant. Again,  interstudy  comparison  with  trial  310  does  not  suggest  any  reason  to  suspect  the  sirolimus formulation as a causative factor.

For laboratory adverse events, no difference was found between the tablet and the solution in serum creatinine,  fasting  serum  cholesterol  and  triglyceride  levels.  Statistically  significantly  higher  mean liver enzymes (AST and ALT) were noted with the tablet compared with the solution formulation at 12 months post-transplant. However, the difference with the tablet formulation was not considered to achieve clinical significance. The most likely explanation is the slightly higher average exposure to sirolimus obtained with the tablet formulation in this dose-controlled study. Findings from trial 310 and,  indeed,  the  cumulative  experience  with  sirolimus  provide  clear  evidence  that  higher  sirolimus doses/trough concentrations expose patients to a greater risk of liver toxicity.

## Post-authorisation study 316 in high-risk and low-risk patients

Trial 316-EU is an open label, multicentre trial over 208 weeks to evaluate a randomised switch from calcineurin inhibitor-based [CNI: Ciclosporin A (CsA) or tacrolimus] triple therapy to sirolimus-based (SRL,  target  trough  12-20  ng/ml)  immunosuppression  in  stable  renal  transplant  recipients  6-120 months  post  transplantation.  The  study  aims  to  enrol  750  patients  and  was  originally  designed  to stratify to two groups: low-risk (GFR at baseline &gt;40 ml/min) and high-risk (GFR at baseline 20-40 ml/min). The primary endpoint is change from baseline in GFR at 52 weeks, and the aim was to show superiority for SRL conversion in the low risk stratum and non-inferiority in the high- risk group.

At  routine  Data  and  Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  evaluation  after  enrolment  of  400  patients, poor outcomes were noted in high-risk patients switched to SRL and inclusion into this stratum was stopped  in  August  2003  when  90  patients  had  been  recruited.  These  patients  will  be  allowed  to continue in the trial and the remaining 660 patients will come from the low-risk group. The protocol has  been  amended  accordingly  and  SRL  target  trough  has  been  adjusted  to  8-20  ng/ml  to  better comply  with  current  practice  among  investigators.  According  to  the  MAH,  subsequent  DSMB evaluation (data cut-off 11/02/2004 based on 551 patients treated for at least three months) revealed no unexpected findings and the recommendation was to continue the trial.

## Discussion on clinical safety

In the overall clinical programme, more than 3,500 patients and subjects were enrolled in 50 studies (2,247 of whom received at least one dose of sirolimus).

The most common side effects are lymphocele, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia (hyperlipidemia), hypokalaemia;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

increased  lactic  dehydrogenase  (LDH),  increased  transaminases,  arthralgia,  acne  and  urinary  tract infection.

As expected, sirolimus is associated with dose/concentration related risks for over immunosuppression with  infections,  including  opportunistic  infections.  These  have  been  reported  at  rates  which  appear comparable with those seen with MMF and tacrolimus, but higher than what has been reported with IL-2 receptor antibodies in this indication. CMV and PCP appear manageable with the recommended prophylactic regimens.

Haematological  toxicity  with  sirolimus  does  not  appear  a  major  concern  with  the  proposed  dosing regimen.

The  period  of  observation  available  is  too  limited  for  definite  evaluation  regarding  the  risk  for malignancy, including PTLD, but the submitted data do not provide any signals.

The  majority  of  patients  treated  with  sirolimus  would  be  considered  as  likely  candidates  for concomitant use of a statin or fibrate. Lipid elevations decrease with time and lipid-lowering therapy.

For the evaluation of the tablet formulation, the overall safety profile of sirolimus was similar to that found in the previous blinded trials. There were no real differences between the tablet and solution groups in the incidence of clinically relevant adverse events including tachycardia, diabetes mellitus, leukopenia,  thrombocytopenia,  TTP,  hyper-  and  hypokalemia,  arthralgia,  epistaxis,  and  rash.  The incidence of selected clinically important infections such as sepsis, CMV infection, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and EBV infection was also similar. Incidence of deaths at 12 months post-transplant was comparable in both groups. Malignancies were few, with lymphoproliferative disease/lymphoma reported  in  two  patients  in  the  tablet  group  and  three  in  the  solution  group.  With  respect  to  skin carcinoma, the CPMP observed that numbers are too small for any conclusions. However, this issue should be continuously monitored in PSURs.

There were no significant differences in the rates of discontinuation  during  treatment.  Although  no significant  difference  between the  groups was reported for most of the adverse events, it should be noted  that  during  the  first  three  months  post-transplant  the  incidence  of  myocardial  infarction  was numerically higher in the tablet (1.3%) than in the solution group (0).

For laboratory adverse events, no difference was found between the tablet and the solution in serum creatinine,  fasting  serum  cholesterol  and  triglyceride  levels.  Of  some  concern  are  the  statistically significantly  higher  liver  enzymes  (AST  and  ALT)  with  the  tablet  than  the  solution  formulation particularly at 12 months post-transplant. However, the difference with the tablet formulation was not considered to achieve clinical significance.

The  findings  from  trial  310  indicate  that  high  dose  sirolimus,  while  preventing  graft  rejection  in  a regimen of CsA withdrawal, may expose patients to a greater risk of liver toxicity.  Cumulative data obtained from trial 310 indicates that the main safety concerns of hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, hyperlipidaemia, thrombocytopenia and overimmunosuppression do not show trends to increase over time.  The trial is ongoing to provide long-term safety and patient outcome data

Overall, studies 309 and 310 provide evidence of equivalence between sirolimus tablets and solution in  terms  of  safety.  However,  the  findings  also  confirm  a  potential  risk  of  toxicity,  particularity hepatotoxicity, when sirolimus is employed at high doses. The need for close drug monitoring has to be considered.

In  a  study  evaluating  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  conversion  from  calcineurin  inhibitors  to  sirolimus (target levels of 12 - 20 ng/ml) in maintenance renal transplant patients, enrollment was stopped in the subset  of  patients  with  a  calculated  baseline  glomerular  filtration  rate  (Nankivell  method)  of  &lt;  40 ml/min due to a higher rate of serious adverse events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety issues observed during trials for other transplant types (no authorised indication)

The use of sirolimus in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss in a study in de novo liver transplant patients.  Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death.  In this and another study in de novo liver transplant recipients, the use of sirolimus in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation and most led to graft loss or death.  The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients, and therefore such use is not recommended.

Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, mostly fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen.

## 5. Overall conclusion and benefit risk assessment

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.    Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology

Overall,  the  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  provided  adequate  evidence  that  sirolimus  is  an immunosuppressive and antiproliferative agent that prevents allograft rejection in animal models of organ transplantation.

The kidney is a target organ for toxicity of the related macrocyclic, tacrolimus, but pancreatic toxicity has  also  been  reported.  In  the  case  of  tacrolimus,  renal  and  pancreatic  toxicity  were  considered  of greatest  concern. The general pharmacology studies indicated that renal toxicity with sirolimus is a minor effect. Although the potential for nephrotoxic effects appears lower with sirolimus than for CsA or tacrolimus, the toxicity was enhanced in combination with CsA.

Toxic effects of sirolimus were evident at systemic exposure levels providing (little or) no margins of exposure to expected clinical levels. Species differences in tolerance were evident. The effect on bone is a concern. Young animals were more susceptible to this effect.

The toxicology programme revealed that reactions that appear 'unique' for sirolimus were pulmonary alveolar macrophages, increased haemosiderosis and haematopoiesis, indicative of an increase in red blood cell turnover, and possibly skins toxicity (ulcers mainly in mouse).

Sirolimus did not induce any significant mutagenic or clastogenic effects, with or without metabolic activation, in the standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests for genotoxicity.

Carcinogenicity  studies  with  sirolimus  indicate  that  the  intrinsic  potential  for  carcinogenicity  was secondary to that induced by the pharmacological action.

Sirolimus has a predictable toxicity profile with both similarities and differences to other immunosuppressants. Most of the toxic effects have been reported with other immunosuppressants or represented expected exaggerated pharmacological effects.

## Clinical Efficacy

All  data  submitted  for  assessment  referred  to  kidney  transplant  recipients  at  low  to  moderate immunological risk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sirolimus as add-on to CsA

Trials 301 and 302 tested fixed doses of sirolimus, 2 or 5 mg/d as add-on to conventionally dosed CsA and CS. Both doses were efficacious. In the risk/benefit evaluation, no benefit of the 5 mg/d dose was demonstrated,  and  this  was  subsequently  withdrawn  by  the  Applicant.  Renal  function  was  reduced compared to control therapy when the CsA-sirolimus combination was used beyond 3 months.

Studies  212  and  310  provided  supportive  evidence  that  sirolimus  as  add-on  to  CsA  and  CS  is associated with low rates of acute rejection and high graft and patient survival. These trials, moreover, used lower CsA exposures than studies 301 and 302. Immunosuppressive efficacy of sirolimus as addon to CsA and CS is considered acceptably documented as regards prevention of acute rejection in patients of low to moderate immunological risk. Due to the unfavourable effect of the CsA-sirolimus combination  on  graft  function,  maintenance  therapy  with  sirolimus  is  not  recommended  in  patients where CsA cannot be discontinued.

## Sirolimus as base immunosuppressant after discontinuation of CsA

The  observed,  adverse  effects  on  graft  function  of  the  sirolimus  plus  CsA  combination  prompted renewed  exploration  of  sirolimus  as  monotherapy  in  combination  with  CS  after  tapering  and discontinuation of CsA in trials 212 and 310. Twelve-month data from trial 310 were available during the  marketing  authorisation  procedure.  These  data  indicated  that,  in  the  population  studied,  this regimen is compatible with good graft and patient survival, despite a transient increase in the rate of mild to moderate acute rejections. Longer-term 24 support this conclusion and 36-month data supplied post-marketing. Graft function and blood pressure improved when CsA was withdrawn. The observed adverse interaction of sirolimus and CsA on graft function would mandate that CsA be progressively withdrawn after 2-3 months, if patients remain on sirolimus maintenance therapy.

## Coated tablet

The clinical experience with a tablet formulation of Rapamune derives from trials 309 and 310. Both studies used an oval tablet presentation and the currently proposed triangular tablet has not been tested in clinical trials.

Trial  310  (performed  entirely  with  the  tablet  formulation)  was  considered  the  pivotal  evidence supporting the positive CPMP opinion for Rapamune oral solution.

The  other  trial  (309)  was  a  one-year,  multicentre,  parallel  group  study  that  enrolled  477,  largely primary,  recipients  of  a  renal  allograft.  This  trial  presented  compared  sirolimus  tablets  (oval)  and solution in a combination regimen (fixed-dose sirolimus plus continuous full-dose CsA) that has been clearly identified as unsuitable. In this study, no statistically significant differences in primary efficacy outcome  could  be  seen  between  tablets  and  oral  solution.  Considering  the  specific  indication  and TDM-based regimen approved by CPMP for sirolimus oral solution and which are also applicable to the  proposed  tablet  formulation,  these  findings  are  not  considered  important  for  determination  of suitability of a tablet formulation per se and, thus, not critical to the approval of the tablet formulation.

## Safety

In the overall clinical programme, more than 3,500 patients and subjects were enrolled in 50 studies (2,247 of whom received at least one dose of sirolimus)

.

Sirolimus  is  associated  with  dose/concentration  related  risks  for  over  immunosuppression  with infections,  including  opportunistic  infections.  These  have  been  reported  at  rates  which  appear comparable with those seen with MMF and tacrolimus, but higher than what has been reported with IL-2 receptor antibodies in this indication. CMV and PCP appear manageable with the recommended prophylactic regimens.

Haematological toxicity with sirolimus occurs in a dose-related manner, but does not appear a major concern with the proposed dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  period  of  observation  available  is  too  limited  for  definite  evaluation  regarding  the  risk  for malignancy, including PTLD, but the submitted data do not provide any signals.

A majority of sirolimus-treated patients develop hyperlipidemia. By 12 months, lipid-lowering therapy was effective in lowering serum lipids to values similar to those in the 301/302 control groups, without notable increases in adverse events.  When used with the proposed regimen of CsA withdrawal at 3 months, sirolimus maintenance therapy was associated with lower blood pressure and normal to high HDL-cholesterol  levels.  The  long-term  impact  of  sirolimus  on  cardiovascular  risk  has  not  been established.

## Coated tablets

Overall, studies 309 and 310 provide evidence of equivalence between sirolimus tablets and solution in terms of safety. However, the findings also confirm a potential risk of toxicity, particularity hepatotoxicity, when sirolimus is employed at high doses. The need for close drug monitoring has to be considered.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Rapamune  was  favourable.  Rapamune  is  indicated  for  the prophylaxis  of  organ  rejection  in  adult  patients  at  low  to  moderate  immunological  risk  receiving  a renal transplant.  It is recommended that Rapamune be used initially in combination with cyclosporine microemulsion and corticosteroids for 2 to 3 months.  Rapamune may be continued as maintenance therapy with corticosteroids only if cyclosporine can be progressively discontinued..
