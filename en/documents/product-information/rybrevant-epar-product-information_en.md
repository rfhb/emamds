## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Rybrevant 350 mg concentrate for solution for infusion.

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

One mL of concentrate for solution for infusion contains 50 mg amivantamab. One 7 mL vial contains 350 mg of amivantamab.

Amivantamab is a fully-human Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)-based bispecific antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and mesenchymal-epidermal transition (MET) receptors, produced by a mammalian cell line (Chinese Hamster Ovary [CHO]) using recombinant DNA technology.

## Excipient with known effect:

One mL of solution contains 0.6 mg of polysorbate 80.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Concentrate for solution for infusion.

The solution is colourless to pale yellow, with a pH of 5.7 and an osmolality of approximately 310 mOsm/kg.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Rybrevant is indicated:

-  in combination with lazertinib for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR Exon 19 deletions or Exon 21 L858R substitution mutations.
-  in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed for the treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR Exon 19 deletions or Exon 21 L858R substitution mutations after failure of prior therapy including an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).
-  in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations.
-  as monotherapy for treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations, after failure of platinum-based therapy.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with Rybrevant should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products.

Rybrevant should be administered by a healthcare professional with access to appropriate medical support to manage infusion-related reactions (IRRs) if they occur.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Before initiation of Rybrevant therapy, EGFR mutation status in tumour tissue or plasma specimens must be established using a validated test method. If no mutation is detected in a plasma specimen, tumour tissue should be tested if available in sufficient amount and quality due to the potential for false negative results using a plasma-test. Testing may be performed at any time from initial diagnosis until the initiation of therapy; testing does not need to be repeated once EGFR mutation status has been established (see section 5.1).

## Posology

Premedications should be administered to reduce the risk of IRRs with Rybrevant (see below 'Dose modifications' and 'Recommended concomitant medicinal products').

## Every 3 weeks

The recommended dosages of Rybrevant, when used in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed, is provided in Table 1 (see below 'Infusion rates' and Table 5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Duration of treatment

It is recommended that patients are treated with Rybrevant until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

## Missed dose

If a planned dose is missed, the dose should be administered as soon as possible and the dosing schedule should be adjusted accordingly, maintaining the treatment interval.

## Dose modifications

Dosing should be interrupted for Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions until the adverse reaction resolves to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. If an interruption is 7 days or less, restart at the current dose. If an interruption is longer than 7 days, it is recommended restarting at a reduced dose as presented in Table 3. See also specific dose modifications for specific adverse reactions below Table 3.

If used in combination with lazertinib, refer to section 4.2 of the lazertinib Summary of Product Characteristics for information about dose modifications.

## Infusion-related reactions

Infusion should be interrupted at the first sign of IRRs. Additional supportive medicinal products (e.g., additional glucocorticoids, antihistamine, antipyretics and antiemetics) should be administered as clinically indicated (see section 4.4).

-  Grade 1-3 (mild-severe): Upon recovery from symptoms, resume infusion at 50% of the previous rate. If there are no additional symptoms, the rate may be increased per the recommended infusion rate (see Tables 5 and 6). Concomitant medicinal products should be administered at the next dose (including dexamethasone (20 mg) or equivalent (see Table 4).
-  Recurrent Grade 3 or Grade 4 (life-threatening): Permanently discontinue Rybrevant.

## Venous thromboembolic (VTE) events with concomitant use with lazertinib

At the initiation of treatment, prophylactic anticoagulants should be administered to prevent VTE events in patients receiving Rybrevant in combination with lazertinib. Consistent with clinical guidelines, patients should receive prophylactic dosing of either a direct acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) or a low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Use of Vitamin K antagonists is not recommended.

For VTE events associated with clinical instability (e.g., respiratory failure or cardiac dysfunction), both drugs should be withheld until the patient is clinically stable. Thereafter, both medicinal products can be resumed at the same dose. In the event of recurrence despite appropriate anticoagulation, discontinue Rybrevant. Treatment can continue with lazertinib at the same dose.

## Skin and nail reactions

Prophylactic therapy with oral and topical antibiotics is recommended to reduce the risk and severity of skin and nail reactions in patients receiving Rybrevant. Non-comedogenic skin moisturiser (ceramide-based or other formulations that provide long lasting skin hydration and exclude drying agents are preferred) on the face and whole body (except scalp) and chlorhexidine solution to wash hands and feet is also recommended. Patients should be instructed to limit sun exposure during and for 2 months after Rybrevant therapy. For further information about prophylaxis for skin and nail reactions, see section 4.4.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If the patient develops a Grade 1-2 skin or nail reaction, supportive care should be initiated as clinically indicated; if there is no improvement after 2 weeks, dose reduction should be considered for persistent Grade 2 rash (see Table 3). If the patient develops a Grade 3 skin or nail reaction, supportive care should be initiated as clinically indicated, and interruption of Rybrevant should be considered until the adverse reaction improves. Upon recovery of the skin or nail reaction to ≤ Grade 2, Rybrevant should be resumed at a reduced dose. If the patient develops Grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue Rybrevant (see section 4.4).

## Interstitial lung disease

Rybrevant should be withheld if interstitial lung disease (ILD) or ILD-like adverse reactions (pneumonitis) is suspected. If the patient is confirmed to have ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions (e.g., pneumonitis), permanently discontinue Rybrevant (see section 4.4).

## Recommended concomitant medicinal products

Two days before the first infusion:

During the two days prior to the initial Rybrevant infusion, patients should receive 8 mg dexamethasone orally, twice daily.

## Day of infusion:

On the day of the initial infusion (Week 1, Day 1), patients should receive 8 mg dexamethasone orally, one hour prior to infusion in addition to intravenous dexamethasone to further reduce the risk of IRRs.

Prior to infusion (Week 1, Days 1 and 2), antihistamines, antipyretics, and glucocorticoids should be administered to reduce the risk of IRRs (see Table 4). For subsequent doses, antihistamines and antipyretics are required to be administered. Glucocorticoids should also be re-initiated after prolonged dose interruptions. Antiemetics should be administered as needed.

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of amivantamab in the paediatric population in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

## Elderly

No dose adjustments are necessary (see section 4.8, section 5.1, and section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No formal studies of amivantamab in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. Based on population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

moderate renal impairment. Caution is required in patients with severe renal impairment as amivantamab has not been studied in this patient population (see section 5.2). If treatment is started, patients should be monitored for adverse reactions with dose modifications per the recommendations above.

## Hepatic impairment

No formal studies of amivantamab in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. Based on population PK analyses, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Caution is required in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment as amivantamab has not been studied in this patient population (see section 5.2). If treatment is started, patients should be monitored for adverse reactions with dose modifications per the recommendations above.

## Method of administration

Rybrevant is for intravenous use. It is administered as an intravenous infusion following dilution with sterile 5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Rybrevant must be administered with in-line filtration.

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## Infusion rates

Following dilution, the infusion should be administered intravenously at the infusion rates presented in Table 5 or 6 below. Due to the frequency of IRRs at the first dose, amivantamab should be infused via a peripheral vein at Week 1 and Week 2; infusion via a central line may be administered for subsequent weeks when the risk of IRR is lower (see section 6.6). It is recommended for the first dose to be prepared as close to administration as possible to maximise the likelihood of completing the infusion in the event of an IRR.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Infusion-related reactions

Infusion-related reactions commonly occurred in patients treated with amivantamab (see section 4.8).

Prior to initial infusion (Week 1), antihistamines, antipyretics, and glucocorticoids should be administered to reduce the risk of IRRs. For subsequent doses, antihistamines and antipyretics should be administered. The initial infusion should be administered in split doses on Week 1, Day 1 and 2.

Patients should be treated in a setting with appropriate medical support to treat IRRs. Infusions should be interrupted at the first sign of IRRs of any severity and post-infusion medicinal products should be administered as clinically indicated. Upon resolution of symptoms, the infusion should be resumed at 50% of the previous rate. For recurrent Grade 3 or Grade 4 IRRs, Rybrevant should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2).

## Interstitial lung disease

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) or ILD-like adverse reactions (e.g., pneumonitis) have been reported in patients treated with amivantamab, including fatal events (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnoea, cough, fever). If symptoms develop, treatment with Rybrevant should be interrupted pending investigation of these symptoms. Suspected ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions should be evaluated and appropriate treatment should be initiated as necessary. Rybrevant should be permanently discontinued in patients with confirmed ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions (see section 4.2).

## Venous thromboembolic (VTE) events with concomitant use with lazertinib

In patients receiving Rybrevant in combination with lazertinib, VTE events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), including fatal events, were reported (see section 4.8). Consistent with clinical guidelines, patients should receive prophylactic dosing of either a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

direct acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) or a low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Use of Vitamin K antagonists is not recommended.

Signs and symptoms of VTE events should be monitored. Patients with VTE events should be treated with anticoagulation as clinically indicated. For VTE events associated with clinical instability treatment should be withheld until the patient is clinically stable. Thereafter, both drugs can be resumed at the same dose.

In the event of recurrence despite appropriate anticoagulation, Rybrevant should be discontinued. Treatment can continue with lazertinib at the same dose (see section 4.2).

## Skin and nail reactions

Rash (including dermatitis acneiform), pruritus, dry skin, and skin ulcer occurred in patients treated with amivantamab (see section 4.8). Patients should be instructed to limit sun exposure during and for 2 months after Rybrevant therapy. Protective clothing and use of broad-spectrum UVA/UVB sunscreen are advisable. A prophylactic approach to rash prevention is recommended. This includes prophylactic therapy, at treatment initiation, with an oral antibiotic (e.g., doxycycline or minocycline, 100 mg twice daily) starting on Day 1 for the first 12 weeks of treatment and after completion of oral antibiotic therapy, topical antibiotic lotion to the scalp (e.g., clindamycin 1%) for the next 9 months of treatment. Non-comedogenic skin moisturiser (ceramide-based or other formulations that provide long-lasting skin hydration and exclude drying agents are preferred) on the face and whole body (except scalp) and chlorhexidine solution to wash hands and feet is recommended beginning on Day 1 and continued for the duration of treatment.

Prescriptions for topical and/or oral antibiotics and topical corticosteroids are recommended to be available at the time of initial dosing to minimise any delay in reactive management should rash develop despite prophylactic treatment. If skin reactions develop, supportive care, topical corticosteroids and topical and/or oral antibiotics should be administered. For Grade 3 or poorly-tolerated Grade 2 events, systemic antibiotics and oral steroids should also be administered. Patients presenting with severe rash that has an atypical appearance or distribution or lack improvement within 2 weeks should be referred promptly to a dermatologist. Rybrevant should be dose reduced, interrupted, or permanently discontinued based on severity (see section 4.2) .

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) has been reported. Treatment with this medicinal product should be discontinued if TEN is confirmed.

## Eye disorders

Eye disorders, including keratitis, occurred in patients treated with amivantamab (see section 4.8). Patients presenting with worsening eye symptoms should promptly be referred to an ophthalmologist and should discontinue use of contact lenses until symptoms are evaluated. For dose modifications for Grade 3 or 4 eye disorders, see section 4.2.

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. This medicinal product may be diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion. This should be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet (see section 6.6).

## Polysorbate content

This medicinal product contains 0.6 mg of polysorbate 80 in each mL, which is equivalent to 4.2 mg per 7 mL vial. Polysorbates may cause hypersensitivity reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No drug interaction studies have been performed. As an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, renal excretion and hepatic enzyme-mediated metabolism of intact amivantamab are unlikely to be major elimination routes. As such, variations in drug-metabolising enzymes are not expected to affect the elimination of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

amivantamab. Due to the high affinity to a unique epitope on EGFR and MET, amivantamab is not anticipated to alter drug-metabolising enzymes.

## Vaccines

No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations in patients taking amivantamab. Avoid the use of live or live-attenuated vaccines while patients are taking amivantamab.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of child-bearing potential/Contraception

Women of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during and for 3 months after cessation of amivantamab treatment.

## Pregnancy

There are no human data to assess the risk of amivantamab use during pregnancy. No animal reproductive studies were conducted to inform a drug-associated risk. Administration of EGFR and MET inhibitor molecules in pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of impairment of embryo-foetal development, embryo lethality, and abortion. Therefore, based on its mechanism of action and findings in animal models, amivantamab could cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Amivantamab should not be given during pregnancy unless the benefit of treatment of the woman is considered to outweigh potential risks to the foetus. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this medicinal product the patient should be informed of the potential risk to the foetus (see section 5.3).

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether amivantamab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon afterwards. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded during this short period just after birth, although IgGs are likely to be degraded in the gastrointestinal tract of the breast-fed child and not absorbed. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from amivantamab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effect of amivantamab on human fertility. Effects on male and female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Rybrevant may have moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Please see section 4.8 (e.g., dizziness, fatigue, visual impairment). If patients experience treatment-related symptoms, including vision-related adverse reactions, affecting their ability to concentrate and react, it is recommended that they do not drive or use machines until the effect subsides.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

In the dataset of amivantamab as monotherapy (N=380), the most frequent adverse reactions in all grades were rash (76%), infusion-related reactions (67%), nail toxicity (47%), hypoalbuminaemia (31%), oedema (26%), fatigue (26%), stomatitis (24%), nausea (23%), and constipation (23%). Serious adverse reactions included ILD (1.3%), IRR (1.1%), and rash (1.1%). Three percent of patients discontinued Rybrevant due to adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were IRR (1.1%), ILD (0.5%), and nail toxicity (0.5%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 7 summarises the adverse drug reactions that occurred in patients receiving amivantamab as monotherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The data reflects exposure to amivantamab in 380 patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients received amivantamab 1050 mg (for patients &lt; 80 kg) or 1400 mg (for patients ≥ 80 kg). The median exposure to amivantamab was 4.1 months (range: 0.0 to 39.7 months).

Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below by frequency category. Frequency categories are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10000 to &lt; 1/1000); very rare (&lt; 1/10000); and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).

Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

## Summary of the safety profile

In the dataset of amivantamab in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed (N=301), the most frequent adverse reactions in all grades were rash (83%), neutropenia (57%), nail toxicity (53%), infusion related reactions (51%), fatigue (43%), stomatitis (39%), nausea (43%), thrombocytopenia (40%), constipation (40%), oedema (40%), decreased appetite (33%), hypoalbuminaemia (32%), alanine aminotransferase increased (26%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (23%), vomiting (22%), and hypokalaemia (20%). Serious adverse reactions included rash (2.7%), venous thromboembolism (2.3%), thrombocytopenia (2.3%) and ILD (2.0%). Eight percent of patients discontinued Rybrevant due to adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were IRR (2.7%), rash (2.3%), ILD (2.3%), and nail toxicity (1.0%).

Table 8 summarises the adverse drug reactions that occurred in patients receiving amivantamab in combination with chemotherapy.

The data reflects exposure to amivantamab in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed in 301 patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Patients received amivantamab 1400 mg (for patients &lt; 80 kg) or 1750 mg (for patients ≥ 80 kg) weekly for 4 weeks. Starting at Week 7, patients received amivantamab 1750 mg (for patients &lt; 80 kg) or 2100 mg (for patients ≥ 80 kg) every 3 weeks. The median exposure to amivantamab in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed was 7.7 months (range: 0.0 to 28.1 months).

Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below by frequency category. Frequency categories are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10000 to &lt; 1/1000); very rare (&lt; 1/10000); and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).

Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

## Summary of the safety profile

In the dataset of amivantamab in combination with lazertinib (N=421), the most frequent adverse reactions in all grades were rash (89%), nail toxicity (71%), infusion-related reactions (63%), hypoalbuminaemia (48%), hepatotoxicity (47%), oedema (47%), stomatitis (43%), venous thromboembolism (37%), paraesthesia (lazertinib) (34%), fatigue (32%), diarrhoea (29%), constipation (29%), dry skin (26%), pruritus (24%), decreased appetite (24%), hypocalcaemia (21%), nausea (21%) and other eye disorders (21%). The most frequent serious adverse reactions included venous thromboembolism (11%), pneumonia (4.0%), rash (3.1%), ILD/pneumonitis (2.9%), hepatotoxicity (2.4%), COVID-19 (2.4%), and IRR and pleural effusion (2.1%). Twenty-three percent of patients discontinued Rybrevant due to adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to Rybrevant discontinuation were rash (5.5%), infusion related reactions (4.5%), nail toxicity (3.6%), ILD (2.9%) and VTE (2.9%).

Table 9 summarises the adverse drug reactions that occurred in patients receiving amivantamab in combination with lazertinib.

The data reflects exposure to amivantamab in combination with lazertinib in 421 patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Patients received amivantamab 1050 mg (for patients &lt; 80 kg) or 1400 mg (for patients ≥ 80 kg) once weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks thereafter. The median exposure to study treatment in the amivantamab and lazertinib combination group was 18.5 months (range: 0.2 to 31.4 months).

Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below by frequency category. Frequency categories are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(≥ 1/1000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10000 to &lt; 1/1000); very rare (&lt; 1/10000); and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).

Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Infusion-related reactions

In patients treated with amivantamab monotherapy, infusion-related reactions occurred in 67% of patients. Ninety-eight percent of IRRs were Grade 1-2. Ninety-nine percent of IRRs occurred at the first infusion with a median time to onset of 60 minutes, and the majority occurring within 2 hours of infusion start. The most frequent signs and symptoms include chills, dyspnoea, nausea, flushing, chest discomfort, and vomiting (see section 4.4).

In patients treated with amivantamab in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed, infusion-related reactions occurred in 50% of patients. Greater than 94% of IRRs were Grade 1-2. A majority of IRRs occurred at the first infusion with a median time to onset of 60 minutes (range 0-7 hours), and the majority occurring within 2 hours of infusion start. Occasionally an IRR can occur at re-initiation of amivantamab after prolonged dose interruptions of more than 6 weeks.

In patients treated with amivantamab in combination with lazertinib, infusion-related reactions occurred in 63% of patients. Ninety-four percent of IRRs were Grade 1-2. A majority of IRRs occurred at the first infusion with a median time to onset of 1 hour, and the majority occurring within 2 hours of infusion start. The most frequent signs and symptoms include chills, dyspnoea, nausea, flushing, chest discomfort, and vomiting (see section 4.4)

Occasionally an IRR can occur at re-initiation of amivantamab after prolonged dose interruptions of more than 6 weeks.

In a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study in patients with NSCLC, patients were administered 8 mg dexamethasone orally, twice daily on both of the two days prior to the first Rybrevant infusion and 8 mg orally, 60 minutes prior to infusion on the day of the first infusion (5 doses total) in addition to intravenous dexamethasone. With the addition of oral dexamethasone, a 22.5% incidence of IRRs and no grade ≥3 IRRs were reported on the day of the initial infusion (see section 4.2).

## Interstitial lung disease

Interstitial lung disease or ILD-like adverse reactions have been reported with the use of amivantamab as well as with other EGFR inhibitors. Interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis was reported in 2.6% of patients treated with amivantamab monotherapy, 2.3 % of patients treated with amivantamab in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed and 3.1% of patients treated with amivantamab in combination with lazertinib, including 1 (0.2%) fatal case. Patients with a medical history of ILD, drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis that required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active ILD were excluded from the clinical study (see section 4.4).

## Venous thromboembolic (VTE) events with concomitant use with lazertinib

When Rybrevant is used in combination with lazertinib, VTE events, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), were reported in 37% of the 421 patients receiving Rybrevant in combination with lazertinib. Most cases were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3-4 events occurring in 11% of patients receiving Rybrevant in combination with lazertinib and deaths occurring in 0.5% of patients receiving Rybrevant in combination with lazertinib. For information on prophylactic anticoagulants and management of VTE events, see sections 4.2 and 4.4. In patients receiving Rybrevant in combination with lazertinib, the median time to first onset of a VTE event was 84 days. VTE events led to Rybrevant treatment discontinuation in 2.9% of patients.

## Skin and nail reactions

Rash (including dermatitis acneiform), pruritus, and dry skin occurred in 76% of patients treated with amivantamab alone. Most cases were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 rash events occurring in 3% of patients. Rash leading to amivantamab discontinuation occurred in 0.3% of patients. Rash usually developed within the first 4 weeks of therapy, with a median time to onset of 14 days. Nail toxicity occurred in patients treated with amivantamab. Most events were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 nail toxicity occurring in 1.8% of patients.

Rash (including dermatitis acneiform), occurred in 83% of patients treated with amivantamab in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed. Most cases were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 rash events occurring in 14% of patients. Rash leading to amivantamab discontinuation occurred in 2.3% of patients. Rash usually developed within the first 4 weeks of therapy, with a median time to onset of 14 days. Nail toxicity occurred in patients treated with amivantamab in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed. Most events were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 nail toxicity occurring in 4.3% of patients (see section 4.4).

Rash (including dermatitis acneiform), occurred in 89% of patients treated with amivantamab in combination with lazertinib. Most cases were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 rash events occurring in 27% of patients. Rash leading to amivantamab discontinuation occurred in 5.5% of patients. Rash usually developed within the first 4 weeks of therapy, with a median time to onset of 14 days. Nail toxicity occurred in patients treated with amivantamab in combination with lazertinib. Most events were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 nail toxicity occurring in 11% of patients (see section 4.4).

A Phase 2 study in patients treated with Rybrevant in combination with lazertinib was conducted to assess the use of prophylactic therapy with an oral antibiotic, a topical antibiotic on the scalp, a moisturiser on the face and whole body (except scalp), and an antiseptic on hands and feet (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). A reduction in the incidence of ≥ Grade 2 dermatologic adverse events during the first 12 weeks of treatment was demonstrated, compared with the standard dermatologic management used in clinical practice (38.6% vs. 76.5%, p&lt;0.0001). In addition, there was a reduction in ≥ Grade 2 adverse events involving the scalp in the first 12 weeks of treatment (8.6% vs. 29.4%) along with lower incidence of dose reductions (7.1% vs. 19.1%), interruptions (15.7% vs. 33.8%), and treatment discontinuations (1.4% vs. 4.4%) due to dermatological adverse events.

## Eye disorders

Eye disorders, including keratitis (0.5%), occurred in 9% of patients treated with amivantamab alone. Other reported adverse reactions included growth of eyelashes, visual impairment, and other eye disorders. All events were Grade 1-2.

Eye disorders, including keratitis (0.3%), occurred in 11% of patients treated with amivantamab in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed. Other reported adverse reactions included growth of eyelashes, visual impairment, uveitis, and other eye disorders. All events were Grade 1-2 (see section 4.4).

Eye disorders, including keratitis (2.6%) occurred in patients treated with amivantamab in combination with lazertinib. Other reported adverse reactions included growth of eyelashes, visual impairment, and other eye disorders. Most events were Grade 1-2 (see section 4.4).

## Special populations

## Elderly

There are limited clinical data with amivantamab in patients 75 years of age or over (see section 5.1). No overall differences in safety were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age and patients &lt; 65 years of age.

## Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. In clinical studies of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with amivantamab, 4 of the 1862 (0.2%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

participants who were treated with Rybrevant and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-amivantamab antibodies. There was no evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic, efficacy, or safety profile due to anti-amivantamab antibodies.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No maximum tolerated dose has been determined in a clinical study in which patients received up to 2100 mg administered intravenously. There is no known specific antidote for amivantamab overdose. In the event of an overdose, treatment with Rybrevant should be stopped, the patient should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse events and appropriate general supportive measures should be instituted immediately until clinical toxicity has diminished or resolved.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, ATC code: L01FX18.

## Mechanism of action

Amivantamab is a low-fucose, fully-human IgG1-based EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity that targets tumours with activating EGFR mutations such as Exon 19 deletions, Exon 21 L858R substitution, and Exon 20 insertion mutations. Amivantamab binds to the extracellular domains of EGFR and MET.

Amivantamab disrupts EGFR and MET signalling functions through blocking ligand binding and enhancing degradation of EGFR and MET, thereby preventing tumour growth and progression. The presence of EGFR and MET on the surface of tumour cells also allows for targeting of these cells for destruction by immune effector cells, such as natural killer cells and macrophages, through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and trogocytosis mechanisms, respectively.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Albumin

Amivantamab decreased serum albumin concentration, a pharmacodynamic effect of MET inhibition, typically during the first 8 weeks (see section 4.8); thereafter, albumin concentration stabilised for the remainder of amivantamab treatment.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Previously-untreated NSCLC with EGFR Exon 19 deletions or Exon 21 L858R substitution mutations (MARIPOSA)

NSC3003 (MARIPOSA) is a randomised, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre phase 3 study assessing the efficacy and safety of Rybrevant in combination with lazertinib as compared to osimertinib monotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC not amenable to curative therapy. Patient samples were required to have one of the two common EGFR mutations (Exon 19 deletion or Exon 21 L858R substitution mutation), as identified by local testing. Tumour tissue (94%) and/or plasma (6%) samples for all patients were tested locally to determine EGFR Exon 19 deletion and/or Exon 21 L858R substitution mutation status

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 65% and next generation sequencing (NGS) in 35% of patients.

A total of 1074 patients were randomised (2:2:1) to receive Rybrevant in combination with lazertinib, osimertinib monotherapy, or lazertinib monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Rybrevant was administered intravenously at 1050 mg (for patients &lt; 80 kg) or 1400 mg (for patients ≥ 80 kg) once weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks thereafter starting at week 5. Lazertinib was administered at 240 mg orally once daily. Osimertinib was administered at a dose of 80 mg orally once daily. Randomisation was stratified by EGFR mutation type (Exon 19 deletion or Exon 21 L858R), race (Asian or non-Asian), and history of brain metastasis (yes or no).

Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced across the treatment arms. The median age was 63 (range: 25-88) years with 45% of patients ≥ 65 years; 62% were female; and 59% were Asian, and 38% were White. Baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 0 (34%) or 1 (66%); 69% never smoked; 41% had prior brain metastases; and 90% had Stage IV cancer at initial diagnosis. With regard to EGFR mutation status, 60% were Exon 19 deletions and 40% were Exon 21 L858R substitution mutations.

Rybrevant in combination with lazertinib demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) by BICR assessment.

The final analysis of OS demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for Rybrevant in combination with lazertinib compared to osimertinib (see Table 10 and Figure 2).

## Previously treated NSCLC with EGFR Exon 19 deletions or Exon 21 L858R substitution mutations (MARIPOSA-2)

MARIPOSA-2 is a randomised (2:2:1) open-label, multicentre Phase 3 study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR Exon 19 deletions or Exon 21 L858R substitution mutations (mutation testing could have been performed at or after the time of locally advanced or metastatic disease diagnosis. Testing did not need to be repeated at the time of study entry once EGFR mutation status was previously established) after failure of prior therapy including a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). A total of 657 patients were randomised in the study, of which 263 received carboplatin and pemetrexed (CP); and 131 which received Rybrevant in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed (Rybrevant-CP) . Additionally, 263 patients were randomised to receive Rybrevant in combination with lazertinib, carboplatin, and pemetrexed in a separate arm of the study. Rybrevant was administered intravenously at 1400 mg (for patients &lt; 80 kg) or 1750 mg (for patients ≥ 80 kg) once weekly through 4 weeks, then every 3 weeks with a dose of 1750 mg (for patients &lt; 80 kg) or 2100 mg (for patients ≥ 80 kg) starting at Week 7 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Carboplatin was administered intravenously at area under the concentration-time curve 5 mg/mL per minute (AUC 5) once every 3 weeks, for up to 12 weeks. Pemetrexed was administered intravenously at 500 mg/m 2 once every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients were stratified by osimertinib line of therapy (first-line or second-line), prior brain metastases (yes or no), and Asian race (yes or no).

Of the 394 patients randomised to the Rybrevant-CP arm or CP arm, the median age was 62 (range: 31-85) years, with 38% of the patients ≥ 65 years of age; 60% were female; and 48% were Asian and 46% were White. Baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 0 (40%) or 1 (60%); 66% never smoked; 45% had history of brain metastasis, and 92% had Stage IV cancer at initial diagnosis.

Rybrevant in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to carboplatin and pemetrexed, with a HR of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.64; p&lt;0.0001). At the time of the second interim analysis for OS, with a median follow-up of approximately 18.6 months for Rybrevant-CP and approximately 17.8 months for CP, the OS HR was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.99; p=0.0386). This was not statistically significant (tested at a prespecified significance level of 0.0142).

## Intracranial metastases efficacy data

Patients with asymptomatic or previously treated and stable intracranial metastases were eligible to be randomised in MARIPOSA-2. Treatment with Rybrevant-CP was associated with a numeric increase in intracranial ORR (23.3% for Rybrevant-CP versus 16.7% for CP, odds ratio of 1.52; 95% CI (0.51, 4.50), and intracranial DOR (13.3 months; 95% CI (1.4, NE) in the Rybrevant-CP arm compared with 2.2 months; 95% CI (1.4, NE) in the CP arm). The median follow-up for Rybrevant-CP was approximately 18.6 months.

## Previously-untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with Exon 20 insertion mutations (PAPILLON)

PAPILLON is a randomised, open-label, multicentre Phase 3 study comparing treatment with Rybrevant in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed to chemotherapy alone (carboplatin and pemetrexed) in patients with treatment-naïve, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations. Tumour tissue (92.2%) and/or plasma (7.8%) samples for all 308 patients were tested locally to determine EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutation status using next generation sequencing (NGS) in 55.5% of patients and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 44.5% of patients. Central testing was also performed using the AmoyDx® LC10 tissue test, Thermo Fisher Oncomine Dx Target Test, and the Guardant 360® CDx plasma test.

Patients with brain metastases at screening were eligible for participation once they were definitively treated, clinically stable, asymptomatic, and off corticosteroid treatment for at least 2 weeks prior to randomisation.

Rybrevant was administered intravenously at 1400 mg (for patients &lt; 80 kg) or 1750 mg (for patients ≥ 80 kg) once weekly through 4 weeks, then every 3 weeks with a dose of 1750 mg (for patients &lt; 80 kg) or 2100 mg (for patients ≥ 80 kg) starting at Week 7 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Carboplatin was administered intravenously at area under the concentrationtime curve 5 mg/mL per minute (AUC 5) once every 3 weeks, for up to 12 weeks. Pemetrexed was administered intravenously at 500 mg/m 2 once every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation was stratified by ECOG performance status (0 or 1), and prior brain metastases (yes or no). Patients randomised to the carboplatin and pemetrexed arm who had confirmed disease progression were permitted to cross over to receive Rybrevant monotherapy. A total of 308 subjects were randomised (1:1) to Rybrevant in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed (N=153) or carboplatin and pemetrexed (N=155). The median age was 62 (range: 27 to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

92) years, with 39% of the subjects ≥ 65 years of age; 58% were female; and 61% were Asian and 36% were White. Baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 0 (35%) or 1 (64%); 58% never smoked; 23% had history of brain metastasis and 84% had Stage IV cancer at initial diagnosis.

The primary endpoint for PAPILLON was PFS, as assessed by BICR. The median follow-up was14.9 months (range: 0.3 to 27.0).

Efficacy results are summarised in Table 13.

## Previously-treated non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) with Exon 20 insertion mutations (CHRYSALIS)

CHRYSALIS is a multicentre, open-label, multi-cohort study conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of Rybrevant in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Efficacy was evaluated in 114 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who had EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations, whose disease had progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, and who had a median follow-up of 12.5 months. Tumour tissue (93%) and/or plasma (10%) samples for all patients were tested locally to determine EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutation status using next generation sequencing (NGS) in 46% of patients and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 41% of patients; for 4% of patients, the testing methods were not specified. Patients with untreated brain metastases or a history of ILD requiring treatment with prolonged steroids or other immunosuppressive agents within the last 2 years were not eligible for the study. Rybrevant was administered intravenously at 1050 mg for patients &lt; 80 kg or 1400 mg for patients ≥ 80 kg once weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks starting at Week 5 until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR), defined as confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST v1.1. In addition, the primary endpoint was assessed by a blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of response (DOR).

The median age was 62 (range: 36-84) years, with 41% of the patients ≥ 65 years of age; 61% were female; and 52% were Asian and 37% were White. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range: 1 to 7 therapies). At baseline, 29% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 and 70% had ECOG performance status of 1; 57% never smoked; 100% had Stage IV cancer; and 25% had previous treatment for brain metastases. Insertions in Exon 20 were observed at 8 different residues; the most common residues were A767 (22%), S768 (16%), D770 (12%), and N771 (11%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Efficacy results are summarised in Table 14.

Anti-tumour activity was observed across studied mutation subtypes.

## Elderly

No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age and patients &lt; 65 years of age.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Rybrevant in all subsets of the paediatric population in non-small cell lung cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Based on Rybrevant monotherapy data, amivantamab area under the concentration-time curve (AUC1week) increases proportionally over a dose range from 350 to 1750 mg.

Based on simulations from the population pharmacokinetic model, AUC1 week was approximately 2.8-fold higher after the fifth dose for the 2-week dosing regimen and 2.6-fold higher after the fourth dose for the 3-week dosing regimen. Steady-state concentrations of amivantamab were reached by Week 13 for both the 3-week and 2-week dosing regimen and the systemic accumulation was 1.9-fold.

## Distribution

Based on the individual amivantamab PK parameter estimates in population PK analysis, the geometric mean (CV%) total volume of distribution, is 5.12 (27.8%) L, following administration of the recommended dose of Rybrevant.

## Elimination

Based on the individual amivantamab PK parameter estimates in population PK analysis, the geometric mean (CV%) linear clearance (CL) and terminal half-life associated with linear clearance is 0.266 (30.4%) L/day and 13.7 (31.9%) days respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Elderly

No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of amivantamab were observed based on age (21-88 years).

## Renal impairment

No clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of amivantamab was observed in patients with mild (60 ≤ creatinine clearance [CrCl] &lt; 90 mL/min), moderate (29 ≤ CrCl &lt; 60 mL/min) or severe (15 ≤ CrCl &lt; 29 mL/min) renal impairment. Data in patients with severe renal impairment are limited (n=1), but there is no evidence to suggest that dose adjustment is required in these patients. The effect of end-stage renal disease (CrCl &lt; 15 mL/min) on amivantamab pharmacokinetics is unknown.

## Hepatic impairment

Changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect on the elimination of amivantamab since IgG1-based molecules such as amivantamab are not metabolised through hepatic pathways.

No clinically meaningful effect in the pharmacokinetics of amivantamab was observed based on mild [(total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST &gt; ULN) or (ULN &lt; total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN)] or moderate (1.5×ULN &lt; total bilirubin ≤ 3×ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. Data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment are limited (n=1), but there is no evidence to suggest that dose adjustment is required in these patients. The effect of severe (total bilirubin &gt; 3 times ULN) hepatic impairment on amivantamab pharmacokinetics is unknown.

## Paediatric population

The pharmacokinetics of Rybrevant in paediatric patients have not been investigated.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity.

## Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity

No animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of amivantamab. Routine genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are generally not applicable to biologic pharmaceuticals as large proteins cannot diffuse into cells and cannot interact with DNA or chromosomal material.

## Reproductive toxicology

No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects on reproduction and foetal development; however, based on its mechanism of action, amivantamab can cause foetal harm or developmental anomalies. As reported in the literature, reduction, elimination, or disruption of embryo foetal or maternal EGFR signalling can prevent implantation, cause embryo foetal loss during various stages of gestation (through effects on placental development), cause developmental anomalies in multiple organs or early death in surviving foetuses. Similarly, knock out of MET or its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was embryonic lethal due to severe defects in placental development, and foetuses displayed defects in muscle development in multiple organs. Human IgG1 is known to cross the placenta; therefore, amivantamab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Prepare the solution for intravenous infusion using aseptic technique as follows:

## Preparation

-  Determine the dose required and the number of Rybrevant vials needed based on patient's baseline weight (see section 4.2). Each vial contains 350 mg of amivantamab.
-  For every 2-week dosing, patients &lt; 80 kg receive 1050 mg and for patients ≥ 80 kg, 1400 mg once weekly for a total of 4 doses, then every 2 weeks starting at Week 5.
-  For every 3-week dosing, patients &lt; 80 kg receive 1400 mg once weekly for a total of 4 doses, then 1750 mg every 3 weeks starting at Week 7, and for patients ≥ 80 kg, 1750 mg once weekly for a total of 4 doses, then 2100 mg every 3 weeks starting at Week 7.
-  Check that the Rybrevant solution is colourless to pale yellow. Do not use if discolouration or visible particles are present.
-  Withdraw and then discard a volume of either 5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection from the 250 mL infusion bag that is equal to the required volume of Rybrevant solution to be added (discard 7 mL diluent from the infusion bag for each vial). Infusion bags must be made of polyvinylchloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), or polyolefin blend (PP+PE).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Withdraw 7 mL of Rybrevant from each vial needed then add it to the infusion bag. Each vial contains a 0.5 mL overfill to ensure sufficient extractable volume. The final volume in the infusion bag should be 250 mL. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.
-  Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Do not shake.
-  Visually inspect for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. Do not use if discolouration or visible particles are observed.

## Administration

-  Administer the diluted solution by intravenous infusion using an infusion set fitted with a flow regulator and with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding polyethersulfone (PES) filter (pore size 0.22 or 0.2 micrometre). Administration sets must be made of either polyurethane (PU), polybutadiene (PBD), PVC, PP, or PE.
-  The administration set with filter must be primed with either 5% glucose solution or 0.9% sodium chloride solution prior to the initiation of each Rybrevant infusion.
-  Do not infuse Rybrevant concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents.
-  The diluted solution should be administered within 10 hours (including infusion time) at room temperature (15°C to 25°C) and in room light.
-  Due to the frequency of IRRs at the first dose, amivantamab should be infused via a peripheral vein at Week 1 and Week 2; infusion via a central line may be administered for subsequent weeks when the risk of IRR is lower. See infusion rates in section 4.2.

## Disposal

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation is indicated:

-  in combination with lazertinib for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR Exon 19 deletions or Exon 21 L858R substitution mutations.
-  as monotherapy for treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations, after failure of platinum-based therapy.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products.

Before initiation of Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation, EGFR mutation status in tumour tissue or plasma specimens must be established using a validated test method. If no mutation is detected in a plasma specimen, tumour tissue should be tested if available in sufficient amount and quality due to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the potential for false negative results using a plasma-test. Once EGFR mutation status has been established, testing does not need to be repeated (see section 5.1).

Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation should be administered by a healthcare professional with access to appropriate medical support to manage administration-related reactions if they occur.

## Posology

Premedications should be administered to reduce the risk of administration-related reactions with Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation (see below 'Dose modifications' and 'Recommended concomitant medicinal products').

The recommended dosages of Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation in combination with lazertinib or as monotherapy based on baseline body weight, are provided in Table 1.

Table 1: Recommended dosage of Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation

| Body weight at baseline*       | Recommended dose   | Dosing schedule                                                                          |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Less than 80 kg                | 1600 mg            |  Weekly (total of 4 doses) from Weeks 1 to 4  Every 2 weeks starting at Week 5 onwards |
| Greater than or equal to 80 kg | 2240 mg            |  Weekly (total of 4 doses) from Weeks 1 to 4  Every 2 weeks starting at Week 5 onwards |

When given in combination with lazertinib, it is recommended to administer Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation any time after lazertinib when given on the same day. Refer to section 4.2 of the lazertinib Summary of Product Characteristics for recommended lazertinib dosing information.

## Duration of treatment

It is recommended that patients are treated with Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

## Missed dose

If a dose of Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation is missed between Weeks 1 to 4, it should be administered within 24 hours. If a dose of Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation is missed from Week 5 onward, it should be administered within 7 days. Otherwise, the missed dose should not be administered and the next dose should be administered per the usual dosing schedule.

## Dose modifications

Dosing should be interrupted for Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions until the adverse reaction resolves to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. If an interruption is 7 days or less, restart at the current dose. If an interruption is longer than 7 days, it is recommended restarting at a reduced dose as presented in Table 2. See also specific dose modifications for specific adverse reactions below Table 2.

If used in combination with lazertinib, refer to section 4.2 of the lazertinib Summary of Product Characteristics for information about dose modifications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Administration-related reactions

Premedications should be administered to reduce the risk of administration-related reactions with Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation (see 'Recommended concomitant medicinal products'). Injections should be interrupted at the first sign of administration-related reactions. Additional supportive medicinal products (e.g., additional glucocorticoids, antihistamine, antipyretics and antiemetics) should be administered as clinically indicated (see section 4.4).

-  Grade 1-3 (mild-severe): Upon recovery of symptoms, resume Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation injections. Concomitant medicinal products should be administered at the next dose, including dexamethasone (20 mg) or equivalent (see Table 3).
-  Recurrent Grade 3 or Grade 4 (life-threatening): Permanently discontinue Rybrevant.

## Venous thromboembolic (VTE) events with concomitant use with lazertinib

At the initiation of treatment, prophylactic anticoagulants should be administered to prevent VTE events in patients receiving Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation in combination with lazertinib. Consistent with clinical guidelines, patients should receive prophylactic dosing of either a direct acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) or a low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Use of Vitamin K antagonists is not recommended.

For VTE events associated with clinical instability (e.g., respiratory failure or cardiac dysfunction), both drugs should be withheld until the patient is clinically stable. Thereafter, both medicinal products can be resumed at the same dose. In the event of recurrence despite appropriate anticoagulation, discontinue Rybrevant. Treatment can continue with lazertinib at the same dose (see section 4.4).

## Skin and nail reactions

Prophylactic therapy with oral and topical antibiotics is recommended to reduce the risk and severity of skin and nail reactions in patients receiving Rybrevant. Non-comedogenic skin moisturiser (ceramide-based or other formulations that provide long lasting skin hydration and exclude drying agents are preferred) on the face and whole body (except scalp) and chlorhexidine solution to wash hands and feet is also recommended. Patients should be instructed to limit sun exposure during and for 2 months after Rybrevant therapy. For further information about prophylaxis for skin and nail reactions, see section 4.4.

If the patient develops a Grade 1-2 skin or nail reaction, supportive care should be initiated as clinically indicated; if there is no improvement after 2 weeks, dose reduction should be considered for persistent Grade 2 rash (see Table 2). If the patient develops a Grade 3 skin or nail reaction, supportive care should be initiated as clinically indicated, and interruption of Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation should be considered until the adverse reaction improves. Upon recovery of the skin or nail reaction to ≤ Grade 2, Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation should be resumed at a reduced dose. If the patient develops Grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue Rybrevant (see section 4.4).

## Interstitial lung disease

Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation should be withheld if interstitial lung disease (ILD) or ILD-like adverse reactions (pneumonitis) is suspected. If the patient is confirmed to have ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions (e.g., pneumonitis), permanently discontinue Rybrevant (see section 4.4).

## Recommended concomitant medicinal products

Prior to the initial dose (Week 1, Day 1), antihistamines, antipyretics, and glucocorticoids should be administered to reduce the risk of administration-related reactions (see Table 3). For subsequent doses, antihistamines and antipyretics are required to be administered. Glucocorticoids should also be re-initiated after prolonged dose interruptions. Antiemetics should be administered as needed.

## Special populations

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of amivantamab in the paediatric population in the treatment of NSCLC.

## Elderly

No dose adjustments are necessary (see section 4.8, section 5.1, and section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No formal studies of amivantamab in patients with renal impairment have been conducted. Based on population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Caution is required in patients with severe renal impairment as amivantamab has not been studied in this patient population (see section 5.2). If treatment is started, patients should be monitored for adverse reactions with dose modifications per the recommendations above.

## Hepatic impairment

No formal studies of amivantamab in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted. Based on population PK analyses, no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Caution is required in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment as amivantamab has not been studied in this patient population (see section 5.2). If treatment is started, patients should be monitored for adverse reactions with dose modifications per the recommendations above.

## Method of administration

Rybrevant solution for injection is for subcutaneous use only.

Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation is not intended for intravenous administration and should be given by subcutaneous injection only, using the doses specified. See section 6.6 for instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration.

Inject the required volume of Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen over approximately 5 minutes. Do not administer at other sites of the body as no data are available.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pause or slow delivery rate if the patient experiences pain. In the event pain is not alleviated by pausing or slowing down delivery rate, a second injection site may be chosen on the opposite side of the abdomen to deliver the remainder of the dose.

If administering with a subcutaneous infusion set, ensure that the full dose is delivered through the infusion set. Sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution may be utilised to flush remaining medicinal product through the line.

Do not inject into tattoos or scars or areas where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard, not intact or within 5 cm around the periumbilical area.

Injection sites should be rotated for successive injections.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Administration-related reactions

Administration-related reactions occurred in patients treated with Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation (see section 4.8).

Prior to the initial injection (Week 1 Day 1), antihistamines, antipyretics, and glucocorticoids should be administered to reduce the risk of administration-related reactions. For subsequent doses, antihistamines and antipyretics should be administered.

Patients should be treated in a setting with appropriate medical support to treat administration-related reactions. At the first sign of administration-related reactions of any severity, injections should be interrupted, if ongoing, and post-injection medicinal products should be administered as clinically indicated. Upon resolution of symptoms, the injection should be resumed. For Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 administration-related reactions, Rybrevant should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2).

## Interstitial lung disease

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) or ILD-like adverse reactions (e.g., pneumonitis) have been reported in patients treated with amivantamab, including fatal events (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnoea, cough, fever). If symptoms develop, treatment with Rybrevant should be interrupted pending investigation of these symptoms. Suspected ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions should be evaluated and appropriate treatment should be initiated as necessary. Rybrevant should be permanently discontinued in patients with confirmed ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions (see section 4.2).

## Venous thromboembolic (VTE) events with concomitant use with lazertinib

In patients receiving amivantamab in combination with lazertinib, VTE events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), were reported (see section 4.8). Fatal events were observed with amivantamab intravenous formulation.

Consistent with clinical guidelines, patients should receive prophylactic dosing of either a direct acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) or a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Use of Vitamin K antagonists is not recommended.

Signs and symptoms of VTE events should be monitored. Patients with VTE events should be treated with anticoagulation as clinically indicated. For VTE events associated with clinical instability,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment should be withheld until the patient is clinically stable. Thereafter, both drugs can be resumed at the same dose.

In the event of recurrence despite appropriate anticoagulation, Rybrevant should be discontinued. Treatment can continue with lazertinib at the same dose (see section 4.2).

## Skin and nail reactions

Rash (including dermatitis acneiform), pruritus, dry skin, and skin ulcer occurred in patients treated with amivantamab (see section 4.8). Patients should be instructed to limit sun exposure during and for 2 months after Rybrevant therapy. Protective clothing and use of broad-spectrum UVA/UVB sunscreen are advisable. A prophylactic approach to rash prevention is recommended. This includes prophylactic therapy, at treatment initiation, with an oral antibiotic (e.g., doxycycline or minocycline, 100 mg twice daily) starting on Day 1 for the first 12 weeks of treatment and after completion of oral antibiotic therapy, topical antibiotic lotion to the scalp (e.g., clindamycin 1%) for the next 9 months of treatment. Non-comedogenic skin moisturiser (ceramide-based or other formulations that provide long-lasting skin hydration and exclude drying agents are preferred) on the face and whole body (except scalp) and chlorhexidine solution to wash hands and feet is recommended beginning on Day 1 and continued for the duration of treatment.

Prescriptions for topical and/or oral antibiotics and topical corticosteroids are recommended to be available at the time of initial dosing to minimise any delay in reactive management should rash develop despite prophylactic treatment. If skin reactions develop, supportive care, topical corticosteroids and topical and/or oral antibiotics should be administered. For Grade 3 or poorly-tolerated Grade 2 events, systemic antibiotics and oral steroids should also be administered. Patients presenting with severe rash that has an atypical appearance or distribution or lack improvement within 2 weeks should be referred promptly to a dermatologist. Rybrevant should be dose reduced, interrupted, or permanently discontinued based on severity (see section 4.2).

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) has been reported. Treatment with this medicinal product should be discontinued if TEN is confirmed.

## Eye disorders

Eye disorders, including keratitis, occurred in patients treated with amivantamab (see section 4.8). Patients presenting with worsening eye symptoms should promptly be referred to an ophthalmologist and should discontinue use of contact lenses until symptoms are evaluated. For dose modifications for Grade 3 or 4 eye disorders, see section 4.2.

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free' (see section 6.6).

## Polysorbate content

This medicinal product contains 0.6 mg of polysorbate 80 in each mL, which is equivalent to 6 mg per 10 mL vial, or 8.4 mg per 14 mL vial. Polysorbates may cause hypersensitivity reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No drug interaction studies have been performed. As an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, renal excretion and hepatic enzyme-mediated metabolism of intact amivantamab are unlikely to be major elimination routes. As such, variations in drug-metabolising enzymes are not expected to affect the elimination of amivantamab. Due to the high affinity to a unique epitope on EGFR and MET, amivantamab is not anticipated to alter drug-metabolising enzymes.

## Vaccines

No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations in patients taking amivantamab. Avoid the use of live or live-attenuated vaccines while patients are taking amivantamab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of child-bearing potential/Contraception

Women of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during and for 3 months after cessation of amivantamab treatment.

## Pregnancy

There are no human data to assess the risk of amivantamab use during pregnancy. No animal reproductive studies were conducted to inform a drug-associated risk. Administration of EGFR and MET inhibitor molecules in pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of impairment of embryo-foetal development, embryo lethality, and abortion. Therefore, based on its mechanism of action and findings in animal models, amivantamab could cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Amivantamab should not be given during pregnancy unless the benefit of treatment of the woman is considered to outweigh potential risks to the foetus. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this medicinal product, the patient should be informed of the potential risk to the foetus (see section 5.3).

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether amivantamab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon afterwards. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded during this short period just after birth, although IgGs are likely to be degraded in the gastrointestinal tract of the breast-fed child and not absorbed. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from amivantamab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effect of amivantamab on human fertility. Effects on male and female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Rybrevant may have moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Please see section 4.8 (e.g., dizziness, fatigue, visual impairment). If patients experience treatment-related symptoms, including vision-related adverse reactions, affecting their ability to concentrate and react, it is recommended that they do not drive or use machines until the effect subsides.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

## Rybrevant as monotherapy

In the dataset of Rybrevant intravenous formulation as monotherapy (N=380), the most frequent adverse reactions in all grades were rash (76%), infusion-related reactions (67%), nail toxicity (47%), hypoalbuminaemia (31%), oedema (26%), fatigue (26%), stomatitis (24%), nausea (23%), and constipation (23%). Serious adverse reactions included ILD (1.3%), IRR (1.1%), and rash (1.1%). Three percent of patients discontinued Rybrevant due to adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were IRR (1.1%), ILD (0.5%), and nail toxicity (0.5%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 4 summarises the adverse drug reactions that occurred in patients receiving Rybrevant as monotherapy.

The data reflects exposure to Rybrevant intravenous formulation in 380 patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients received amivantamab 1050 mg (for patients &lt; 80 kg) or 1400 mg (for patients ≥ 80 kg). The median exposure to amivantamab was 4.1 months (range: 0.0 to 39.7 months).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below by frequency category. Frequency categories are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10000 to &lt; 1/1000); very rare (&lt; 1/10000); and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).

Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

## Rybrevant in combination with lazertinib

Overall, the safety profile of Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation was consistent with the established safety profile of Rybrevant intravenous formulation, with a lower incidence of administration-related reactions and VTEs observed with the subcutaneous formulation compared to the intravenous formulation.

In the dataset of Rybrevant (either intravenous or subcutaneous formulations) in combination with lazertinib (N=752), the most frequent adverse reactions of any grade (≥ 20% patients) were rash (87%), nail toxicity (67%), hypoalbuminaemia (48%), hepatotoxicity (43%), stomatitis (43%), oedema (42%), fatigue (35%), paraesthesia (29%), constipation (26%), diarrhoea (26%), dry skin (25%), decreased appetite (24%), nausea (24%), and pruritus (23%).

Clinically relevant differences between the intravenous and subcutaneous formulations, when given in combination with lazertinib, were observed for administration-related reactions (63% for intravenous vs. 14% for subcutaneous) and VTE (37% for intravenous vs. 11% for subcutaneous).

Serious adverse reactions were reported in 14% of patients who received Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation in combination with lazertinib, including ILD (4.2%), VTE (2.7%), hepatotoxicity (2.1%), and fatigue (1.5%). Seven percent of patients discontinued Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation due to adverse reactions. In patients treated with Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation in combination with lazertinib, the most frequent adverse reactions of any grade (≥ 1% patients) leading to discontinuation of Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation were ILD (3.6%) and rash (1.5%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The adverse reactions for Rybrevant (either intravenous or subcutaneous formulation) when received in combination with lazertinib are summarised in Table 5.

The safety data below reflect exposure to Rybrevant (either intravenous or subcutaneous formulation) in combination with lazertinib in 752 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, including 421 patients in MARIPOSA, 125 patients in PALOMA-2 cohorts 1 and 6, and 206 patients in PALOMA-3 subcutaneous arm. Patients received Rybrevant (either intravenous or subcutaneous formulation) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of treatment with amivantamab overall for both intravenous and subcutaneous formulations was 9.9 months (range: 0.1 to 31.4 months). Median duration on treatment for the subcutaneous formulation was 5.7 months (range: 0.1 to 13.2 months) while median duration on treatment for the intravenous formulation was 18.5 months (range: 0.2 to 31.4 months).

Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below by frequency category. Frequency categories are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10000 to &lt; 1/1000); very rare (&lt; 1/10000); and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Administration-related reactions

Overall, administration-related reactions occurred in 14% of patients treated with Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation in combination with lazertinib. In PALOMA-3, administration-related reactions were reported in 13% of patients treated with Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation in combination with lazertinib compared to 66% when treated with Rybrevant intravenous formulation in combination with lazertinib. The most frequent signs and symptoms of administration-related reactions include dyspnoea, flushing, fever, chills, nausea, and chest discomfort. Median time to onset of first administration-related reactions was 2.1 hours (range: 0.0 to 176.5 hours). Most administration-related reactions (98%) were Grades 1 or 2 in severity.

## Injection site reactions

Overall, injection site reactions occurred in 8% of patients treated with Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation in combination with lazertinib. All injection site reactions were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most frequent symptom of injection site reactions was erythema.

## Interstitial lung disease

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) or ILD-like adverse reactions have been reported with the use of amivantamab as well as with other EGFR inhibitors. ILD was reported in 3.6% of patients treated with Rybrevant (either intravenous or subcutaneous formulation) in combination with lazertinib, including 2 (0.3%) patients with a fatal reaction. Patients with a medical history of ILD, including drug-induced ILD or radiation pneumonitis, were excluded from PALOMA-2 and PALOMA-3.

## Venous thromboembolic (VTE) events with concomitant use with lazertinib

VTE events, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), were reported in 11% of patients receiving Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation in combination with lazertinib in PALOMA-2 and PALOMA-3. Most cases were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 events occurring in 3 (0.9%) patients. Additionally, 269 (81%) of these 331 patients receiving Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation took prophylactic anticoagulants with a direct oral anticoagulant or low molecular weight heparin within the first four months of study treatment. In PALOMA-3, the incidence of VTE reactions was 9% for patients treated with Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation in combination with lazertinib, compared to 13% when treated with Rybrevant intravenous formulation in combination with lazertinib, with similar rates of prophylactic anticoagulant use in both treatment arms (80% in the subcutaneous arm vs. 81% in the intravenous arm). For patients who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulants, the overall incidence of VTE was 17% for patients treated with Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation in combination with lazertinib with all VTE reactions reported as Grade 1-2 and serious VTE reactions reported in 4.8% of these patients, compared to an overall incidence of 23% for patients treated with Rybrevant intravenous formulation in combination with lazertinib with Grade 3 VTE reactions reported in 10% and serious VTE reactions reported in 8% of these patients.

## Skin and nail reactions

Rash (including dermatitis acneiform), pruritus, and dry skin have occurred in patients treated with Rybrevant (either intravenous or subcutaneous formulation) in combination with lazertinib. Rash occurred in 87% of patients, leading to discontinuation of Rybrevant in 0.7% of patients. Most cases were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 and Grade 4 reactions occurring in 23% and 0.1% of patients, respectively.

A Phase 2 study in patients treated with Rybrevant in combination with lazertinib was conducted to assess the use of prophylactic therapy with an oral antibiotic, a topical antibiotic on the scalp, a moisturiser on the face and whole body (except scalp), and an antiseptic on hands and feet (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). A reduction in the incidence of ≥ Grade 2 dermatologic adverse events during the first 12 weeks of treatment was demonstrated, compared with the standard dermatologic management used in clinical practice (38.6% vs. 76.5%, p&lt;0.0001). In addition, there was a reduction in ≥ Grade 2 adverse events involving the scalp in the first 12 weeks of treatment (8.6% vs. 29.4%) along with lower incidence of dose reductions (7.1% vs. 19.1%), interruptions (15.7% vs. 33.8%), and treatment discontinuations (1.4% vs. 4.4%) due to dermatological adverse events.

## Eye disorders

Eye disorders, including keratitis (1.7%), occurred in patients treated with Rybrevant (either intravenous or subcutaneous formulation). Other reported adverse reactions included growth of eyelashes, visual impairment, and other eye disorders.

## Special populations

## Elderly

There are limited clinical data with amivantamab in patients 75 years of age or over (see section 5.1). No overall differences in safety were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age and patients &lt; 65 years of age.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no information on overdose with Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation and no known specific antidote for overdose. In the event of an overdose, treatment with Rybrevant should be stopped, the patient should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse events and appropriate general supportive measures should be instituted immediately until clinical toxicity has diminished or resolved.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, ATC code: L01FX18.

Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation contains recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20). rHuPH20 works locally and transiently to degrade hyaluronan ((HA), a naturally occurring glycoaminoglycan found throughout the body) in the extracellular matrix of the subcutaneous space by cleaving the linkage between the two sugars (N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid), which comprise HA.

## Mechanism of action

Amivantamab is a low-fucose, fully-human IgG1-based EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune cell-directing activity that targets tumours with activating EGFR mutations such as Exon 19 deletions, Exon 21 L858R substitution and Exon 20 insertion mutations. Amivantamab binds to the extracellular domains of EGFR and MET.

Amivantamab disrupts EGFR and MET signalling functions through blocking ligand binding and enhancing degradation of EGFR and MET, thereby preventing tumour growth and progression. The presence of EGFR and MET on the surface of tumour cells also allows for targeting of these cells for destruction by immune effector cells, such as natural killer cells and macrophages, through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and trogocytosis mechanisms, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamic effects

After the first full dose of Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation, mean serum EGFR and MET concentrations decreased substantially and remained suppressed for the duration of treatment for all studied doses.

## Albumin

Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation decreased serum albumin concentration, a pharmacodynamic effect of MET inhibition, typically during the first 8 weeks (see section 4.8); thereafter, albumin concentration stabilised for the remainder of amivantamab treatment.

## Clinical experience of Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation

The efficacy of Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation in patients with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC is based on achieving non-inferior PK exposure to intravenous amivantamab in the non-inferiority study PALOMA-3 (see section 5.2). The study demonstrated non-inferior efficacy of subcutaneous to intravenous amivantamab given in combination with lazertinib in patients with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose disease has progressed on or after treatment with osimertinib and platinum-based chemotherapy.

## Clinical experience of Rybrevant intravenous formulation

## Previously-untreated NSCLC with EGFR Exon 19 deletions or Exon 21 L858R substitution mutations (MARIPOSA)

NSC3003 (MARIPOSA) is a randomised, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre phase 3 study assessing the efficacy and safety of Rybrevant intravenous formulation in combination with lazertinib as compared to osimertinib monotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC not amenable to curative therapy. Patient samples were required to have one of the two common EGFR mutations (Exon 19 deletion or Exon 21 L858R substitution mutation), as identified by local testing. Tumour tissue (94%) and/or plasma (6%) samples for all patients were tested locally to determine EGFR Exon 19 deletion and/or Exon 21 L858R substitution mutation status using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 65% and next generation sequencing (NGS) in 35% of patients.

A total of 1074 patients were randomised (2:2:1) to receive Rybrevant intravenous formulation in combination with lazertinib, osimertinib monotherapy, or lazertinib monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Rybrevant intravenous formulation was administered intravenously at 1050 mg (for patients &lt; 80 kg) or 1400 mg (for patients ≥ 80 kg) once weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks thereafter starting at week 5. Lazertinib was administered at 240 mg orally once daily. Osimertinib was administered at a dose of 80 mg orally once daily. Randomisation was stratified by EGFR mutation type (Exon 19 deletion or Exon 21 L858R), race (Asian or non-Asian), and history of brain metastasis (yes or no).

Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced across the treatment arms. The median age was 63 (range: 25-88) years with 45% of patients ≥ 65 years; 62% were female; and 59% were Asian, and 38% were White. Baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 0 (34%) or 1 (66%); 69% never smoked; 41% had prior brain metastases; and 90% had Stage IV cancer at initial diagnosis. With regard to EGFR mutation status, 60% were Exon 19 deletions and 40% were Exon 21 L858R substitution mutations.

Rybrevant intravenous formulation in combination with lazertinib demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) by BICR assessment.

The final analysis of OS demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for Rybrevant intravenous formulation in combination with lazertinib compared to osimertinib (see Table 6 and Figure 2).

Intracranial ORR and DOR by BICR were pre-specified endpoints in MARIPOSA. In the subset of patients with intracranial lesions at baseline, the combination of Rybrevant intravenous formulation and lazertinib, demonstrated similar intracranial ORR to the control. Per protocol, all patients in MARIPOSA had serial brain MRIs to assess intracranial response and duration. Results are summarised in Table 7.

## Previously-treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with Exon 20 insertion mutations (CHRYSALIS)

CHRYSALIS is a multicentre, open-label, multi-cohort study conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of Rybrevant intravenous formulation in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Efficacy was evaluated in 114 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who had EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutations, whose disease had progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, and who had a median follow-up of 12.5 months. Tumour tissue (93%) and/or plasma (10%) samples for all patients were tested locally to determine EGFR Exon 20 insertion mutation status using next

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

generation sequencing (NGS) in 46% of patients and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 41% of patients; for 4% of patients, the testing methods were not specified. Patients with untreated brain metastases or a history of ILD requiring treatment with prolonged steroids or other immunosuppressive agents within the last 2 years were not eligible for the study. Rybrevant intravenous formulation was administered intravenously at 1050 mg for patients &lt; 80 kg or 1400 mg for patients ≥ 80 kg once weekly for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks starting at Week 5 until loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR), defined as confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST v1.1. In addition, the primary endpoint was assessed by a blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary efficacy endpoints included duration of response (DOR).

The median age was 62 (range: 36-84) years, with 41% of the patients ≥ 65 years of age; 61% were female; and 52% were Asian and 37% were White. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range: 1 to 7 therapies). At baseline, 29% had ECOG performance status of 0 and 70% had ECOG performance status of 1; 57% never smoked; 100% had Stage IV cancer; and 25% had previous treatment for brain metastases. Insertions in Exon 20 were observed at 8 different residues; the most common residues were A767 (22%), S768 (16%), D770 (12%), and N771 (11%).

Efficacy results are summarised in Table 8.

c Based on Kaplan-Meier estimate.

Anti-tumour activity was observed across studied mutation subtypes.

## Immunogenicity

Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were uncommonly detected after treatment with Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation. No evidence of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was observed. Among the 389 participants who received Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy, 37 participants (10%) were positive for treatment-emergent antibodies to rHuPH20. The immunogenicity to rHuPH20 observed in these participants did not impact the pharmacokinetics of amivantamab.

## Elderly

No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age and patients &lt; 65 years of age.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Rybrevant in all subsets of the paediatric population in NSCLC (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Following subcutaneous administration, the geometric mean (%CV) of amivantamab bioavailability is 66.6% (14.9%) with a median time to reach maximum concentration of 3 days, based on the individual amivantamab PK parameter estimates for participants receiving subcutaneous administration in the population PK analysis.

For the every 2-week subcutaneous dosing regimen, the geometric mean (%CV) maximum trough concentration of amivantamab after the 4 th weekly dose was 335 µg/mL (32.7%). The mean AUC1week increased 3.5-fold from the first dose to Cycle 2 Day 1. Maximum trough concentration of amivantamab after subcutaneous administration as monotherapy and in combination with lazertinib is typically observed at the end of the weekly dosing (Cycle 2 Day 1). Amivantamab steady-state concentration is reached by approximately Week 13. The geometric mean (%CV) steady-state trough concentration of amivantamab at Cycle 4 Day 1 was 206 µg/mL (39.1%).

Table 9 lists the observed geometric mean (%CV) maximum trough concentrations (Cycle 2 Day 1 Ctrough ) and Cycle 2 area under the concentration time curve (AUCDay 1-15 ) following the recommended doses of amivantamab administered subcutaneously and intravenously in patients with NSCLC. These PK endpoints were the basis for the demonstration of non-inferiority that supports the intravenous to subcutaneous bridging.

## Distribution

Based on the individual amivantamab PK parameter estimates for participants receiving subcutaneous administration in the population PK analysis, the geometric mean (%CV) total volume of distribution for amivantamab administered subcutaneously is 5.69 L (23.8%).

## Elimination

Based on the individual amivantamab PK parameter estimates for participants receiving subcutaneous administration in the population PK analysis, the estimated geometric mean (% CV) linear CL and associated-terminal half-life is 0.224 L/day (26.0%) and 18.8 days (34.3%), respectively.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of amivantamab were observed based on age (21-88 years).

## Renal impairment

No clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of amivantamab was observed in patients with mild (60 ≤ creatinine clearance [CrCl] &lt; 90 mL/min), moderate (29 ≤ CrCl &lt; 60 mL/min) or severe (15 ≤ CrCl &lt; 29 mL/min) renal impairment. Data in patients with severe renal impairment are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

limited (n=1), but there is no evidence to suggest that dose adjustment is required in these patients. The effect of end-stage renal disease (CrCl &lt; 15 mL/min) on amivantamab pharmacokinetics is unknown.

## Hepatic impairment

Changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect on the elimination of amivantamab since IgG1-based molecules such as amivantamab are not metabolised through hepatic pathways.

No clinically meaningful effect in the pharmacokinetics of amivantamab was observed based on mild [(total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST &gt; ULN) or (ULN &lt; total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN)] or moderate (1.5×ULN &lt; total bilirubin ≤ 3×ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment. Data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment are limited (n=1), but there is no evidence to suggest that dose adjustment is required in these patients. The effect of severe (total bilirubin &gt; 3 times ULN) hepatic impairment on amivantamab pharmacokinetics is unknown.

## Paediatric population

The PK of amivantamab in paediatric patients have not been investigated.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity.

## Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity

No animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of amivantamab. Routine genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are generally not applicable to biologic pharmaceuticals as large proteins cannot diffuse into cells and cannot interact with DNA or chromosomal material.

## Reproductive toxicology

No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects on reproduction and foetal development; however, based on its mechanism of action, amivantamab can cause foetal harm or developmental anomalies. As reported in the literature, reduction, elimination, or disruption of embryo foetal or maternal EGFR signalling can prevent implantation, cause embryo foetal loss during various stages of gestation (through effects on placental development), cause developmental anomalies in multiple organs or early death in surviving foetuses. Similarly, knock out of MET or its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was embryonic lethal due to severe defects in placental development, and foetuses displayed defects in muscle development in multiple organs. Human IgG1 is known to cross the placenta; therefore, amivantamab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation is for single use only and is ready to use.

The solution for injection should be prepared using aseptic technique as follows:

Preparation

-  Determine the dose required and the appropriate Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation vial needed based on the patient's baseline weight (see section 4.2).
-  Patients &lt; 80 kg receive 1600 mg and for patients ≥ 80 kg, 2240 mg weekly from Weeks 1 to 4 and then every 2 weeks starting at Week 5 onwards.
-  Remove the appropriate Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation vial from refrigerated storage (2°C to 8°C).
-  Check that the Rybrevant solution is colourless to pale yellow. Do not use if opaque particles, discolouration or other foreign particles are present.
-  Equilibrate Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation to room temperature (15°C to 30°C) for at least 15 minutes. Do not warm Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation in any other way. Do not shake.

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## Rybrevant 350 mg concentrate for solution for infusion amivantamab

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important information for you.

-  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
-  If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.
-  If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Rybrevant is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you are given Rybrevant
3. How Rybrevant is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Rybrevant
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Rybrevant is and what it is used for

## What Rybrevant is

Rybrevant is a cancer medicine. It contains the active substance 'amivantamab', which is an antibody (type of protein) designed to recognise and attach to specific targets in the body.

## What Rybrevant is used for

Rybrevant is used in adults with a type of lung cancer called 'non-small cell lung cancer'. It is used when the cancer has spread to other parts of your body and has gone through certain changes in a gene called 'EGFR'.

## Rybrevant can be prescribed for you:

-  as the first medicine you receive for your cancer in combination with lazertinib.
-  in combination with chemotherapy after failure of prior therapy including an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).
-  as the first medicine you receive for your cancer in combination with chemotherapy, or
-  when chemotherapy is no longer working against your cancer.

## How Rybrevant works

The active substance in Rybrevant, amivantamab, targets two proteins found on cancer cells:

-  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and
-  mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET).

This medicine works by attaching to these proteins. This may help to slow or stop your lung cancer from growing. It may also help to reduce the size of the tumour.

Rybrevant may be given in combination with other anti-cancer medicines. It is important that you also read the package leaflets for these other medicines. If you have any questions about these medicines, ask your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Rybrevant

## Do not use Rybrevant if

-  you are allergic to amivantamab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

Do not use this medicine if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given this medicine.

## Warnings and precautions

Tell your doctor or nurse before you are given Rybrevant if:

-  you have suffered from inflammation of your lungs (a condition called 'interstitial lung disease' or 'pneumonitis').

## Tell your doctor or nurse straight away while taking this medicine if you get any of the following side effects (see section 4 for more information):

-  Any side effect while the medicine is being given into your vein.
-  Sudden difficulty in breathing, cough, or fever that may suggest inflammation of the lungs. The condition may be life-threatening, therefore healthcare professionals will monitor you for potential symptoms.
-  When used with another drug called lazertinib; life-threatening side effects (due to blood clots in the veins) may occur. Your doctor will give you additional medication to help prevent blood clots during the course of your treatment and will monitor you for potential symptoms.
-  Skin problems. To reduce the risk and severity of skin problems, wear protective clothing, apply broad-spectrum UVA/UVB sunscreen, and use moisturisers (ceramide-based or other formulations that provide long-lasting skin hydration and without drying components are preferred) regularly on your face and whole body (except scalp), while taking this medicine. You will need to keep out of the sun and continue doing this for 2 months after you stop treatment. Your doctor may recommend that you start an antibiotic(s) and an antiseptic to wash your hands and feet to reduce the risk and severity of skin problems, and may treat you with a medicine(s), or send you to see a skin specialist (dermatologist) if you get skin reactions during treatment.
-  Eye problems. If you have vision problems or eye pain contact your doctor or nurse straight away. If you use contact lenses and have any new eye symptoms, stop using contact lenses and tell your doctor straight away.

## Children and adolescents

Do not give this medicine to children or young people below 18 years of age. This is because it is not known whether the medicine is safe and effective in this age group.

## Other medicines and Rybrevant

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

## Contraception

-  If you could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception during Rybrevant treatment and for 3 months after stopping treatment.

## Pregnancy

-  Tell your doctor or nurse before you are given this medicine if you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby.
-  It is possible that this medicine may harm an unborn baby. If you become pregnant while being treated with this medicine, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of having the medicine is greater than the risk to your unborn baby.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

It is not known if Rybrevant passes into breast milk. Ask your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of breast-feeding is greater than the risk to your baby.

## Driving and using machines

If you feel tired, feel dizzy, or if your eyes are irritated or vision is affected after taking Rybrevant, do not drive or use machinery.

## Rybrevant contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. However, before Rybrevant is given to you, it may be mixed with a solution that contains sodium. Talk to your doctor if you are on a low salt diet.

## Rybrevant contains polysorbate

This medicine contains 0.6 mg of polysorbate 80 in each mL, which is equivalent to 4.2 mg per 7 mL vial. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How Rybrevant is given

## How much is given

Your doctor will work out the correct dose of Rybrevant for you. The dose of this medicine will depend on your body weight at the start of your therapy. You will be treated with Rybrevant once every 2 or 3 weeks according to the treatment your doctor decides for you.

The recommended dose of Rybrevant every 2 weeks is:

-  1050 mg if you weigh less than 80 kg.
-  1400 mg if you weigh more than or equal to 80 kg.

The recommended dose of Rybrevant every 3 weeks is:

-  1400 mg for the first 4 doses and 1750 mg for subsequent doses if you weigh less than 80 kg.
-  1750 mg for the first 4 doses and 2100 mg for subsequent doses if you weigh more than or equal to 80 kg.

## How the medicine is given

This medicine will be given to you by a doctor or nurse. It is given as a drip into a vein ('intravenous infusion') over several hours.

Rybrevant is given as follows:

-  once a week for the first 4 weeks
-  then once every 2 weeks starting at week 5 or once every 3 weeks starting at week 7, for as long as you keep getting benefit from the treatment.

In the first week, your doctor will give you the Rybrevant dose split over two days.

## Medicines given during treatment with Rybrevant

Before each infusion of Rybrevant, you will be given medicines which help lower the chance of infusion-related reactions. These may include:

-  medicines for an allergic reaction (antihistamines)
-  medicines for inflammation (corticosteroids)
-  medicines for fever (such as paracetamol).

You may also be given additional medicines based on any symptoms you may experience.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you are given more Rybrevant than you should

This medicine will be given by your doctor or nurse. In the unlikely event that you are given too much (an overdose), your doctor will check you for side effects.

## If you forget your appointment to have Rybrevant

It is very important to go to all your appointments. If you miss an appointment, make another one as soon as possible.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

## This leaflet was last revised in .

## Other sources of information

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site https://www.ema.europa.eu.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned below.

Prepare the solution for intravenous infusion using aseptic technique as follows:

## Preparation

-  Determine the dose required and the number of Rybrevant vials needed based on patient's baseline weight. Each vial of Rybrevant contains 350 mg of amivantamab.
-  For every 2-week dosing, patients &lt; 80 kg receive 1050 mg and for patients ≥ 80 kg, 1400 mg once weekly for a total of 4 doses, then every 2 weeks starting at Week 5.
-  For every 3-week dosing, patients &lt; 80 kg receive 1400 mg once weekly for a total of 4 doses, then 1750 mg every 3 weeks starting at Week 7, and for patients ≥ 80 kg, 1750 mg once weekly for a total of 4 doses, then 2100 mg every 3 weeks starting at Week 7.
-  Check that the Rybrevant solution is colourless to pale yellow. Do not use if discolouration or visible particles are present.
-  Withdraw and then discard a volume of either 5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection from the 250 mL infusion bag that is equal to the required volume of Rybrevant solution to be added (discard 7 mL diluent from the infusion bag for each vial). Infusion bags must be made of polyvinylchloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), or polyolefin blend (PP+PE).
-  Withdraw 7 mL of Rybrevant from each vial needed then add it to the infusion bag. Each vial contains a 0.5 mL overfill to ensure sufficient extractable volume. The final volume in the infusion bag should be 250 mL. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.
-  Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Do not shake.
-  Visually inspect for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. Do not use if discolouration or visible particles are observed.

## Administration

-  Administer the diluted solution by intravenous infusion using an infusion set fitted with a flow regulator and with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding polyethersulfone (PES) filter (pore size 0.22 or 0.2 micrometer). Administration sets must be made of either polyurethane (PU), polybutadiene (PBD), PVC, PP, or PE.
-  The administration set with filter must be primed with either 5% glucose solution or 0.9% sodium chloride solution prior to the initiation of each Rybrevant infusion.
-  Do not infuse Rybrevant concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents.
-  The diluted solution should be administered within 10 hours (including infusion time) at room temperature (15°C to 25°C) and in room light.
-  Due to the frequency of IRRs at the first dose, amivantamab should be infused via a peripheral vein at Week 1 and Week 2; infusion via a central line may be administered for subsequent weeks when the risk of IRR is lower.

## Disposal

This medicinal product is for single use only and any unused medicinal product that is not administered within 10 hours should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## 1. What Rybrevant is and what it is used for

## What Rybrevant is

Rybrevant is a cancer medicine. It contains the active substance 'amivantamab', which is an antibody (type of protein) designed to recognise and attach to specific targets in the body.

## What Rybrevant is used for

Rybrevant is used in adults with a type of lung cancer called 'non-small cell lung cancer'. It is used when the cancer has spread to other parts of your body and has gone through certain changes in a gene called 'EGFR'.

Rybrevant can be prescribed for you:

-  as the first medicine you receive for your cancer in combination with lazertinib, or
-  when chemotherapy is no longer working against your cancer.

## How Rybrevant works

The active substance in Rybrevant, amivantamab, targets two proteins found on cancer cells:

-  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and
-  mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET).

This medicine works by attaching to these proteins. This may help to slow or stop your lung cancer from growing. It may also help to reduce the size of the tumour.

Rybrevant may be given in combination with other anti-cancer medicines. It is important that you also read the package leaflets for these other medicines. If you have any questions about these medicines, ask your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Rybrevant

## Do not use Rybrevant if

-  you are allergic to amivantamab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

Do not use this medicine if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given this medicine.

## Warnings and precautions

Tell your doctor or nurse before you are given Rybrevant if:

-  you have suffered from inflammation of your lungs (a condition called 'interstitial lung disease' or 'pneumonitis').

## Tell your doctor or nurse straight away while taking this medicine if you get any of the following side effects (see section 4 for more information):

-  Any side effect while the medicine is injected.
-  Sudden difficulty in breathing, cough, or fever that may suggest inflammation of the lungs. The condition may be life-threatening; therefore healthcare professionals will monitor you for potential symptoms.
-  When used with another drug called lazertinib; life-threatening side effects (due to blood clots in the veins) may occur. Your doctor will give you additional medication to help prevent blood clots during the course of your treatment and will monitor you for potential symptoms.
-  Skin problems. To reduce the risk and severity of skin problems, wear protective clothing, apply broad-spectrum UVA/UVB sunscreen, and use moisturisers (ceramide-based or other formulations that provide long lasting skin hydration and without drying components are preferred) regularly on your face and whole body (except scalp), while taking this medicine. You will need to keep out of the sun and continue doing this for 2 months after you stop treatment. Your doctor may recommend that you start an antibiotic(s) and an antiseptic to wash your hands and feet to reduce the risk and severity of skin problems, and may treat you with a medicine(s), or send you to see a skin specialist (dermatologist) if you get skin reactions during treatment.
-  Eye problems. If you have vision problems or eye pain, contact your doctor or nurse straight away. If you use contact lenses and have any new eye symptoms, stop using contact lenses and tell your doctor straight away.

## Children and adolescents

Do not give this medicine to children or young people below 18 years of age. This is because it is not known whether the medicine is safe and effective in this age group.

## Other medicines and Rybrevant

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

## Contraception

-  If you could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception during Rybrevant treatment and for 3 months after stopping treatment.

## Pregnancy

-  Tell your doctor or nurse before you are given this medicine if you are pregnant, think you might be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby.
-  It is possible that this medicine may harm an unborn baby. If you become pregnant while being treated with this medicine, tell your doctor or nurse straight away. You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of having the medicine is greater than the risk to your unborn baby.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Breast-feeding

It is not known if Rybrevant passes into breast milk. Ask your doctor for advice before being given this medicine. You and your doctor will decide if the benefit of breast-feeding is greater than the risk to your baby.

## Driving and using machines

If you feel tired, feel dizzy, or if your eyes are irritated or vision is affected after taking Rybrevant, do not drive or use machinery.

## Rybrevant contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Rybrevant contains polysorbate

This medicine contains 0.6 mg of polysorbate 80 in each mL, which is equivalent to 6 mg per 10 mL vial, or 8.4 mg per 14 mL vial. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How Rybrevant is given

## How much is given

Your doctor will work out the correct dose of Rybrevant for you. The dose of this medicine will depend on your body weight at the start of your therapy.

The recommended dose of Rybrevant is:

-  1600 mg if you weigh less than 80 kg.
-  2240 mg if you weigh more than or equal to 80 kg.

## How the medicine is given

Rybrevant will be given to you by a doctor or nurse as an injection under your skin (subcutaneous injection) over approximately 5 minutes. It is given in the stomach area (abdomen), not in other sites of the body, and not into areas of the abdomen where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard or where there are tattoos or scars.

If you experience pain during the injection, the doctor or nurse may interrupt the injection and give you the remaining injection in another area of your abdomen.

Rybrevant is given as follows:

-  once a week for the first 4 weeks
-  then once every 2 weeks starting at week 5, for as long as you keep getting benefit from the treatment.

## Medicines given during treatment with Rybrevant

Before each injection of Rybrevant, you will be given medicines which help lower the chance of administration-related reactions. These may include:

-  medicines for an allergic reaction (antihistamines)
-  medicines for inflammation (corticosteroids)
-  medicines for fever (such as paracetamol).

You may also be given additional medicines based on any symptoms you may experience.

## If you are given more Rybrevant than you should

This medicine will be given by your doctor or nurse. In the unlikely event that you are given too much (an overdose), your doctor will check you for side effects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you forget your appointment to have Rybrevant

It is very important to go to all your appointments. If you miss an appointment, make another one as soon as possible.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation should be administered by a healthcare professional.

To prevent medication errors, it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the appropriate formulation (intravenous or subcutaneous formulation) and dose is being given to the patient as prescribed. Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation should be given by subcutaneous injection only, using the dose specified. Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation is not intended for intravenous administration.

This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned below.

Prepare the solution for subcutaneous injection using aseptic technique as follows:

## Preparation

-  Determine the dose required and the appropriate Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation vial needed based on patient's baseline weight.
-  Patients &lt; 80kg receive 1600 mg and patients ≥ 80 kg receive 2240 mg weekly from Weeks 1 to 4 and then every 2 weeks starting at Week 5 onward.
-  Remove the appropriate Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation vial from refrigerated storage (2°C to 8°C).
-  Check that the solution is colourless to pale yellow. Do not use if opaque particles, discolouration or other foreign particles are present.
-  Equilibrate Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation to room temperature (15°C to 30°C) for at least 15 minutes. Do not warm Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation in any other way. Do not shake.
-  Withdraw the required injection volume of Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation from the vial into an appropriately sized syringe using a transfer needle. Smaller syringes require less force during preparation and administration.
-  Rybrevant subcutaneous formulation is compatible with stainless steel injection needles, polypropolene and polycarbonate syringes, and polyethylene, polyurethan, and polyvinylchloride subcutaneous infusion sets. A sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution may also be used to flush an infusion set if needed.
-  Replace the transfer needle with the appropriate ancillaries for transport or administration. Use of a 21G to 23G needle or infusion set is recommended to ensure ease of administration.

## Storage of prepared syringe

The prepared syringe should be administered immediately. If immediate administration is not possible, store the prepared syringe refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C for up to 24 hours followed by at room temperature of 15°C to 30°C for up to 24 hours. The prepared syringe should be discarded if stored for more than 24 hours refrigerated or more than 24 hours at room temperature. If stored in the refrigerator, allow the solution to come to room temperature before administration.

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Disposal

This medicinal product is for single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
