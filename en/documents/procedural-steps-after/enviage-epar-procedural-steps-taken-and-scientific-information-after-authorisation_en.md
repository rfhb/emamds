| II/0033 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of SPC section 4.4 to include a warning of events of renal dysfunction in at- risk patients and to amend the existing text for renal artery stenosis following the CHMP assessment of PSURs. SPC section 4.8 has been updated relating to events of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure during post-marketing experience. The package leafet has been amended accordingly. | 19/02/2009          | 03/04/2009 product                       | SPC, PL no                       | For aliskiren, cases of renal dysfunction with relevant occurrence were reported in the postmarketing use (PSUR 1 and PSUR 2). Following evaluation of the available postmarketing data, the CHMP concluded to add a warning to SPC section 4.4 that caution should be exercised when aliskiren is given in the presence of conditions pre- disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolemia (eg. due to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver disease or kidney disease. Acute renal failure, reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in post-marketing experience.. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be promptly discontinued. Furthermore, SPC section 4.8 was also amended. |

|         | Update of SPC section 4.5 to include a statement regarding the potential interaction with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs).

As with other agents acting on the renin -angiotensin system, NSAIDs may reduce the anti- hypertensive effect of aliskiren. In some patients with compromised renal function (dehydrated patients or elderly patients) aliskiren given concomitantly with NSAIDs may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore the combination of aliskiren with an NSAID requires caution, especially in elderly patients. The package leaflet has been amended accordingly. authorised                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| II/0031 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of SPC sections 4.3 and 4.4 to include a contraindication on the use in patients with prior history of angioedema and a warning of angioedema-type reactions as for other agents acting on the renin- angiotensin system respectively, following the CHMP assessment of PSURs. Furthermore, SPC section 4.8 has been revised regarding angioedema cases and the Package Leaflet has been updated in accordance with the SPC changes. | 19/02/2009          | 03/04/2009                               | SPC, PL no                       | For aliskiren, cases of angioedema with relevant occurrence were reported in the postmarketing use. Following the assessment of the available data, the CHMP concluded that a contraindication for patients with a history of angioedema with aliskiren is needed. In addition, a warning of angioedema-type reactions as for other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system has been added to SPC section 4.4 recommending that patients without a previous history who suffer angioedema with aliskiren should discontinue treatment and contact their doctor. Furthermore,the term \"angioedema\" has been added as a rare adverse drug reaction to SPC section 4.8. longer                                                                                                                                                                        |

Also cyclosporine markedly increased aliskiren t1/2. Hence, there is concern that the increase in AUC would be substantially higher with the approved aliskiren dosage, even exceeding the highest dose tested in humans. An additional concern is that aliskiren might distribute to tissues from which the medicinal product is normally absent in presence of a P-gp inhibitor, or preset at low levels because of the activity of P-gp. Non clinical and clinical data converge to show that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren bioavailability. In addition, literature data show that P-gp mediates |

Given the very limited safety data at increased exposure, and the risk for very large increase in tissue exposure, the CHMP concluded that the co-administration of cyclosporine and aliskiren poses serious safety concerns. Therefore, a contraindication for the concomitant administration with cyclosporine, a highly potent P-gp inhibitor, as well as with other potent P g inhibitors (verapamil, quinidine) is considered essential. Moreover, due to the risk for higher increase in tissue exposure than in plasma, caution should be advised during co administration with moderate P-gp inhibitors (ketoconazol, itraconazol, clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). authorised                                                                                                                                                        |

The addition of 300mg aliskiren achieved an average reduction in the urinary albumin to creatinine (UACR) ratio of 12 mg/mmol (from 58 to 46 mg/mmol) compared to placebo. Aliskiren did not induce any significant effect on blood pressure or affect estimated GFR under these conditions. The clinical relevance of a reduction in UACR is not established in the absence of an effect on blood pressure. Furthermore, aliskiren was associated with an increased frequency (4.2% vs. 1.9% for placebo) in serum potassium concentration (? 6 mmol/l). |
