The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of Indication to include a new indication for Keytruda in second line Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC); as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

A Scientific  Advice,  related  to  clinical  development  in  NSCLC  and  to  the  study  design  of  the  pivotal KEYNOTE- 010 (P010) trial, was received from the CHMP. The originally proposed study was revised taking into account most of the feedback received.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Keytruda (pembrolizumab, MK-3475) is a humanized monoclonal antibody blocking the interaction between the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligands PD-L1 and PDL2. As a consequence, the functional activity of the target lymphocytes is enhanced to facilitate immune-mediated anti-tumor activity. A Marketing Authorization was granted on July 17, 2015 in the EU as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults.

Lung cancer has been among the most common cancers in the world for several decades. The 2012 worldwide estimates of cancer incidence and mortality by GLOBOCAN, indicate a total of 1.8 million new lung cancer cases and 1.6 million lung cancer related deaths, accounting for 13.0% of all cancer cases (except non-melanoma skin cancers) and 19.4% of all cancer deaths (except non-melanoma skin cancers). Furthermore, lung cancer incidence rates were two-fold higher in males compared to females (1,241,601 and 583,100, respectively). In 2013, the estimated number of lung cancer related deaths is 159,480 in the United States (Siegel et al 2013) and 269,610 in the European Union (Malvezzi et al 2013).

The two most prevalent sub-types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, which is frequently further subdivided into non-squamous carcinoma (including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other cell types) and squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma (Brambilla et al, 2014 and Schrump DS et al NSCLC; Principles and Practice of Oncology. 9th Edition. 2011).

In approximately two thirds of patients, NSCLC is diagnosed at an advanced stage. The standard of care for first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC is still platinum-based doublets, to which bevacizumab

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and/or maintenance therapy in patients with good performance status can be added. In case of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements, approved target therapy agents are available.

The prognosis for patients who failed first line therapies is dismal. A poor response rate was reported from single agent docetaxel, pemetrexed, or erlotinib (4.0% - 17.9%), with the median progression free survival (PFS) of 1.5 to 4.2 months and the overall survival (OS) ranging from 5.4 to 14.8 months. A small but statistically significant improvement over docetaxel single agent was registered with the addition of ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody specifically binding VEGF Receptor 2, that has been recently approved in combination with docetaxel as a second-line therapy for advanced NSCLC patients. The combination of docetaxel plus ramucirumab showed a small but statistically significant improvement in terms of PFS (HR 0.76, median PFS 4.5 vs. 3.0 months) and OS (HR 0.86, median OS 10.5 vs. 9.1 months).

Nintedanib, a multi kinase inhibitor, in combination with docetaxel has been also approved for the second-line treatment of NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma, based on the demonstration of a statistically significant improvement in PFS and OS compared to docetaxel single agent (PFS: HR 0.84, median PFS 4.2 vs. 2.8 months in the follow-up analysis of the primary endpoint, OS: HR 0.83, median 12.6 vs. 10.3 months).

Nivolumab, a different antibody directed against PD-1, is already approved for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic squamous and non-squamous NSCLC after prior chemotherapy.

The current application is a type II variation to extend the indication in treatment of advanced NonSmall Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) in adults with tumours expressing PD-L1 who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. The application is based on results from the  study KEYNOTE010 'A Phase II/III Randomized Trial of Two Doses of MK-3475 versus Docetaxel in Previously Treated Subjects with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer', with supportive data from the phase I trial KEYNOTE-001, cohorts C and F.

The MAH applied for the following indication:

KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 and who have disease progression on or after prior chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumour aberrations should also have disease progression on approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.

The CHMP recommended the following indication:

KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. Patients with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations should also have received approved therapy for these mutations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.

In order to be treated with Keytruda, patients with NSCLC should be selected for treatment based on the tumour expression of PD-L1 confirmed by a validated test (see sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC).

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Pembrolizumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the environment. Thus, according to the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), pembrolizumab is exempt from the submission of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a significant risk to the environment.

## Absorption

Keytruda is administered via the i.v. route and is therefore completely (100%) bioavailable.

## Distribution

The volume of distribution of Keytruda at steady state is small (7.4L).

## Elimination

Keytruda is eliminated by catabolism. The systemic clearance of Keytruda is ~0.2 L/day (CV: 37%) and the terminal half-life (t½) is ~27 days (CV: 38%).

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Exposure to Keytruda (Cmax and AUC) increased linearly dose proportionally within the dose range for efficacy (1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg).

Upon repeated dosing, the clearance of Keytruda was found to be independent of time, and systemic accumulation was approximately 2.1-fold when administered every 3 weeks.

## Special populations

The impact of intrinsic factors on pembrolizumab exposure from the definitive population PK analysis (report 0473LK) is described below (see also section 2.3.4 for a detailed description of population PK report 0473LK).

## Exploratory analysis of covariates

Based on established exposure bounds, no clinically relevant impact on exposure was identified for other intrinsic factors in the NSCLC population, including age, gender, race, renal impairment (eGFR), or mild hepatic impairment and markers of FcRn capacity (baseline albumin). Exploratory covariate evaluations were performed as exemplified for age (see figure below).

Cancer type in the data set was classified in two categories: Melanoma and NSCLC.

The following displays the distribution of clearance and inter-individual variability versus cancer type. No impact of cancer type on clearance can be observed.

Tumour burden showed a trend of correlation with clearance as well as inter-individual variability on clearance suggesting that Tumour burden might have an effect on clearance (figure below).

Figure 6: Effect of tumour burden on clearance

There appears to be no obvious trend between clearance and eGFR, either as a continuous covariate or as a categorical covariate broken out by impairment severity classification.

No effect on clearance is seen for mild and normal hepatic patients (Figure below, right). However for severe and moderate hepatic patients there appears to be an indication of a trend towards decreased clearance. Limited number of patients in Severe and Moderate hepatic categories were available in the pop PK analysis (table below).

## Statistical covariate analysis

## Method

As  an  exploratory  check  intended  to  test  stability  of  the  key  covariate  findings,  re-identification  of covariates  was  performed  using  a  stepwise  selection  procedure  (Stepwise  Covariate  Model  building, linear relationships in a forwards inclusion (ΔOFV of 6.63, p &lt; 0.01 for 1 DF) and backwards exclusion (Δ OFV of 10.8, p &lt; 0.001 for 1 DF) procedure. The categorical covariates Gender (on CL and Vc) and ECOG performance status, Co-administered drugs, Cancer type, Race, PDL1, Smoking Status on CL were tested as well as the continuous covariates Albumin and AST (on CL and Vc) and Bilirubin, eGFR,

SCM) within  PsN  (psn.sourceforge.net).  This  procedure  involves  stepwise  testing  of  linear  and  nonTumour burden and Age on CL. Weight was included as structural covariate on clearance and volume. The covariate 'prior IPI treatment status' was excluded from the present analysis, as it was specifically collected only in the melanoma trials. In addition, to all previous covariates, Race (White/Asian) was added due to the number of Asian subjects that were recruited in P010.

As in the previous analysis, highly correlated (ALP, ALT) and covariates with missing values (IgG) were excluded.

## Results

The  following  table  provides  the  final  list  of  statistically  significant  covariates  selected  by  the  SCM algorithm.

*No means covariate was not found statistically significant according to SCM algorithm

bYes means covariate was retained by SCM algorithm

Since  no  new  covariates  were  selected  compared  to  the  previous  population  PK  analysis,  no assessment of clinical relevance of the covariate effects was performed. Specifically, the newly added covariate race was not picked up as having statistically-significant impact on clearance or volume of distribution and was therefore not assessed for clinical relevance.

The final model was fitted to 1000 bootstrap replicate datasets to assess consistency of the parameter estimates and their precision with those obtained in the previous population PK analysis. The mean parameter  estimates  and  associated  95%  CIs  were  along  with  the  bootstrap  estimates  from  the previous population PK analysis. Results indicate robust consistency between the two analyses, with confidence intervals for most of the parameter estimates showing large overlap.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

## Mechanism of action

Keytruda  is  an  antibody  which  binds  to  the  programmed  death-1  (PD-1)  receptor  and  blocks  its interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. Keytruda potentiates Tcell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PDL2, which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour microenvironment.

Data source [Appendix 7]

In the new database, a total of 11886 samples from 2910 subjects were available.

The  immunogenicity  categorization  was  to  include  only  subjects  who  received  treatment  and  had  a post-treatment  ADA  sample  available.  The  overall  immunogenicity  incidence  was  defined  as  the proportion of treatment-emergent positive subjects to the total number of evaluable subjects.

Figure 8: Flow charts of subjects included in immunogenicity analysis

The immunogenicity analysis as presented contained 2632 subjects (1535 melanoma and 1097 NSCLC assessable subjects).

Twenty nine (29) subjects had one or more samples that tested positive in the tier 2 confirmatory assay  for  antibodies  against  pembrolizumab.  In  the  subgroup  of  NSCLC  subjects,  16  of  the  653 evaluable  subjects  tested  positive  for  treatment-emergent  antibodies  to  pembrolizumab  during treatment  with  pembrolizumab  (16  with  treatment  emergent  positive  status,  6  with  non-treatment emergent positive status and 631 with negative immunogenicity status, red rectangles), yielding an incidence rate of 2.5% and compared to 631 negative and 444 inconclusive subjects.

An overview of the immunogenicity evaluation stratified by treatment and indication is presented in the table reported below.

a:Included are subjects with at least one ADA sample available after treatment with pembrolizumab

b: Inconclusive subjects are the number of subjects with no positive ADA samples present and the drug concentration in the last sample above the DTL.

- c: Evaluable subjects are the total number of negative and positive subjects (non-treatment emergent and treatment emergent.
- d: Denominator was total number of evaluable subjects.

Data source [Appendix 7]

As  reported  in  the  table  above,  the  observed  incidence  of  treatment  emergent  ADA  in  evaluable subjects was 1.7% (19 out of 1087, green rectangles). Of note, the previously reported value in the melanoma indication was 0.4 %.

At  this  time,  results  from  the  neutralizing  assay  are  available  from  4  subjects.  For  one  of  these subjects that was negative at ADA assay, sample was inadvertently tested in Neutralizing Assay and resulted to be positive. The remaining three subjects were negative in the neutralizing assay.

## Evaluation of drug tolerance level

Interference by pembrolizumab in the ADA assays may occur, especially at concentrations above the drug tolerance level. Therefore, samples with a negative test result in the screening or confirmatory anti-pembrolizumab  assay  could  only  be  conclusively  confirmed  to  be  negative  in  the  case  of  a pembrolizumab  concentration  below  the  DTL.  Furthermore,  the  immunogenicity  status  of  a  subject could only be conclusively confirmed to be negative if all pre-treatment and post-dose samples were negative in the confirmatory assay for antibodies against pembrolizumab and if the concentration of pembrolizumab in the last post-dose sample was below the drug tolerance level .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At the recommended dosing regimen of 2 mg/kg, the pembrolizumab concentration in the last postdose sample was below the drug tolerance level for about 81% of the subjects.

## Impact of ADA on MK-3475 exposure

The  pembrolizumab  exposure  for  ADA  positive  subjects  was  similar  to  the  exposure  observed  for negative subjects treated with the same dose regimen (data not shown).

## QTc evaluation

No new data on QTc has been submitted.

## 2.3.4. PK/PD modelling

An  extension  of  the  population  PK  analysis  (044WBG  using  P001,  P002  and  P006  studies  and submitted  as  part  of  EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0002,  CHMP  opinion  adopted  on  1  April  2016)  was conducted.  The  present  analysis  (report  0473LK)  also  includes  data  from  657  NSCLC  patients  from protocol P010. In total 2856 subjects were included in the final analysis with the objectives to:

- Assess the appropriateness of the existing Pop PK model to characterize concentration data from Protocol 010.
- Generate exposure predictions for patients in Protocol 010 to support exposure-response analyses.
- Investigate the effects of race on pertinent PK parameters

The parameters from the initial and updated models are compared in the following table.

Goodness of fit plots of the final model and visual predictive check (VPC) were performed (data not shown).

The MAH has explored a series of structural PK models incorporating time-dependency in clearance.

Results (data not shown) showed that there is a pattern in time-dependent clearance with response categories (progressive disease, stable disease, complete and partial disease).

## Exploratory Re-check of Covariate Findings

To confirm consistency in covariate relationships between the model based on the updated dataset and the  previous  analysis,  an  exploratory  covariate  analysis  was  conducted.  In  addition  to  all  previous covariates, RACE (White/Asian) was added due to the number of Asian subjects recruited in P010 (see table below).

## Bootstrap

The  final  model  was  also  fitted  to  1000  bootstrap  replicate  datasets  to  assess  consistency  of  the parameter estimates and their  precision  with  those  obtained  in  the  previous  population  PK  analysis (data not shown).

## Simulations to Illustrate the PK Profile of Pembrolizumab

The model was used to simulate typical concentration-time profiles for different dosing regimens of pembrolizumab. This included a comparison of the exposures that would be generated by a fixed dose regimen of 200 mg Q3W with those for the weight-based doses included in the current dataset.

The table below presents values of derived parameters (Cmax, Ctrough, AUC) at steady state obtained from model-based simulations. Typical patient receiving dosing regiments of 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q2W were simulated 1000 times using the final model.

## Exposure-response analysis

A Model-based analysis of the relationship between pembrolizumab exposure and efficacy in patients with NSCLC in PN001 and PN010 was performed (report 0473KZ)

Data for this analysis were derived from patients treated on cohorts C and F of Protocol 001 (PN001) and pembrolizumab-treated arms of Protocol 010 (PN010). In total, 550 subjects received pembrolizumab treatment on PN001 and 682 on PN010. The tumour size exposure-response modelling analysis dataset consists of a subset of these 'all patients as treated' (APaT) set including only those patients who had a baseline tumour size assessment and were evaluable for pharmacokinetic analysis.

## Results:

There were 4,554 observations from 1,151 patients comprising the FAS dataset used in the tumour size  exposure-response analysis described in this report.  Of  these  1,151  patients,  84  had  a tumour size measurement at a follow-up of at least 28 weeks but no measurements within a 26-30 week (i.e. 28 ± 2 week) window. 697 patients in the dataset had maximum follow-up less than 28 ± 2 weeks. This left 370 patients who had at least one tumour size measurement within 26-30 week (i.e. 28 ± 2 week) from baseline and also an AUCss-6weeks value. Of these 370 patients, 173 were considered TPS ≥50%, 156 were TPS 1-49%, 25 were TPS&lt;1% (PD-L1 negative), and 16 were PD-L1 unknown.

Exploratory plots were generated to gain insight in the overall pattern of change in tumour size over time  and  to  investigate  trends  of  response  to  treatment  vs.  exposure.  The  visual  exploration  was supported by the results of a simple linear regression where appropriate.

## Exploration of Exposure-response at Week 28

Percent changes  of tumour  size from  baseline at 28  weeks  after the baseline scan versus pembrolizumab AUCss-6weeks and stratified by PD-L1 expression were explored (data not shown).

The linear regression slope estimates for prior treated were modest and not significantly different from 0 (p&gt;0.05) and there was no clear evidence of exposure dependency in response as also shown by the similar  distribution  of  individual  tumour  response  values  across  the  AUCss-6weeks  quintiles  (see  figure below)).

## Evaluation of covariate effects on tumour size model parameter estimates

An  automated  stepwise  forward  inclusion  (p&lt;0.01)  /  backward  elimination  (p&lt;0.001)  elimination procedure was applied to test for significant covariates on the model parameters using the Stepwise Covariate Modelling (SCM) routine implemented in PsN.

The figure below illustrates the structural components for describing NSCLC tumour dynamics:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

f = fraction of the tumour on which removal is occurring (individual parameters assumed to be logit normally distributed and thus constrained between 0 and 1).

kgrowth = Tumour growth rate (constrained to be positive, with individual parameters lognormally distributed)

'Baseline ' is the baseline tumour size. In the current implementation, this is fixed to observed value and not estimated.

kdeath = Tumour kill rate (constrained to be positive, with individual parameters log normally distributed) that captures the kinetics of the net tumour removal in the responding portion of the tumour delay =  Delay  in  the  onset  of  drug  activity  for  tumour  killing  interpreted  as  the  time  required  for  immune  system  activation (constrained to be positive, with individual parameters log normally distributed)

max(0,time-delay) = To constrain the system to avoid evaluating the model at negative times (i.e. tumour size before baseline), any scenario where delay&gt;time, time = 0

Examination  of  plots  of  the  distributions  of post  hoc individual  parameters  against  covariates (see figure below) indicate that higher levels of PD-L1 expression are associated with a higher fraction of tumour being responsive to therapy, and mutated EGFR status, and younger age are associated with higher k growth .

## Exposure-response Simulations

Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, a maximum of five representative target lesions (and up to two lesions per organ) are identified and monitored for follow-up. Target lesions are evaluated based on change in SLD and patient response classified as either Complete Response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions), Partial Response (PR; 30% decrease in SLD of target lesions), Progressive Disease (PD; 20% increase in  SLD of target lesions), and Stable Disease (SD; neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD).

Simulations were first conducted at 1 mg/kg Q3W, 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W and 200 mg Q3W, drawing from subjects with PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, and from subjects with TPS≥1% (data not shown).

The simulated median response rates for PD-L1 TPS ≥50% patients and TPS &lt;1% at week 28 were reported below.

## Exposure-Adverse Event analysis

An exposure-adverse event analysis of pembrolizumab in a pooled dataset of patients with advanced melanoma and NSCLC form P001, P002, P006 and P0101 studies was performed (report 0473LR) to further characterize the exposure response relationship for pembrolizumab for relevant adverse events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in  a  pooled  dataset  across  melanoma  and  NSCLC  indications  and  to  estimate  the  impact  of  other predictors on the occurrence of the adverse events of interest.

Data  from  2530  patients,  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  pembrolizumab  and  had  a  measured baseline  tumour  value,  was  used  for  this  exposure  safety  analysis.  Consistent  with  overall  safety analyses  presented  elsewhere,  a  group  of  AEs  of  special  interest  (AEOSI)  was  defined,  as  a  broad category of potentially immune related adverse events, excluding mild dermatological disorders. The AEOSI group was used as the dependent variable in this analysis.

## Simulation

Simulations  were  used  to  characterize  the  typical  probability  of  experiencing  an  AEOSI  event  as  a function  of  exposure  taking  into  account  the  estimated  parameter  uncertainty  from  the  variancecovariance matrix and the influence of any significant covariate from the final model. Simulations were performed on the basis of the final model.

## Covariates

The following baseline covariates were included in the analysis datasets: duration of treatment, dosing regimen,  randomization  status,  indication,  baseline  tumor  size,  ECOG  performance  status,  body weight,  sex,  EGFR  status  and  PD-L1  status.  A  specific  component  of  the  covariate  analysis  was  to assess the importance of time (duration of treatment) for the occurrence of AEOSI.

## Exploratory analysis

The potential presence of an exposure response relationship was investigated by means of bar plots of AE frequency vs bins of AUC6wks for different covariates (the same covariates as mentioned above).

The AUC values were divided into bins based on the percentiles and the number of bins depended on the total number of patients in order to have sufficient patients per bin or percentile.

## Results

The  results  of  the  stepwise  covariate  analysis  (first  forward  addition,  data  not  shown)  revealed  the duration of treatment as the main covariate that was statistically significant on intercept indicating that patients  with  longer  treatment  duration  have  somewhat  higher  probability  to  experience  an  AEOSI. Following inclusion of this covariate, no other covariate relationships were found to meet the criterion for inclusion in the model.

The table reported below summarizes the estimated parameters from the final model.

The  inclusion  of  the  covariate  for  treatment  duration  rendered  the  linear  exposure  response relationship insignificant (p=0.56 based on log likelihood ratio test versus a model with the slope value fixed  at  zero),  as  also  indicated  by  the  large  %  relative  standard  error  (RSE)  for  the  parameter estimate.

Table 14: Parameter estimates of the final AEOSI logistic regression model

Apart from the exposure-response slope, the other two parameters (intercept and effect of treatment duration on intercept) were estimated with good precision (low %RSE).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

When forcing the non-significant regression slope with AUC on the final model, this was estimated to be  0.00000581  mL/(μg.day)  (173%  RSE).  This  translates  into  predicted  probabilities  of  having  a potentially  immune  related  AE  ranging  from  18.6  to  19.7%  for  the  10th  and  90th  percentiles  of AUC6wks values, respectively, in the pooled analysis dataset.

## Model Qualification

Before using the logistic regression model for simulation purposes a visual predictive check (VPC) for the  final  model  based  on  the  full  dataset.  Data  sets  were  simulated  based  on  the  estimates  of  the parameters  and  the  accompanied  uncertainties  from  the  final  model.  The  VPC  was  performed  by simulating  10000  subjects.  The  5th,  50th  and  95th-percentiles  were  calculated  from  the  simulated profiles and were super-imposed on the raw data (divided into different bins: one for 2 mg/kg and 4 equally  sized  bins  for  10  mg/kg,  each  for  three  different  categories  of  treatment  duration)  to  allow assessment of model predictability. The VPC for the final model including a non-significant exposure to pembrolizumab and incidence of AEOSI is displayed below.

## SIMULATIONS

## Data Sets

The simulation datasets included 10000 subjects and exposure as the predictor variable. In addition, treatment duration was included, since it was a significant covariate in the model.

## Simulation Results

The simulated probability of experiencing an AEOSI in function of exposure, using the final model, is shown here below:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The median (90% CI) simulated probability of experiencing an AE of the AEOSI group during 199 days of treatment (median treatment duration in dataset) for an exposure equal to the median AUC6wks for 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q2W was 0.19 (0.17 - 0.21), 0.19 (0.18 - 0.21) and 0.20 (0.18-0.22), respectively. Thus, simulations indicate AEOSI occurrence to remain similar with increasing exposure.

## 2.3.5. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

An updated clinical pharmacology dossier was submitted as part of this application.

## Immunogenicity evaluation

An integrated immunogenicity evaluation has been performed across data from studies P001, P002, P006 and P010. The immunogenicity analysis as presented in this report contained 2632 subjects (1535 melanoma and 1097 NSCLC assessable subjects). The observed incidence of treatment emergent ADA in evaluable subjects was 1.7%, slightly increased relative to previously reported values (0.4 %) in melanoma indication. This slight higher incidence of ADA in NSCLC relative to the melanoma indication is likely the result of the ongoing optimization of the immunogenicity assay framework. The majority of the NSCLC data were analysed with the most recent assay at PPD which has a higher tolerance level for the presence of pembrolizumab and the considerably longer treatment durations included in the current analysis.

At the recommended dosing regimen of 2 mg/kg, the pembrolizumab concentration in the last postdose sample was below the drug tolerance level (&lt;DTL) for about 81% of the subjects. Considering all treatments regimen, the pembrolizumab concentration in the last post-dose sample was below the drug tolerance level for about 41% of the subjects and for the dosing regimen of 10mg/kg the percentage of subjects with a pembrolizumab concentration &lt;DTL in the last post-dose samples was of about 27%.

The new assay with this high drug tolerance level allows conclusive assessment of the immunogenicity potential of pembrolizumab based on trough samples in 81% of patients at the proposed dose regimen of  2 mg/kg Q3W. At the dose of 10 mg/kg results from a high percentage of patients resulted inconclusive, but also considering the clinical data supporting the use of the 2 mg dose, this issue is no longer pursued.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH is actually validating a new designed assay for the evaluation of neutralizing antibody (only data from 4 of the positive subjects are available at present). This validation will be finalized by end of 2Q 2016 and the MAH will submit the final results by 3Q 2016 (see RMP).

The pembrolizumab exposure for ADA positive subjects was similar to the exposure observed for negative subjects treated with the same dose regimen as already observed in the previous analysis. There was no evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic with anti-pembrolizumab binding antibody development.

## Population PK Analysis

An extension of the population PK analysis was conducted. The present analysis (report 0473LK) has built on the previous one that was updated and expanded to include data from 657 NSCLC patients from protocol P010 for a total of 2856 subjects included in the final analysis. Parameter estimates from both models are very similar.

The addition of PK data from P010 did not alter the previous population PK data for pembrolizumab (report 044WBG) in a significant way. Race (white or Asian) as a covariate did not have a statistically significant impact on clinical exposure.

Most intrinsic factors seem to have no relevant impact on pembrolizumab exposure (clearance). Specifically, age has no impact on exposure. Gender (independent of body weight), tumour type, renal and hepatic impairment, disease and albumin, while statistically significant, have at most small and not clinically relevant impact on exposure based on the established clinical bounds.

Visualization of the impact of albumin on clearance has been provided further to CHMP request. Provided data show that the lower the albumin level, the higher the corresponding clearance. Clearance values have been stratified by low (&lt; 0.35 g/dL) and normal range albumin (&gt; 0.35 g/dL). Post-hoc median clearance value in subjects with low albumin is approximately one third higher compared to subjects with normal range albumin. The MAH's explanation that albumin and the associated clearance variations likely reflect variation in disease severity (extent of cachexia and enhanced catabolism as a marker of end-stage cancer) is plausible. Data from subjects with severe hepatic and renal impairment were too sparse to draw a clinical conclusion from the data with respect to severe impairment. The influence of bilirubin as a marker for hepatic impairment could be associated with albumin.

The effect of all statistically significant covariates was judged clinically not important, as the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of exposures and their computed 95% CIs remained within the established clinical bounds interval of 0.5 to 5, based on clinical dose- and exposure-response data. No high correlations were found between Albumin and Bilirubin (i.e. correlation coefficient=0.088) or any of the other covariates included in the formal covariate testing.

## PK/PD modelling

Visual predictive checks were carried out to check the ability of the model to describe the new data from P010; those were stratified by dose. As acknowledged by the MAH, the VPCs demonstrate an under-prediction of pembrolizumab concentration at later time point. Further to the CHMP request, the MAH evaluated the potential for time-dependency in pembrolizumab PK to account for the discrepancy demonstrated by the VPC. An exploratory Kaplan-Meier of OS showed that the overall survival was associated with pembrolizumab clearance but not exposure (lower pembrolizumab clearance is associated with improved survival) and subjects with an initial higher CL tend to stay in the trial for shorter duration and therefore contribute less to PK concentration-time data than patients with lower CL. A series of structural PK models incorporating time-dependency in clearance have been explored. Results showed that there is a pattern in time-dependent clearance with response categories

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(progressive disease, stable disease, complete and partial disease), consistent with the hypothesized association between CL and OS.

It is assumed that all patients starting treatment have higher clearance values probably because they are in a more advanced cachectic state (hyper-catabolism) associated with a more severe disease. If patients have a beneficial response to the drug, the hyper-catabolism may be reduced (cachectic state may be improved), while the cachectic state and so the hyper -catabolism increases in progressing patients. It can be hypothesised that variations on clearance (the dependency of clearance on albumin levels has also been shown) reflect variations in disease severity (extent of cachexia and hypercatabolism) is possible.

As acknowledged by the MAH, the ETA shrinkage of the empirical Bayes estimates from the exposureresponse model of tumor size is moderate to high. Shrinkage was assigned to an unavoidable effect of sparse and heterogeneous data available at individual patient level. Provided qq plots showed deviations from normality of the random effect distributions on kgrowth (ETA1), fraction dying, f (ETA3) and especially kdeath (ETA2). Given that some shrinkage appears to be unavoidable, model predictions should be trusted with caution.

## Exposure-response analysis

A Model-based analysis of the relationship between pembrolizumab (MK-3475) exposure and efficacy in patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in PN001 and PN010 was performed (report 0473KZ). There was no clear evidence of exposure dependency in response as also shown by the similar distribution of individual tumour response values across the AUCss-6weeks quintiles. Plots of simulated response rate show that there is only a light exposure-response dependency in tumour size response across doses ranging from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W. There is a little trend of increase in response and a parallel little decrease in progression both in patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥50% than in patients with PD-L1 TPS &lt;1%.

The potential for exposure-dependency in OS in NSCLC patients from P010 was investigated using exploratory Kaplan-Meier (K-M) plots, stratified by AUCss-6weeks quartile, thus comparing the OS with CL and exposure. The analysis considered a total of 651 patients (324 treated with a dose of 10 mg/kg Q3W and 327 patients with a dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W). Presented data show that the higher dose of 10 mg/kg Q3W has no noticeable beneficial effect in comparison to 2 mg/kg Q3W. Within each dose group, there appears to be a strong relationship between AUC and OS. Irrespective of dose, a high AUC (low clearance) is associated with higher rate of overall survival (OS).

OS of all four quartiles are comparable per dose group. In the pooled analysis, the survival curves associated within each quartile (e.g. 1st quartile of AUCss-6weeks from the 2mg/kg dose versus the 10 mg/kg dose) are similar with overlapping confidence limits, despite the observed 5-fold difference in AUCss-6weeks values.  Moreover, the 2nd and 4th quartiles of AUC of the combined analysis (2 and 10 mg/kg doses) shows the lowest CL value together with the improved OS relative to the 1st and 3rd quartiles of AUC, suggesting that exposure-OS relationship is strongly associated with pembrolizumab's clearance rather to exposure.

Secondly, the lack of a clear exposure-response relationship was also demonstrated by simulated median response rates at week 28, where the predicted proportion of patients with progressing tumour growth has been shown to be quite similar across wide dose ranges and close to the maximal response plateau of efficacy at a 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Thus, patients with low exposure (Q1, 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg group) regardless of PD-L1 expression have lower benefit regarding OS, but the data clearly indicate that dose adjustment would not alter this situation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subject age, EGFR mutation and PD-L1 expression status are significant predictors of tumour size response as suggested by the final results of the stepwise covariate model, and no other patient specific factors were found to be predictive of tumour size parameters.

## Exposure-Adverse Event analysis

An exposure-adverse event analysis of pembrolizumab in a pooled dataset of patients with advanced melanoma and NSCLC form P001, P002, P006 and P010 studies was performed (report 0473LR).

The  simulated  analysis  as  well  as  the  exploratory  plots  analysis  demonstrated  the  absence  of exposure-response  relationship  supporting  the  flat  exposure-response  of  pembrolizumab  for  these types of AEs (AEOSI) within the tested dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg.

In the updated graphs provided by the MAH, all the binned observed data fall within (or near) the 90% confidence interval from the model.

## IHC to detect PD-L1 expression

To evaluate the clinical performance of CRA a bridging study was conducted with a retrospective testing of banked tissue samples using the CRA based on clinical outcomes from study P010 that enrolled on a Clinical Trial Assay. Overall, the bridging analysis to compare the two assays (CTA and CRA) shows an unidirectional trend versus a more stringent selection with the new assay, with the most evident discordance observed for 136 specimens resulted negative (TPS&lt;1%) with CRA and previously classified as weakly positive (1-49%) with CTA. Analyses of OS and PFS based on PD-L1 expression detected by the new assay provided slightly stronger results than those obtained with the primary efficacy analysis conducted using CTA, especially in the overall population, and support the use of the new assay for the selection of patients. Whether, these results are driven solely by the difference in the monoclonal mouse anti PD-L1, or also by other factors is difficult to establish. Differences in the sample type used (tissue from resection vs biopsies) could have influenced the results.

## 2.3.6. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab has been mainly characterised by means of a population PK model which is considered acceptable.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology:

- To submit the validation report for anti-pembrolizumab neutralizing antibody assay by September 2016

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

This  application  to  extend  the  Keytruda  therapeutic  indication  for  the  treatment  of  second  line  or greater  advanced  NSCLC  with  PD-L1 expression is based on  efficacy  results  from  the  pivotal  phase II/III  trial  KEYNOTE-010,  comparing  two  pembrolizumab  doses  (2  mg/kg  and  10  mg/kg,  every  3 weeks)  versus  docetaxel.  Data  from  the  phase  I  study  KEYNOTE-001  Cohorts  C  and  F,  enrolling previously treated NSCLC patients, were also submitted as supportive.

In study P001, an additional cohort (Part E), designed to characterize pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in NSCLC patients was originally planned. However, no patients were enrolled and, as suggested by FDA, this cohort was removed and set up as a stand-alone study (KEYNOTE-021).

## 2.4.1. Dose response study(ies)

No additional dose-response study was performed, and data are limited to those submitted at the time of the initial Marketing Authorisation Application, from the escalation Part A of the phase I P001 trial.

In the trial P010, submitted as pivotal to support this extension of indication, 2 pembrolizumab doses (2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W), including that already recommended for the treatment of melanoma patients, were tested with an opportunity to drop a poorly performing dose early in the study.

## 2.4.2. Main study

A Phase II/III Randomized Trial of Two Doses of MK-3475 versus Docetaxel in Previously Treated Subjects with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (KEYNOTE-010, P010).

## Methods

<!-- image -->

## Study participants

## Key inclusion criteria were:

- Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC with at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1. The target lesion(s) should also have bi-dimensional measurability for irRC evaluation on study.
- Investigator determined radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1 (from at least 2 dates) after treatment  with  at  least  two  cycles  of  a platinum-containing  doublet  for  stage  IIIB/IV  or recurrent  disease.  Completion  of  treatment  with  a  platinum-containing  doublet  as  adjuvant therapy within one  year of signing informed  consent  will satisfy the prior  treatment requirement.
- o Subjects  with  an  EGFR  sensitizing  mutation  must  also  be  able  to  demonstrate progression of disease on the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (either erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib).
- o Subjects with an ALK translocation must also be able to demonstrate progression of disease on crizotinib.

Subjects  with  an  EGFR  sensitizing  mutation  or  with  an  ALK  translocation  may  have  been treated previously with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor separately from the platinum-containing doublet; the order of treatment does not matter, but progression of disease as determined by RECIST 1.1 must be demonstrable for both regimens. An exception to this rule is the patient whose NSCLC tumour has an EGFR sensitizing mutation who receives four cycles of a platinum doublet, does not experience progression of disease, and begins therapy with an EGFR tyrosine kinase  inhibitor  as  a  maintenance  therapy  within  28  days  of  the  last  administration  of  the platinum  doublet  chemotherapy.  For  this  patient,  only  one  set  of  images  demonstrating

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

progression on the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor is required for submission to the independent imaging vendor for the patient to be eligible.

- PD-L1  positive  (either  strongly  or  weakly)  tumour  as  determined  by  IHC  at  a  central laboratory.  If  the  initial  tumour  specimen  is  not  classified  as  PD-L1  positive  by  the  central laboratory, a newly obtained specimen may be submitted for testing.
- Age ≥18 years
- ECOG performance status of ≤ 1
- Newly obtained formalin fixed tissue from a recent biopsy of a tumour lesion not previously irradiated, for PD-L1 biomarker analysis. For patients in whom obtaining a new tumour biopsy will be medically inappropriate, an archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour specimen for PD-L1 could be submitted if agreed by the study clinical director.
- o Investigators must be able to produce the source documentation of the EGFR mutation status  or  ALK  translocation  status.  If  unable  to  test  for  these  molecular  changes, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour tissue of any age should be submitted to a central laboratory .
- o If  a  patient  is  known  to  have  one  molecular  alteration  (either  sensitizing  EGFR mutation or ALK translocation), then testing for the other alteration is not required.
- o If a patient is known to have a mutation in KRAS, then testing for an EGFR mutation or for  an  ALK  translocation  will  not  be  required,  given  that  all  of  these  molecular alterations are mutually exclusive in patients with non-squamous NSCLC.
- o For  patients  enrolled  who  are  known  to  have  a  tumour  of  predominantly  squamous histology,  molecular  testing  for  EGFR  mutation  and  ALK  translocation  will  not  be required as this is not standard of care and is not part of current diagnostic guidelines.

## Main exclusion criteria were:

- Prior therapy with docetaxel for NSCLC.
- Systemic steroid therapy within three days prior to the first dose of trial treatment or any other form of immunosuppressive medication.
- Need of any other form of systemic or localized antineoplastic therapy while on trial (including maintenance therapy with another agent for NSCLC or radiation therapy).
- Prior  systemic  cytotoxic  chemotherapy,  antineoplastic  biological  therapy  (e.g.,  cetuximab), major surgery within 3 weeks; thoracic radiation therapy of &gt; 30 Gy within 6 months; prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy or completed palliative radiotherapy within 7 days.
- Prior  therapy  with  an  anti-PD-1,  anti-PD-L1,  anti-PD-L2,  anti-CD137,  or  anti-Cytotoxic  Tlymphocyte-associated  antigen-4  (CTLA-4)  antibody  (including ipilimumab  or any  other antibody  or  drug  specifically  targeting  T-cell  co-stimulation  or  checkpoint  pathways)  or participation in another pembrolizumab clinical trial.
- Known  history  of  prior  malignancy  except  if  the  patient  has  undergone  potentially  curative therapy with no evidence of that disease recurrence for 5 years since initiation of that therapy. The time requirement does not apply to subjects who underwent successful definitive resection of basal cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.
- Active autoimmune disease, or documented history of autoimmune disease, or syndrome that requires  systemic  steroids  or  immunosuppressive  agents.  Subjects  with  vitiligo  or  resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be exception to this rule. Subjects that require inhaled steroid or local steroid injections will not be excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism not from autoimmune disease and stable on hormone replacement will not be excluded from the study.
- Interstitial  lung  disease  or  a  history  of  pneumonitis  that  required  oral  or  intravenous glucocorticoids.

## Treatments

Pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) was administered IV every 3 weeks as a 30 minute infusion, with a time window of -5 and +10 minutes.

Docetaxel 75 mg/m 2  was administered IV over 1 hour every 3 weeks. Pre-medications, including oral or injectable steroids, were administered as per standard practice.

Patients randomised to docetaxel were pre-medicated with oral or injectable steroids according to the approved product label and/or standard practice. Additional pre-medications were administered as per standard practice.

Treatment with pembrolizumab or docetaxel was planned to be continued until two years or less in case of documented disease progression, unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness that prevented further administration  of  treatment,  Investigator's  decision  to  withdraw  the  subject,  subject  withdrawal  of consent, pregnancy of the subject, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, or discontinuation  due  to  administrative  reasons.  Treatment  could  be  interrupted  for  clinically  stable patients  assigned  who  experienced  disease  progression.  The  decision  to  continue  or  discontinue treatment in the trial could be deferred until confirmation of disease progression per irRC at least 28 day from the date of radiological disease progression. In case of no disease progression confirmation, treatment could be resumed.

## Objectives

Primary Objectives:

- To compare the OS and PFS per RECIST 1.1 by independent radiologists' review of previously treated NSCLC patients in the strongly positive (TPS≥50%) PD-L1 stratum.
- To  evaluate  OS  and  PFS  per  RECIST  1.1  by  independent  radiologists'  review  in  the  PD-L1 positive population.

Safety and tolerability profile of pembrolizumab in previously treated subjects with NSCLC in the TPS ≥ 50% stratum and in the overall population was also among primary objectives.

## Secondary Objectives:

- To evaluate ORR and response duration in the strongly positive (TPS≥50%) PD-L1 stratum and in the overall positive (TPS≥1%) study population.

## Exploratory Objectives :

- To  evaluate  PFS,  ORR,  response  duration  per  immune-related  response  criteria  (irRC)  by Investigators'  review  in  the  TPS≥50%  stratum  and  in  overall  positive  study  population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(TPS≥1%).

- To evaluate the influence of age of tumour specimen (archival vs new) submitted for PD-L1 analysis on the primary endpoints PFS and OS.
- To  evaluate  tumour  volumetric  changes  and  to  explore  correlation  of  tumour  volumetric changes with OS in the TPS≥50% stratum.
- To evaluate changes in HRQoL assessments from baseline, and to characterize utilities and healthcare resource utilization in the TPS≥50% stratum and in the TPS&gt;1% population.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  endpoints  were  OS  and  PFS  using  IRC  assessment  per  RECIST  1.1  in  the  TPS≥50% stratum and the TPS≥1% population.

The secondary endpoints were ORR and time to response by IRC assessment by RECIST 1.1.

The changes in HRQoL were assessed using the electronic EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items (eEORTC QLQ-C30) and the electronic EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13 items (eEORTC QLQ-LC13).

Patients were evaluated every 9 weeks (63±7 days) with radiographic imaging to assess response to treatment. Investigators made all treatment-based decisions using the irRC.

Treatment  with  pembrolizumab  or  docetaxel  was  continued  until  two  years  of  therapy  had  been administered, documented disease progression, unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness that prevented further  administration  of  treatment,  Investigator's  decision,  subject  withdrew  consent,  pregnancy, noncompliance, or for administrative reasons.

Pembrolizumab-treated patients who attained an Investigator-determined confirmed complete response (CR) per irRC could have considered stopping trial treatment. In case of radiographic disease progression these patients were eligible for re-treatment for up to one year with pembrolizumab at the Investigator discretion (Second Course Phase).

Participation in this trial was dependent upon supplying tumour tissue for PD-L1 analysis. Specimens were evaluated at a central laboratory facility for PD-L1 expression status in a prospective manner. Only patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 were eligible for randomization in this study.

## PD-L1 -expression

The PD-L1 expression levels were measured in NSCLC tumour tissues by IHC performed on tumour tissue on glass slides. Tumour tissue was analysed by the Dako Clinical Trial Assay (CTA) by using the 22C3 clone against PD-L1.

All scoring was performed by pathologists. An evaluable sample must have contained a minimum of 100 tumour cells. The slides were evaluated using several scoring methods. A tumour proportion score (TPS) reflecting the percentage of tumour cells exhibiting membranous staining was selected as the scoring  method  to  use  for  the  assay.  Tumours  with  at  least  1%  positive  staining  for  PD-L1  were considered  positive.  Since  the  Biomarker  Training  Set  defined  the  optimal  cutpoint  as  TPS≥50%, subjects with tumour PD-L1 expression above this cutpoint were referred to as strongly positive for PD-L1 expression. Those subjects with tumours who had a TPS between 1% and 49% are referred to as weakly positive for PD-L1 expression. Tumours with &lt;1% tumour cells positive for PD-L1 staining were considered negative.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After the study had started, the Sponsor became aware that PD-L1 antigens on the cut slides have the stability  window  of  6  months  for  the  CTA.  Therefore,  those  subjects  who  submitted  tumour  sample slides out of the stability window were excluded from the FAS analysis.

## Sample size

The  sample  size  was  targeted  to  be  approximately  460  for  strongly  PD-L1  positive  patients (TPS≥50%), and was projected to be approximately 920 patients for the overall population (TPS≥1%), based on an expected rate of strongly PD-L1 positive patients of around 50%.

The study was designed as event driven, with the number of patients and follow-up time subject to change, and would be complete after approximately 200 deaths observed across the three arms in the TPS≥50% stratum (approximately  140  deaths  between  one  pembrolizumab  arm  and  the  docetaxel arm  under  the  alternative  hypothesis).  With  140  deaths  between  one  pembrolizumab  arm  and  the docetaxel  arm,  the  study  had  over  81%  power  to  detect  a  0.55  hazard  ratio  at  the  final  analysis, where  0.825%  alpha  was  allocated  to  the  two  pembrolizumab  vs.  docetaxel  comparisons  using Hochberg procedure.

The sample size calculation is based on the following assumptions for subjects in the strongly positive PD-L1 stratum: 1) overall survival follows an exponential distribution with a median of 9 months in the control arm, 2) the hazard ratio between pembrolizumab and control is 0.60, 3) an enrollment period of 16 months and a minimum of 8 months follow-up after enrollment completion, 4) a dropout rate of 2%  in  12  months.  The  assumed  median  overall  survival  time  of  9  months  for  docetaxel  treated patients  is  based  on  historical  data,  and  the  possible  positive  prognostic  nature  of  high  PD-L1 expression levels. The median OS in docetaxel could be greater or less than 9 months in patients with strongly positive PD -L1 expression, if PD-L1 expression is prognostic for docetaxel.

## Randomisation

Patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  treatment  arms  (ratio  1:1:1)  via  a  central  Interactive  Voice Response System (IVRS)/Interactive Voice and Web Response System (IXRS) in block of six in each stratum. They were stratified according to PD-L1 expression, as tumour proportion score (TPS) ≥50% vs 1-49%, ECOG PS (0 vs 1), and Region (East Asia vs not East Asia).

## Blinding (masking)

The study was conducted in an open label fashion, with a blinded independent radiologist review of responses.

The extent of tumour PD-L1 expression in randomized subjects was double-blinded. The subject, the Investigator,  and  Sponsor  personnel  or  delegate(s)  who  were  involved  in  the  treatment  or  clinical evaluation of the subjects were unaware of the PD-L1 status.

## Statistical methods

The  primary  efficacy  analyses  are  based  on  the  Intention  to  Treat  (ITT)  population  in  the  strongly positive PD-L1 stratum and the overall positive PD-L1 population. A supportive analysis was conducted in  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS) population that excludes those who did not meet the critical eligibility criteria or discontinued before receiving any dose of assigned treatment. All Patients Population (APaT) was used for the primary analysis of safety data. The Kaplan-Meier method is used to estimate the survival (PFS and OS) curves, as well as the overall survival rate at 1 year by treatment group. The treatment  difference  in  OS  and  PFS  is  assessed  by  the  stratified  log-rank  test.  A  stratified  Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling with a single treatment covariate is used

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to  assess  the  magnitude  of  the  treatment  difference  (i.e.,  the  hazard  ratio  and  95%  confidence interval). The same stratification factors used for randomization are applied to both the stratified logrank test and the stratified Cox model. The model based approach to handling missing data is used for the  primary  outcomes.  To  control  for  bias  induced  by  non-study  treatment  (i.e  patients  in  the docetaxel arm may receive other PD-1 treatment after discontinuation), it was planned to use a Rank Preserving  Structural  Failure  Time  (RPSFT)  model.  To  further  account  for  the  possible  confounding effect,  an  OS  sensitivity  analysis  censoring  patients  at  the  time  of  initiation  of  new  therapy  and  an additional analysis that treats initiation of new therapy as a time-dependent binary covariate were also planned. In case the proportional hazards assumption doesn't hold it was planned to conduct Fleming and Harrington's weighted logrank test or other methods, as appropriate, after proper adjustment of the  crossover  effect  over  time.  Restricted  mean  survival  time  (RMST)  estimate  of  OS  and  PFS over time was also calculated as an exploratory analysis.

Three PFS sensitivity analyses with a different set of censoring rules and PD event definitions under various scenarios were planned. The censoring rules for the primary and sensitivity PFS analyses are summarized in the following table.

An exploratory analysis of pooled pembrolizumab arm vs. docetaxel was carried out for PFS or OS at the second interim and the final analyses in the strongly positive PD-L1 stratum as well as the overall PD-L1 positive population. The same stratified Cox proportional hazard model as that for the primary analysis was used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curves.

For  comparison  of  the  ORR  between  the  treatment  groups,  the  stratified  Miettinen  and  Nurminen's method was used. The same stratification factors used for randomization were applied to the analysis. A 95% confidence interval for the difference in response rates between each pembrolizumab arm and the  control  was  provided.  A  p-value  for  this  difference  was  provided  for  dose  selection  at  interim analyses. A subgroup ORR analysis is performed in patients followed up for 27 weeks, including early drop-outs. Subjects with missing data were considered non-responders.

Response  duration  was  summarized  descriptively  using  Kaplan-Meier  medians  and  quartiles.  Nonresponders were excluded in this analysis.

EORTC-QLQC30, EORTC QLQ LC-13, EuroQoL EQ-5D, Health Economic Assessment were summarized as part of the exploratory analysis.

## Interim Analyses

Two planned interim analyses occurred during the conduct of this trial. The table below summarizes the  strategy  and  timing  of  each  interim  analysis.  The  eDMC  reviewed  the  data,  and  the  study continued until the final analysis.

## Multiplicity Adjustment

A  predefined  strategy  to  address  multiplicity  issues  with  regard  to  multiple  treatment  comparisons, multiple  efficacy  endpoints,  multiple  target  groups  and  interim  analyses  is  taken  into  account  (see figure below). At each analysis, the Hochberg step-up procedure is used for PFS and OS testing in the strongly  positive  PD-L1  stratum,  giving  equal  weights  to  the  two  pembrolizumab  arms,  if  neither  is prior discontinued. At each analysis, a gate-keeping testing procedure is used for adjustment over the strongly positive PD-L1 stratum and the overall PD-L1 positive population. If both pembrolizumab arms demonstrate  superior  PFS  in  the  strongly  positive  stratum,  PFS  is  then  tested  in  the  overall  PD-L1 positive  population  at  the  same  alpha  level.  The  same  approach  is  applied  at  the  second  interim analysis for OS, while at the final analysis, a Bonferroni correction is used to adjust for the OS tests in strongly positive PD-L1 stratum and in the overall PD-L1 positive population; the level of significance for OS in the final analysis is set at 0.825% (i.e. 1.65/2) in light of the results observed for the PSF at the second interim and final analysis in both populations. Indeed, the strongly positive PD-L1 stratum and  the  overall  PD-L1  positive  population  was  planned  to  be  tested  at  α'/2  each,  where  α'  will  be between 1.65% and 2.00% and the actual alpha level depends on whether or not both MK-3475 arms are  superior  in  PFS  for  the  overall  positive  population  at  the  second  interim  analysis  and  the  final analysis.

## Subgroup Analyses

To determine whether the treatment effect is consistent across various subgroups, the estimate of the between-group treatment effect (with a nominal 95% CI) for the primary endpoint is estimated and plotted  within  each  category  of  the  following  classification  variables:  age  category  (≤65  vs.  &gt;65 years),  sex  (female,  male),  race  (white,  non-white),  ECOG  status  (0  vs.  1),  geographic  region  of enrolling site (East Asia, non-East Asia), ethnicity (East Asian, non-East Asian), previous chemotherapy regimen  (types  with  greater  than  10%  subjects  in  the  control  group),  ALK  translocation  status (translocated vs. wild type), EGFR mutation status (wild type vs. mutant), age of tumour specimen (archival vs. new).

## Results

## Participant flow

Herbst RS, Lancet 2015

<!-- image -->

In the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg arm, one patient was excluded from efficacy analysis due to GCP noncompliance issue of the enrolling site.

## Recruitment

The study was conducted in 198 trial centres in 24 countries. Overall, 1034 PD-L1 positive (TPS&gt;1%) patients were enrolled from 28 August 2013 to 27 February 2015. The highest enrolling country was the US with a total of 224 subjects and the top recruiter site was in the Netherlands (25 patients).

## Conduct of the study

A total of 11 protocol amendments, including global and country-specific changes, were implemented during the study. The original protocol (dated 16 November 2012) specified the inclusion of squamous NSCLC patients who experienced disease progression after a platinum-containing systemic therapy.

The key changes introduced by the protocol amendments are summarized below:

| Protocol Amendment   | Most relevant changes                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| #01 (25 April 2013)  | - study population was expanded to include all NSCLC histologies, provided that tumors were PD-L1 positive. - primary statistical analyses were changed from an all-comers population to PD-L1 strongly positive patients. |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

|                        | - changed PFS to primary endpoint, and ORR to secondary endpoint. - increase of sample size, from 408 to 660 patients. - pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W arm was replaced with a 10 mg/kg Q2W - unblinding of pembrolizumab treatment arms. -addition of analysis of OS and PFS in the weakly positive PD-L1 stratum. - in EGFR mutated or ALK positive patients, demonstration of progression of disease also respectively on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (either erlotinib or gefitinib) or crizotinib. -removal of criterion excluding patients with symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. - changed time period of the first dose of trial treatment (from 3 weeks to 6 months) for the exclusion of patients with previous radiation therapy of > 30 Gy. - changed criteria from 4 to 2 weeks of stable brain metastases prior to the first dose of trial treatment, allowing patients inclusion - update of first interim analysis to facilitate decisions in both strongly and weakly positive PD-L1 subgroups. Second interim analysis has been changed to be based on PFS events.   |

The first patients were screened under Amendment #3 (global) and #4 (country-specific). A total of 441  patients  were  enrolled  prior  to  the  implementation  of  PD-L1  status  stratification  factor,  as  for Amendment  #8.  Collaborative  partner  audits  and  the  Investigator  site  compliance  (14  sites)  were conducted specific to study P010.

Two formal interim analyses occurred during the conduct of this trial. The first interim analysis (futility) was  performed  on  01-Nov-2014  after  120  subjects  in  the  TPS≥50%  stratum  had  completed  a minimum of 3 months of follow-up; based on data, the eDMC recommended to continue the study with no modifications.

The  second  interim  analysis  (31-Jul-2015)  was  triggered  after  approximately  175  PFS  events  per RECIST 1.1 by independent radiologists' review across the three study arms in the TPS≥50% stratum,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and based on data it was decided to continue the study.

The final analysis (30-Sep-2015) was carried out when 204 deaths occurred across the 3 study arms in the TPS≥50% stratum.

## Baseline data

In study P010, for the PD-L1 analysis a new tumour sample was available for 578 (55.95%) patients and an archival tumour sample was provided for 455 (44.05%) patients. The baseline characteristics for patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥50% and TPS ≥1% are shown below:

## Numbers analysed

The ITT population in the strongly positive PD-L1 stratum (TPS ≥50%) and the overall PD-L1 positive population (TPS ≥1%) served as the primary population for the efficacy analyses.

A supportive efficacy analysis was conducted in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) that excluded patients who did  not  meet  the  key  eligibility  criteria  or  discontinued  before  receiving  any  dose  of  assigned treatment. The FAS population was also used for the pre-specified exploratory PRO analysis.

## Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Analyses

There were three electronic questionnaires used in this study: eEORTC QLQ-C30, eEORTC QLQ-LC13, and eEQ-5D-3L.

The primary analysis approach for the pre-specified exploratory PRO endpoints was based on a quality of  life  related  FAS  population,  including  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of study medication and completed at least one PRO assessment.

- eEORTC QLQ-C30 Analyses are summarised in the below figures.

<!-- image -->

*For global health status/quality of life score and all functional scales, a higher score denotes better HRQoL or function, and a higher negative score denotes worse HRQoL or functions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

*For different symptoms scales, a higher score denotes worse symptoms.

Figure 23: Change from baseline for EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom scales at week 12 - FAS population, TPS≥ 1%

## - eEORTC QLQ-LC13 Analyses.

Subjects in both pembrolizumab arms had a numerical improvement from baseline to Week 12 in most EORTC lung cancer symptoms. This improvement was more pronounced for the 2 mg/kg dose in the TPS≥50%  stratum.  In  contrast,  subjects  in  the  docetaxel  arm  had  a  numerical  worsening  from baseline in most EORTC lung cancer symptoms. With few exceptions, both pembrolizumab arms had a superior numerical change from baseline in EORTC lung cancer symptom scores compared to docetaxel and  many  of  these  achieved  statistical  significance.  Compared  to  docetaxel,  pembrolizumab  also increased the time to true deterioration in the QLQ-LC13 composite endpoint of cough, dyspnea and chest pain. Unlike traditional deterioration, true deterioration requires a second adjacent 10 points or more score decrease from baseline under right-censoring rule.

- Summary of eEQ-5D-3L Analysis

The  eEQ-5D  provides  data  for  use  in  economic  models  and  analyses  on  health  utilities  or  qualityadjusted life years. Minimal descriptive statistics were included in the PRO SAP for eEQ-5D. Results from  eEQ-5D  VAS  analyses  are  consistent  with  the  results  of  EORTC  QLQ-C30  analyses  (data  not shown).

## Efficacy results for weakly positive (1%≤ TPS &lt;50%) stratum

In the weakly positive (1%≤ TPS &lt;50%) stratum, both pembrolizumab doses were superior to docetaxel in terms of OS by individual arms (HR 0.79, 95% CI: 0.61, 1.04 for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and HR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.94 for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg) and by pooled analysis (HR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.96 for pooled pembrolizumab). The median OS for pembrolizumab was 9.4 months and 10.8 months for the 2 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively, compared to 8.6 months for docetaxel.

Restricted Mean Survival Times Analysis of PFS in TPS≥50% Stratum

Comparison  of  restricted  mean  survival  times  (RMST)  of  PFS  provides  an  assessment  of  treatment effect over a time interval. It provides an alternative estimate of the treatment effect that is robust to the proportional hazard assumption. The treatment effect of pembrolizumab on PFS was demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier analysis where a separation of the curves was observed after Month 3 and continued all the way towards the tail end when the majority of subjects in the docetaxel arm had PFS events. The mean PFS up to a certain follow-up time provides meaningful additional information compared to the median PFS in this situation, e.g., the RMST at Month 6 was 4.18 and 4.16 for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg  and  10  mg/kg,  respectively,  compared  to  3.78  for  docetaxel.  The  differences  between pembrolizumab and docetaxel RMST values continue to increase at each subsequent time point.

## Subgroups analyses

Data from the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg were pooled for the subgroup analyses.

## Supportive study

To support the claimed indication, an interim CSR from the NSCLC parts (Cohort C and Cohort F) of the multicenter, open label phase I P001 trial, whose data on melanoma patients were submitted at the time of the initial Marketing Authorisation Application, was provided with a minimum of 6-months of follow-up (database cut-off of 23-Jan-2015).

Different pembrolizumab doses and  schedules were tested across NSCLC Cohorts: 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, in patients  with prior systemic therapy (Cohort C), PD-L1 positive treatment naïve patients (Cohort F1) and PD-L1 positive previously treated patients (Cohort F2); 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in PD-L1  positive  treatment  naïve  patients  (Cohort  F1)  and  in  previously-treated  patients  both  PD-L1 negative or positive (Cohort F2); 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks in PD-L1 positive treatment naïve patients (Cohort F1) and PD-L1 positive previously treated patients.

A total of 560 NSCLC patients were allocated to Cohorts C and F of study P001.

The median duration of follow up is 15.7 months (range 10.0 to 32.3 months) for Cohort C, Cohort F2, and  Cohort  F1.  Due  to  the  late  starting  of  enrollment,  Cohort  F-3  has  a  median  follow-up  of  7.7 months (range 6.4 to 9.7 months).

The baseline characteristics were well balanced across the dosing arms. Overall, the median age was 64 years; most of patients were former smokers (66.9%) and had metastatic disease (96.2%). The non-squamous was the most common histology (81.1%), and in the majority of patients (67.2%) ≥2 prior  lines  of  therapy  were  administered.    Fifty-eight  (10.5%)  patients  presented  baseline  brain metastases.

The  study  primary  endpoint  was  ORR,  based  on  RECIST  1.1  by  IRC. The  secondary  measure  for assessment of tumor response (ORR) was based on irRC by Investigator assessment. Disease control rate (DCR), duration of response, and PFS based on both RECIST 1.1 and irRC, and OS were evaluated as secondary endpoints.

The pre-specified primary efficacy analysis was conducted in the Previously Treated Primary Efficacy Population ,  a  subset  of  61  patients  in  Cohort  F2  comprising  the  Biomarker  Validation  Set    who  had tumor PD-L1 expression ≥50% at baseline, as determined by a different IHC assay using the 22C3 clone,  a  Market-Ready  Assay.  All  patients  previously  received  a  platinum-based  chemotherapy  and experienced progression.

Supportive  analyses  were  also  conducted  in Previously  Treated  Validation  Population including    223 patient from Cohort F2 who progressed after at least platinum-based cytotoxic chemotherapy, were part of the Biomarker Validation Set and had PD-L1 expression ≥1% at baseline (patients).

Data Souwrce: [16.4]

Cohort F-3 (PD-L1 positive previously treated population - 2 mg/kg Q3W)

Cohort F-3 was added with the last amendment to the protocol to study the likely dose for pembrolizumab in subjects with NSCLC, i.e., 2 mg/kg Q3W, therefore follow up is shortest in these subjects with a minimum of 27 weeks of follow up. The inclusion criteria for Cohort F-3 are identical to Cohort F-2. The only difference between these cohorts is that in F-3, all subjects received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W, and in F-2 all subjects received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W or Q2W.

For Cohort F-3 (n=55) the cumulative ORR at Week 27 was 14.7% (95% CI: 7.6, 27.3) compared to 21.1% (95% CI: 16.8, 26.5) for PD-L1 pos. subjects of F2 (n=280). 6-month PFS rates were 33.6% for Cohort F-3 and 37.2% for Cohort F-2. Cohort F-3 had a 6-month OS rate of 58.8%, and the randomized subjects of Cohort F-2 had an OS rate of 66.0%.

## Development of Companion diagnostic

Dako has been collaborating with MSD in the development of a companion diagnostic immunohistochemical (IHC) assay, PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx, to detect PD-L1 protein expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) tissue samples.

This commercial ready assay (CRA) (abbreviated 'Dako PD-L1 CRA' in this document) uses an anti PDL1 mouse monoclonal antibody MEB037.22C3.138 ('22C3') that is optimized for automated use on the Dako Autostainer Link 48 platform for detection of PD-L1 expression.

An  immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  clinical  trial  assay  (CTA)  (abbreviated  'Dako  PD-L1  CTA'  in  this document), was used to screen patients prior to enrolment into the pembrolizumab KEYNOTE 010 (see clinical efficacy).

The primary difference between Dako PD-L1 CTA and Dako PD-L1 CRA is that the primary antibody for the CTA IHC assay was supplied by Merck, whereas the primary antibody for the CRA IHC assay is manufactured by Dako.

A bridging study was conducted to establish the clinical performance of the CRA, in conjunction with an accompanying statistical analysis plan (SAP). ( Retrospective Testing of Banked NSCLC Tissue Samples Using PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx CRA to compare and Evaluate Clinical Performance Based on Clinical Outcomes from Clinical Study MK-3475- 010/KEYNOTE-010 that enrolled on a CTA) .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary objectives in the SAP were:

1.  To  estimate  agreement  between  the  CTA  and  the  CRA  for  the  IHC  outcomes  of  being  'PD-L1 Negative' or 'PD-L1 Positive' or 'PD-L1 Strongly Positive' (1% and 50% cut-off points).
2. To test the primary hypotheses of KEYNOTE-010 comparing pembrolizumab to docetaxel within the 'PD-L1 positive' and 'PD-L1 strongly positive' subpopulations with respect to the CRA under an intentto-treat (ITT) framework.
3. To conduct a sensitivity analysis to understand the plausible range for the hazard ratio estimated based  on  the  CRA  in  the  'PD-L1  positive'  and  'PD-L1  strongly  positive'  subpopulations  under  an intent-to-diagnose (ITD) framework.

## Results

## Bridging Analysis

Dako PD-L1 CTA was used as the reference study and negative percent agreement (NPA) and positive percent agreement (PPA) estimates were calculated for tumour proportion score 1% (cut-off for PD-L1 positive) and 50% (cut-off for PD-L1 strongly positive) along with 95% confidence intervals.

## Agreement Estimates

Results in the panels using the 1% and 50% cut-offs are reflected in the table below.

For the 1% cut-off, PD-L1 positive is defined as TPS ≥ 1% and PD-L1 negative is defined as TPS &lt; 1%, and for the 50% cut-off PD-L1 positive is defined as TPS ≥ 50% and PD-L1 negative is defined as TPS &lt; 50%. Note that the category of TPS 1-49% is considered to be PD-L1 positive for the 1% cutoff, and is considered to be PD-L1 negative for the 50% cut-off.

Document Type: Template

Of the 2699 patients in the data set received, 477 patients (none of which belong to the ITT) had no CTA or CRA PD-L1 score and were excluded from all subsequent evaluation. For the remaining 2222

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients, referred to hereafter as the imputation analysis set (IAS), all CTA or CRA scores lying outside the 6-month stability window were set to missing.

Panel 8 and 9 show the resulting breakdown of the CTA and CRA PD-L1 status variables in the IAS and ITT respectively.

Analysis of Overall Survival (OS) and Progression Free Survival (PFS):

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the bridging study, results from the analysis of overall survival (OS) in Panel 12-14 show that for the  patients  with  a  CRA  measurement  that  was  within  the  stability  window  (the  complete  case analysis) both the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W doses are superior to docetaxel at the significance threshold of nominal p-value &lt;0.00825 (pre-specified in the protocol for the primary analyses in using the CTA) for both the strongly positive and positive PD-L1 status definitions.

Panels  17-19  show  the  complete  case  analyses  for  progression-free  survival  based  on  central assessment  per  RECIST  1.1.  The  point  estimates  and  trend  are  generally  consistent  with  those analyses conducted based on CTA regardless of sample stability. However, due to reduced sample size, only the MK-3475 10 mg/kg vs. docetaxel comparison in the PD-L1 strongly positive patients met the

significance  threshold  of  nominal  p-value  &lt;  0.001  (pre-specified  in  the  protocol  for  the  primary analyses in patients irrespective of stability window).

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The pivotal study P010 is a randomized trial comparing two pembrolizumab doses (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg,  every  3  weeks)  versus  docetaxel  in  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  (Stage  IIIB/IV)  PD-L1 positive (TPS≥1%) NSCLC patients previously treated with at least two cycles of a platinum-containing doublet. Patients with sensitizing EGFR mutation or ALK translocation were eligible provided they had progressed  on  both  TKIs  and  platinum-based  chemotherapy:  although  this  inclusion  may  have introduced  some  further  heterogeneity  in  the  patient  population,  it  is  considered  acceptable  as  it increases the external validity of the trial. Overall, the eligibility criteria are acceptable. The choice to include  all  NSCLC  histologies  limited  to  PD-L1  positive  (TPS≥1%)  tumours  is  based  on  data accumulating  from  Study  P001  supporting  the  potential  predictive  value  of  PD-L1  expression regardless the histology, and is acceptable. Patients with brain metastases (non-active) were eligible, which is acceptable. From Amendment #8 onwards, i.e after the enrolment of the first 441 patients, newly obtained biopsies were required for the evaluation of PD-L1 expression. However, for patients in whom  obtaining  a  new  biopsy  was  deemed  inappropriate,  archival  tissue  was  accepted.  Whether changes  in  PD-L1  expression  are  to  be  expected  during  the  natural  course  of  the  disease  (i.e.  in treatment naïve and after platinum-based chemotherapy and/or TKIs) is at present unknown.

The primary objectives of the study were to compare the OS and PFS per RECIST 1.1 by independent radiologists' review of previously treated NSCLC patients with tumour samples designated as strongly positive  (TPS≥50%)  PD-L1  stratum,  and  in  the  overall  patient  population  that  had  tumour  samples which  were  designated  as  PD-L1  positive.  Safety  and  tolerability  profile  of  pembrolizumab  was  also among  primary  objectives.  ORR,  response  duration  and  changes  in  HRQoL  were  among  secondary objectives.

The  sample  size  was  targeted  to  be  approximately  460  for  strongly  PD-L1  positive  patients (TPS≥50%), and the study had over 81% power to detect a 0.55 hazard ratio at the final analysis, where  0.825%  alpha  was  allocated  to  the  two  pembrolizumab  vs.  docetaxel  comparisons  using Hochberg procedure. In the protocol the MAH provided also the Minimum Detectable Hazard Ratios (MDHR) for  positive  OS and PFS in  the  PD-L1  strongly  positive stratum  at  the  final  analysis. The target MDHR was stronger for OS (&lt;0.675, i.e. &gt;4.3 m of improvement) with regard to PFS (&lt;0.787, i.e.  &gt;2.4  m  of  improvement)  which  is  not  surprising  based  on  the  mechanism  of  action  of pembrolizumab compared to docetaxel, and the higher probability  to induce  durable  responses  and thus show a higher probability to show a benefit in the long run. Therefore, OS analyses are expected to capture the benefit of the therapy better than PFS analyses.

Two planned interim analyses occurred during the conduct of this trial. Interim Analysis 1(IA1) was performed after 120 subjects in the strongly positive (TPS≥50%) PD-L1 stratum completed a minimum of  3  months  of  follow-up,  ant  its  primary  objective  of  IA1  was  to  stop  the  study  for  futility  or discontinue one pembrolizumab arm if it was less efficacious than the other pembrolizumab arm based on ORR in the strongly positive (TPS≥50%) PD-L1 stratum. However, after IA1 the study continued without modifications. Interim Analysis 2 (IA2) was planned at the time of primary PFS analysis after approximately 175 PFS events had  occurred in the strongly positive (TPS≥50%) PD-L1 stratum.  The eDMC reviewed the data, and the study continued until the final analysis. The statistical methods are overall acceptable.

The statistical  analyses for the primary endpoints and for the secondary and exploratory endpoints, including  the  sensitivity  analyses  and  the  censoring  rules,  are  adequate  for  the  type  of  variables

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analyzed.  Results  of  OS  sensitivity  analyses,  censoring  at  the  time  new  anti-cancer  therapy  and subsequent immunotherapy started were provided. The significant benefit in OS was confirmed in both TPS ≥ 1% and TPS ≥ 50%. Comparison of restricted mean survival times (RMST) of PFS, which provides an alternative estimate of the treatment effect that is robust to the proportional hazard assumption, has been planned and submitted.

The multiplicity strategy is overall acceptable. In light of the results observed for the PSF at the second interim and at the final analysis, the level of significance in the final analysis in both populations is set at 0.825% (p=0.00825) for OS and 0.1% (p=0.001) for PFS.

A total of 1034 patients were randomised 1:1:1 to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg  (n=344), to pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg (n=346) and to docetaxel (n=343). Screen failure was mostly due to not meeting the inclusion criteria of PD-L1 positivity (830 patients), or to unavailability of tissue for PD-L1 biomarker  analysis  (260).  In  addition,  the  presence  of  known  active  CNS  metastases  and/or carcinomatous meningitis excluded patients from enrolment in the trial (78 patients). The rate of PDL1 strongly (TPS≥50%) and weakly positive (TPS 1&gt;49%) was around 40% and 60%, respectively, in both  the  overall  PD-L1  positive  screened  (1475)  and  enrolled  subjects  (1034);  this  consistency  is reassuring  with  regard  to  the  representativeness  of  the  ITT  population  (i.e.  there  is  no  apparent overrepresentation of strongly positive patients), which is deemed very important for the reliability of the results in the overall population of patients that have tumours expressing PD-L1. It is noted that a higher number of patients did not receive treatment as assigned in the control arm. Furthermore, a quite  higher  number  of  patients  in  the  docetaxel  arm  discontinued  treatment  for  reason  other  than progressive disease, namely withdrawal of consent and physician's decision. In the context of an open label trial this is likely occurring due to patients and physicians' awareness of the treatment assigned.

Overall,  there  are  no  meaningful  imbalances  in  patients'  baseline  characteristics  among  treatment arms, and the enrolled population is representative of real life EU patients. Not all enrolled patients met key eligibility criteria (e.g. prior chemotherapy, ECOG PS, etc.). However, the numbers are quite limited and supportive efficacy analysis (FAS) was conducted excluding those patients not meeting the key eligibility criteria or discontinued before receiving any dose of assigned treatment, and has been provided.

Data  from  the  phase  I  study  KEYNOTE-001  Cohorts  C  and  F,  enrolling  previously  treated  NSCLC patients, were also submitted as supportive.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

A  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  benefit  in  OS  has  been  observed  for  both pembrolizumab arms over docetaxel in subjects with TPS≥50% (HR of 0.54, p=0.00024, and 0.50, p=0.00002, for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q3W vs docetaxel, respectively), and in the overall  population  of  subjects  with  TPS≥1%  (HR  of  0.71,  p=0.00076,  and  0.61,  p&lt;0.00001,  for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q3W vs docetaxel, respectively).

A statistically significant difference has been observed for PFS in the strongly positive subgroup only, with HRs of 0.58 and 0.59 for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg vs docetaxel, respectively. The median PFS was 5.2 months for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, and 4.1 months for docetaxel. The  Kaplan-Meier  PFS  curves  show  a  clear  separation  only  after  some  months,  and  this  pattern  is observed also in the overall population PD-L1 positive population. In both subjects with TPS≥50% and the overall study population of subjects with TPS≥1% there is a trend to an increase in the difference in the rate of event-free patients between the experimental and the control arms at subsequent time points.

Supportive  pre-specified  sensitivity  analyses  for  PFS  were  provided.  The  PFS  results  based  on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Investigator assessment by irRC were similar to the results by IRC assessment per RECIST 1.1 in both the TPS≥50% and TPS≥1%population. The PFS sensitivity censoring rule analyses confirm the results of the primary analysis, with a reduced, but still clinically significant advantage also in the strongly PDL1  positive  population.  The  RMST  analysis  of  PFS  provided  to  account  the  possible  violation  of proportional  hazard  assumption  show  that  the  differences  between  pembrolizumab  and  docetaxel RMST values continue to  increase  over  time,  which  support  the  potential  benefit  of  pembrolizumab based  on  its  mechanism  of  action  compared  to  docetaxel  and  its  ability  to  induce  more  durable responses.

No meaningful differences have been observed between the two pembrolizumab dose levels for both OS and PFS.

The  OS  results  observed  in  the  overall  population  are  clearly  driven  by  the  effect  observed  in  the strongly  positive  subgroup.  However,  when  taking  into  account  the  complementary  weakly  positive subgroup (for which a formal analysis was not planned) the visual inspection of OS survival curves shows a separation of the curves over time with a trend to an increase in the difference in the rate of patients  alive  between  the  experimental  and  the  control  arms  at  subsequent  time  points.  When analysing the PFS Kaplan Meier curves in the complementary weakly positive population, the curves appear superimposed with no apparent benefit for the experimental arms over docetaxel. However, based on the different mechanism of action and expected pattern of response to pembrolizumab and docetaxel it is not unexpected that OS analysis may capture the potential benefit of pembrolizumab better than PFS. Indeed, as reported below, the duration of response observed with pembrolizumab is much longer than what observed with docetaxel, even in the weakly positive subgroup.

The ORR was higher for pembrolizumab in TPS≥50% subjects (30.2% and 29.1% in the 2 mg/kg and 10  mg/kg  arms,  respectively,  vs  7.9%  in  the  docetaxel  arm,  p=&lt;0.00001),  and  in  the  overall population  (18%  and  18.5%  in  the  2  mg/kg  and  10  mg/kg  arms,  respectively,  vs  9.3%  in  the docetaxel  arm),  with  no  difference  observed  between  the  two  pembrolizumab  dose  levels.  In  the complementary  weakly  positive  subgroup  no  difference  in  terms  of  ORR  was  observed  between pembrolizumab and docetaxel (9.8% and 10.3% in the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg arms, respectively, vs 10.5% in the docetaxel arm). However, the duration of response based on IRC assessment was almost double in pembrolizumab treated subjects compared to docetaxel even in the weakly positive subgroup (46 and 45 weeks in the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg arms, respectively, vs 26 weeks in the docetaxel arm).

The  treatment  effect  of  pembrolizumab  was  superior  for  subjects  with  TPS≥50%  compared  to  the overall study population with TPS≥1% across all endpoints (OS, PFS and ORR). However, also for the overall study population with TPS≥1% statistically significant and clinically meaningful HRs for OS are demonstrated for the pembrolizumab treatment groups in comparison to the docetaxel arm, supported by  a  numerically  superior  (although  not  statistically  significant)  HR  for  PFS.  For  both  primary endpoints, the Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated separation after several months without crossing of the curves.

The MAH provided additional analyses to inform on the impact of various tumour PD-L1 expression levels on efficacy. Forest plots of OS are presented for subgroups with TPS 1-49% ('weakly positive'), with  TPS  1st  to  4th  quartiles  and  for  different  cut-offs of TPS (≥5 % and ≥10 %). The HR results indicate that an OS benefit is demonstrated for all subgroups and that the superior treatment effect of pembrolizumab over docetaxel does not appear to be driven solely by the subgroups with high tumour expression levels. However, with regard to the endpoints PFS (HR) and ORR, subjects in the 1%≤TPS &lt;50%  stratum  did  not  derive  superior  benefit  from  pembrolizumab  compared  to  docetaxel  in exploratory analyses (with crossing of Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS). But longer response duration for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pembrolizumab compared to docetaxel was also confirmed in this subgroup, likely contributing to the effect on OS.

Based on preliminary efficacy results of P001, two different pembrolizumab doses were evaluated in study P010. The KM curves for both pembrolizumab groups are superimposed in the initial parts and separate after some months, both for the OS and the PFS curves. From the visual inspection of the curves, the higher pembrolizumab dose group of 10 mg/kg appears to be slightly superior compared to the dose of 2 mg/kg in all figures. However, pairwise comparisons did not show meaningful HRs for OS or  PFS  for  the  pembrolizumab  2  mg/kg  group  relative  to  the  10  mg/kg  group  (range  of  HRs  1.0  1.17). Additionally, ORR did not differ between both pembrolizumab dose groups. Exposure-response analyses indicated that there is little if any additional benefit available at higher exposures. Overall, the  observed  differences  are  considered  small  and  not  sufficient  to  object  the  dose  selection  of  2 mg/kg Q3W also for the NSCLC indication.

No major differences in OS across pembrolizumab doses can be highlighted based on tumour histology and PD-L1 expression. Although there is a general trend for a better efficacy of the 10 mg/kg Q3W particularly in PD-L1 weakly positive subjects with non-squamous histology, a dose-exposure response analysis  by  NSCLC  histology  based  on  KN010  shows  no  meaningful  differences  between  the  two pembrolizumab doses at each TPS cut points (&gt;50% and &gt;1%) for reduction in tumour size both in non-squamous and squamous histology.  In particular, in the non-squamous subgroup there is a trend to an increased response in the lowest quintile in TPS 1-49%.

The  lack  of  meaningful  difference  between  the  two  pembrolizumab  dose  levels  observed  in  all  the efficacy analyses including Quality of life data further supports the adequacy of the 2 mg/kg Q3W dose level.

No  new  insights  were  provided  from  efficacy  results  submitted  by  the  MAH  for  study  KN010  using additional PD-L1 expression cut-off values (1% ≤TPS &lt;10% and 10%≤ TPS &lt;50%).

Consistently to what was observed in the primary analyses, the benefit observed in the strongly PD-L1 positive  patients  appears  more  robust  also  in  subgroup  analyses  in  comparison  to  the  overall population and the complementary weakly positive subgroup.

In  subgroup  analyses,  a  reduced  survival  benefit  of  pembrolizumab  compared  to  docetaxel  was observed  for  patients  who  were  never-smokers,  patients  with  tumours  harbouring  EGFR  activating mutations or East Asian patients who received at least platinum-based chemotherapy and a tyrosine kinase  inhibitor;  however,  due  to  the  small  numbers  of  patients,  no  definitive  conclusions  can  be drawn from these data.

A  consistent  improvement  in  OS  and  PFS  was  reported  with  pembrolizumab  over  docetaxel  in sensitivity  analyses  conducted  excluding  patients  who  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  consent withdrew or physician'decision.

Based  on  a  subgroup  analysis  by  the  number  of  prior  therapies  (1  versus  ≥2  lines),  the  superior benefit of pembrolizumab over docetaxel in the overall study population appears to be solely driven by the treatment effect in subjects with only one prior line of therapy. Patients with two or more lines of prior therapy do not seem to have a superior outcome with pembrolizumab compared to docetaxel. A reduced  treatment  effect  in  patients  with  more  advanced  disease  is  in  line  with  what  has  been previously observed for nivolumab in the same indication and might be expected from the mode of action of checkpoint inhibitors that depends on an efficient immune system and requires a longer time to exert an effect.

As from the prior nivolumab experience, in non-squamous NSCLC the pembrolizumab effect seems to be determined by the level of PD-L1 expression, with an OS HR ranging from 0.67 to 0.49 at the dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of 2 mg/kg and from 0.58 to 0.45 at 10 mg/kg based on TPS ≥1% and TPS ≥50%, respectively. On the other hands, the percentage of TPS is not related to OS benefit in squamous NSCLC.

In study KEYNOTE-010, patients were screened by an IHC clinical trial assay (Dako PD-L1 CTA) which is an earlier version of the companion diagnostic IHC assay (Dako PD-L1 CRA) proposed by the MAH. To  evaluate  the  clinical  performance  of  the  commercial  ready  assay  (CRA),  a  bridging  study  for KEYNOTE-010  retrospectively  tested  banked  formalin  fixed  and  paraffin  embedded  (FFPE)  NSCLC tissue samples available from screened patients. Even if the variability of PD-L1 expression within the tumour  and,  consequently,  the  possibility  of  discordant  results  produced  by  analytical  tests  is acknowledged, overall the available efficacy outcomes, in terms of OS and PFS, support the use of Dako PD-L1 CRA (PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx) for the selection of NSCLC patients.

When  assessing  the  PD-L1  status  of  the  tumour,  it  is  important  that  a  well-validated  and  robust methodology is chosen to minimise false negative or false positive determinations.

The efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in patients with tumours that do not express PD-L1 have not been established.

Similarly to the melanoma indication, the MAH will further explore the value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab in NSCLC studies.

In the supportive study P001 a clear benefit in terms of ORR, PFS and OS has been observed for the strongly PD-L1 positive subgroup over the weakly positive or negative subgroups. The ORR was 36.3% in strongly PD-L1 positive, 13.2% in weakly PD-L1 positive and 8.1% in negative subjects (TPS&lt;1%) PD-L1.  Even  though  a  similar  median  PFS  and  OS  were  observed  in  weakly  PD-L1  positive  and negative patients, the difference in PFS and OS rate tend to increase over time, with a higher rate for weakly PD-L1 positive vs negative subjects at 12 months.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

A statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in OS over docetaxel has been observed for both subjects with TPS≥50% and with TPS≥1% with pembrolizumab in the target population of adult patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumours express PD-L1 and who have disease progression on or after prior chemotherapy. A statistically significant difference has been observed for PFS in the strongly positive  subgroup  only.  It  can  however  be  concluded  that  the  benefit  from  pembrolizumab  is  not limited to the strongly positive subgroup.

There are no meaningful differences among the two pembrolizumab doses, supporting the proposed 2mg/kg Q3W dose, already recommended in the melanoma indication. Further support comes from the observation that statistical significance for PROs was achieved for the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg dose only.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

- The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab should be further explored, specifically:

Although PD-L1 status is predictive of response in NSCLC patients, durable responses have been observed in PD-L1 negative patients. Additional biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (e.g. PD-L2, RNA signature, etc.) predictive of pembrolizumab efficacy should be investigated together with more information regarding the pattern of expression of PD L1 obtained in the ongoing NSCLC studies (P001, P010, P024, and P042):

- IHC staining for PD-L2
- Data on RNA and proteomic serum profiling

## 2.5. Clinical safety

The known pembrolizumab safety profile, at present based on 1567 melanoma patients treated across studies  KEYNOTE-001,  KEYNOTE-002  and  KEYNOTE-006  is  mainly  associated  with  immune-related adverse  reactions  and    characterized  by  general  (fatigue),  gastrointestinal  (diarrhoea  and  nausea), skin (rash and pruritus) and muskuloskeletal (arthralgia) disorders. The majority of adverse reactions reported were of Grade 1 or 2 severity and the most serious were immune-related adverse reactions and severe infusion-related reactions.

The  submitted  safety  database  includes  1232  NSCLC  patients  (from  studies  KEYNOTE-010  and KEYNOTE-001)  and  1567  melanoma  patients  (from  studies  KEYNOTE-001,  KEYNOTE-002  and KEYNOTE-006) who received at least one pembrolizumab dose.

## Patient exposure

In the pivotal NSCLC study P010, the mean treatment duration was higher in the pembrolizumab arms (155.4 days at 10 mg/kg Q3W and 151.1 days at 2 mg/kg Q3W) compared to docetaxel (81.6 days).

Overall,  the  mean  exposure  was  greater  in  melanoma  compared  to  NSCLC  patients  (227.80  days vs.160.25 days). In a total of 418 and 165 NSCLC patients the duration of exposure to pembrolizumab was  ≥6  months  and  ≥12  months,  respectively.  Considering  the  pooled  NSCLC  and  melanoma populations, 1153 and 600 patients were respectively exposed to pembrolizumab ≥6 months and ≥12 months.

Demographic  and  other  baseline  characteristics  of  patients  in  the  pooled  melanoma  and  NSCLC populations  were  mostly  similar  across  tumour  types.  Mainly  due  to  due  to  the  differences  in  site selection  and  the  natural  history  of  disease,  there  were  more  Asian  patients  (17.4%  vs  1.2%)  and more subjects with ECOG PS 1 (65.5% vs 34.5) in the NSCLC studies compared to melanoma studies.

## Adverse events

The primary analysis population for safety across clinical studies includes all patients who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab (APaT population).

In the pivotal NSCLC study P010, despite the longer exposure duration to pembrolizumab, overall AE counts were similar across all three arms. However, in the pembrolizumab arms fewer drug-related AEs,  drug-related  Grade  ≥3  AEs,  and  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  or  drug-related  AEs  occurred compared to the docetaxel arm. A slight excess of deaths due to AEs has been observed in the pooled pembrolizumab population compared to docetaxel arm (6.3% vs 4.9%); however, deaths due to drugrelated  adverse  events  were  less  frequently  observed  in  the  pooled  experimental  arms  than  with docetaxel (0.9% vs 1.6%).

In study P010, the most common AEs (&gt;20%) were fatigue (25.1%), decreased appetite (24.6%) and dyspnea (22.9%) with pembrolizumab combined dose levels, and alopecia (34.0%), fatigue (32.0%) and diarrhea (25.9%) in the docetaxel arm. The exposure adjusted incidence of AEs showed across all treatment arms a more frequent reporting in the first 3 months followed by decreased frequency with each successive 3-month period. In the pembrolizumab arms, the most frequent Grade ≥3 AEs were pneumonia  (5.3%),  dyspnea  (3.7%),  and  fatigue  (3.1%),  while  with  docetaxel  Grade  ≥3  AEs commonly reported were neutropenia (13.6%), neutrophil count decreased (6.5%), fatigue (5.5%), febrile neutropenia (5.5%), and pneumonia (5.5%).

In  the  overall  pembrolizumab  safety  database,  including  both  melanoma  and  NSCLC  patients,  the observed incidence of specific AEs occurred in ≥10% of patients is shown in the Table below.

Overall,  the  most  common  Grade  ≥3  AEs  were  anaemia  (3.2%),  dyspnoea  (2.8%),  pneumonia (2.6%), fatigue (2.5%), and hyponatremia (2.2%). Consistently with the natural history of NSCLC, a higher  incidence  of  Grade  ≥3  dyspnoea  (3.9%  vs.  1.9%)  and  pneumonia  (4.1%  vs.  1.5%)  was reported in the NSCLC population compared to melanoma patients.

## Drug-related AEs

In the pivotal NSCLC study P010, the most common drug-related AEs reported with pembrolizumab (combined  arms)  were  fatigue  (13.9%),  decreased  appetite  (11.6%),  nausea  (10.0%),  and  rash (10.7%).  In  the  docetaxel  arm  drug-related  alopecia  (32.7%),  fatigue  (24.6%),  and  diarrhoea (18.1%) were more frequently observed.

The overall incidence of drug-related AEs in lung and melanoma populations is reported in the Table

## Adverse Events of Special Interest (AEOSI)

In the overall TPS≥1% population of study P010, AEOSI were more common among pembrolizumabtreated compared to docetaxel-treated patients (19.5% vs. 4.2%, respectively). The median time to onset of the first  AEOSI  occurrence  was  64  days  (range:  4  to  381  days)  in  pembrolizumab-treated patients and 85 days (range: 14 to 229 days) in docetaxel-treated patients.

Grade ≥3 AEOSI were reported in 5.3% of pembrolizumab-treated patients. No meaningful differences occurred between the pembrolizumab and docetaxel arms in the rates of deaths due to AEOSI (0.4% vs.  0.6%),  discontinuations  due  to  AEOSI  (2.2%  vs.  1.6%),  or  discontinuations  due  to  AEOSI categorized as SAEs (1.5% vs. 1.0%). Fifteen patients (2.2%) discontinued pembrolizumab due to any AEOSI, regardless of causality, compared to 5 patients (1.6%) on docetaxel.

The most common AEOSI, occurring in &gt;1% of subjects in the pooled pembrolizumab arms, included hypothyroidism (8.2% vs 0.3%), hyperthyroidism (4.7% vs 1%) and pneumonitis (4.5% vs 1.3%).

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, mainly Grade 1 or Grade 2 events and none worse than Grade 3, were in general readily managed with thyroid replacement therapy, treatment interruption, or both. Only one patient discontinued pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg Q3W) due to hypothyroidism.

A total of 31 patients (4.5%) on pembrolizumab and 6 (1.9%) on docetaxel experienced pneumonitis in  the  pivotal  NSCLC  P010.  At  the  data  cut-off  date,  18  out  of  the  31  pembrolizumab  treated completely  recovered  from  pneumonitis  with  corticosteroid  treatment  and  treatment  interruption. Grade  ≥3  pneumonitis  was  experienced  by  14  (2.1%)  patients  compared  to  2  (0.6%)  patients  on docetaxel. Three pembrolizumab-treated patients died due to pneumonitis possibly drug-related.

The incidence of selected and pre-specified AEs of potential immune aetiology was compared between the pooled pembrolizumab arms and the docetaxel arm. Results reported in the TPS≥1% population are shown in the Table below:

Overall, infusion reactions were more frequent in the docetaxel arm than in the pooled pembrolizumab arms  (5.2%  vs.  1.8%,  respectively).  The  majority  of  cases  were  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity  across treatment arms. The only two Grade 3 reported cases (anaphylactic reaction and drug hypersensitivity) occurred with pembrolizumab.

The  number  and  rate  of  patients  with  specific  identified  AEOSI  across  clinical  studies  are  reported below:

Due to coding issues and differing database locks, the following events for a small subset of terms were not included in the above table:

- Five additional cases in the AEOSI-Renal (Nephritis): autoimmune nephritis (Subject 000054 in Study P001), renal failure acute (Subject 000048 in Study P001), renal failure (Subject 000058 in Study P001), renal failure acute (Subject 368852 in Study P006), and renal failure (Subject 363218  in  Study  P006).  Therefore,  the  incidence  of  AEOSI-Renal  (Nephritis)  in  the  pooled dataset of PN001, PN002, PN006, PN010 should have a count of 9 (0.3%).
- Subject 001734 in KEYNOTE-001 was counted within the AEOSI-Colitis. However, it was later determined that the patient had a grade 3 calcified fecalith, and was included in the summary

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of  colitis  due  to  data  entry  errors.  Therefore,  the  incidence  of  AEOSI-Colitis  in  the  pooled dataset of PN001, PN002, PN006, PN010 should have a count of 48 (1.7%).

- Subject 361473 in KEYNOTE-006 had an event of anaphylactoid reaction that was not counted as  an  infusion-related  reaction  since  this  term  was  not  listed  as  AEOSI-Infusion-Related Reactions at the time of reporting. This event was considered related to study drug, and led to treatment  withdrawal.  Therefore,  the  incidence  of  AEOSI-Infusion-Related  Reactions  in  the pooled dataset of PN001, PN002, PN006, PN010 should have a count of 71 (2.5%).

## Pneumonitis:

Pneumonitis  occurred  in  94  (3.4%)  patients,  including  Grade  2,  3,  4  or  5  cases  in  36  (1.3%),  25 (0.9%), 7 (0.3%) and 4 (0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of pneumonitis was 3.3 months (range 2 days to 19.3 months). The median duration was 1.5 months (range 1 day to 17.2+ months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 36 (1.3%) patients. Pneumonitis resolved in 55 patients.

Colitis occurred in 48 (1.7%) patients, including Grade 2, 3 or 4 cases in 10 (0.4%), 31 (1.1%) and 2 (&lt;0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of colitis was 3.5 months (range 10 days to 16.2 months). The median duration was 1.3 months (range 1 day to 8.7+ months). Colitis led to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 15 (0.5%) patients. Colitis resolved in 41 patients.

## Hepatitis

Hepatitis occurred in 19 (0.7%) patients, including Grade 2, 3 or 4 cases in 4 (0.1%), 12 (0.4%) and 2 (&lt;0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of hepatitis was 1.3 months (range 8 days to 21.4 months). The median duration was 1.8 months (range 8 days to 20.9+  months).  Hepatitis  led  to  discontinuation  of  pembrolizumab  in  6  (0.2%)  patients.  Hepatitis resolved in 15 patients.

## Nephritis

Nephritis occurred in 9 (0.3%) patients, including Grade 2, 3 or 4 cases in 3 (0.1%), 4 (0.1%) and 1 (&lt;0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of nephritis was 5.1 months (range 12 days to 12.8 months). The median duration was 3.3 months (range 12 days to 8.9+  months).  Nephritis  led  to  discontinuation  of  pembrolizumab  in  3  (0.1%)  patients.  Nephritis resolved in 5 patients.

## Endocrinopathies

Hypophysitis occurred in 17 (0.6%) patients, including Grade 2, 3 or 4 cases in 6 (0.2%), 8 (0.3%) and  1  (&lt;0.1%)  patients,  respectively,  receiving  pembrolizumab.  The  median  time  to  onset  of hypophysitis  was  3.7  months  (range  1  day  to  11.9  months).  The  median  duration  was  4.7  months (range 8+ days to 12.7+ months). Hypophysitis led to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 4 (0.1%) patients. Hypophysitis resolved in 7 patients, 2 with sequelae.

Hyperthyroidism  occurred  in  96  (3.4%)  patients,  including  Grade  2  or  3  cases  in  22  (0.8%)  and  4 (0.1%) patients, respectively, receiving pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of hyperthyroidism was 1.4 months (range 1 day to 21.9 months). The median duration was 2.1 months (range 3 days to 15.0+  months).  Hyperthyroidism  led  to  discontinuation  of  pembrolizumab  in  2  (&lt;0.1%)  patients. Hyperthyroidism resolved in 71 (74%) patients.

Hypothyroidism occurred in 237 (8.5%) patients, including Grade 2 or 3 cases in 174 (6.2%) and 3

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(0.1%)  patients,  receiving  pembrolizumab.  The  median  time  to  onset  of  hypothyroidism  was  3.5 months (range 1 day to 18.9 months). The median duration was not reached (range 2 days to 27.7+ months). One patient (&lt; 0.1%) discontinued pembrolizumab due to hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism resolved in 48 (20%) patients.

Table made by the CHMP Assessor. Source: Table 14.4.2-63 and Table 14.4.2-71

Among pembrolizumab-treated patients, the most common drug-related SAE was pneumonitis (2.2%), with all other drug-related SAEs occurred in less than 1% of patients. By contrast, in the docetaxel arm, the most frequent drug-related SAEs were febrile neutropenia (3.2%).

Overall, no major differences were registered based on pembrolizumab dose or PD-L1 expression in the pivotal NSCLC trial P010.

In  the  NSCLC  population,  the  incidence  of  both  All-Causality  and  Drug-related  SAEs  was  consistent with that reported in melanoma studies. As expected, a higher rate of drug-related Pneumonitis was reported in NSCLC patients (2.4% vs 1.0%):

## Laboratory findings

In  study  P010,  a  shift  analysis  on  laboratory  abnormalities  with  the  highest  CTCAE  Grade  was performed. A clinically meaningful worsening in CTCAE grade, defined as a shift from less than Grade 3 to Grade ≥3 or a shift from Grade 0 to Grade 2, was reported for some laboratory test:

From Table 12-36 (CSR P010)

No  clinically meaningful  changes  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  worsening  of  laboratory abnormalities was observed between the previously reported data in subjects with melanoma and the new data in subjects with NSCLC.

## Safety in special populations

Safety was assessed in subgroups defined by intrinsic and extrinsic factors (age, gender, ECOG status, region  and  histology)  in  NSCLC  patients  treated  with  pembrolizumab  in  the  KEYNOTE-001  and KEYNOTE-010 studies.

## Age

In Study P010 the incidence of drug-related AEs and SAEs was slightly higher in patients ≥65 years compared to those aged &lt;65 years in both docetaxel and pembrolizumab arms.

In the NSCLC population treated with pembrolizumab (Studies P001 and P010), the incidences of AEs, drug-related AEs, Grade ≥3 AEs, deaths, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs were slightly increased in older patients.

## Gender

In Study P010, the overall incidence of AEs was similar between the genders in both treatment arms, with the exception of SAEs occurring more often in males than in females (38.7% vs 28% in docetaxel arm; 40.6% vs 28.9% in pooled pembrolizumab arms). A similar trend was observed in the NSCLC population  (studies  P001  and  P010)  with  a  slightly  lower  incidence  of  SAEs  in  female  patients pembrolizumab treated.

## ECOG Performance Status

The incidence of SAEs was slightly higher in the ECOG 1 than in the ECOG 0 populations in both the docetaxel (36.7% vs 30.4%) and the pembrolizumab arms (38.4% vs 31.6%) in study P010. In ECOG 1  NSCLC  patients  treated  with  pembrolizumab  across  studies  P001  and  P010  the  tolerability  was slightly  reduced  compared  to  that  in  ECOG  0  patients  in  terms  of  SAEs  (  40.5%  vs  34.4%), discontinuation due to AEs (12.6% vs 8.8%) and discontinuation due to SAEs (10.2% vs 6.9%).

## Region

NSCLC patients from North America, Europe, Asia and Australia participated in the studies. No major differences  in  safety  were  observed  by  Region  (US  and  outside  of  US)  both  in  study  P010  among treatment arms and in the overall NSCLC population.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

In study P010, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred more frequently in the docetaxel arm (13.6%)  compared  to  the  pooled  pembrolizumab  arms  (7.9%),  with  consistent  results  besides  the degree of PD-L1 expression. Treatment discontinuation was slightly more frequent in the pembrolizumab arms due to events in the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC (2.9% vs 2.6%).

Due to AEs, the treatment was interrupted in 23.6% of patients in the docetaxel arm and in 22.9% in the pembrolizumab combined arms. The more frequently reported events leading to pembrolizumab interruption were in the SOCs Infection and Infestations (5.3%), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (3.7%) and Metabolism and nutrition disorders (3.4%). In the docetaxel arm, treatment was more  commonly  interrupted  due  to  AEs  in  the  SOCs Infection  and  Infestations (7.4%), General disorders and  administration  site  conditions (5.8%)  and Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal disorders (4.2%).

No major differences were observed in AEs leading to discontinuation or interruption regardless of PDL1 expression level.

The incidence of treatment discontinuations due to AEs reported in the NSCLC population (11.3%) was consistent  with  that  previously  reported  in  melanoma  patients  (12.4%).  This  was  also  observed  in terms  of  drug-related  AEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuations  (4.6%  in  NSCLC  and  5.7%  in melanoma populations).

Overall,  across  populations  pembrolizumab  discontinuation  mostly  occurred  due  to Pneumonitis (34 events, 1.2%).

## Post marketing experience

The first annual Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) for pembrolizumab, covering the period from 04-Sep-2014  to  03-Sep-2015,  has  been  assessed  by  the  PRAC.  Overall,  300  serious  adverse  drug

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reactions and 527 non-serious drug reactions have been reported (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010403/201509). No new safety concerns have been identified from the review of spontaneously reported cases for Keytruda as of 03-Sep-2015.

After  the  reporting  period,  1  patient  treated  with  pembrolizumab  in  the  phase  III  melanoma  study P006 experienced Grade 4 Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) that was considered an Important Identified Risk and was added in the SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.8 (Keytruda EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0002 adopted by the CHMP on 1 April 2016).

## Pooled Data Across Indications to Support the Product Information

Safety  data  to  support  Section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  were  pooled  across  completed  studies  in  multiple indications (studies P001 and P010 in NSCLC and studies P001, P002 and P006 in melanoma) using the pembrolizumab intended dose and regimen (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks).

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The pembrolizumab safety profile in NSCLC is based on data from 1232 patients treated in the pivotal phase II/III study (KEYNOTE-010, P010) and in the supportive phase I trial (KEYNOTE-001, P001). The majority of patients were previously treated with systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, with the exception of 101 patients in study P001 (Cohort F2) that were treatment-naïve.

A  twice  longer  mean  exposure  to  pembrolizumab  than  to  docetaxel  was  registered  in  Study  P010 (153.27  vs  81.6  days,  respectively).  In  comparison  to  data  in  the  melanoma  population,  the  drug exposure and duration of exposure were lower in the NSCLC population. However, long term safety data (≥12 months) are available for 165 NSCLC patients.

No major differences in baseline characteristics were observed across NSCLC and melanoma patient populations,  with  the  exception  that  there  were  more  Asian  patients  (17.4%  vs  1.2%)  and  more subjects with ECOG PS 1 (65.5% vs 34.5) in the NSCLC studies, due to the differences in site selection and the natural history of disease, compared to melanoma studies.

Overall,  in  the  pivotal  study  P010  a  lower  rate  of  AEs,  in  particular  drug-related  and  drug-related Grade ≥3, and treatment discontinuation occurred in patients treated with pembrolizumab compared to docetaxel.

No meaningful differences occurred in the safety profile of pembrolizumab-treated patients based on dose or level of PD-L1 expression in Study P010. However, in weakly PD-L1 positive patients, a higher rate of drug-related SAEs in the Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC was registered in the two pembrolizumab arms (3.5% and 2.1% at dose 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively) compared to docetaxel (1.1%), mainly in terms of Pneumonitis (8 total cases with pembrolizumab vs one case in the control arm).

Pembrolizumab  and  docetaxel  were  characterized  by  a  well  different  safety  profile.  The  most commonly  reported  AEs  belonging  respectively  to  SOCs General  disorders  and  administration  site conditions ( Fatigue ,  25.1%), Metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders ( Decreased  Appetite ,  24.6%), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders ( Dyspnoea , 22.9%) and to SOCs Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders ( Alopecia ,  34%), General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions ( Fatigue , 32%), Gastrointestinal disorders ( Diarrhoea , 25.9%). In terms of drug-related AEs, the most frequently reported were Fatigue (13.9%), Decreased appetite (11.6%), Nausea (10.0%), and Rash (10.7%)  with  pembrolizumab,  while  in  the  docetaxel  arm  drug-related Alopecia (32.7%), Fatigue (24.6%), and Diarrhoea (18.1%) were more commonly observed. As expected, a higher incidence of AEOSI,  including  immune-mediated  AEs,  was  registered  in  the  pembrolizumab  arms  compared  to docetaxel (19.5% vs 4.2%), and the most frequently reported events were Hypothyroidism (8.2% vs

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.3%), Hyperthyroidism (4.7% vs 1%) and Pneumonitis (4.5% vs 1.3%). In addition, AEOSI occurred earlier  with  pembrolizumab  than  docetaxel,  with  a  median  time  to  first  episode  onset  of  64  days (range: 4 to 381 days) and 85 days (range: 14 to 229 days), respectively. The most common drugrelated  SAEs  were Pneumonitis (2.2%)  with  pembrolizumab  and Febrile  neutropenia (3.2%)  with docetaxel. Overall, 43 deaths due to AEs were observed in the pembrolizumab arms (17 in the 2m/kg Q3W, and 26 in the 10 mg/kg Q3W) vs 15 in the docetaxel arm. However, only 6 deaths (3 in each pembrolizumab  arm)  were  considered  drug-related  in  the  experimental  arms  vs  5  in  the  docetaxel arm. For 5 of the 6 cases, the event leading to the fatal outcome in the pembrolizumab arms was related to respiratory function (3 Pneumonitis and 2 Pneumonia). The information on the possible fatal outcome  of  Pneumonitis  has  been  added  to  the  Keytruda  SmPC  (Section  4.4)  through  Keytruda variation EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0002.

In  the  overall  pembrolizumab  database,  a  mostly  overlapping  safety  profile  was  observed  across melanoma and NSCLC populations. Overall, the occurrence of Adverse Events in the NSCLC population was quite similar to that in melanoma patients. In NSCLC patients the most common AEs were Fatigue (30.4%), Decreased Appetite (25.2%), Dyspnoea (23.2%), Cough (20.8%) and Nausea (20  %).  An increased  incidence  of  Grade  ≥3  events  in  the  SOC Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders occurred in NSCLC ( Dyspnoea 3.9%, Pneumonia 4.1%)  compared to melanoma patients ( Dyspnoea 1.9%, Pneumonia 1.5%). The slightly lower incidence of drug-related events can be justified by the reduced  exposure  to  pembrolizumab  in  NSCLC  patients  compared  to  melanoma  patients.  No  major differences  in  the  incidence  of  Grade  ≥  3  Drug-Related  AEs  were  observed  between  NSCLC  and melanoma  patients  with  the  exception  of  events  in  the  SOC Respiratory,  Thoracic  and  Mediastinal disorders (2.5% vs 1.3%).

The rates of AEOSI were consistent across patient populations, except for Pneumonitis occurring more frequently  in  NSCLC  (4.4%  vs  2.6%).  In  terms  of  drug-related  SAEs,  no  major  differences  were reported  among  melanoma  and  NSCLC  population,  with  the  only  exception  of  a  higher  rate  of Pneumonitis in NSCLC patients (2.4% vs 1.0%):

The overall incidence of AEs resulting in deaths was slightly higher in NSCLC patients compared to that previously  reported  in  melanoma  (5.0%  vs  3.1%),  with  in  particular  an  increased  number  of respiratory fatalities (pneumonia, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure).

The tolerability  of  pembrolizumab  treatment  was  slightly  reduced  in  NSCLC  patients  ≥65  years  and with ECOG PS 1.  Available data do not allow to clearly differentiate the pembrolizumab safety profile based on histology. No new safety concerns were raised by post-marketing data.

Due to insufficient evidence to support a causal relationship with pembrolizumab, the MAH proposes to remove the terms Optic Neuritis and Rhabdomyolysis from the list of Other immune-related adverse reactions in section 4.4 of the SmPC. In the pooled locked datasets of studies P001, P002, P006, and P010,  one  drug-related  AE  of  optic  neuritis  and  one  drug-related  AE  of  rhabdomyolysis  were registered.

The  only  drug-related  AE  of  optic  neuritis  (Grade  2)  occurred  in  a  patient  with  a  known  history  of sarcoidosis for whom the ophthalmologist raised the possible role of sarcoidosis in the aetiology of the event. The drug-related AE of rhabdomyolysis (Grade 3) was reported in a patient with a history of hypothyroidism and who was engaged in an intense physical workout a few days prior to development of  the  event.  The  CHMP  agrees  with  the  deletion  of  both  Optic  Neuritis  and  Rhabdomyolysis  from section 4.4 of the SmPC

There  was  no  evidence  of  an  altered  safety  profile  with  anti-pembrolizumab  binding  antibody development.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Based on submitted data, no new pembrolizumab safety concerns arise from the NSCLC population. In comparison to data related to melanoma patients, an increased frequency of drug-related Pneumonitis and respiratory fatalities (pneumonia, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure) was reported. The information on the possible fatal outcome of Pneumonitis has been reflected in the Keytruda SmPC (Section 4.4) in the context of variation EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0002.

The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

In addition, minor changes have been implemented in Annex II.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable due to the minor changes introduced by this variation.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The  benefit  of  Keytruda  in  the  treatment  of  second  line  or  greater  advanced  NSCLC  with  PD-L1 expression is based on data from the pivotal phase II/III trial KEYNOTE-010 (P010), and supportive data from the NSCLC Cohorts C and F of the phase I study KEYNOTE-001 (P001).

In the pivotal trial, a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in OS has been observed for both pembrolizumab arms over docetaxel in subjects with TPS≥50% (HR of 0.54, p=0.00024, and 0.50, p=0.00002, for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q3W vs docetaxel, respectively), and in the overall population of subjects with TPS≥1% (HR of 0.71, p=0.00076, and 0.61, p&lt;0.00001, for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q3W vs docetaxel, respectively).

A statistically significant difference has been observed for PFS in the strongly positive subgroup only (as per the CTA test used), with HRs of 0.58 and 0.59 for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg vs docetaxel, respectively.

Supportive pre-specified sensitivity analyses for PFS were provided, all of which support the results of the primary analysis.

OS results observed in the overall population are clearly driven by the effect observed in the strongly positive  subgroup.  However,  the  visual  inspection  of  OS  survival  curves  of  the  weakly  positive subgroup (for which a formal analysis was not planned) shows a separation of the curves over time with a trend to an increase in the difference in the rate of alive patients between the experimental and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the control arms at subsequent time points.

The  duration  of  response  observed  with  pembrolizumab  is  much  longer  than  what  observed  with docetaxel for all patients whose tumours express PD-L1.

Duration of response based on IRC assessment was almost double in pembrolizumab treated subjects compared to docetaxel even in the weakly positive subgroup (46 and 45 weeks in the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg arms, respectively, vs 26 weeks in the docetaxel arm).

No meaningful difference has been observed between the two pembrolizumab dose levels for both OS and PFS. In general, secondary endpoints confirmed the benefit of pembrolizumab over docetaxel, with no difference observed between the two pembrolizumab dose levels. The lack of meaningful difference between the two pembrolizumab dose levels observed in all the efficacy analyses including Quality of life data further supports the adequacy of the 2 mg/kg Q3W dose level.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Results from subgroup analyses raise concerns on the effect of pembrolizumab in EGFR mutant (in all stratum), East Asian patients and never smokers. The information on the reduced survival benefit of pembrolizumab compared to docetaxel in patients who were never-smokers or patients with tumours harbouring  EGFR  activating  mutations  who  received  at  least  platinum-based  chemotherapy  and  a tyrosine kinase inhibitor is reported in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  pembrolizumab  in  the  NSCLC  population  was  quite  similar  to  that  in melanoma patients, although it should be noted the drug exposure is reduced compared to melanoma patients.  In  NSCLC  patients  the  most  common  AEs  were  Fatigue  (30.4%),  Decreased  Appetite (25.2%), Dyspnoea (23.2%), Cough (20.8%) and Nausea (20 %). An increased frequency of drugrelated Pneumonitis and respiratory fatalities (pneumonia, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure), some of which resulting in deaths, was reported. However, the information on the possible fatal outcome of Pneumonitis  has  been  added  to  the  Keytruda  SmPC  (Section  4.4)  in  the  context  of  variation EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0002 (positive CHMP opinion adopted on 1 April 2016).

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Treatment with pembrolizumab resulted in a clinically significant benefit in OS compared to standard therapy  with  docetaxel  in  adult  patients  with  advanced  PD-L1-positive  NSCLC  who  were  on  disease progression  or  after  prior  chemotherapy.  The  superiority  of  treatment  with  pembrolizumab  over docetaxel was further  supported by PFS, ORR and  response duration results, even though PFS  was statistically  significant  in  the  &gt;50%  PD-L1  positive  stratum  only.  Indeed,  although  the  OS  results observed in the overall population are clearly driven by the effect observed in the strongly positive PDL1  subgroup,  exploratory  analyses,  in  the  weakly  positive  subgroup,  indicated  a  trend  to  a  timedependent increase in the difference in survival rates favouring pembrolizumab over docetaxel, and albeit the Kaplan Meier analysis of PFS did not show any benefit for pembrolizumab over docetaxel, the duration  of  response  observed  with  pembrolizumab  was  much  longer  than  what  observed  with docetaxel. The benefit of pembrolizumab treatment is thus not considered limited to only the NSCLC patient population expressing high levels of PD-1.

The  safety  profile  in  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  does  not  differ  significantly  from  what  already

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

known  in  the  advanced  melanoma  setting  and  overall  seems  to  compare  favourably  to  that  of docetaxel.

## Benefit-risk balance

The observed clinically relevant survival benefit obtained with pembrolizumab treatment compared to standard therapy with docetaxel, and the favourable safety profile outweigh the risks, hence the B/R balance  of  pembrolizumab  in  the  second-line  or  greater  treatment  of  PD-L1  positive  NSCLC  is considered positive.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The  benefit  of  treatment  with  pembrolizumab  compared  to  standard  therapy  with  docetaxel  in  the second line of PD-L1 positive NSCLC is clearly evident in terms of OS, PFS and ORRs. The safety profile in  the  new  indication  almost  overlaps  with  that  already  known  for  the  melanoma  indication  and favourably compares with that of docetaxel.

There are no meaningful differences among the two pembrolizumab doses, supporting the proposed 2mg/kg Q3W dose, already recommended in the melanoma indication. Further support comes from the observation that statistical significance for PROs was achieved for the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg dose only.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

- The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab should be further explored, specifically:

Although PD-L1 status is predictive of response in NSCLC patients, durable responses have been observed in PD-L1 negative patients. Additional biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (e.g. PD-L2, RNA signature, etc.) predictive of pembrolizumab efficacy should be investigated together with more information regarding the pattern of expression of PD L1 obtained in the ongoing NSCLC studies (P001, P010, P024, and P042):

- Data on the Nanostring RNA gene signature
- IHC staining for PD-L2
- Data on RNA and proteomic serum profiling

| 4. The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab should be further explored, specifically: Although PD-L1 status is predictive of response in advanced melanoma and NSCLC patients, durable responses have been observed in PD-L1 negative patients. Additional biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) (e.g. PD-L2, RNA signature, etc.) predictive of pembrolizumab efficacy should be investigated together with more information regarding the pattern of expression of PD L1 obtained in the ongoing melanoma (P001, P002 and P006) and NSCLC studies (P001, P010, P024, and P042): • Comparison between PD-L1 IHC staining in archival tissue vs newly obtained (melanoma studies only) • Comparison of PD-L1 IHC between pre and post treatment tumour tissues (melanoma studies only) • Data on the Nanostring RNA gene signature • IHC staining for PD-L2 • Data on RNA and proteomic serum profiling • Data on Immune cell profiling (peripheral blood) (melanoma studies only) | 1Q 2017 2Q 2020 |

## 5. EPAR changes

The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope

Extension of Indication to include a new indication for Keytruda in second line Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC); as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated. Annex II is updated in order to include NSCLC on-going studies among the study designed to explore value of the biomarkers to predict efficacy of pembrolizumab. The Package Leaflet and the RMP (final version 3.3) is updated in accordance.
