## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Xevudy is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and over and weighing at least 40 kg) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who do not require oxygen supplementation and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 (see section 5.1).

The use of Xevudy should take into account information on the activity of sotrovimab against viral variants of concern (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Xevudy should be administered under conditions where management of severe hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, is possible and patients can be monitored during and for at least one hour after administration (see section 4.4).

It is recommended that Xevudy is administered within 5 days of onset of symptoms of COVID-19 (see section 5.1).

## Posology

Adults and adolescents (from 12 years and 40 kg body weight)

The recommended dose is a single 500 mg intravenous infusion administered following dilution (see sections 4.4 and 6.6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2) .

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Xevudy in children under 12 years old or weighing less than 40 kg have not yet been established . Currently available data are described in sections 4.8 and 5.2 but no recommendation on posology can be made.

## Method of administration

For intravenous use.

This medicinal product must be diluted prior to administration.

Once diluted, it is recommended that the solution is administered over 15 minutes (when using a 50 mL infusion bag) or over 30 minutes (when using a 100 mL infusion bag) with a 0.2-μm in-line filter.

Xevudy must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection.

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with administration of sotrovimab (see section 4.8). If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, administration should be discontinued immediately and appropriate medications and/or supportive care should be given.

## Infusion-related reactions

Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) have been observed with intravenous administration of monoclonal antibodies (see section 4.8). These reactions may be severe or life threatening. If an IRR occurs, the infusion may be interrupted, slowed or stopped.

## Antiviral resistance

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Decisions regarding the use of Xevudy should take into consideration what is known about the characteristics of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses including regional or geographical differences and available information on sotrovimab susceptibility patterns (see section 5.1).

When molecular testing or sequencing data are available, they should be considered to rule out SARSCoV-2 variants that are shown to have reduced susceptibility to sotrovimab.

## Polysorbate

This medicinal product contains 4.8 mg of polysorbate 80 in each 500 mg dose. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Pharmacokinetic interactions

No interaction studies have been performed. Sotrovimab is not renally excreted or metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes; therefore, interactions with medicinal products that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of CYP enzymes are unlikely.

## Pharmacodynamic interactions

In vitro pharmacodynamic studies showed no antagonism between sotrovimab and remdesivir or bamlanivimab.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of sotrovimab in pregnant women. Animal studies have not been evaluated with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). In a cross-reactive binding assay using a protein array enriched for human embryofoetal proteins, no off-target binding was detected. Since sotrovimab is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG), it has the potential for placental transfer from the mother to the developing foetus. The potential treatment benefit or risk of placental transfer of sotrovimab to the developing foetus is not known.

Sotrovimab should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the foetus.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether sotrovimab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. Administration of sotrovimab while breast-feeding can be considered when clinically indicated.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effects of sotrovimab on human male or female fertility. Effects on male and female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Xevudy has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety of a 500 mg dose of sotrovimab administered intravenously was evaluated in nonhospitalised patients with COVID-19 in a placebo-controlled randomised study (COMET-ICE, 1049 patients treated in a 1:1 ratio of sotrovimab:placebo), and in two non-placebo controlled randomised studies (COMET-PEAK, 193 patients and COMET-TAIL, 393 patients) (see section 5.1). The most common adverse reactions were hypersensitivity reactions (2%) and infusion-related reactions (1%). The most serious adverse reaction was anaphylaxis (0.05%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The adverse reactions in Table 1 are listed by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000), very rare (&lt;1/10,000).

Table 1: Tabulated list of adverse reactions

| System organ class                              | Adverse reaction                         | Frequency   |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Immune system disorders                         | Hypersensitivity reactions a Anaphylaxis | Common Rare |
| Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders | Dyspnoea                                 | Uncommon    |
| Injury, poisoning and procedural complications  | Infusion-related reactions               | Common      |

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Infusion-related reactions

IRRs may be severe or life threatening (see section 4.4). Signs and symptoms of IRRs may include fever, difficulty breathing, reduced oxygen saturation, chills, nausea, arrhythmia (e.g. atrial fibrillation), tachycardia, bradycardia, chest pain or discomfort, weakness, altered mental status, headache, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, angioedema, throat irritation, rash including urticaria, pruritus, myalgia, dizziness, fatigue and diaphoresis.

## Paediatric population

Based on limited data (n=7) from adolescents (aged 12 to less than 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg), there were no new adverse reactions identified beyond those observed in the adult population.

Data (n=3) obtained in children (aged 6 to less than 12 years and weighing at least 15 kg), are too limited to establish safety in this group.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no specific treatment for an overdose of sotrovimab. If overdose occurs, the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary.

A single 2000 mg dose of sotrovimab (4 times the recommended dose) administered by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes has been evaluated in a clinical trial (N=81) without evidence of doselimiting toxicity.

## Antiviral resistance

Cell culture studies: No viral breakthrough was observed when virus was passaged for 10 passages (34 days) in the presence of fixed concentration of antibody at the lowest concentration tested (~10x EC50). Forcing the emergence of resistance variants through an increasing concentration selection method identified E340A as a sotrovimab mAb resistance mutant (MARM). An E340A substitution emerged in cell culture selection of resistant virus and had a &gt;100-fold reduction in activity in a pseudotyped virus-like particle (VLP) assay.

Table 3 shows the activity data for sotrovimab against epitope sequence polymorphisms evaluated in pseudotyped VLP assessments in cell culture using the Wuhan-Hu-1 and Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5 spike proteins.

Clinical studies : SARS-CoV-2 viruses with baseline and treatment-emergent substitutions at amino acid positions associated with reduced susceptibility to sotrovimab in vitro were observed in patients enrolled in clinical studies who received a 500 mg intravenous infusion of sotrovimab (Table 4). In the COMET-ICE and COMET-TAIL studies, among patients who were treated with a 500 mg intravenous infusion of sotrovimab and had a substitution detected at amino acid positions 337 and/or 340 at any visit baseline or post-baseline, 1 of 32 and none of 33 patients, respectively, met the primary endpoint for progression to hospitalisation for &gt;24 hours for acute management of any illness or death from any cause through Day 29. This single patient had E340K detected post-baseline and was infected with the Epsilon variant of SARS-CoV-2.

c A multicentre, single arm, prospective, genomic surveillance study that followed non-hospitalised immunocompromised patients who received 500 mg intravenous infusion of sotrovimab.

## Immunogenicity

Treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to a single 500 mg intravenous infusion of sotrovimab were detected in 9% (101/1101) of participants, in controlled clinical studies with follow up durations of 18-36 weeks. No participants with confirmed treatment-emergent ADAs had neutralising antibodies against sotrovimab, and there was no evidence of an association of ADA with any impact on the safety, efficacy, or pharmacokinetics after a single intravenous infusion.

## Clinical efficacy

Study 214367 (COMET-ICE) was a Phase II/III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study which evaluated sotrovimab as treatment for COVID-19 in non-hospitalised, non-vaccinated adult patients who did not require any form of oxygen supplementation at study entry. The study included patients with symptoms for ≤ 5 days and laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and was conducted when the wild-type Wuhan-Hu-1 virus was predominant, with the highest frequency of variants being Alpha and Epsilon. Eligible patients had at least 1 of the following: diabetes, obesity (BMI&gt;30), chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or moderate to severe asthma, or were aged 55 years and older.

Patients were randomised to a single 500 mg infusion of sotrovimab (N=528) or placebo (N=529) over 1 hour. In the Intent to Treat (ITT) population at Day 29, 46% were male and the median age was 53 years (range: 17-96), with 20% aged 65 years or older and 11% over 70 years. Treatment was given within 3 days of COVID-19 symptom onset in 59% and 41% were treated within 4-5 days. The four most common pre-defined risk factors or comorbidities were obesity (63%), 55 years of age or older (47%), diabetes requiring medicine (22%) and moderate to severe asthma (17%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The adjusted relative risk reduction in hospitalisation or death by Day 29 in the ITT population was 79% (95% CI: 50%, 91%). The difference was driven by rates of hospitalisation, with no deaths in the sotrovimab arm and two deaths in the placebo arm up to Day 29. No patients in the sotrovimab arm, versus 14 in the placebo arm, required high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation up to Day 29.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Xevudy in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, following a 15 minute to 1 hour intravenous infusion of 500 mg, the geometric mean Cmax was 170 µg/mL (N = 1188, CVb% 53.4), and the geometric mean Day 28 concentration was 39.7 µg/mL (N = 1188, CVb% 37.6).

## Distribution

Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the geometric mean steady-state volume of distribution was 7.9 L.

## Biotransformation

Sotrovimab is degraded by proteolytic enzymes which are widely distributed in the body.

## Elimination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the mean systemic clearance (CL) was 95 mL/day, with a median terminal half-life of approximately 61 days.

## Special populations

## Elderly patients

Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, there was no difference in sotrovimab pharmacokinetics in elderly patients.

## Renal impairment

Sotrovimab is too large to be excreted renally, thus renal impairment is not expected to have any effect on elimination. Furthermore, based on population pharmacokinetic analyses there was no difference in sotrovimab pharmacokinetics in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.

## Hepatic impairment

Sotrovimab is degraded by widely distributed proteolytic enzymes, not restricted to hepatic tissue, therefore changes in hepatic function are not expected to have any effect on elimination. Furthermore, based on population pharmacokinetic analyses there was no difference in sotrovimab pharmacokinetics in patients with mild to moderate elevations in alanine aminotransferase (1.25 to &lt; 5 x ULN).

## Paediatric population

Limited data on the pharmacokinetics of sotrovimab in patients aged less than 18 years, has been obtained from the COMET-TAIL study (see section 4.8) and the COMET-PACE study. The COMETPACE study is an open-label, non-conparator paediatric study, that was terminated prior to completion of recruitment. The recommended dose for adolescents aged from 12 years and from 40 kg body weight was based on an allometric scaling approach, which accounted for effect of body weight changes associated with age on clearance and volume of distribution. This approach is supported by a population pharmacokinetic analysis, which shows comparable serum exposures of sotrovimab in adolescents as those observed in adults. Following intravenous infusion of 500 mg sotrovimab in 7 adolescents, the geometric mean Cmax was 180 µg/mL (geometric CV% 25.6) and the geometric mean Day 29 concentration was 47.4 µg/mL (geometric CV% 17.0).

Data (n=3) in children (aged 6 to less than 12 years and weighing at least 15 kg), are too limited to establish pharmacokinetics of sotrovimab in this age group.

## Other special populations

Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, the pharmacokinetics of sotrovimab following intravenous infusion were not affected by age, sex or BMI. No dose adjustment is warranted based on these characteristics. Body weight was a significant covariate, but the magnitude of effect does not warrant dose adjustment.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Carcinogenesis/mutagenesis

Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with sotrovimab.

## Reproductive toxicology

Nonclinical reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with sotrovimab.

## Animal toxicology and pharmacology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No toxicity with sotrovimab was identified in a cynomolgus monkey 2-week repeat-dose IV infusion toxicology study with 105-day recovery period at doses up to 500 mg/kg, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and highest dose tested. The Cmax and total exposure AUC [sum of AUC0-168h after Dose 1 and AUC0-last after Dose 2 (Day 8)] values at the NOAEL of 500 mg/kg were 13500 µg/mL and 216000 day*µg/mL, respectively.

## 1. What Xevudy is and what it is used for

Xevudy contains the active substance sotrovimab. Sotrovimab is a monoclonal antibody , a type of protein designed to recognise a specific target on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Xevudy is used to treat COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (from 12 years and weighing at least 40 kg).
