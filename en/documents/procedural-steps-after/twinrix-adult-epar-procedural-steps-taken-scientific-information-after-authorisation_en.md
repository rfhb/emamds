| WS/0153 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. This was an application for a group of variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to include a warning on psychogenic syncope based on the available safety data. The PL was proposed to be updated in accordance. In addition, the company took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the PL of Pumarix, Ambirix, Pandemrix, Pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Prepandrix and Fendrix. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 17/11/2011 | 13/01/2012 | SmPC and PL            | Based on a review of literature and a search in the global safety database performed by the MAH, the CHMP recommended including a wording on psychogenic syncope to the product information of the MAH injectable vaccines. The literature review showed an incidence peak occurred around the age of 15 years, with females having more than twice the incidence of males. The syncope reports with secondary injuries were reported most frequently in children and adolescents. Given that psychogenic syncope is not a true side effect, it was not considered appropriate to include syncope as an undesirable effect in section 4.8 of the SmPC. However, as such events can result in injury, and may not have occurred in the absence of the vaccination, the CHMP recommended to add a reference to such events in section 4.4 'Warning and Precaution' of the SmPC and in the PL. |

In addition, the immune memory in subjects who became seronegative for anti-HAV antibodies (i.e. concentrations < 15 mIU/ml) or had anti-HBs antibody concentrations < 10 mIU/ml at the long-term blood sampling time-point (years 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15) and who received an additional dose of Engerix-B, was also evaluated. 56 subjects had evaluable tests 15 years after the primary vaccination with Twinrix Adult. The anti-HAV seropositivity rates were 100% in both studies and the anti-HBs seroprotection rates were 89.3% and 92.9%, respectively. The data obtained also suggest that in the few subjects who respond to primary vaccination but loose seroprotection level of hepatitis B antibodies, protection could still be conferred through immune memory. The SmPC has been revised to reflect this information.   |

| II/0060   | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with seroprotection data from two vaccination follow-up clinical studies. In addition, sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC were amended to delete a wording on thiomersal-containing formulations. The MAH also took the opportunity to update the local list of representatives of the Package Leaflet for Bulgaria, Cyprus and Denmark. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   | 21/01/2010   | 15/03/2010   | SmPC and PL   | Study HAB-163 and study HAB-168 are a 36 month and 48 month respectively long-term follow-up of study HAB-160, previously submitted within variation II/50. Study HAB-163 is a phase IV, open, randomised, multicentre study to evaluate the effect of risk factors likely to influence immunogenicity of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (Twinrix) according to a 0, 1 and 6 months compared to separately administered monovalent hepatitis A and B vaccines and to demonstrate non-inferiority of Twinrix to the monovalent vaccines, in healthy and non- healthy adults aged 41 years or older. Study HAB-168 evaluated the immune response to a challenge dose of Twinrix versus monovalent hepatitis A and B vaccines 48 months in the same population after primary vaccination from study HAB-160. The SmPC has been updated to add persistence data up to 48 months. In addition, the data on the immune memory response following an additional dose administered at approximately 48 months has been included. In addition, as requested following the assessment and approval of a variation for Fendrix submitted in July 2008 (procedure EMEA/H/C/550/II/0007), that the wording in sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC for Twinrix Adult, referring to thiomersal containing formulations was removed.   |

The analysis of anti-HAV seropositivity rates up to 24 months after the first vaccine dose showed that the anti-HAV antibody response was influenced the most by body mass index (BMI), followed by age, gender and the vaccine received. Obese subjects (BMI > 30 kg/m2) achieved significantly lower anti-HAV seropositivity rates compared to subjects with BMI < 30 kg/m2. Based on these findings, the detrimental effect of obesity on the immune response to hepatitis A vaccines has been mentioned in the SPC and PL.   |

Section 5.3 was consequentially updated. The MAH also took the opportunity to update section 16 of the Labelling in line with the EMEA/QRD template version 7.2 and to amend the contact details of a local representative in the PL. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, | 24/04/2008 | 19/06/2008 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | In a nonclinical study in rats, Twinrix was not associated with any adverse effects on embryo-fetal, pre-natal and post-natal development. There were no findings of toxicity on the parental females or on reproduction. Likewise, no safety concern has been identified based on the limited clinical and post-marketing data of pregnant women exposed to vaccination with Twinrix. However, these limited data should be interpreted with caution and it is recommended that vaccination should be delayed until after delivery unless there is an urgent need to protect the mother against hepatitis B infection.                                                                                                           |

| II/0047   | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. Update of sections 4.4, 4.8 and 4.9 of the SPC to reflect the safety information obtained through a review of relevant clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance. These changes address the requests made by the CHMP following the assessment of the renewal of Twinrix Adult in June 2006 as well as PSUR 12 (covering the period from 20 September 2005 to 19 September 2006). Section 4 of the PL has been updated accordingly. The MAH also took the opportunity to update the contact details for the local representatives of Romania and Slovakia in the PL and to make minor changes in the SPC in line with the EMEA/QRD template version 7.2 Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   | 13/12/2007   | 17/01/2008   | SmPC and PL            | Based on an analysis of pooled safety data from 24 clinical trials and of post-marketing surveillance data, the information on adverse events reported with Twinrix has been comprehensively updated as appropriate. Among these changes, 'hypoaesthesia' (loss of skin sensitivity), 'lichen planus' (bumps on the skin) or 'muscle weakness' have been added to the list of undesirable effects. 'Syncope' has been removed from the list of adverse events since it is attributed to the injection rather than to the vaccine itself, but an appropriate warning was added in section 4.4 of the SPC. The frequency of some adverse events has also been updated. As an example, the frequency of 'headache' has changed from 'common' (occurring in up to 1 in 10 vaccine doses) to 'very common' (occurring in 1 in 10 doses or more). The distinction has also been made clearer in the SPC between the adverse events reported during clinical trials and those reported through post-marketing surveillance. Ten cases of overdose have been reported during post-marketing surveillance. However the adverse events reported following overdosage were similar to those reported with normal vaccine administration.   |
