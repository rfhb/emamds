## BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR THE PROCEDURE

## 1. Submission of the dossier

The  applicant  Glaxo  Group  Limited,  submitted  on  30  October  1998  an  application  for  Marketing Authorisation  to  the  European  Agency  for  the  Evaluation  of  Medicinal  Products  (EMEA)  for Agenerase (amprenavir) through the centralised procedure. After agreement by the CPMP on 24 July 1998,  this  medicinal  product  has  been  referred  to  Part  B  of  the  Annex  of  the  Council  Regulation (EEC) 2309/93, of the 22 July 1993, as amended.

The Rapporteur and Co-rapporteur appointed by the CPMP were:

Medicinal product no longer authorised Rapporteur: Prof. F. De Andres-Trelles Co-Rapporteur:   Pharm. J. Genoux-Hames Licensing status: Agenerase was not licensed in any country outside or inside the European Union at the time of the submission of the application. Agenerase is licensed several countries, including the United States (15 April 1999). 2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product  The procedure started on 20 November 1998.  The Rapporteur's initial assessment report was circulated to all CPMP members on 3 February 1999.  The  Co-rapporteur's  initial  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  members  on 4 February 1999.  The draft consolidated list of questions was circulated to all CPMP members on 18 March 1999 for  discussion  at  the  March  plenary  meeting.  The  CPMP  adopted  the  consolidated  list  of questions on 25 March 1999. The consolidated list of questions was sent to the applicant on 26 March 1999.  The applicant submitted the responses to the CPMP consolidated list of questions to all CPMP members on 6 August 1999 and the  evaluation  restarted  by  written  procedure  at  the  August CPMP meeting .  The joint Rapporteur/Co-rapporteur assessment report on the responses to the consolidated list of questions was circulated to all CPMP members on 6 October 1999.  During the  meeting  in  October  1999,  the  CPMP  agreed  on  a  list  of  outstanding  issues  to  be addressed by the applicant during an oral explanation. The CPMP agreed also to convene the ad-hoc group of experts on antiretroviral medicinal product to discuss the resistance issues.

The ad-hoc group of experts was held on 15 November 1999. The conclusions of the group were considered by the CPMP during its November meeting. In addition, an hearing with the applicant was held before the CPMP on 16 November 1999. In view of the difficulty to resolve the outstanding issues related to the indication, the CPMP agreed, exceptionally, to suspend the evaluation procedure to allow the applicant to provide additional data, particularly in relation to the potential benefit of amprenavir as salvage therapy. A list of outstanding issues was therefore adopted.

-  On the request of the CPMP, the issue of the amount of propylene glycol, contained in the oral solution,  was  further  addressed  by  the  Safety  Working  Party.  The  recommendations  of  the Safety Working Party were endorsed by the CPMP during its January 2000 plenary meeting.
-  The  applicant  submitted  the  responses  to  the  CPMP  list  of  outstanding  issues  to  all  CPMP members on 23 March 2000 and the evaluation restarted at the April CPMP meeting .

-  The joint Rapporteur/Co-rapporteur assessment report on the responses to the consolidated list of questions was circulated to all CPMP members on 2 May 2000.
-  During the meeting on 25 May 2000 the CPMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  agreed  that  a  clinical  study  to  compare  the efficacy,  safety  and  tolerance  of  Amprenavir/ritonavir  in  PI-experienced  HIV-infected  adults experiencing virological failure should be conducted.

The  CPMP  however  requested  that  before  the  adoption  of  an  Opinion,  the  protocol  for  the clinical study,  needed to be submitted by the applicant and agreed by the CPMP.

-  The  joint  Rapporteur/Co-rapporteur  assessment  report  on  the  draft  protocol  provided  by  the applicant was circulated to all CPMP members on 16 June 2000.
- Medicinal product no longer authorised  During  the  CPMP  meeting  on  27-29  June  2000,  outstanding  issues  were  addressed  by  the applicant  during  a  hearing  before  the  CPMP.  The  CPMP,  in  the  light  of  the  overall  data submitted  and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for granting a Marketing Authorisation under exceptional circumstances to Agenerase on 29 June 2000.  The  CPMP  opinion  was  forwarded,  in  all  official  languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decision on 20 October 2000.
