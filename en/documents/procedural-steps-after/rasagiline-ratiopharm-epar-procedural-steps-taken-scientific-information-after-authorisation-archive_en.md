The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP version 2.0 has also been submitted. In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to make editorial changes throughout the PI, to correct the invented name for Rasagiline Ratiopharm in the Czech annexes and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   |            |     | sleepiness has been reported post-marketing with rasagiline. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on rasagiline with other dopaminergic medicinal products, some perceived that they had no warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some of these events have been reported more than 1-year after initiation of treatment. In patients experiencing somnolence/sudden sleep episodes, rasagiline may have major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that rasagiline does not affect them adversely. Patients being treated with rasagiline and presenting with somnolence and/or sudden sleep episodes must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. operating machines) until they have gained sufficient experience with rasagiline and other dopaminergic medications to gauge whether or not it affects their mental and/or motor performance adversely. In addition as the term 'dysphoria' can be attributed to cognitive effects of serotonin syndrome, it was removed from the list of symptoms reported following overdose of rasagiline in doses ranging   |
