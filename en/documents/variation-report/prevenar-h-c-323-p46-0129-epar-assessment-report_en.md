## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

No SmPC and PL changes are proposed.

## II. RECOMMENDATION

The data from this study do not warrant any changes to the SmPC or PIL. III. INTRODUCTION On 6 February 2012, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Prevenar, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use. A short critical expert overview has also been provided. The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Prevenar and that there is no consequential regulatory action. IV. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION IV.1 Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study(ies) No investigational product was administered during the study period. IV.2 Clinical aspects 1. Introduction The MAH submitted a final report for: A study to evaluate pneumococcal antipolysaccharide antibody concentrations in subjects that participated in the Wyeth Prevenar Safety and Immunogenicity Study 0887X-101518 (Protocol B1841009 [6114A1-4001-CN]). 2. Clinical study  Description This study has been conducted as a postapproval commitment following approval of Prevenar by the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) for immunization against invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and young children. Prevenar, a  7-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (7vPnC),  contains  polysaccharides  from serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14,  18C, 19F, and 23F. Based on Chinese data on pneumococcal disease and nasopharyngeal  carriage,  serotypes  23F,  19F,  6A,  6B,  14,  15,  3,  18C,  23A,  and  9V  are  the  most common in China. Prevenar is therefore likely to protect Chinese infants from a large proportion of invasive pneumococcal diseases. In 2005, a Phase 3 safety and immunogenicity study (Wyeth study 0887X-101518) was conducted, in which  Chinese  infants  were  assigned  to  1  of  3  groups  to  receive  either  Prevenar  alone  (group  1), Prevenar given concomitantly with a diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine (group 2), or DTaP alone (group 3). The Chinese State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) has requested that an additional study be conducted  as  a  postapproval  commitment,  to  evaluate  postvaccination  antibody  concentrations  in children  aged  up  to  5  years.  This  follow-up  study  (B1841009  [6114A1-4001-CN])  assessed  the postvaccination  pneumococcal  antipolysaccharide  antibody  concentrations  in  children  who  previously completed Wyeth study 0887X-101518, at a time point at least 36 months after the last vaccination. It also compared antibody levels in subjects who received Prevenar in this study to those subjects who received DTaP alone (control group) at a single time point.

Primary objective

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the antibody levels to the 7 pneumococcal vaccine serotypes at least 36 months after administration of the toddler vaccination in groups 1 and 2 in Wyeth study 0887X-101518, as measured by serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG)concentrations.

## Secondary objective

The  secondary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  compare  the  antibody  levels  to  the  7  pneumococcal vaccine serotypes in subjects who received 7vPnC (groups 1 and 2) with those who did not receive 7vPnC (group 3) in Wyeth study 0887X-101518.

Immunogenicity analyses were performed for 2 populations in this study. The primary immunogenicity population in this study was the evaluable immunogenicity population, defined as eligible subjects who had blood drawn within required time frames, had at least 1 valid and determinate assay result for the proposed  analysis,  received  no  prohibited  vaccines,  and  had  no  major  protocol  violations.  Although specific  prohibited  vaccines  were  not  pre-specified  in  the  protocol,  non-live  vaccines/live  vaccines within  28  days  prior  to  enrollment  were  to  be  reviewed  by  the  clinical  scientist  and  used  to  assess whether  subjects  should  be  included  in  the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population.  The  all-available immunogenicity population consisted of subjects who had at least 1 valid and determinate assay result for the proposed analysis.

· Study design All eligible subjects who completed the Wyeth safety and immunogenicity study 0887X-101518 were invited to participate in this Phase 4, open-label study, at a timepoint at least 3 years after their last vaccination  in  study  0887X-101518.  Subjects  had  a  blood  sample  (approximately  5  mL)  drawn  at enrollment; subjects participated in the study for approximately 1 day. No vaccines were administered during the study. However, subjects were assessed according to the vaccine group they were assigned to in Wyeth study 0887X-101518: 7vPnC alone (group 1), 7vPnC given concomitantly with diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) (group 2), or DTaP alone (group 3). Subjects in all 3 groups were vaccinated in the preceding study at 3 months (vaccination 1), 4 months (vaccination 2), and 5 months (vaccination 3) of age (designated the infant series), with the subjects in groups 1 and 2 (groups that received 7vPnC) also vaccinated at 12 to 15 months of age (vaccination 4) (designated the toddler vaccination). · Study population /Sample size Of the 652 subjects who completed the Wyeth safety and immunogenicity  study 0887X-101518, 336 were screened for participation in this study and 335 were enrolled. One of the screened subjects did not meet the entrance criteria and did not enroll. Of the 335 subjects enrolled, 123 subjects were in group  1,  121  subjects  were  in  group  2,  and  91  subjects  were  in  group  3.  All  enrolled  subjects completed this 1-day study. · Treatments No investigational product was administered during the study period. · Outcomes/endpoints Efficacy endpoint: not applicable Safety  endpoint: The  protocol  defined  AEs  and  SAEs  that  were  collected  throughout  the  study. Adverse events were categorized according to MedDRA. If an event increased in severity, then a stop date was to be entered and a new event reported with a new severity. The start date of the new event was to be the same as the stop date for the previous event. Immunogenicity endpoint: The primary endpoint is the serotype-specific IgG concentration at the blood draw. Immunogenicity variables collected for this study are the results of assays performed on the blood samples collected. The results of these assays are antibody concentrations. Indicator  variables  will  be  derived  for  each  of  the  7  serotypes  in  7vPnC  for  the  following  criterion: serotype-specific IgG antibody concentration ≥ 0.35 μg/mL. All indicator variables will be derived as follows: =., if the value is missing or otherwise unavailable =1, if the value meets the specified criteria =0, if the value does not meet the specified criteria · Statistical Methods Statistical Analysis of Immunogenicity - Immunogenicity Populations Medicinal product no longer authorised

Ad hoc analyses were also conducted on 2 subsets, Subset A and Subset B.

*Subset A (called 'Infant-Toddler-3/4 years after') included those subjects who had valid IgG values at 'before infant series', 'after infant series', 'before toddler vaccination', 'after toddler vaccination', and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

'3 years after last vaccination' for group 1 and 2, and 'before infant series', 'after infant series', and '3 years after last vaccination' for group 3.

*Subset  B  (called  'Toddler-3/4  years  after')  included  subjects  who  had  valid  IgG  values  at  'before toddler vaccination', 'after toddler vaccination', and '3 years after last vaccination' for group 1 and 2.

## Comparisons of Immunogenicity

The  immunologic  comparisons  were  between  group  1  (7vPnC)  and  group  2  (7vPnC  +  DTaP),  and between groups 1 and 2 combined and group 3 (DTaP) at 3 years after the last vaccination. These between-group comparisons using immunogenicity data collected in this study were performed for the evaluable and the all-available immunogenicity populations. Within-group comparisons were also made for the following intervals:

<!-- image -->

* From after the infant series to 3 years after the last vaccination * From after the toddler vaccination to 3 years after the last vaccination Because  there  was  no  evaluable  population  defined  during  the  preceding  study,  comparisons  of immunogenicity  data  collected  during  the  preceding  study  (ie,  after  the  infant  series  or  after  the toddler vaccination) were only performed for the all-available population. The ad hoc analyses of Subset A and Subset B were performed for the comparisons at 3 years after the last vaccination. Methods of Analysis - Geometric Means Geometric means of the pneumococcal IgG concentrations (GMCs) were calculated at each visit that had a blood draw. For all groups, the geometric mean fold changes (GMFCs) in antibody concentration at  different  timepoints  were  summarized  by  geometric  mean  IgG  concentration  and  confidence intervals (CIs), computed using the logarithmically transformed assay results. Only subjects with results at both timepoints were included in the derivation of GMFCs. For betweengroup  comparisons,  ratios  of  the  GMCs  for  the  groups  being  compared  were  calculated  by  back transforming  the  difference  between  vaccine  groups  on  the  logarithmic  scale.  For  within-group comparisons, the GMFCs for the timepoints were calculated by back transforming the difference in GMC within vaccine groups on the logarithmic scale. The  analyses  in  this  study  are  descriptive.  The  protocol  and  SAP  did  not  prespecify  an  analysis  to demonstrate superiority of the immune response. However, the same criteria used for other vaccine studies  were  used  to  evaluate  antibody  concentrations  in  this  study.  Response  to  a  serotype  was considered to be statistically significantly greater for 1 vaccine group over another if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of GMCs was greater than 1.0. The response to a  serotype was considered statistically significantly lower if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of GMCs was less than 1.0. Significant within-group differences in GMC were also assessed using these criteria.  Results · Recruitment/ Number analysed All eligible subjects who completed the 0887X-101518 study were allowed to participate in this study. All analyses were descriptive and no formal power calculation was done. Disposition  of  study  subjects  is  summarized  in  Table  6-1.  Of  the  652  subjects  who  completed  the preceding  study,  336  were  screened  for  participation  in  this  study  and  335  enrolled.  One  of  the screened subjects did not meet the entrance criteria and did not enroll. Of the 335 subjects enrolled (123 in group 1, 121 in group 2, and 91 in group 3), all completed this 1-day study.

· Baseline data Subjects  were  not  randomized  in  this  study;  they  remained  in  the  same  groups  that  they  were assigned to in the preceding study (study 0887X-101518). A unique subject number for each subject was assigned at enrollment. The demographic characteristics of subjects in the safety population are summarized in Table 6-2. The 3 vaccine groups were similar with respect to sex, race, and age at the time of the blood draw. All subjects were Asian and ≥4 years of age at the time of blood draw, with a mean age of 5.04 years. The percentage of males (55.5%) was slightly higher than the percentage of females (44.5%).

*  At  3  years  after  the  last  vaccination,  for  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  a  pneumococcal  IgG concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL,  group  1  was  similar  to  group  2  for  the  majority  of  serotypes  for  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects  in  the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population.  The  results  were  consistent  for  subjects  in Subset A and Subset B.

*  At  3  years  after  the  last  vaccination,  for  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  a  pneumococcal  IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL, group 1 and group 2 combined was significantly greater than group 3 for 6  of  7  of  serotypes  for  the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population.  In  contrast,  group  1  and  group  2 combined had a similar proportion of subjects with a pneumococcal IgG concentration ≥0.35  μg/mL compared to group 3 for 5 of 7 serotypes for the subjects in Subset A.
* In groups 1 and 2, the IgG GMCs at 3 years after the last vaccination were generally lower than after the  infant  series,  and  were  also  generally  lower  than  after  the  toddler  vaccination,  but  were  higher than before vaccination 1 of the infant series.

In 2005, a Phase 3 safety and immunogenicity study (Wyeth study 0887X-101518) was conducted, in which  Chinese  infants  were  assigned  to  1  of  3  groups  to  receive  either  Prevenar  alone  (group  1), Prevenar given concomitantly with a diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine (group 2), or DTaP alone (group 3). The Chinese State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) has requested that  an  additional  study  be  conducted  as  a  postapproval  commitment,  to  evaluate  postvaccination antibody  concentrations  in  children  aged  up  to  5  years.  This  follow-up  study  (B1841009  [6114A14001-CN]) assessed the postvaccination pneumococcal antipolysaccharide antibody concentrations in children  who  previously  completed  Wyeth  study  0887X-101518, at a time point at least 36 months after the last vaccination. It also compared antibody levels in subjects who received Prevenar in this study  to  those  subjects  who  received  DTaP  alone  (control  group)  at  a  single  time  point.  The  total number of subjects in the three groups participating in this study was 335. The serotype specific antipneumococcal  IgG  concentrations  were  not  significantly  different  between  subjects  who  received 7vPnC  alone  and  those  who  received  7vPnC  simultaneously  with  the  DTaP  vaccine,  except  for serotypes 4 and 19F. Antibody concentrations against the latter serotypes were significantly lower in the latter group. Anti-pneumococcal antibody concentrations for subjects who received 7vPnC either

* In group 3 the IgG GMCs at 3 years after the last vaccination were higher than after the infant series for  all  serotypes.  However,  serotype-specific  IgG  GMCs  for  all  serotypes  decreased  from  before vaccination 1 of the infant series to after the infant series. In  conclusion,  at  3  years  after  the  last  vaccination,  the  circulating  anti-pneumococcal  antibody concentrations  were  similar  for  subjects  who  received  7vPnC  alone  compared  with  subjects  who received 7vPnC and DTaP as measured by serotype-specific IgG concentrations. At 3 years after the last  vaccination,  the  anti-pneumococcal  antibody  concentrations  for  subjects  who  received  7vPnC either alone or combined with DTaP were greater than for subjects who received DTaP alone. · Safety results For protocol-related AEs and SAEs, the reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative was from the time of informed consent until the end of the visit at the clinic (Visit 1). Any SAE occurring any time after the reporting period was reported if a causal relationship to the protocol/procedures was suspected. There were no protocol related AEs, SAEs, or AEs that led to withdrawal during the study. No subjects died during this study. 3. Discussion on clinical aspects In  conclusion,  at  3  years  after  the  last  vaccination,  the  circulating  anti-pneumococcal  antibody concentrations  were  similar  for  subjects  who  received  7vPnC  alone  compared  with  subjects  who received  7vPnC  and  DTaP  as  measured  by  serotype-specific  IgG  concentrations,  except  for  the serotypes  4  and  19F.  At  3  years  after  the  last  vaccination,  the  anti-pneumococcal  antibody concentrations for subjects who received 7vPnC either alone or combined with DTaP were greater than for subjects who received DTaP alone except for serotype 9V. No vaccine was administered in this study, and there were no AEs of any kind reported. V.
