1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

3 SmPC (Summary of Product Characteristics), Annex II, Labelling, PL (Package Leaflet).

| II/0024 | Extension of Indication from \"Treatment of actinic keratosis of mild to moderate severity on the face and scalp (Olsen grade 1 to 2; see section 5.1) and of field cancerization\" to the following: Treatment of superficial and/or nodular basal cell carcinoma unsuitable for surgical treatment due to possible treatment-related morbidity and/or poor cosmetic outcome in adults. Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. Editorial changes have been proposed in sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.2, 6.6 and 9 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated accordingly. There are two new warnings that have been included in section 4.4 that the use of immunosuppressants during treatment with Ameluz is not recommended and of the risk of transient global amnesia. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10. | 15/12/2016 | 27/01/2017 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Please refer to the published Assessment Report Ameluz H- 2204-II-24-AR. |
