## I. INTRODUCTION

On June 7, 2012 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Synflorix, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Synflorix and that there is no consequential regulatory action.

This  study  report  is  also  part  of  a  follow-up  measure  for  Synflorix,  with  the  aim  to  evaluate  the boostability of the immune response following the 2-dose catch-up vaccinatin in children 12-23 months of age. The study was performed in accordance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan (EMEA000673-PIP01-09).

## II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## II.1 Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The formulation used in the current study is the same as the commercially available formulation.

## II.2 Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- -10PN-PD-DIT-062;  Booster  vaccination  with  pneumococcal  vaccine  GSK1024850A  in  primed children and catch-up vaccination in unprimed children.

## 2. Clinical study

10PN-PD-DIT-062; Booster vaccination with pneumococcal vaccine GSK1024850A in primed children and catch-up vaccination in unprimed children.

##  Description

A phase III, open study in children previously enrolled in study 10PN-PD-DIT-037 (111188) to assess the  immunogenicity,  safety  and  reactogenicity  of  GlaxoSmithKline  (GSK)  Biologicals'  10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when administered as a booster dose at either 9-18 or 15-18 months of age in primed children or when administered as a catch-up vaccination (2+1 schedule) in unprimed children during the second year of life.

##  Methods

- Objective(s)

Primary:

- To assess the immune responses following vaccination with a booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine administered at either 9-12 or 15-18 months of age in children previously vaccinated with  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-037  (111188)  according  to  a  3-dose primary vaccination at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age.

Note: In the Pn-Pn9 group, following protocol amendment 1, the age range for receiving booster dose was  changed  from  9-12  to  9-18  months  of  age.  Therefore,  for  analysis  purposes,  the  group  was divided in two sub-groups [Pn-Pn9 (9-12) and Pn-Pn9 (13-18)] in order to allow evaluation of the early booster subset (9-12 months of age) for the primary objective.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Assessor's  comment: It is unfortunate that the design of the study was not in accordance with the primary objective. The consequence of the protocol amendment was that there were fewer children with an early booster.

Secondary:

- To assess, prior to booster vaccination, the antibody persistence following primary vaccination with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine.
- To  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  following  a  2-dose  primary vaccination administered as a catch-up immunization according to a 2+1 vaccination schedule in unprimed children during the second year of life.
- To  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  following  booster  vaccination administered as a catch-up immunization according to a 2+1 vaccination schedule in unprimed children during the second year of life.
- To assess the safety and reactogenicity of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine when administered as a catchup immunization according to a 2+1 vaccination schedule in unprimed children during the second year of life.
- To assess the safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine when administered at either 9-18 or 15-18 months of age in children primed with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in study 10PN-PD-DIT-037 (111188) according to a 3-dose primary vaccination at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age.
- To assess the antibody persistence following booster vaccination with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine up to approximately 24 months of age in the primed groups.
- Study design

This was a phase III, partially randomized, open study with 3 parallel groups (as described above). Randomization of subjects primed in study 10PN-PD-DIT-037 (111188) into two groups; Pn-Pn9 and Pn-Pn15, in a 1:1 ratio was done at 9-18 months of age (Randomisation visit or Visit 1).

## Blood samples:

Pn-Pn9 and Pn-Pn15 groups: prior to vaccination, one month post-vaccination, and at approximately 24 months of age.

Hib-Pn  group:  prior  to  dose  1,  one  month  post-dose  2,  prior  to  and  one  month  post-booster vaccination.

- Study population /Sample size

Healthy male or female for whom the investigator believes that their parents/ guardian(s) could and would  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  protocol.  Written,  signed  or  thumb-printed  informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the child/ward. Where parent(s)/guardian(s) are illiterate, the consent form was countersigned by a witness.

## For primed subjects:

- Completion of the full vaccination course in study 10PN-PD-DIT-037 (111188).
- 9-18 months at the time of randomization.
- 9-18 months of age at the time of booster vaccination for the Pn-Pn9 group.
- 15-18 months of age at the time of booster vaccination for the Pn-Pn15 group

For unprimed subjects:

- Enrolled in study 10PN-PD-DIT-037 (111188).
- 12-18 months of age at the time of first vaccination in the present study.

The sample size was contingent on the number of subjects who received a 3-dose primary vaccination course with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine for primed subjects or who were enrolled in study 10PN-PD-DIT037 (111188) for the unprimed group. ( Assessors' note: 240 subjects received priming vaccination in study 10PN-PD-DIT-037 and 120 subjects were included in the control group ).

Assuming  that  around  20%  of  these  subjects  did  not  enter  this  study,  it  could  be  considered  that approximately 96 subjects per group received a booster vaccine dose or catch-up vaccine dose(s) in the current study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Considering that 96 subjects per group (288 subjects in total) were to be enrolled and included in the Total vaccinated cohort, and up to 10% of the subjects might have been excluded from the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity, there would be 86 evaluable subjects per group (258 subjects in total) in the current study.

- Treatments

The study groups were as follows:

- Pn-Pn9 group: 50% of subjects (randomly selected) previously primed with the 10PnPDDiT  vaccine  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-037  (111188)  and  receiving  a  booster  dose  of 10Pn-PDDiT at 9-18 months of age.
- Pn-Pn15 group: 50% of subjects (randomly selected) previously primed with the 10PnPDDiT  vaccine  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-037  (111188)  and  receiving  a  booster  dose  of 10Pn-PDDiT at 15-18 months of age.
- Hib-Pn  group:  unprimed  subjects  previously  vaccinated  with  DTPw-HBV  and  Hib vaccines  in  the  control  group  of  study  10PN-PD-DIT-037  (111188)  and  receiving  a catch-up vaccination with 10Pn-PD-DiT (2+1 schedule) during the second year of life. Dose 1 was given at 12-18 months of age, dose 2 at 14-20 months and dose 3 at 1824 months of age.

## Notes:

1. During the study subjects might have been vaccinated with a measles-containing vaccine and with the Infanrix/Hiberix (DTPa/Hib) vaccine according to the national  recommended vaccination  program.  These  vaccines  were  not  considered  as  study  vaccines  and  could  be administered either at any 'protocol defined study visit' or at any time during the study except in the period 30 days before and 30 days after the administration of the study vaccine (10PnPD-DiT).
2. In  the  Pn-Pn9  group,  following  protocol  amendment  1,  the  age  range  for  receiving  booster dose  was  changed  from  9-12  to  9-18  months  of  age.  Therefore,  for  analysis  purposes,  the group was divided in two sub-groups [Pn-Pn9 (9-12) and Pn-Pn9 (13-18)] in order to allow evaluation of the early booster subset (9-12 months of age) for the primary objective.

- Occurrence of unsolicited adverse events within 31 days after each vaccination.
- Occurrence of serious adverse events after the first vaccination up to study end.
- Statistical Methods

Demography:

- Demographic characteristics (age in months, gender and race) were tabulated for each study cohort as a whole and per group.
- The mean age in months (plus range and standard deviation) of the enrolled subjects at the time of booster or first vaccination with 10Pn-PD-DiT, as a whole, and per group, was calculated. The mean age in months (plus range and standard deviation) at the time  of  randomization  (screening  visit)  was  also  calculated  for  the  primed  Pn-Pn15 group.
- The distribution of subjects enrolled among the study centres was tabulated as a whole and per group.
- A summary of the tracking log-sheet that documented outcomes of the contacts made with subjects for enrolment in this study was provided.

## Analysis of immunogenicity:

The primary analysis was based on the ATP cohort for persistence or on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity  according  to  the  objective.  As,  in  at  least  one  group,  the  percentage  of vaccinated subjects with serological data excluded from this ATP cohort was more than 5%, a second analysis based on the Total vaccinated cohort was performed to complement the ATP analysis.

## Descriptive analysis:

- Geometric mean concentrations/titres (GMCs/GMTs), seropositivity rates were calculated with their 95%  confidence interval (CI) for each group and each pneumococcal serotype and protein D, at each timepoint that  a  blood  sample  result was available.
- Distribution of antibody concentrations/titres was displayed using tables and/or reverse cumulative curves for each group and each pneumococcal serotype and protein D, at each timepoint that a blood sample result was available.

Exploratory Inferential analysis:

- 95% CIs for the ELISA GMCs ratio (GMCs Pn-Pn15 group over GMCs Pn-Pn9 group), one month after booster dose, was computed for each of the pneumococcal serotypes, for the cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes 6A and 19A and for protein D, using an ANOVA  model  on  the  logarithm10  transformation  of  the  concentrations  (pooled variance).
- 95% CIs for the OPA GMTs ratio (GMTs Pn-Pn15 group over GMTs Pn-Pn9 group), one month after booster dose, was computed for each of the pneumococcal serotypes and for the cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes 6A and 19A, using an ANOVA model on the logarithm10 transformation of the titres (pooled variance).
- 95% CIs for the ELISA GMCs ratio [GMCs Pn-Pn15 group over GMCs Pn-Pn9 (9-12) group],  one  month  after  booster  dose,  was  computed  for  each  of  the  vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, for  the  cross-reactive  pneumococcal  serotypes  6A  and  19A and  for  protein  D  using  an  ANOVA  model  on  the  logarithm10  transformation  of  the concentrations (pooled variance).
- 95%  CIs  for  the  OPA  GMTs  ratio  [GMTs  Pn-Pn15  group  over  GMTs  Pn-Pn9  (9-12) group],  one  month  after  booster  dose,  was  computed  for  each  of  the  vaccine pneumococcal  serotypes  and  for  the  cross-reactive  pneumococcal  serotypes  6A  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

19A, using an ANOVA model on the logarithm10 transformation of the titres (pooled variance).

## Analysis of safety:

- The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  the  Total  vaccinated  cohort.  As,  in  at  least  one group, the percentage of vaccinated subjects excluded from the ATP cohort for analysis of safety was more than 5%, a second analysis based on the ATP cohort for safety was performed to complement the primary analysis.

## Descriptive analyses:

- Incidence  of  solicited  and/or  unsolicited  local  and/or  general  AEs  during  the  31-day postvaccination period was calculated with exact 95% CI after each vaccine dose and overall, according to the type of symptom, intensity and relationship to vaccination.
- Incidence of each local and each general solicited symptom reported during the 4-day postvaccination period was calculated with exact 95% CI after each vaccine dose and overall, according to the type of symptom, intensity and relationship to vaccination.
- The percentages of subjects/doses with unsolicited symptoms reported within the 31days postvaccination period were summarized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA),  with  exact  95%  CI,  according  to  the  intensity  and relationship  to  vaccination.  The  same  tabulation  was  done  for  unsolicited  symptoms resulting in a medically attended visit.
- The number and percentage of subjects who took concomitant antipyretic/medication at least once during the 4-day post-vaccination period was computed with exact 95% CI after each vaccine dose and overall. The number and percentage of doses for which the  subjects  took  concomitant  antipyretic/medication  at  least  once  during  the  4-day (day 0-day 3) solicited follow-up period were tabulated over the full vaccination course, with exact 95% CI.
- Serious adverse events (SAEs), large swelling reactions and withdrawal(s) due to AE(s) reported during the entire study period were described in detail.

- Efficacy results

## Persistence of immune response to pneumococcal serotype specific polysaccharides prior to booster vaccination

## 22F Inhibition ELISA

For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes:

At  least  94.3%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn9  and  Pn-Pn15  groups  had  antibody  concentrations  ≥  0.05 µg/mL (Table 27).

At  least  80.7%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn9  group  and  78.9%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn15  group  had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL except for serotype 1 (65.9% in the Pn-Pn9 group and 64.4% in the Pn-Pn15 group) (Table 27).

## For cross-reactive serotypes:

The observed percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations ≥0.05 µg/mL was 78.7% for 6A and 79.5% for 19A in the Pn-Pn9 group and 86.2% for 6A and 89.9% for 19A in the Pn-Pn15 group (Table 29).

The observed percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL was 46.1% for 6A and 62.5% for 19A in the Pn-Pn9 group and 52.9% for 6A and 69.7% for 19A in the Pn-Pn15 group (Table 29).

## Opsonophagocytic activity

For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, at least 64.4% of subjects in the Pn-Pn9 group and 60.5%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn15  group,  respectively,  had  OPA  titres  ≥8  except  for  serotypes  1 (41.4% in the Pn-Pn9 group and 40.5% in the Pn-Pn15 group) and 5 (48.3% in the Pn-Pn9 group and 44.4% in the Pn-Pn15 group) (Table 31).

For cross-reactive serotypes, the observed percentage of subjects with OPA titres ≥8 was 40.7% for 6A and 25.6% for 19A in the Pn-Pn9 group and 47.6% for 6A and 23.2% for 19A in the Pn-Pn15 group (Table 33).

Assessor's comment: The antibody titres decline for most serotypes prior to booster vaccination, which is in agreement with other studies and as expected.

Immune response to booster vaccination in the primed Pn-Pn9 (9-12), Pn-Pn9 and Pn-Pn15 groups (22-inhibition ELISA):

## One month after booster vaccination:

For  each  of  the  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes,  at  least  95.2%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn9  (9-12) group and 93.8% of subjects in the Pn-Pn15 group had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL. For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, at least 96.3% of subjects in the Pn-Pn9 group (i.e. pooled  Pn-Pn9  (9-12)  and  Pn-Pn9  (13-18)  groups)  and  at  least  93.8%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn15

group had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL (Table 36).

For cross-reactive serotypes, the observed percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL was 82.7% for 6A and 19A in the Pn-Pn9 group and 82.3% for 6A and 87.5% for 19A in the PnPn15 group.

## Persistence  of  antibodies  at  age  of  24  months  (i.e.  approximately  9  to  15  months  after  booster vaccination with 10Pn-PD-DiT)

Approximately 9 to 15 months after booster vaccination: For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes: At  least  96.6%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn9  group  and  96.4%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-  Pn15  group  had antibody concentrations ≥0.05 µg/mL. At  least  89.8%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn9  group  and  90.9%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn15  group  had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL except for serotype 6B in the Pn-Pn9 group (83.1%).

## For cross-reactive serotypes,

The observed percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations ≥0.05 µg/mL was 89.8% for 6A and 91.5% for 19A in the Pn-Pn9 group and 89.1% for 6A and 96.4% for 19A in the Pn-Pn15 group. The observed percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL was 62.7% for 6A and 74.6% for 19A in the Pn-Pn9 group and 58.2% for 6A and 92.7% for 19A in the Pn-Pn15 group.

## Immune response to catch-up (2+1 schedule) vaccination in the unprimed Hib-Pn group (22-inhibition ELISA):

One month after dose 2 of catch-up vaccination: For each of the vaccine pneumococcal  serotypes,  at least 94.4%  of  subjects had  antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL except for serotypes 6B (88.6%) and 23F (90.1%). For cross-reactive serotypes, the observed percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL was 65.7% for 6A and 94.4% for 19A.

Four months after dose 2 of catch-up vaccination: For each of the vaccine pneumococcal  serotypes,  at least 93.8%  of  subjects concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL except for serotype 6B (87.7%).

had  antibody For cross-reactive serotypes, the observed percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations   ≥0.2 µg/mL was 60.0% for 6A and 95.4% for 19A.

One month after dose 3 of catch-up vaccination: For each of the vaccine pneumococcal  serotypes,  at least 96.3%  of  subjects had  antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL. For cross-reactive serotypes, the observed percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations ≥0.2

µg/mL was 87.0% for 6A and 100.0% for 19A.

Assessor's comment: The study was not powered to detect any differences between an early or late booster dose. The ELISA results do not indicate any major differences between the groups, while the OPA GMTs were numerically higher in the late booster group compared to the early booster group for several serotypes. The titres had generally declined to a lower level in the late booster group, which favours  an  early  booster  dose  in  order  to  decrease  the  risk  of  breakthrough  cases  due  to  waning immunity before the booster dose.

The responses after the third dose in the catch-up group (i.e. PIII(M7) in the HibPn group) were similar to  the  responses  to  the  booster  response  in  the  children  primed  with  the  EPI  schedule  in  terms  of number of subjects achieving ELISA antibody levels ≥0.2 µg/mL. In some cases, e.g. serotype 1 and 6B the GMCs and the OPA GMTs were lower in the catch-up group and for serotypes 18C and 19F they were higher in the catch-up group. The ELISA GMCs and the OPA GMTs for all serotypes following the third dose in the catch-up schedule were consistently numerically higher compared to the second dose. Taken together these results indicate that a third dose given during the second year of life after the 2dose catch-up schedule induces a booster response. However, from this relatively small study in Indian children it is not possible to draw conclusions on when or if a booster dose should be given to children who received a 2-dose catch-up vaccination during the second year of life. In addition, the relevance to an EU population is unclear.

## Immune  response  to  booster  vaccination  in  primed  Pn-Pn9  (9-12),  Pn-Pn9  and  Pn-Pn15 groups (opsonophagocytic activity):

## One month after booster vaccination:

For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, at least 97.4% of subjects in the Pn-Pn9 group and 93.0% of subjects in the Pn-Pn15 groups had OPA titres ≥8 (Table 40).

For cross-reactive serotypes, the observed percentage of subjects with OPA titres ≥8 was 73.4% for 6A and 76.9% for 19A in the Pn-Pn9 group and 77.2% for 6A and 87.7% for 19A in the Pn-Pn15 group (Table 42).

## Approximately 9 to 15 months after booster vaccination,

For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, at least 80.4% of subjects in the Pn-Pn9 group and 83.6%  of  subjects  Pn-Pn15  group  had  OPA  titres  ≥8,  except  for  serotype  1  in  the  Pn-Pn9  group (71.9%).

For cross-reactive serotype, the observed percentage of subjects with OPA titres ≥8 was 64.8% for 6A and 37.7% for 19A in the Pn-Pn9 group and 62.3% for 6A and 72.5% for 19A in the Pn-Pn15 group.

## Immune  response  to  catch-up  (2+1  schedule)  vaccination  in  unprimed  Hib-Pn  group (opsonophagocytic activity):

One month after dose 2 of catch-up vaccination: For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, at least 90.6% of subjects had OPA titres ≥8 except for serotypes 6B (71.4%) and 1 (79.4%) (Table 40). For cross-reactive serotypes, the observed percentage of subjects with OPA titres ≥8 was 78.5% for

6A and 87.5% for 19A (Table 42).

Four months after dose 2 of catch-up vaccination:

For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, at least 87.1% of subjects had OPA titres ≥8 except for serotypes 1 (45.3%), 6B (70.5%) and 5 (73.0%) (Table 40).

For cross-reactive serotypes, the observed percentage of subjects with OPA titres ≥8 was 81.0% for 6A and 90.2% for 19A.

One month after dose 3 of catch-up vaccination: For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, at least 90.6% of subjects had OPA titres ≥8 (Table 40). For cross-reactive serotypes, the observed percentage of subjects with OPA titres ≥8 was 92.3% for

6A and 98.1% for 19A (Table 42).

Assessor's  comment: The rate of solicited general adverse events does not cause any  new concern regarding Synflorix.

## Unsolicited adverse events

At least one unsolicited AE was reported by 7.0% and 1.1% of subjects in the Pn-Pn9 and Pn-Pn15 groups,  respectively,  within  the  31-day  post-vaccination  period.  Unsolicited  AEs  with  medically attended  visits  were  reported  by  6.0%  and  1.1%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn9  and  Pn-Pn15  groups, respectively.

In the unprimed Hib-Pn group, 2.5% of administered doses were followed by at least one unsolicited AE within the 31-day post-vaccination period. For the unsolicited AEs with medically attended visits, this percentage was 2.1% of administered doses.

## Serious adverse events

Three  subjects  reported  at  least  one  SAE  during  the  entire  study  period:  two  out  of  100  subjects boosted at 9-18 months of age and one out of 87 subjects that received 2+1 dose catch-up vaccination in  second year of life. None of the reported SAEs were fatal or considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

Synflorix EMEA/H/C/000973 P46 017

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fatal events

No fatal SAEs were reported during the entire study period.

## Non-fatal events

During the entire study period, three subjects reported at least one SAE (two out of 100 vaccinated subjects in the Pn-Pn9 group and one out of 87 vaccinated subjects in the Hib-Pn group). None of the SAEs  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination.  All  SAEs  were recovered/resolved without sequelae.

## Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study vaccine and/or study

None of the subjects withdrew due to an AE or SAE during the study period.

## MAH conclusions

- The  data  in  this  study  showed  that  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  induced  an  immune  response against vaccine pneumococcal serotypes when given as an early or late booster dose at either 9-12 or 15-18 months of age, respectively, following 3-dose primary immunization course at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age in Indian children. One month after booster vaccination, for each of the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, at least 96.8% and 98.4% of subjects boosted with 10Pn-PD-DiT at 9-12 or 15-18 months of age, respectively had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL except for serotype 6B (95.2% of subjects boosted at 9-12 months of age and 93.8% of subjects boosted at 15-18 months of age).
- 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine was generally well tolerated.
- During the 31-day post-booster vaccination period, at least one unsolicited AE was reported by 7.0% and 1.1% of subjects boosted at either 9-18 or 15-18 months of age, respectively. In the group that received 3-dose (2+1 schedule) catch-up vaccination with 10Pn-PD-DiT in second year of life, at least one unsolicited AE was reported following the administration of 2.5% of doses (5.7% of subjects).
- Three  subjects  reported  at  least  one  SAE  during  the  entire  study  period:  two  out  of  100 subjects boosted at 9-18 months of age and one out of 87 subjects that received 2+1 dose catch-up vaccination in second year of life. None of the reported SAEs were fatal or considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.
- No  confirmatory analysis was  performed  with regards to the primary  and secondary immunogenicity and reactogenicity/safety objectives.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The submitted study report describes booster responses at 9-12 months of age or 15-18 months of age in Indian children who had received three primary doses according to the EPI schedule, i.e. at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. In addition, a secondary objective was to study immune responses to 2 catchup doses followed by a single booster dose within the second year of life. The catch-up part of this study fulfils FUM, regarding boostability of the catch-up vaccination. The study design was not optimal to achieve the primary objective, since the children were recruited to either the 9-18 months group or 15-18 months group, instead of the intended 9-12 and 15-18 months age groups. This was apparently done for practical reasons, as the study start was delayed.

The study was not powered to detect differences between an early or late booster dose. The titres had generally  declined  more  in  the  late  booster  group  before  the  booster  dose,  compared  to  the  early booster group, and the responses tended to be higher in the late booster group. However, the groups were relatively small, and the relevance of these data for a European population is unclear. Therefore, in conclusion, there is no need to make any SPC changes based on the booster data presented in this submission.

The catch-up part of this study was a secondary objective, but represents the first data on boostability of  a  2-dose  catch-up  schedule  during  the  second  year  of  life.  The  responses  to  a  third  dose  given during the second year of life have the characteristics of a booster response, i.e. higher GMCs and GMTs following the third dose compared to the second priming dose. The interval between the two primary doses and the booster dose was relatively short, and no data on duration of the immunological memory are available. Taken together, the catch-up data indicate that a third dose given during the second year of life increases the antibody titres, but these data are not considered sufficient to change the dosing recommendations for the catch-up schedule. In addition, the relevance of the data from this study conducted in India to a European population is questioned.

No new safety signal was detected in this study.

Thus, no further regulatory action is required.

## III. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

##  Overall conclusion

This Paediatric submission is considered fulfilled, and in addition FUM is also considered fulfilled. The presented  data  on  a  booster  dose  following  the  2-dose  catch-up  during  the  second  year  of  life  are considered novel, but not sufficient to request a change to the booster recommendations for the catchup dose in the EU SPC.

##  Recommendation
