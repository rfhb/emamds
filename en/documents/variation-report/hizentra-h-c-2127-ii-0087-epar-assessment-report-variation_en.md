## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

IgPro20 is a ready-to-use 20% protein liquid formulation of a polyvalent human immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparation for subcutaneous administration. The protein moiety of IgPro20 is highly purified IgG (≥ 98% purity); more than 90% of the IgG consists of monomers and dimers. IgG function (Fc and Fab mediated activity) is retained. The sterile 20% IgG solution is formulated with 250 mmol/L L-proline and 20 mg/L polysorbate  80  at  pH  4.8.  IgPro20  contains  no  preservative.  Wherever  possible,  specifications  and analytical  methods  have  been  selected  in  compliance  with  both  the  USP  and  the  Ph.  Eur.  The manufacturing  process  of  the  subcutaneous  immunoglobulin  (SCIG)  solution  Hizentra  is  based  on  the IgPro10 (Privigen: EMEA/H/C/831) process except for formulation and final protein concentration. Filling sizes include 5 mL (1 g), 10 mL (2 g), 15 mL (3 g) and 20 mL (4 g).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IgPro20  is  approved  in  the  US,  EU,  Switzerland,  Latin  America,  Eastern  Europe,  Canada,  Japan,  and Australia under the trade name  of Hizentra for s.c. application in the treatment of Primary Immunodeficiency (PID).  In  the  EU,  IgPro20  is  also  approved  for  replacement  therapy  in  myeloma  or chronic lymphocytic leukemia with severe secondary hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections.

In  general,  IV  immunoglobulins  (IVIG)  targets  various  cellular  (such  as  dendritic  cells,  macrophages, monocytes,  B  and  T  cells)  and  soluble  compartments  (cytokines,  complements,  auto-antibodies,  and auto-antigens)  of  the  immune  system  that  are  involved  in  the  pathogenesis  of  autoimmune  disease. These mechanisms are non-exclusive and work synergistically to provide their therapeutic effects, which is  essentially  neutralization  of  the  activated  complement,  inactivation  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines, downregulation of Fc receptors, adhesion to molecules on macrophage, and modulation of B-cells.

The  exact  pharmacotherapeutic  mechanisms  in  auto-immune  disorders  are  unclear;  however,  there  is some  evidence  that  IGs  exert  their  action  in  part  through  up-regulation  of  the  inhibitory  FcγIIB  cell receptor  on  effector  cells,  whose  function  is  to  balance  the  activity  of  activating  FcγRs,  dismissing inflammatory  response  by  delivering  inhibitory  signals.  This  mechanism  was  shown  for  CIDP  patients when compared to healthy subjects. In addition, number of circulating CD4+ CD25+ T- regulatory cells was shown to be reduced in CIDP patients. Increased frequency of genotype GA13-16 of the SH2D2A gene encoding for a T-cell-specific adapter protein in CIDP patients may result in a defective control and elimination of autoreactive T cells. IVlG treatment has been shown to increase numbers and function of peripheral CD4+ CD25+ T-regulatory cells in a mouse model.

CIDP is an acquired polyneuropathy within the peripheral nerve system with an assumed autoimmunemediated pathogenesis. Its presentation is heterogeneous, and the clinical, serological, and electrophysiologic  diagnostic  procedures  have  limitations.  The  probable  autoimmune  nature  of  the condition is most strongly suggested by response to various immunotherapies. This assumption is further supported  by  the  fact  that  the  histology  of  active  lesions  is  characterized  by  endoneurally  located inflammatory  mediators, deposits of  complement  and  infiltrates  of  T-cells,  and  macrophage-associated demyelination. Patients with CIDP have symmetrical weakness in both proximal and distal muscles that worsens progressively. The condition is usually associated with impaired sensation, absent or diminished tendon  reflexes, an  elevated  cerebrospinal fluid protein level,  and  changes  in  electrophysiology parameters. Nerve biopsy specimens are characterized by signs of demyelination. The clinical course can be relapsing or chronic and progressive, the former being much more common in young adults.

CIDP is a rare disease with an estimated prevalence of about 1.6 to 8.9 per 100,000 adults and about 0.5 per 100,000 children.

Primary  treatment  modalities  for  CIDP  include  intravenous  immunoglobulins  (IVIGs)  and  plasma exchange, for which there is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evidence. In addition, despite less  definitive  published  evidence  of  efficacy,  corticosteroids  are  also  considered  as  first-line  therapy because of their long history of use. Studies have failed to demonstrate a difference in efficacy among these 3 treatments; consequently, the choice is usually based on availability, cost, and side-effect profile. Another therapy option for CIDP is the subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of IgG.

In the last years, possible prognostic biomarkers for CIDP have been discussed: Antibodies against NF155 (Neurofascin-155)  were  found  in  subgroups  of  CIDP  patients  and  correlated  with  a  more  severe phenotype  of  disease,  younger  age  at  onset,  ataxia,  CNS  demyelination  and  poor  response  to  IVIG treatment.  The  presence  of  antibodies  against  CNTN1  (Contactin-1)  characterized  subgroups  of  CIDP patients  with  an  acute  and  aggressive  symptom  onset,  poor  response  to  IVIG  treatment  but  positive response to corticosteroids. Both autoantibodies could possibly serve as biomarkers to guide treatment option and therapy decision, if they were fully validated.

## Rationale for the proposed change:

According  to  international  guidelines  [eg,  Joint  Task  Force  of  the  European  Federation  of  Neurological Societies (EFNS) and the Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS), 2010], IVIG products have become established in the treatment of sensory and motor CIDP (recommendation level A). SCIG is an alternative treatment option for CIDP that allows patients to self-administer the product in the home setting. As demonstrated for  SCIG  treatment  of  primary  immune  deficiency,  many  patients  prefer  treatment  at  home  to  IVIG

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment in the hospital. SCIG treatment increases autonomy, quality of life, and may reduce costs by less hospitalization. In addition, and in contrast to IVIG, serum IgG peak levels are lower and troughs are higher with SCIG; thus, a more constant IgG level is achieved, leading to a reduction in the wearing-off effect at the end of an IV treatment cycle. SCIG also results in an improved side-effect profile, with a lower rate of systemic reaction observed in SCIG studies in PID and does not require venous access that can be associated with complications. Several published trials and cases indicate the benefits of SCIG as a treatment of CIDP.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

## PK Study IgPro20\\_3003

PK  (IgG)  samples  in  Study  IgPro20\\_3003  were  collected  at  SC  Weeks  9,  17  and  at  completion  visit; efficacy  (INCAT  score)  was  collected  at  SC  Weeks  1,  2,  5,  9,  13,  17,  21  and  at  completion  visit.  IgG concentrations were analysed by immunoturbidimetry. Serum IgG concentrations were summarized by visit using descriptive statistics.

Summary of the study design:

## Pre-randomization Phase:

A  total  of  276  subjects  were  screened,  245  entered  the  IVIG  withdrawal  period,  and  208  entered  the IgPro10 restabilization period. Of these, 207 subjects started treatment with IgPro10 and 171 achieved CIDP stability.

## Post-randomization Phase:

A  total  of  172  subjects  were  randomized  and  started  treatment  with  IgPro20  /  placebo  in  the  SC treatment  period  (placebo:  57;  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20:  57;  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20:  58  subjects).  A  total  of  76 subjects  were  withdrawn  (placebo:  36;  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20:  21;  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20:  19  subjects)  and  60 subjects received IgPro10 as rescue medication.

## IgPro10 restabilization Period:

Pre-infusion serum IgG concentration increased by a mean (SD) of 19.27 (5.854) g/L after the IgPro10 loading  dose  (2  g/kg  bw  within  2  to  5  days).  At  the  next  visit  (Week  4),  serum  IgG  concentration decreased but was still increased by a mean (SD) of 5.38 (4.130) g/L as compared to the start of the loading dose administration. The IgG concentration declined slightly over time.

## SC Treatment Period (IgPro20 / Placebo):

Compared with the baseline mean (SD) concentration (16.3 [3.20] g/L for all subjects), the mean (SD) IgG concentration at the last post-dose observation decreased by 4.39 (3.40) g/L in the placebo group and by 0.89 (2.84) g/L in the 0.2 g/kg group, and increased by 4.11 (2.70) g/L in the 0.4 g/kg group.

## Population PK Model and Model Evaluation

## Pooled PK data set

A population approach was used for the description of the PK of IgG after SC administration of IgPro20 because of the sparse sampling in study 3003. A previously developed population PK model for IVIG was updated with collected SCIG data. The thereby derived population PK model for subjects with CIDP was developed based on the pooled observed serum IgG concentrations collected in Study IgPro20\\_3003 and Study IgPro10\\_3001 (IV administration).

IgPro10\\_3001 was a single-arm study to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of IgPro10 in the treatment of subjects with CIDP. IgPro10 was given at 2 g/kg as a loading dose for naïve subjects, followed by a maintenance  dose  at  1  g/kg  every  3  weeks  for  24  weeks.  In  Study  IgPro10\\_3001,  PK  (IgG)  were collected before and after infusion at Day 1, Days 2 to 5 (whenever infusions took place), and at Weeks 7, 13, 19, and at completion visit (Week 25).

## Final population PK model structure and results

A  2-compartment  model  with  first-order  absorption  (for  SC  administration)  and  elimination  and  interindividual variability (IIV) on clearance (CL) and central volume of distribution (V2) was selected as final model.  The  existing  model  (based  on  IV  data)  was  used  as  a  starting  point  and  the  choice  of  2compartmental  structure  confirmed.  The  necessity/benefit  of  including  pre-treatment  information  was evaluated.  Various  approaches  to  describe  physiological  baseline  IgG  levels  were  tested.  Using  the observed baseline  as  covariate  stabilized  the  model  and  led  to  significant  improvements  of  parameter precision. Owing to the limited sampling in the absorption phase, the absorption rate constant (Ka) was not  estimable  based  on  the  current  data,  and  was  therefore  set  to  a  previously  estimated  value.  The residual error structure was proportional. The estimates (95% CIs) of the population PK parameters in subjects with CIDP for the reference covariate effect of 82 kg (ie, the median body weight of the 235 subjects in the pooled PK dataset) were: 0.453 (0.431, 0.474) L/day for clearance, 4.69 (4.38, 5.01) L for  volume  of  distribution.  Relative  bioavailability  of  the  SC  formulation  compared  to  intravenous  (IV) administration was estimated to approx. 85% (0.824 (0.759, 0.889)). Estimates for the base and final model are listed below.

Exposure  coverage  for  all  tested  alternative  SC  dosing  regimens  (bi-weekly,  twice  weekly  and  daily administration  of  the  same  total  weekly  dose)  was  equivalent,  i.e.,  exposure  parameter  ratios  were between 0.8 and 1.25.

Simulations of IgG concentrations over 6 months after a switch from the original IV dosing regimen (1 g/kg every 3 weeks) to 0.2 g/kg qw SC showed essentially stable IgG concentration during the entire transition period and beyond. A switch from the IV regimen to 0.4 g/kg qw SC showed a gradual rise of IgG  concentrations  to  a  new  SS  (Cmax  22.2  g/L,  Cmin  20.4  g/L)  over  a  period  of  approximately  2 months, after which the new SS was established.

days  in  dose  cohort  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20,  respectively.  Analogously,  the  mean  (95%  CI)  absolute bioavailability of SC administered IgPro20 relative to IV administered IgPro10 was estimated to be 82% (76%, 89%). The absorption constant was fixed to the value of 0.439 1/day and has been estimated in the base model to 0.143 (0.008 - 0.277) 1/day.

Distribution: The  Population-PK  derived  estimated  mean  (95%  CI)  central  volume  of  distribution  of IgPro20 in study IgPro20\\_3003 was 4.69 (4.38 - 5.01) L. Peripheral volume of distribution was estimated to 1.87 (1.29 - 2.45) L.

Elimination: The  elimination  of  IgG  occurs  mostly  via  intracellular  catabolism,  after  fluid-phase  or receptor-mediated endocytosis. Because neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) expression in vascular endothelium and in various other organs and tissues is limited, FcRn-mediated recycling is capacity-limited. The mean (95% CI) clearance of IgPro20 was estimated to be 0.453 (0.431, 0.474) L/day.

Available covariates included body weight, age, sex, baseline IgG, IgG pre-treatment, Japanese vs nonJapanese, and United States (US) resident vs non-US resident. An automated forward inclusion followed by  backward  elimination  procedure  was  applied  using  the  stepwise  covariate  model  (SCM)  tool  as implemented in PsN. The results after backward elimination are given in the following Table.

Among the covariates  evaluated  in  the  population  PK  analysis,  only  body  weight  influenced  the  PK  of serum  IgG  after  IgPro20  administration.  Age,  sex,  and  region  (US,  Japan,  Rest  of  World)  had  no statistically significant or clinically meaningful effects.

## Body weight

Body  weight  has  been  identified  as  significant  covariate  on  CL  and  V  and  was  introduced  in  the  final model as covariate on CL, Q, V2 and V3.

## Sex

Covariate effect of sex on central volume lead to a change &lt; 20% in V2 and thus was not considered clinically relevant. Besides, sex was identified to be correlated with body weight. Sex was not included as covariate in the final model.

## Baseline IgG

The  baseline  IgG  effect  on  CL,  though  significant,  was  mainly  driven  by  extreme  baseline  values  that were atypical for CIDP subjects (&lt;5 g/L or &gt;20 g/L). Baseline IgG effect on CL is depicted below. The applicant decided not to retain Baseline IgG as covariate in the final population PK model.

## Age

No formal PK study was conducted in elderly subjects. Subjects &lt; 18 years were not eligible to enter the study of IgPro20. In Study 3003, 57 subjects (27.5%) of the 172 CIDP patients were ≥ 65 years of age (34/57  subjects  have  been  treated  with  Hizentra).  The  data  from  these  subjects  were  included  in  the population PK analysis. Age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of IgG.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The covariate categories 'treatment-naïve' and 'Japanese' contained only 15 subjects each, limiting the ability to interpret these effects. However, both were not found to be significant on clearance and central volume of distribution.

By incorporation of covariate effects on CL and V (only BW-related effects), unexplained IIV (%CV) for CL was reduced by 7% for CL and 6% for V2 compared to the base model.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic modelling

The  relationship  between  systemic  IgG  exposures  and  Total  Inflammatory  Neuropathy  Cause  and Treatment scale (INCAT) scores was assessed using a longitudinal population-based exposure-response (ER) analysis with data from 171 subjects with CIDP (1250 observations) who were treated with IgPro20 in the post-randomization Phase of Study 3003. The total INCAT scores over time, stratified by IgPro20 dose groups are depicted below.

The model simulation demonstrated that higher serum IgG trough concentrations resulted in a greater probability of having a stable (no change) or decreased (improvement) Total Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and treatment (INCAT) score.  The probability of having a stable or decreased Total INCAT score over  a  range  of  serum  IgG  concentrations  (baseline-corrected)  ranging  from  0  (analogous  to  no treatment) to 30 g/L is depicted below.

Target baseline-corrected IgG concentrations were identified where 20% (EC20), 50% (EC50), and 80% (EC80) of the clinically meaningful Emax would be expected. The model simulation estimated that the baseline-corrected IgG concentrations that would result in an EC20, EC50, and EC80 of the probability of having a stable or decreased Total INCAT score would occur at baseline-corrected IgG concentrations of 0.8 g/L, 2.8 g/L, and 8.1 g/L, respectively.

The Emax was defined as the probability of having a stable or decreased Total INCAT score at a baselinecorrected  IgG  concentration  of  30  g/L  (corresponding  to  a  probability  of  approximately  92%).  The probability of having a stable or decreased Total INCAT score with no treatment was approximately 64%.

Source: Module 2.7.2, Figure 8

These baseline-corrected target IgG concentrations (0.8 g/L, 2.8 g/L, and 8.1 g/L) were then compared with the expected baseline-corrected IgG trough (at the end of the weekly dosing interval) concentrations after SC administration of IgPro20 at a dose of 0.2 g/kg or 0.4 g/kg. The predicted baseline-corrected mean trough concentration was 3.82 g/L for the 0.2 g/kg dose and 7.54 g/L for the 0.4 g/kg dose. These corresponding  IgG  trough  concentrations  would  yield  probability  estimates  of  having  a  stable  or decreased Total INCAT score of 81% for the 0.2 g/kg dose and 86% for the 0.4 g/kg dose.

Based on this analysis, the proportion of subjects with CIDP that would achieve baseline-corrected serum IgG concentrations above these targets (EC20, EC50, and EC80) at trough for the 0.2 g/kg and 0.4 g/kg doses of IgPro20 were calculated.

The  simulations  indicate  that  both  doses  of  IgPro20  SC  would  achieve  serum  IgG  concentrations  that exceed  the  EC50  (2.8  g/L)  at  trough,  specifically  96%  of  subjects  with  CIDP  would  have  minimum (trough) concentrations at steady-state (Ctrough) above the EC50 after receiving IgPro20 at a weekly SC dose of 0.4 g/kg, and 72% of subjects with CIDP would have Ctrough concentrations above the EC50 after receiving IgPro20 at a weekly SC dose of 0.2 g/kg. In addition, the ER model was used to compare the probability of having a stable or decreased Total INCAT score after SCIG treatment with IgPro20 (at the weekly doses of 0.2 g/kg and 0.4 g/kg investigated in Study 3003) with the probability of having a stable or decreased Total INCAT score after IVIG treatment with IgPro10 every 3 weeks at a dose of 1 g/kg, representative of an approved IVIG treatment regimen for CIDP:

A higher probability (86%) of having a stable of decreased Total INCAT score was predicted for the 0.4 g/kg SC dose of IgPro20 as a result of the higher IgG trough concentrations obtained relative to the low SC dose of IgPro20 (81%) and the IV dose of IgPro10.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

PK modelling and simulation have previously been performed and successfully concluded for Hizentra in the past and this allowed for two-weekly doing and frequent dosing of more than once a week. These variations  applied  to  the  PID/SID  population,  in  whom  dosing  is  generally  lower  than  in  autoimmune disorders such as CIDP.

The PK of IgG after SC administration of IgPro20 was described using a population approach because of the sparse sampling in Study IgPro20\\_3003 (0.2 g/kg, 0.4 g/kg SC QW).This was considered acceptable by CHMP.  A previously developed population PK model for IV administered IgG was updated with SC data. PK data were pooled from 235 subjects to derive the definite pooled PK data set of in total 1558 observations  resulting  from  both  studies,  IgPro10\\_3001  (IV,  N  =28)  and  IgPro20\\_3003  (IV  &amp;  SC,  N =207).

A  2-compartment  model  with  first-order  absorption  (for  SC  administration)  and  elimination  and  interindividual  variability  (IIV)  on  clearance  (CL)  and  central  volume  of  distribution  (V2)  was  selected  to describe SC PK data. Due to limited sampling in the absorption phase, the absorption rate constant (Ka) could not properly be estimated based on the current data and instead, literature references were used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As requested by the CHMP, a sensitivity analysis was provided showing that varying ka values over the range  0.05  -  0.6  has  only  minor  influence  on  the  objective  function  values  and  consequently  also  on trough  concentrations in the steady state. This mirrors the poor identifiability of ka and in turn the low quantitative predictive power. Thus, the choice of the more robust literature-based value is acceptable. It is  agreed  that  differences  in  ka  between  PID  and  CIDP  patients  are  not  expected.  Due  to  the  above mentioned reasons the model is not qualified to detect possible differences in ka.

Diagnostic  plots  and  VPC  plots  showed  that  the  PK  of  IgG  following  IV  and  SC  administration  was  in general well characterized. Relating observed and predicted values showed an over-estimation of small values, high values are slightly over-predicted on the individual level, however, these are not considered substantial.

The  estimates  (95%  CIs)  of  the  population  PK  parameters  were:  0.453  (0.431,  0.474)  L/day  for clearance, 4.69 (4.38, 5.01) L for the central volume and 1.87 (1.29, 2.45) L for the peripheral volume of distribution.  Relative  bioavailability  of  the  SC  formulation  compared  to  intravenous  administration  was estimated to approx. 85% (0.824 (0.759, 0.889)).

Body weight had a significant impact on both IgG CL and V2. By incorporation of covariate effects (only BW-related effects), unexplained IIV (%CV) for CL (28 %CV) was reduced by 7% and by 6% for V2 (23 %CV) compared to the base model.

Based  on  the  final  model  estimates,  the  following  steady-state  PK  parameters  for  serum  IgG  after administration  of  IgPro20  (SC  weekly  dose  of  0.2  g/kg  or  0.4  g/kg,  6  months)  during  maintenance therapy were derived after switching from IV regimen to SC in subjects with CIDP.

While the 0.2 g/kg SC qw dose level (trough levels) stayed almost unchanged at the SS after standard IV administration  (Cmax  17.4  g/L,  Cmin  16.5  g/L),  simulations  of  0.4  g/kg  SC  qw  dosing  resulted  in  a gradual rise of IgG concentrations to a slightly higher SS level over approximately 2 months (Cmax 22.2 g/L, Cmin 20.4 g/L). This is in accordance with the data collected from SC treatment period: Compared with  the  Baseline  mean  (SD)  concentration  (16.3  [3.20]  g/L  for  all  subjects),  the  mean  (SD)  IgG concentration at the last post-dose observation decreased by 4.39 (3.40) g/L in the placebo group and by 0.89 (2.84) g/L in the 0.2 g/kg group, and increased by 4.11 (2.70) g/L in the 0.4 g/kg group. In the placebo group IgG Ctrough values decline after approx. Week 10. Thus, the carry-over effect of IVIG to IgPro 20 could also be estimated to last this length of time.

Model-based simulations indicate that flexible SC dosing scenarios (bi-weekly, weekly, twice-weekly and daily administration) would lead to equivalent exposure. A switch from the established IV regimen to one of  proposed  SC  weekly  dose  levels  (0.2  g/kg,  0.4  g/kg)  would  achieve  comparable  trough  IgG concentration  levels  with  slightly  higher  level  in  the  steady  state  regarding  the  0.4  g/kg  SC  dosing regimen.

In conclusion, the derived population PK model described the PK of IgPro20 for SC use acceptably well.

## PK/PD

The  pharmacodynamics  IgPro20  effect  was  described  by  an  Emax  model  that  relates  exogenous  IgG concentration  with  INCAT  score  changes  observed.  Data,  population  based  PK  analysis  and  simulation indicate  that  there  is  a  dose-response  relations  with  regard  to  efficacy.  Weekly  dosing  of  0.4  g/kg  SC

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

resulted in a more pronounced change from baseline and higher Ctrough IgG values as compared to 0.2 g/kg dosing. Exposure-efficacy response was described by an Emax model; however the EC50 value could not be estimated precisely.

Model-based  simulations  indicate  that  both  doses  of  IgPro20  achieve  serum  IgG  concentrations  that exceed  the  EC50  (2.8  g/L).  Specifically  96%  of  subjects  with  CIDP  would  have  minimum  (trough) concentrations at steady-state above the EC50 after receiving IgPro20 at a weekly SC dose of 0.4 g/kg, and  72%  of  subjects  with  CIDP  would  have  Ctrough  concentrations  above  the  EC50  after  receiving IgPro20 at a weekly SC dose of 0.2 g/kg. Only 4% of the patients would achieve Ctrough above the EC80 (8.1 g/L) in the 0.2 g/kg group, but 44% of the patients that have been dosed with 0.4 g/kg SC.

Analogously, a higher probability (86%) of having a stable of decreased Total INCAT score is expected for the 0.4 g/kg SC dose of IgPro20 as a result of the higher IgG trough concentrations obtained relative to the low SC dose of IgPro20 (81%) and the IV dose of IgPro10.

In conclusion, as diagnostic plots regarding the population PK as well as for the PK-PD model indicate that precise quantitative predictions based on these models might be biased, nevertheless, data and model indicate a relationship between dose/exposure and efficacy that is in favour of the 0.4 g/kg SC dosing regimen.

<!-- image -->

Deterioration : A clinically meaningful deterioration is defined as a total INCAT disability score increase by≥1 point, I-RODS deterioration by≥4 points (using the centile metric), or a mean grip strength deterioration by≥8 kiloPascal (kPa) in one hand using the handheld vigorimeter.

Restabilisation: Only patients whose INCAT total score improves to at least the INCAT total score recorded at the screening visit (i.e., ≥ INCAT score at screening) and who maintain a stable INCAT total score at weeks 7 and 10 (or at weeks 10 and 13) are eligible for randomization.

Relapse: Relapse is defined as an increase of ≥ 1 point in adjusted INCAT score compared with Baseline (for full definition see 1° endpoint).

## Treatments

IVIG during pre-study/screening: Subjects received their last IVIG during Pre-study / Screening (before amendment 3) or after Screening eligibility determination (after amendment 3) before the start of the IVIG Withdrawal Period. Subjects received their regular / required non-study IVIG. Any locally available IVIG was used. The dosage was the same dosage the subject usually received or the dose the subject required by judgment of the Treating Physician.

IVIG withdrawal period: No IVIG was administered during the IVIG Withdrawal Period (for other medication see 'Concomitant Medication' below).

IgPro10 during IgPro10 restabilization period: Eligible subjects were treated with the IVIG product IgPro10, administered as follows:

- 1 loading dose of 2 g/kg bw, administered over 2 to 5 consecutive days (in Japan: dose was given over 5 days), with a maximum of 1 g/kg bw on a single day, followed by
- 3  or  4  maintenance  doses  (depending  on  the time  needed  for  restabilization)  of  1  g/kg  bw  given every 3 weeks over 1 or 2 consecutive days. Maintenance treatment was given at Weeks 4, 7, and 10 (and Week 13, if needed).

Subjects  who  did  not  achieve  CIDP  stability  (i.e.  CIDP  status  did  not  show  a  clinically  meaningful difference  during  the  last  2  visits.  In  addition,  to  be  considered  CIDP  stable,  the  CIDP  status  had  to recover back to at least the status at Screening, as assessed by adjusted INCAT score) during the last 2 visits (either Weeks 7 and 10 or Weeks 10 and 13) were discontinued and not randomized.

SC treatment period with IgPro20 or placebo: The SC treatment dose with IgPro20 or placebo was based on body weight, and eligible subjects were randomized to weekly SC infusions for 24 weeks to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups:

- IgPro20 at 0.2 g/kg bw.
- IgPro20 at 0.4 g/kg bw.
- Placebo (2% human albumin solution).

The dose was administered once a week in 2 infusion sessions conducted on 1 or 2 consecutive day(s).

Rescue medication with IgPro10: Subjects who experienced CIDP relapse (i.e. an increase of ≥ 1 point in adjusted  INCAT  score  compared  to  Baseline)  during  the  SC  Treatment  Period  were  withdrawn  from further  SC  treatment  and  were  offered  IgPro10  as  rescue  treatment  within  1  week  of  CIDP  relapse determination. Before any rescue therapy was administered, all assessments were performed. Rescue treatment with IgPro10 included:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 1 loading dose of 2 g/kg bw, administered over 2 to 5 consecutive days (in Japan: dose was given over 5 days), with a maximum of 1 g/kg bw on a single day, followed by:
- A maximum of 4 maintenance doses of 1 g/kg bw given every 3 weeks over 1 or 2 consecutive days, depending on the time needed to return to Baseline INCAT score.

INCAT score was assessed before the subsequent IgPro10 maintenance dose. If the INCAT score had improved (i.e., the INCAT score returned back to or below the Baseline score), IgPro10 was administered and Completion Visit tasks were performed.

If INCAT score had not improved, another maintenance dose was administered and INCAT was assessed according to above-mentioned procedure at the next visit scheduled 3 weeks later.

If  INCAT  score  had  not  improved  after  4  maintenance  doses  of  IgPro10,  Completion  Visit  tasks  were performed and further treatment was at the discretion of the Treating Physician.

Concomitant medication: Concomitant CIDP treatments eg, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate corticosteroids (maintenance dose ≤ 20 mg), topical and inhaled corticosteroids, or topical immunosuppressants were permitted, provided that their dose and frequency were kept stable during the whole study and were stable during the 3 months before enrolment.

## Objectives

## Primary objective

To determine the efficacy of 2 different doses of IgPro20 (0.2 g/kg bw and 0.4 g/kg bw) in the maintenance treatment of CIDP in comparison to placebo.

## Secondary objectives

- To investigate the efficacy of IgPro20 with additional clinical outcome measures in comparison to placebo.
- To investigate the safety and tolerability of IgPro20 in comparison to placebo.
- To investigate the safety and efficacy of IgPro10 restabilization therapy.
- To investigate the safety and efficacy of IgPro10 rescue therapy.

## Exploratory objectives

- To investigate health-related quality of life (HRQL) following treatment with IgPro20.
- To investigate exploratory safety and efficacy endpoints.
- To investigate serum IgG concentrations.
- To investigate the effect of IgPro20 on electrophysiology parameters.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Endpoint

The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects who had CIDP relapse during the SC Treatment Period or were withdrawn from SC treatment for any reason.

CIDP relapse was defined as follows:

An increase of ≥ 1 point in adjusted INCAT score compared with Baseline, excluding an increase in INCAT score of 1 point if this is only due to an increase of the arm score from 0 to 1 (not clinically meaningful worsening) or an unchanged adjusted INCAT score compared with Baseline where the arm score decreased from 1 to 0 (not clinically meaningful improvement) and the leg score increased by 1 point (clinically meaningful worsening).

## Secondary Endpoints

## Efficacy:

- Changes in means during SC Treatment Period between groups in (i) INCAT score, (ii) maximum grip strength (dominant/non-dominant hand), (iii) MRC sum score, and (iv) R-ODS.
- Difference in 'time to CIDP relapse' using a Kaplan-Meier estimation comparing both IgPro20 groups with placebo as well as the 2 IgPro20 groups pair-wise.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety:

- Rate of AEs per infusion during the SC Treatment Period, grouped by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).
- Number and percentage of subjects with AEs during the SC Treatment Period, grouped by MedDRA, SOC and PT.

Efficacy of IgPro10 and IgPro20 was assessed on the basis of the following variables:

- INCAT score.
- R-ODS score.
- Mean grip strength.
- MRC sum score (8 muscle groups).
- Electrophysiology parameters: distal and proximal latencies, Compound action potential (CMAP) amplitudes, nerve conduction velocities, and conduction block in 3 motor nerves (SC Treatment Period only)

Safety was assessed on the basis of the following variables recorded during the study:

- AEs.
- Laboratory safety parameters (haematology and serum chemistry).
- Vital signs.
- Physical examination.
- 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (Japan only)

## Sample size

Pre-randomization IVIG withdrawal period: 245 subjects

IgPro10 restabilization period: 207 subjects

Post-randomization SC treatment period: randomized to IgPro20 / placebo: 172 subjects

Completed: 96 subjects

ITTS and SDS: 172 subjects

110 male, 62 female

Age: 56.70 (24.7 to 82.7) years

IgPro10 Rescue Period: 60 subjects

## Randomisation

During  the  double-blind  SC  treatment  period,  randomization  to  0.2  g/kg  bw  IgPro20,  0.4  g/kg  bw IgPro20,  or  placebo  was  controlled  centrally  by  the  Interactive  Voice  Response  System  (IVRS)  / Interactive  Web  Response System (IWRS). Randomization was stratified by region (Japan versus nonJapan) to ensure that the treatments were evenly distributed among the subgroup of Japanese patients.

## Blinding (masking)

All subjects and study personnel were blinded to IgPro20/placebo treatment. Standard measures were taken for the 2 doses of IgPro20 and placebo to ensure adequate blinding of the investigational product. In addition, the investigators and subjects were blinded to the randomized treatment assignment. In addition, the blind was preserved by administration of the same volume for all 3 treatment groups (subjects randomized to 0.2 g/kg bw IgPro20 received 1 session of IgPro20 and 1 session of placebo, randomly selected, each week.) To minimize potential unblinding, a 2-physician approach (Treating Physician / Evaluating Physician) was used. The results of immunoglobulin concentration assessments remained blinded until post-database lock. For the planned interim analysis and ongoing risk-benefit evaluations, members of the IDMC were unblinded. Access to study documents containing information on IgG concentrations and treatment groups was restricted to ensure that no person involved in operations, analysis, or management of the study was unblinded.

## Statistical methods

Study IgPro20\\_3003 is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study. The study  has  three  arms;  a  low-dose,  a  high-dose,  and  a  placebo  arm  with  57,  58,  and  57  subjects randomized respectively (planned with the sample size calculation according to study protocol were 58 subjects each).

The study was powered to demonstrate that at least the high dose of IgPro20 is superior to placebo with regard to the primary efficacy endpoint.

A monotonic dose-response was expected for the primary endpoint, with placebo ≥ IgPro20 low dose ≥ IgPro20 high dose and with at least 1 strict inequality among the 2 non-strict inequalities. This means that if the null hypothesis was rejected, the primary efficacy endpoint would have a statistically significant higher result for placebo than for at least 1 of the investigated doses.

Based on the (recalculated) results from the ICE study extension period [Hughes et al, 2008; Hughes, 2009], it was assumed that the percentages of subjects who would relapse during SC treatment were 35% for the IgPro20 high dose, 52% for the IgPro20 low dose, and 65% for placebo. Further it was assumed that 60% of subjects were randomized under protocol amendment 3 or later.

The  proportion  of  IVIG-independent  subjects  included  in  the  study  was  assumed  to  be  15%.  It  was further assumed that these subjects would have a relapse rate of 10% regardless of the treatment. A discontinuation rate of 15% due to other reasons than CIDP relapse in the placebo group and 10% in the IgPro20 treatment groups after implementation of amendment 3 was included in the calculation of the relapse rates.

The exact CA trend test with equally spaced scores was used for the purpose of sample size calculation. With a 1-sided significance level of 2.5%, a sample size of 58 was needed in each treatment group to achieve a power of approximately 90% in the ITT analysis based on the above assumptions. Thus, the overall planned sample size was 174 subjects treated either with IgPro20 or placebo. Approximately 350 subjects  were  planned  to  be  enrolled  to  ensure  that  174  subjects  would  be  treated  with  IgPro20  or placebo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Recruitment

A  total  of  172  subjects  were  randomized  and  started  treatment  with  IgPro20  /  placebo  in  the  SC Treatment Period of the Post-randomization Phase. A total of 57 subjects received placebo; of these, 36 subjects  were  withdrawn  (CIDP  relapse:  32  subjects,  withdrawal  by  subject:  3  subjects,  physician decision:  1  subject).  A  total  of  57  subjects  received  0.2  g/kg  bw  IgPro20;  of  these,  21  subjects  were withdrawn (CIDP relapse: 18 subjects, withdrawal by subject: 2 subjects, adverse event [AE]: 1 subject). A total of 58 subjects received 0.4 g/kg bw IgPro20; of these, 19 subjects were withdrawn (CIDP relapse: 10 subjects, withdrawal by subject: 8 subjects, AE: 1 subject). The demographic and primary disease characteristics of the ITTS were balanced across the treatment groups, except for sex: there were more male subjects in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group (42 subjects [73.7%]) than in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group (31 subjects [53.4%]). In the placebo group, 37 subjects (64.9%) were male. All subjects received prior treatment  with  immunoglobulins  before  enrolment.  There  was  no  dose-related  pattern  in  the  use  of concomitant medication.

Applicable toJapan only: Safety follow-up telephone call 4 weeks after last SC treatment Was onlyrequired if the subject didn't roll over into the safety extension study,IgPr020_3004. |                                                                                                                                                                        |

The following two important changes were implemented:

(1)  The  IVIg  withdrawal  phase  was  modified  to  an  IgG  dependency  test  and  additional  deterioration criteria  were  implemented  as  described  above.  Fulfillment  on  one  of  these  criteria,  in  the  event  of  an unchanged INCAT score, qualified the patient to move to the next study phase (Amendment 3). Relapse rates in the IgPro20 groups were anticipated to increase after this change due to the fact that significant decrease  in  grip  strength  (i.e.,  8-point  deterioration)  is  not  always  accompanied  by  a  corresponding worsening  in  adjusted  INCAT  score  by  1  point.  To  correct  for  the  new  assumptions  for  relapse percentages underlying the power calculation, the sample size was increased from 150 to 174, and the screening  numbers  were  increased  from  250  to  350.  The  underlying  assumptions  were  that  90  %  of subjects would be recruited after Amendment 3 and the dropout rates for placebo subjects would increase to 15 % (while being around 10 % in the active treatment groups).

(2)  The  length  of  time  required  for  prestudy  IVIg  has  been  reduced  to  8  weeks.  The  change  in  this requirement  is  not  expected  to  adversely  affect  the  outcomes  of  the  SC  treatment  period  because  all patients must show IgG dependency (up to 12 weeks) and IVIg restabilization (up to 13 weeks) before randomization and start of SC treatment.

INCAT score at Screening for the Igpro10 Restabilization Period and at Baseline for the SC Treatment Period.

In  the  PSDS, the median time since CIDP diagnosis was 3.0 years (0.1 to 33.5 years). A total of 185 subjects (89.4%) had a definite CIDP diagnosis per the EFNS / PNS diagnostic criteria. The mean (SD) INCAT score at Screening was 2.7 (1.67) points. The minimum (0 points) and maximum (8 points) INCAT scores show that subjects were affected by the disease to very different degrees. The ITTS and the RSDS had  similar  primary  disease  characteristics  as  the  PSDS.  The  primary  disease  characteristics  were balanced across treatment groups in the ITTS. In the PSDS, the most frequent SOC recorded in medical history was Vascular Disorders (94 subjects, 45.4%), followed by Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (78 subjects, 37.7%) and Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders (72 subjects, 34.8%). The most frequent PT recorded in medical history was Hypertension (85 subjects, 41.1%), followed by Hypercholesterolaemia (25 subjects, 12.1%).

Prior  Treatment  With  Immunoglobulins: All  subjects  in  the  PSDS  received  prior  treatment  with immunoglobulins before enrollment. A total of 56 subjects (27.1%) in the PSDS received at least 1 dose of Privigen before enrollment. The mean (SD) IVIG dose in the 3 months before Screening in the PSDS was 2.6 (1.52) g/kg bw. A similar result was observed for the ITTS, the mean IVIG dose was balanced across the treatment groups.

Prior  Medication  for  CIDP  (Excluding  Treatment  With  Immunoglobulins): During  the  IVIG  Withdrawal Period,  21  (10.1%)  of  the  subjects  in  the  PSDS  received  Glucocorticoids  and  24  (11.6%)  subjects received Other Analgesics and Antipyretics that were reported as CIDP medication. A small proportion of subjects (10 subjects, 4.8%) in the PSDS received prior medication, mainly Glucocorticoids (6 subjects, 2.9%), for CIDP other than IgG within a maximum of 6 months before enrollment. Prior medication was not analyzed for the ITTS.

Prior  Medication  (Excluding  Treatment  of  CIDP): The  most  frequently  used  medications  in  the  PSDS during the IVIG Withdrawal Period were Proton Pump Inhibitors (43 subjects, 20.8%), ACE Inhibitors (33 subjects,  15.9%),  and  3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme  A  (HMG  CoA)  Reductase  Inhibitors  (30 subjects, 14.5%). The most frequently used prior medications in the PSDS were Proton Pump Inhibitors (5 subjects, 2.4%) and Contact Laxatives (3 subjects, 1.4%). Prior medication was not analyzed for the ITTS.

## Numbers analysed

A  total  of  172  subjects  were  randomized  and  started  treatment  with  IgPro20  /  placebo  in  the  SC Treatment Period of the Post-randomization Phase. A total of 57 subjects received placebo; of these, 36

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects  were  withdrawn  (CIDP  relapse:  32  subjects,  withdrawal  by  subject:  3  subjects,  physician decision:  1  subject).  A  total  of  57  subjects  received  0.2  g/kg  bw  IgPro20;  of  these,  21  subjects  were withdrawn (CIDP relapse: 18 subjects, withdrawal by subject: 2 subjects, adverse event [AE]: 1 subject). A total of 58 subjects received 0.4 g/kg bw IgPro20; of these, 19 subjects were withdrawn (CIDP relapse: 10 subjects, withdrawal by subject: 8 subjects, AE: 1 subject).

## Outcomes and estimation

Efficacy results are given on the ITTS group. The per-protocol analyses of the efficacy data supported the overall efficacy results obtained from the ITTS. Study 3003 was considered successful if a superiority of at least 1 dose of IgPro20 over placebo was shown.

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint

## CIDP relapse

During the 24-week post-randomisation period the relapse rate (increase of ≥ 1 point in adjusted INCAT score compared with baseline) for both IgPro20 doses (0.2 g/kg bw and 0.4 g/kg bw) showed superiority over placebo. A statistically significant lower percentage of subjects treated with IgPro20 (32.8% for the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group and 38.6% for 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group) had CIDP relapse or were withdrawn for other  reasons  compared  with  subjects  treated  with  placebo  (63.2%).  The  absolute  risk  reduction  was 24.6% for the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group and 30.4% for the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group compared with placebo.

Sensitivity analyses A - C were performed as described:

- B = 'Mixed-case analysis'. Subjects with CIDP relapse (including 4 subjects who received rescue medication without having had CIDP relapse) and subjects who were withdrawn for taking prohibited

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

medication and subjects who were withdrawn due to physician's decision were considered relapsers. All other subjects were considered non-relapsers.

- C = 'Complete-case analysis'. All subjects who were withdrawn for any other reason than CIDP relapse were excluded from the analysis; thus, the population included in this analysis was smaller than that in the primary endpoint analysis.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

## Time to CIDP Relapse (or Withdrawal for any Other Reason)

After  switching  from  the  IgPro10  Restabilization  Period  to  the  randomized  SC  Treatment  Period  with IgPro20 / placebo, subjects in the placebo group had a rapidly increasing probability of CIDP relapse or withdrawal  from  SC  Week  3  onwards.  In  the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group,  the  probability  of  relapse  or withdrawal increased above the level of the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group at SC Week 6 and remained higher until the end of the SC Treatment Period (Figure E 3). In the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group, a gradual increase was observed. At Week 25, the probability of CIDP relapse or withdrawal for any other reason was 0.63 for placebo, 0.39 for 0.2 g/kg IgPro20, and 0.34 for 0.4 g/kg IgPro20.

- Censored: Subjects who neither relapsed nor withdrew for any other reason were censored at the date of their Completion Visit.

## Time to CIDP Relapse

The probability of CIDP relapse alone increased in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group above the level of the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group at SC Week 4 and remained higher until the end of the SC Treatment Period (Figure E 4). At Week 25, the probability of CIDP relapse was 0.59 for placebo, 0.35 for 0.2 g/kg IgPro20, and 0.22 for 0.4 g/kg IgPro20.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## INCAT score

Subjects in the placebo group deteriorated and subjects in both IgPro20 dose groups remained stable in INCAT score during the SC Treatment Period. The median (range) change from Baseline at the Last Postdose Observation was 1.0 (-1 to 4) points in the placebo group, 0.0 (-2 to 5) points in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group, and 0.0 (-2 to 3) points in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group.

## R-ODS Centile Score

The R-ODS centile score is a 24-item questionnaire assessing activity and social participation. Subjects in the placebo group and in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group deteriorated and subjects in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group  remained  stable  in  R-ODS  centile  score  during  the  SC  Treatment  Period.  In  the  placebo  group, subjects deteriorated from Baseline in all but 7 of the 24 items reflecting activities and social participation compared with the IgPro20 dose groups, in which subjects were stable in all but 1 item ('take a shower' for the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group).

## Ancillary analyses

## Subgroup analyses

Subgroup analyses were performed for sex, age group, region and steroid/immunosuppressant usage. With regard to sex, more male subjects were included in study IgPro20\\_3003. Randomization for gender was  somewhat  imbalanced.  More  male  subjects  were  included  in  the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group  (42 subjects,  73.7%)  compared  to  the  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20  group  (31  subjects  53.4%).  Table  E  12  lists  the gender-specific results for the primary efficacy endpoint:

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Study  IgPro20\\_3003  was  a  phase  3,  prospective,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebocontrolled, parallel-group, 3-arm study in adult CIDP patients with 2 study phases: a Pre-randomization Phase (consisting of an IVIG Withdrawal Period and an IgPro10 (Privigen) Restabilization Period) and a Post-randomization  Phase  (consisting  of  a  randomized  placebo-controlled  SC  Treatment  Period  with  2 doses of IgPro20 (Hizentra) and an IgPro10 Rescue Period). The study is in compliance with the preceding initial and follow-up scientific advice.

Of 276 subjects screened, 172 were randomized to IgPro20/placebo, 96 subjects completed the study. Subjects  were  mostly  withdrawn  due  to  no  CIDP  deterioration  during  Withdrawal  Period  (n=28),  no restabilization  during  IgPro10  Restabilization  Period  (n=22)  or  CIDP  relapse  during  Post-randomization Phase (n=60). In total, there were 28 withdrawals by the subject concerned and 3 withdrawals due to physician decision. During the Pre-randomization Phase 4 subjects and during Post-randomization Phase 2 subjects were withdrawn due to adverse events. Protocol violations were recorded for 2 subjects during Pre-randomization phase which led to subject withdrawal.

The demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced across the 3 treatment groups in the ITTS, except for sex: there were more male subjects in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group (42 subjects, 73.7%) than in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group (31 subjects 53.4%).

The primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of CIDP relapse or withdrawal for any other reason; relapse was defined as an increase of ≥ 1 point in adjusted INCAT score compared to baseline. The higher SC dose of IgPro20 investigated in Study 3003 (0.4 g/kg bw) prevented CIDP relapse or withdrawal for any other reason in 67% of subjects, and the lower dose (0.2 g/kg bw) prevented relapse in 61% of subjects, whereas only 37% of subjects on placebo remained relapse-free.

In  general,  analysis  of  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  (time  to  CIDP  relapse,  INCAT  score,  R-ODS score,  mean  grip  strength,  MRC  sum  score)  and  exploratory  efficacy  endpoints  (electrophysiologic parameters) revealed efficacy of maintenance treatment with IgPro20 and therefore support the primary efficacy endpoint.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

Study IgPro20\\_3003 proved that maintenance treatment with IgPro20 in both dosing groups significantly reduced CIDP relapse rate when compared to placebo (CIDP relapse or withdrawal for any other reason: 63.2% for placebo vs. 38.6% for 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 vs. 32.8% for 0.4 g/kg IgPro20). However, the carryover effect of the preceding IVIG treatment with IgPro10 may have exerted an effect for ~ 10 weeks as seen by the PK data of the placebo group. This would imply that during the post-randomization treatment with  IgPro20  (=24  weeks),  residual  effects  of  the  IgPro10  pre-treatment  cannot  be  excluded.    Thus, results from expansion study IgPro20\\_3004 are important and could offer valuable information on longterm  efficacy.  Therefore  the  company  was  requested  to  provide  these  data  as  soon  as  available.  A restriction if the indication was requested by the CHMP, because of this carry-over effect from IVIG and because SCIG alone or stabilisation with some other therapy haven't been studied. Hizentra is indicated for the treatment of patients with CIDP as maintenance therapy after stabilization with IVIg. In addition, the CHMP also considered that the age range of the CIDP patients for whom Hizentra is indicated should be stated in the indication and this was agreed by the applicant.

No significant difference between the high and low dose of IgPro20 was observed in study IgPro20\\_3003. However, for the primary efficacy endpoint, no statistical analysis comparing the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group with the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group has been provided. The difference in CIDP relapse (excluding withdrawal for any other reason) appears to be high enough to reveal a significant difference and patients could thus have a greater benefit from treatment with 0.4 g/kg IgPro20. This is further supported by the analysis of R-ODS centile score, where the outcome in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group was significantly better compared to  the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group.

CHMP, since both low and high dose (0.2 g/kg and 0.4 g/kg) will be made available to patients and the treatment with Hizentra will be adjusted in each patient according to their individual response.

Although subgroup analysis (gender, age, region [United States, Japan], steroid / immunosuppressant usage)  revealed  no  clinically  relevant  differences  for  the  primary  endpoint,  the  CIDP  relapse  rate  in female subjects on placebo (80%) was much higher compared to male subjects (54%) and treatment with 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 appeared to be more effective in women (26.7% CIDP relapse) compared to men (42.9%  CIDP  relapse)  (see  table  E  12).  Randomization  for  gender  and  dosing  group  is  somewhat imbalanced and may explain some of the differences observed, however, the numbers are too small to actually draw any meaningful conclusions

With  regard  to  the  subgroup  analysis  of  the  elderly  population  (&gt;  65  years),  although  no  significant difference in CIDP relapse or withdrawal for any other reason was apparent comparing treatment with IgPro20 vs. placebo (p=0.066), the same trend is seen for the primary efficacy endpoint of IgPro20 as compared to the total set.

Although any non-head-to-head comparison should be viewed with caution due to differing study designs, patient populations, and concomitant medications etc. a general overview of the efficacy of Ig in CIDP is provided here. IVIG is considered to be established in this indication. From a Cochrane Review analyzing IVIG  treatment  in  CIDP,  8  randomized  controlled  trials  including  332  participants  were  eligible  for evaluation. Five randomized trials prove that intravenous immunoglobulin improves disability more than placebo.  In  the  trials  comparing  IVIg  with  placebo  a  significantly  higher  proportion  of  participants improved in disability within six weeks after the onset of treatment with IVIg compared with placebo, risk ratio (RR) 2.40 (95% CI 1.72 to 3.36) and a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 3.03 (95% CI 2.33 to 4.55). Three other small trials showed no significant difference between intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange, corticosteroids or methylpredisolone. No new trials were  found  for  this  2013  update.  In  this  review,  mild  and  transient  side  effects  were  reported  in approximately half of treated participants; serious side effects were reported in six per cent of the treated participants. This did not differ significantly from plasma exchange or corticosteroids treated participants.

Whether the improvements are equally clinically relevant cannot be deduced from this analysis because each trial used a different disability scale with a unique definition of a significant improvement. Only one study  included  in  this  review  had  a  long-term  follow-up.  These  results  suggest  that  intravenous immunoglobulin improves disability more than placebo over 24 and 48 weeks. The authors conclude that further  research  is  needed  to  compare  the  long-term  benefits  as  well  as  side  effects  of  intravenous immunoglobulin with other treatments.

Study IgPro20\\_3003 was the first randomized, controlled trial evaluating SCIG in CIDP therapy. For this reason,  and  since  this  study  was  designed  to  show  eligibility  for  maintenance  instead  of  primary treatment, comparison to other studies on IVIGs in CIDP is difficult. Due to the restabilization criteria, subjects generally not responding to IVIG treatment have already been excluded. Only stable subjects were  eligible  for  treatment  with  IgPro20  and  study  IgPro20\\_3003  aimed  at  showing  disease  stability instead of improvement. In other studies, e.g. the ICE study or study IgPro10\\_3001, subjects had to be IVIG-free for at least 3 months or a prior IVIG washout was performed.

The primary efficacy endpoint of study IgPro20\\_3003 was CIDP relapse based on the INCAT score, which corresponds to the primary endpoint of other IVIG  studies (e.g. study IgPro10\\_3001 (Privigen) or the ICE-study  (Gamunex)),  which  analyzed  the  responder  rate  based  on  INCAT  score  points.  Secondary efficacy endpoints of study IgPro20\\_3003 (grip strength, time to relapse, MRC sum score) have also been used in other studies on IVIGs in CIDP.

Study IgPro20\\_3003 also analyzed subject's preference for treatment comparing SC to IV treatment. At the Last Post-dose Observation, a larger percentage of subjects preferred current SC treatment over prestudy IV treatment (placebo group: 38.6% versus 24.6%; 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group: 52.6% versus 17.5%; 0.4  g/kg  IgPro20  group:  53.4%  versus  19.0%),  mainly  due  to  feeling  that  SC  treatment  offered participating subjects greater independence.

Overall,  the  efficacy  data  demonstrated  that  IgPro20,  administered  subcutaneously  either  as  low  (0.2 g/kg)  or  high  (0.4  g/kg)  dose  for  maintenance  treatment  of  CIDP,  effectively  prevented  relapse  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

neuromuscular disability and impairment in 61.6% and 67.2% of cases, respectively. Results for CIDP relapse  rate  based  on  the  adjusted  INCAT  score  were  further  supported  by  the  secondary  efficacy outcome measures (time to relapse, INCAT score, R-ODS centile score, mean grip strength, MRC sum score) showing CIDP stability in IgPro20 treated subjects. The beneficial outcomes of study IgPro20\\_3003 therefore justify a transition from IVIG treatment to SCIG treatment in CIDP.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Results for the primary endpoint show a significant lower CIDP relapse rate (ITTS and PPS population) for both 0.2 g/kg and 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 maintenance therapy compared to placebo. These results were also confirmed for three sensitivity analyses performed on ITTS population. Secondary efficacy endpoints of both IgPro20 study arms confirmed the primary endpoint and revealed stable disease for subjects who did not relapse. The originally proposed indication was requested to be amended in order to describe the age group of the treated population (adults, children and adolescents (0-18 years)). The indication was also  narrowed  to  reflect  the  correct  population  suitable  for  treatment,  i.e.  maintenance  therapy  of patients with CIDP already stabilised with IVIg.

With respect to the possible overlapping effect of the preceding IgPro10 treatment it would be beneficial to  present  long-term  efficacy  results  from  the  expansion  study  IgPro20\\_3004  and  the  applicant  was requested to provide these data as soon as possible in the post marketing setting.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

In the post-randomization phase, 57 subjects were administered a total of 1514 infusions with placebo, 57 subjects were administered a total of 2007 infusions with 0.2 g/kg IgPro20, and 58 subjects were administered a total of 2218 infusions with 0.4 g/kg IgPro20. Subjects generally used 4 injections sites (maximum: 9 sites) and infused an average of 20 mL per site (maximum: 50 mL), with an infusion rate of 20 mL/h (maximum: 50 mL/h). The infusion time was approximately 1 hour and the maximum infusion volume was 140 mL per infusion session.

## Adverse events

A total of 21 subjects (36.8%) in the placebo group had 52 AEs, compared with 33 subjects (57.9%) in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group with 158 AEs and 30 subjects (51.7%) in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group with 114 AEs. Most of these AEs were Local Reaction AEs. In the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group, 11 subjects (19.3%) had 54 Local Reaction AEs (1 subject had 30 Local Reaction AEs), and in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group, 17 subjects (29.3%) had 49 Local Reaction AEs (1 subject had 17 Local Reaction AEs). All Local Reaction AEs were either mild (94.5%) or moderate (5.5%) intensity, and the frequency decreased over time. Most AEs reported in the 3 treatment groups were mild or moderate.

b The virtual System Organ Class of Local Reactions included allAEs reported within the MedDRA high level temms \"\"Administration Site Reactions NEC\", \"Infusion Site Reactions\", and \"Injection Site Reactions\".

\"Reported as *related AEs\" in the statistical outputs. Related in this context includes any causally related and / or temporally associated AEs. Causally related AEs are those reported as related to IgPro20 / placebo by the investigator. Temporally associated AEs are those with an onset time between the start of infusion and up to 72 hours after the end of infusion.

A total of 19 subjects (33.3%) had 37 causally related and / or temporally associated AEs in the placebo group,  compared  with  29  subjects  (50.9%)  with  118  events  in  the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group  and  27 subjects  (46.6%) with 95 events in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group. A disproportionately large number of causally related and / or temporally associated AEs were reported in 1 subject in each IgPro20 group. In the IgPro20 dose groups, the rate of causally related and / or temporally associated AEs per infusion was similar for 0.2 g/kg (0.059) and 0.4 g/kg (0.043).

The majority of causally related and / or temporally associated AEs were Local Reaction AEs. A total of 4 subjects (7.0%) had 7 causally related and / or temporally associated Local Reaction AEs in the placebo group, compared with 10 subjects (17.5%) with 52 events in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group and 17 subjects (29.3%) with 49 events in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group. Within the 2 IgPro20 dose groups, the rate of causally related and / or temporally associated Local Reaction AEs was similar.

A total of 33 of the 52 causally related and / or temporally associated Local Reaction AEs in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20  group  were  experienced  by  a  single  subject  (subject  3920037-0002),  as  were  17  of  the  49 causally related and / or temporally associated Local Reaction AEs in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Serious adverse event / adverse events of special interest (AESI) / deaths

Three subjects experienced 7 severe AEs that were reported as SAEs:

- Allergic Dermatitis in 1 subject in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group,
- Device Related Infection, Bacterial Infection, and Nonunion Fracture in 1 subject in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group),
- Anaemia, Acute Cholecystitis, and Sepsis in 1 subject in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group.

In the placebo group, 1 subject had 1 SAE; in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group, 3 subjects experienced 5 SAEs (1 was causally related and / or temporally associated: Allergic Dermatitis); and in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group,  2  subjects  experienced  5  SAEs.  The  outcome  of  all  SAEs  was  recovered  /  resolved,  except  2 events  experienced  by  the  same  subject  in  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group,  for  which  the  outcomes  were recovered  /  resolved  with  sequelae  (Subject  2500019-0005,  Device  Related  Infection  and  Nonunion Fracture). Allergic Dermatitis was the only related SAE that occurred during treatment with IgPro20.

AE = adverse event; SC = subcutaneous; SDS = Safety Data Set

Calculated on the basis of dates only.

Adverse Events of special interest (AESI): The following AEs related to class effects for IgG products were considered as AESIs: Acute Systemic Hypersensitivity Reactions, Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome, Haemolysis, and Thrombotic Events. The only AESI reported during the SC Treatment Period was 1 SAE of  Allergic  Dermatitis.  The  event  was  experienced  by  Subject  2500019-0002  in  the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20 group and was assessed as causally related and / or temporally associated with IgPro20 / placebo. The outcome  was  recovered  /  resolved.  No  subject  experienced  AEs  of  Haemolysis,  Aseptic  Meningitis Syndrome, or Thrombotic Events during the SC Treatment Period.

There were no deaths during the SC Treatment Period with IgPro20.

## Laboratory findings

During the SC Treatment Period, 4 subjects (2.3%) had 5 laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs and potentially related to hemolysis; however, none of these subjects fulfilled the hemolysis criteria.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All  of  these  AEs  were  mild  to  moderate  in  intensity;  the  majority  was  considered  to  be  not  related  to IgPro20 by the investigator and was resolved at the final follow-up. None of these led to discontinuation or changed doses of study product, to any other intervention, or to discontinuation from the study.

At Last Post-dose Observation there was a relevant shift in leukocytes compared to Baseline: 5 subjects (8.6%) had a shift from normal to low in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group, whereas no subjects had a shift from normal to low in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group or in the placebo group.

In group 0.2 g/kg IgPro20, 7 subjects revealed a shift in reticulocytes from normal to high and in group 0.4 g/kg IgPro20, 4 subjects had a shift in reticulocytes from normal to high.

There was also a relevant shift recorded for LDH: overall, 7 subjects had shifts from normal to high; 4 subjects (6.9%) in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group, 2 subjects (3.5%) in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group, and 1 subject (1.8%) in the placebo group.

In group 0.2 g/kg IgPro20, 4 subjects revealed a shift in haptoglobin from normal to high and in group 0.4 g/kg IgPro20, 3 subjects had a shift in haptoglobin from normal to high.

## Safety in special populations

There were no regional effects in the pattern of AEs (US versus non-US and Japan versus non-Japan. No PT was experienced by &gt; 2 US subjects or &gt; 1 Japanese subject in any treatment group.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

One  subject  in  the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group  experienced  1  non-serious,  causally  related  and  /  or temporally  associated  AE  of  Fatigue  that  led  to  withdrawal  of  the  investigational  product  and  subject discontinuation. In the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group, 1 subject experienced 3 events leading to withdrawal of the investigational product and subject discontinuation (anaemia, acute cholecystitis, and sepsis). All 3 events were also serious. None of them were assessed as causally related and / or temporally associated. These 3 SAEs had an outcome of recovered / resolved.

## Post marketing experience

The post-marketing safety profile of Hizentra for the previously approved indications has been characterized during the 7-year post-marketing period. During this period, 38,330,927 g of Hizentra, corresponding to 3,833,093 estimated standard doses of 10 g, were distributed. As of 31 May 2016 (Data Lock Point [DLP] of last periodic report), a worldwide cumulative total of 9277 post-marketing case reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported to CSL Behring's Pharmacovigilance database. Based on these case reports of suspected ADRs and the class effects of Hizentra, the identified risks of Hizentra have been established as local reactions including ulceration-like infusion site reactions (UL-ISRs), anaphylactic reactions, aseptic meningitis syndrome, and thromboembolic events. The potential risks of Hizentra are increased or unknown risks in the home-based SC (self-) administration, exacerbation of existing hyperprolinemia (product specific), hemolysis, and transmission of infectious agents.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety profile of IgPro20 in maintenance treatment of CIDP was evaluated in 57 subjects treated with 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 and 58 subjects treated with 0.4 g/kg IgPro20. 57 subjects were administered a total of 2007 infusions with 0.2 g/kg IgPro20, and 58 subjects were administered a total of 2218 infusions with 0.4 g/kg IgPro20, whereby 33 subjects (58%) experienced at least 1 AE in the 0.2 g /kg IgPro20 group and  30  subjects  (52%)  experienced  at  least  1  AE  in  the  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20  group.  AEs  were  causally related to study drug in 17 subjects (30%, 0.2 g/kg IgPro20) and 20 subjects (34.5% 0.4 g/kg IgPro20).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Temporally associated AEs (within 72 hours) were observed in 29 subjects (51%, 0.2 g/kg IgPro20) and 25 subjects (43%, 0.4 g/kg IgPro20). Based on the amount of infusions administered, the overall AE rate per infusion was 0.079 (0.2 g/kg IgPro20) and 0.051 (0.4 g/kg IgPro20), the rate of causally related AEs per  infusion  was  0.035  (0.2  g/kg  IgPro20)  and  0.029  (0.4  g/kg  IgPro20)  and  the  rate  of  temporally associated AEs per infusion was 0.057 (0.2 g/kg IgPro20) and 0.040 (0.4 g/kg IgPro20).

Causally related and/or temporally associated AEs experienced by ≥ 5% of subjects were local reactions, headache, fatigue, nasopharyngitis and 1 urinary tract infection. Almost all AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. The laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs were mild to moderate in intensity; the majority was considered to be not related or unlikely related to study drug, and were resolved at the final followup. There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs or physical examinations.

No  deaths  occurred  in  this  study.  In  the  0.2  g/kg  IgPro20  group,  3  subjects  experienced  5  SAEs.  Of these,  1  was  causally  related  and  /  or  temporally  associated  to  IgPro20  (Allergic  Dermatitis),  4  were considered not related (infection of arthrodesis material in the right ankle, nonunion of fracture in the right  foot,  bacteriological  infection  in  the  right  ankle,  arthralgia).  In  the  0.4  g/kg  IgPro20  group,  2 subjects had 5 SAEs. None of them were considered related to the study drug (2x Acute Cholecystitis, anaemia, sepsis, arthropathy). Except for the nonunion of the fracture in the right foot (resolved with sequelae), all SAEs were recovered/resolved.

In  total,  2  subjects  had  AEs  leading  to  study  discontinuation;  1  subject  with  1  event  in  the  0.2  g/kg IgPro20 group, and 1 subject with 4 events in the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group.

The only AESI reported during the SC treatment period was 1 event of allergic dermatitis. There was no hemolysis, aseptic meningitis syndrome, or thrombotic events during the SC Treatment Period.

Safety data indicate that both low and high dose IgPro20 were safe and reasonably well tolerated when administered s.c. as maintenance treatment to subjects with CIDP.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## 3.1. Favourable effects

Results of the main clinical study show a significant lower CIDP relapse rate (ITTS population) for both active arms compared to placebo (32.8% for 0.4 g/kg IgPro20, 38.6% for 0.2 g/kg IgPro20, and 63.2% for placebo). These results were also confirmed for the PPS population and three sensitivity analyses performed on ITTS population. Positive differences between active arms and placebo could also be demonstrated for the SC treatment phase for secondary endpoints 'Time to CIDP relapse', 'INCAT Score', 'R-ODS Centile Score' (Questionnaire), 'mean grip strength', and 'MRC Sum Score'.

Study IgPro20\\_3003 also showed that a larger percentage of subjects preferred SC treatment over IV treatment because SC treatment offered greater independence.

## 3.2. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

Long-term beneficial effects of maintenance treatment with IgPro20 are not foreseen yet, especially when considering  the  overlapping  effects  of  prior  IVIG  treatment.  In  the  placebo  group  IgG  Ctrough  values decline after approx. Week 10. Thus, the carry-over effect of IVIG to IgPro 20 could also be estimated to last this length of time. Thus, results from expansion study IgPro20\\_3004 are important and could offer valuable long-term data. Therefore the company is requested to provide these data as soon as possible.

Since the study did not investigate the paediatric population, there is some uncertainty as to the extent of beneficial  effects  of  s.c.  treatment  with  IgPro20  in  maintenance  treatment  of  children  with  CIDP. Nevertheless, the extrapolation to the paediatric population was accepted by the CHMP and Hizentra is indicated also in children and adolescents.

The CIDP relapse rate (excluding withdrawal for any other reason) appears to be lower in subjects treated with 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 vs. 0.2 g/kg IgPro20.

Study  IgPro20\\_3003  did  not  include  enough  subjects  for  showing  beneficial  effects  in  the  elderly population (&gt; 65 years), however, a comparable beneficial outcome as observed in the age group 18 - 65 years might have become apparent if more subjects &gt; 65 years had been included in the study.

## 3.3. Unfavourable effects

The unfavourable effects of IgPro20 seen in the study mainly include local reactions (most frequent), fatigue and headache. The overall frequency of AEs was low (36.8% of placebo subjects, 57.9% of subjects on 0.2 g/kg, and 51.7% of subjects on 0.4 g/kg), with very few systemic AEs. Most AEs reported in the 3 treatment groups were mild or moderate. The only AESI reported during the SC treatment period was 1 event of allergic dermatitis. There were no proven cases of haemolysis, aseptic meningitis syndrome, or thrombotic events during the s.c. treatment period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3.4. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

During the s.c. treatment period with IgPro20, 4 subjects in the 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 group and 2 subjects of the 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 group yielded insufficient data to evaluate haemolysis cases. In these subjects either baseline data for haemoglobin were missing + at least 1 post-baseline DAT was positive + at least 1 of the criteria B was met or no post-baseline laboratory data were available. Thus, the occurrence of hemolysis cases due to IgPro20 treatment in these patients cannot be entirely ruled out. In addition, the MAH plans to increase the infusion volume and infusion rate of IgPro20. However, based on the sparse data obtained and provided, safety of the increased infusion volume and infusion rate is uncertain and cannot be adequately assessed for acceptability at the present time.

## 3.6. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

## 3.6.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Treatment of both low and high dose IgPro20 led to a significant reduction of CIDP relapse (or withdrawal for any other reason) compared to placebo. CIDP relapse was based on the adjusted INCAT score, which was the basis for calculation of CIDP response rates in various other studies on IVIGs in CIDP. The 10point INCAT score is a globally accepted, validated, and reliable scale of disability. A change of 1 INCAT score point is considered clinically meaningful, (excluding an increase in INCAT score of 1 point if this is only due to an increase of the arm score from 0 to 1 or an unchanged adjusted INCAT score compared with the Reference Visit (IgPro10 Restabilization Period) or to Baseline (SC Treatment Period), where the arm score decreased from 1 to 0 (not clinically meaningful improvement) and the leg score increased by 1 point (clinically meaningful worsening)). Secondary efficacy endpoints analysed in this study also revealed positive differences between both IgPro20 treatment arms and placebo. Thus, s.c. treatment with IgPro20 was shown to be effective in CIDP maintenance treatment.

Marginal uncertainty exists with respect to the overlapping effect of prior IVIG treatment and potential increase of CIDP relapse rates after complete washout of Privigen. With respect to long-term efficacy and safety, results from the extension study IgPro20\\_3004 which enrolled subjects who completed Study 3003 or were successfully rescued from CIDP relapse in Study 3003 could provide further information.

In general, IgPro20 revealed a reasonable safety profile in the maintenance treatment of CIDP. Except for 1 acute systemic hypersensitivity reaction (allergic dermatitis), no other adverse events of special interest (hemolysis, aseptic meningitis, thrombotic events) occurred during the study. However, there is uncertainty with regard to haemolytic cases, since 6 subjects yielded insufficient data to evaluate hemolysis. The most frequent AEs were local reactions, causally related AEs included headache and fatigue. The majority of AEs was mild to moderate in severity and manageable. There was 1 case of nonserious, causally related and / or temporally associated AE of fatigue that led to subject discontinuation from the study. Overall, the safety profile was rather similar as it is known from other indications and no new safety signals were identified.

## 3.6.2. Balance of benefits and risks

IgPro20\\_3003 analysed SCIG in the maintenance treatment of CIDP and showed a clinically and statistically relevant reduction in CIDP relapse rate based on the adjusted INCAT score. The safety profile of IgPro20 was consistent with that previously reported. The benefit-risk balance is positive.

The difference in  CIDP  relapse  comparing  both  high  and  low  dose  IgPro20  with  placebo  is  statistically significant  and  clinically  relevant.  Since  only  IVIG-stabilized  subjects  were  included,  the  extension  of indication  solely  affects  maintenance  treatment  of  CIDP  after  prior  IVIG  treatment.  Results  from secondary  endpoints  are  generally  consistent  with  the  primary  endpoint.  The  acceptable  safety  profile also indicates a positive benefit-risk balance.

## 3.7. Conclusions

The overall B/R of Hizentra is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of indication to include immunomodulatory therapy in adults, children and adolescents (0-18 years), for the treatment of patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) as maintenance therapy after stabilization with IVIg; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. Section 4.7 of the SmPC was updated to bring it in line with the latest QRD template. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The RMP is updated (finally agreed version 4.2).

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).
