## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Tolvaptan is a vasopressin receptor antagonist and was approved in 2015 for the orphan indication: treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Of note, tolvaptan tablets 15 and 30 mg also have a separate MA under a different brand name (Samsca, EU/1/09/539/001-004) authorised on 3 August 2009 for the treatment of adult patients with hyponatraemia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion .

The pivotal trial in ADPKD [TEMPO 3:4] was a 3 year randomised, placebo controlled trial comparing longterm safety and efficacy of oral split dose tolvaptan regimens (titrated between 60 mg/day and 120

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mg/day) to placebo, in 1445 adults with ADPKD.  The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term efficacy using change in total kidney volume (TKV). The rate of TKV increase over 3 years was significantly less for tolvaptan-treated subjects than for subjects receiving placebo: 2.80% per year vs 5.51% per year, respectively.  The key secondary composite endpoint (ADPKD progression) was time to multiple clinical progression events of:

- worsening kidney function - defined as a persistent [reproduced over at least 2 weeks] 25% reduction in reciprocal serum creatinine during treatment [from end of titration to last on-drug visit]
- medically significant kidney pain - defined as requiring prescribed leave, last-resort analgesics, narcotic and anti-nociceptive, radiologic or surgical interventions
- worsening hypertension
- worsening albuminuria.

The relative rate of ADPKD-related events was decreased by 13.5% in tolvaptan-treated patients, (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97; p=0.0095). The result of the key secondary composite endpoint was primarily attributed to effects on worsening kidney function and medically significant kidney pain. The renal function events were 61.4% less likely for tolvaptan compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.57; nominal p=0.007). In contrast, there was no effect of tolvaptan on either progression of hypertension or albuminuria. The efficacy assessment and extrapolation to long term outcomes was largely based on the surrogate parameter TKV.  Furthermore, the study population in the pivotal trial had a relatively large renal volume consistent with rapid cystic growth, but at least 50% preservation of renal function.

Patients with early, but rapidly progressive disease, were hoped to benefit from therapy and to have a prognosis for observable changes or outcomes during a 3-year trial. More extensive long term data and data on patients in later stages of the disease were therefore needed to confirm efficacy assumption based on hard clinical outcomes. This was reflected in two post-authorisation efficacy studies at the time of Jinarc's approval.

The first was study 156-08-271 [TEMPO 4:4], which was assessed in procedure EMEA/H/C/002788/II/0006. This 2 year open-label extension to the pivotal trial [total of 5 years] showed tolvaptan continued to have an effect on the rate of  renal function decline over several more years. Longer term data are not currently available to show whether long-term therapy with tolvaptan continues to slow the rate of renal function decline and affect clinical outcomes of ADPKD, including delay in the onset of end-stage renal disease.

The second post-marketing commitment aimed to further define the efficacy of tolvaptan in patients with more advanced renal dysfunction, on a primary endpoint related to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) rather than TKV.  The company was required to submit the final report of study 156-13-210 by February 2018. This is the subject of the current variation assessment.  The results have been published [Torres et al, N Engl J Med 2017; 377:1930-1942, REPRISE study].

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Main study

## Title of Study

Clinical trial 156-13-210: Phase 3b, Multi-centre, Randomized-withdrawal, Placebo-controlled, Doubleblind, Parallel-group Trial to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Tolvaptan (45 to 120 mg/day, Split-dose) in Subjects with Chronic Kidney Disease Between Late Stage 2 to Early Stage 4 Due to Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.

## Methods

The design and objectives of study 156-13-21- were noted already during the initial MAA for Jinarc. The study was a Phase 3b, multi-centre, randomized-withdrawal, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallelgroup trial to compare the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan (45 to 120 mg/day, Split-dose) in subjects with chronic kidney disease between late stage 2 to early stage 4 due to ADPKD. The trial employed a pre-randomization phase comprising placebo run-in, tolvaptan treatment titration, and tolvaptan run-in periods. The titration and run-in periods were designed to test tolerability, exclude subjects unlikely to tolerate tolvaptan's aquaretic effects prior to the randomization period, minimize post-randomization withdrawal, and enrich the trial population with patients who might benefit from long-term treatment. The placebo run-in period was used to establish a pre-randomization baseline of eGFR for each treatment assignment and facilitate straightforward calculation of eGFR slope for all subjects, the key secondary endpoint. After randomisation there was a 1 year double-blind treatment phase, with subjects then

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

eligible for an open-label extension phase. Tolvaptan, or matching placebo, was administered at 60/30 or 90/30 mg, as split doses, with down-titrations to 45/15 and 30/15 mg as needed for tolerability

## Study participants

Subjects were required to meet the following inclusion criteria:

1. Male and female subjects 18 to 55 years of age (inclusive) with eGFR between 25 and 65 mL/min/1.73 m 2
2. Male and female subjects 56 to &lt; 66 years of age with eGFR between 25 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with evidence of ADPKD progression, i.e., eGFR decline of &gt; 2.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2  /year, based on historical eGFR data and medical monitor discretion
3. Male and female subjects who were tolvaptan naïve
4. Diagnosis of ADPKD by modified Pei-Ravine criteria

Exclusion criteria included the need for chronic diuretic use, hepatic impairment or liver function abnormalities other than that expected for ADPKD, advanced diabetes and subjects with additional significant renal disease not due to ADPKD.

## Treatments

See above, section Methods.

## Objectives

This trial was conducted to extend the understanding of the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan treatment in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) subjects with late Stage 2 to early Stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Focusing on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by the CKD-Epidemiology (CKD EPI) formula (hereafter referred to as 'eGFR'), this trial was expected to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

provide kidney function data that were complementary to the data demonstrating the benefits previously observed primarily in ADPKD subjects with earlier stages of disease.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary objective was the treatment difference in the change of eGFR, as calculated using Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) formula, from pre-treatment baseline to post-treatment followup, divided by each subject's trial duration. The pre and post treatment eGFR results were each calculated from the mean of 3 serum creatinine measurements. The secondary efficacy endpoint was the treatment difference in annualized slope of eGFR calculated for individual subjects using eGFR data observed in the placebo run-in, tolvaptan run-in (not including tolvaptan titration), double-blind treatment, and post-treatment follow-up (not including data collected in the first week after the last IMP dose) periods.

## Sample size

Based on a Mixed Model Repeated Measurements analysis of the non-Japanese CKD stage 3 subjects from trial 156-04-251, the treatment difference in renal function at Month 12 was 1.07. Expected intrasubject variance was 14.2 and inter-subject variance 28.05 at Month 12. With 3 repeated measures at pre-treatment baseline and post-treatment follow-up, respectively, the power calculation estimated that, for a 2-sided alpha set at 0.05 for a power of 90%, and with an assumption of 10% dropout rate in the trial, a total sample size of approximately 1300 subjects was needed.

## Randomisation

Randomization was 1:1, tolvaptan to placebo, and utilised an interactive voice response system to ensure appropriate stratification. Subjects were be stratified by their baseline eGFR at a threshold of ≤ 45 or &gt; 45 mL/min/1.73m2 and by age ( ≤ 55 or &gt; 55 years old). Subjects were also stratified by three TKV criteria ( ≤ 2000 mL, &gt; 2000 mL, or unknown).

## Blinding (masking)

Placebo was administered in a form identical to the corresponding dose of tolvaptan tablets.  Following the screening period, there followed a placebo run-in period (1 week), a tolvaptan titration period (2 weeks), and a tolvaptan run-in period (3 weeks). Subjects were aware they would receive placebo or active treatment during the treatment phase, but they would not know which. The subjects were not told that there was a separate run-in phase and randomization phase, and were not told when formal randomization would occur.

## Statistical methods

The end points of the trial were ordered hierarchically and tested sequentially with gatekeeping procedures; if the primary end point was found to be significant, analysis of the secondary end point would be justified. A modified intention-to-treat population or full analysis set was used for the analysis of the primary end point. All patients with any data to inform the primary or secondary end points or safety were included in the modified intention-to-treat and safety populations. The primary end point was analysed by means of a weighted analysis of covariance with trial group and randomization stratification factors as factor and baseline covariates.  The key secondary end point was also assessed in the modified

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

intention-to-treat population and was analysed with the use of a linear mixed-effect model with effects of time (as a continuous variable), trial group, interaction of time and trial group, acute hemodynamic effect, stratification factors at randomization, and baseline covariate (of the primary end point) to fit the estimated GFR data. This trial's estimand was the difference in outcome improvement if all subjects tolerated and adhered to their treatment.   Data missing at random (MAR) was assumed in the primary analysis. A sensitivity analysis was provided to address the concern of data missing not at random (MNAR).

## Recruitment

A total of 2292 subjects were screened. After 2 weeks of screening, 1519 subjects entered the 6-week single-blind pre-randomization phase, and subsequently 1370 subjects were randomized and treated during the 12-month double-blind period. Subjects who were randomized, took IMP up to Month 12 (7/+2 days), and completed some or all of their required trial visits/assessments to the end of the trial treatment completers.'

The difference between groups in time to discontinuation from the IMP was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001). Among the 6.3% of subjects who chose to discontinue the IMP prior to Month 12, the reason was most frequently that the IMP was not tolerable (8.3% in the tolvaptan group; 0.9% in the placebo was most frequently due to hepatic AEs (3.7% in the tolvaptan arm; 0.6% in the placebo arm). In both treatment arms, the percent of subjects lost to follow-up was low (0.1% in the tolvaptan arm; 0.6% in the placebo arm).

(including the Month 12 visit and at least 1 follow-up serum creatinine assessment) were defined as 'OnSubjects who needed to discontinue treatment prior to Day 358 (or never began treatment), and completed some or all of their required trial visits/assessments to the end of the trial (including the Month 12 visit and at least 1 follow-up serum creatinine assessment) were defined as 'Off-treatment completers.' Subjects who were randomized, took IMP (or never began treatment), but did not complete the Month 12 visit and at least 1 end-of-treatment follow-up serum creatinine assessment were defined as 'Non-completers.' The percentage of on-treatment completers (i.e., randomized subjects who received IMP up to Month 12 and completed some or all of their required trial assessments to the end of the trial, including the Month 12 visit and ≥ 1 follow-up serum creatinine assessment) was 84.6% in the tolvaptan arm and 92.7% in the placebo arm. The percentage of 'off-treatment completers' (i.e., randomized subjects who took IMP, but discontinued treatment prior to Day 358 or never began treatment, and completed some or all assessments to the end of the trial, including the Month 12 visit and ≥ 1 follow-up serum creatinine assessment) was 11.1% in the tolvaptan arm and 3.2% in the placebo arm. Based on these data, 96% of patients in both groups were considered to complete the study; approximately 4% in each treatment group were non-completers. group). For the 4.5% of subjects for whom the physician decided to withdraw IMP treatment, the reason

## Conduct of the study

Note that the country-specific amendment for France added the following as an exclusion criterion: Tolvaptan is contraindicated in patients who are known to have hypersensitivity to tolvaptan or 1 of the excipients, are hypovolemic (volume depletion), and cannot perceive thirst. Additionally, subjects with baseline screening abnormalities of serum sodium concentrations (hyponatremia or hypernatremia) could not be enrolled in the trial until these abnormalities resolved, and then the subjects were required to be monitored accordingly.

## Baseline data

Baseline demographics and CKD characteristics are shown in the table below, for the randomised population.  Subjects were most frequently in CKD Stage 3b (45.1%), followed by Stage 3a (30.0%), Stage 4 (19.5%), and Stage 2 (5.2%). The majority of subjects (64.2%) had eGFR (CKD-EPI) ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 . For most subjects (80.4%) the TKV was not known.

Note: CKD stages were defined as follows: Stage 1 =≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m

Stage 2 = 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m; Stage 3a = 45-59 mL/min/1.73 m²;

Stage 3b = 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m²; Stage 4 = 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m². The 3 subjects with CKD

stage of \"unknown were randomized based on their eGFR level (rate blank method).

## Numbers analysed

A total of 2292 subjects were screened. After 2 weeks of screening, 1519 subjects entered the 6-week single-blind pre-randomization phase, and subsequently 1370 subjects were randomized and treated during the 12-month double-blind period.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary efficacy endpoint

The primary efficacy endpoint was the treatment difference in the change of eGFR from pre-treatment baseline to post-treatment follow-up, annualized (divided) by each subject's trial duration. The primary endpoint results demonstrate a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.0001) in favour of tolvaptan of 1.271 mL/min/1.73 m 2  /year (95% CI 0.859 to 1.684).

The LS mean change in eGFR was -2.339 mL/min/1.73 m 2  /year for tolvaptan vs. -3.610 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year for placebo, which corresponds to a difference of ~ 35%

Figure 3 shows the changes in GFR over the 1 year study duration.  As in previous data, there is an initial drop in GFR, presumed to be a haemodynamic effect of the drug, which reverses on drug cessation.

The primary endpoint results according to key subgroups are shown in figure 5 below. The subgroup analysis of the primary endpoints by CKD stage (table 3) demonstrated significant treatment effects for subjects in Stages 3a, 3b, and 4 at baseline - however the result was driven by benefits in those with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

stage 3a disease. Patients who were non-white, aged over 55y or with stage 2 CKD at baseline did not seem to benefit from tolvaptan, although there were small numbers of patients in these subgroups.

A pre-specified subgroup analysis suggested that tolvaptan had less of an effect in patients older than 55 years of age, which correlated with a slower rate of decline of CKD in this subgroup.

## Secondary endpoints

The key secondary endpoint was the linear mixed effect model of annualized eGFR change slope. This showed a statistically significant difference of 1.011 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year (p &lt; 0.0001) in favour of tolvaptan.  The subgroup analysis of the secondary endpoints by CKD stage demonstrated significant treatment effects for subjects in Stages 3a, 3b, and 4 at baseline. The exploratory ANCOVA of the primary endpoint by modal dose showed statistically significant dose-response analysis of modal doses of 60, 90, and 120 mg (with 30 and 45 mg doses pooled to 60 mg due to sample sizes of 1 and 6 respectively) (p = 0.0225 for the dose trend).

## Ancillary analyses

Not applicable.

## Summary of main study

For Trial 156-13-210, statistical significance for both the primary and key secondary endpoints were met at p &lt; 0.05 (p &lt; 0.0001), which provides confirmatory evidence for the efficacy of tolvaptan in slowing renal function decline and extends the understanding of the effects of tolvaptan to later stages of the disease. All pre-specified sensitivity analyses were also positive (all p &lt; 0.0001, except 1 with p = 0.0005). Missing data sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robust treatment effect of tolvaptan in slowing eGFR decline against the data MNAR assumption. Subgroup analysis for the primary endpoint demonstrated consistent treatment effects of tolvaptan for subjects in CKD Stages 2, 3a, 3b, and 4, with the latter 3 subgroups showing p-values ≤ 0.02. Similar results were observed for the key secondary endpoint. For both endpoints, significant treatment effects in favour of tolvaptan were observed across most other subgroup categories; for some subgroup categories (e.g., CKD Stage 2), the non-significant results may be partially attributable to low subject numbers.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The key differences from the previous pivotal trial are the enrolment of subjects with later stages of CKD, and the use of GFR as primary endpoint rather than total kidney volume. For comparison, in the pivotal study the mean pre-titration eGFR was around 80. There are no significant issues with the overall design, conduct and analysis of the trial. The key endpoints have been discussed in previous Jinarc assessments.

Overall, characteristics of patients at baseline were balanced between the two groups. Most patients assigned to the tolvaptan group, and who completed the trial, were taking 90 mg morning and 30 mg afternoon doses daily.

Statistical significance for both the primary and key secondary endpoints were met, according to the applicant's pre-specified analyses.  In the primary endpoint, the LS mean change in eGFR was -2.339 mL/min/1.73 m 2  /year for tolvaptan vs. -3.610 mL/min/1.73 m 2  /year for placebo, which corresponds to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

a decline of ~ 35%. This corresponds to a treatment effect of 1.271 mL/min/1.73 m2 /year (95% CI 0.859 to 1.684, p &lt; 0.0001).  This is very similar to the effect size in the pivotal trial. To put the eGFR results into context, rapid progression of renal impairment is generally defined in CKD as a sustained decline in eGFR of more than 5 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year. Once eGFR decreases below 30 mL/min, there is a progressive impact of complications related to renal impairment. Although primarily dependent on symptoms, the need for renal replacement therapy often occurs in a GFR range between 5 and 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2 . In the trial, the baseline estimated GFR was 41.1 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2  and declined over a 1-year period by 4.17 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2  with placebo. The authors note that if this effect were maintained, the time to chronic kidney disease of stage 5 would be extended from 6.2 years to 9.0 years. Such a delay could buy time for pre-emptive transplant. A larger benefit might be expected if treatment were started earlier, but this assumes that patients would tolerate long-term tolvaptan. The key secondary endpoint was the linear mixed effect model of annualized eGFR change slope. This showed a statistically significant difference of 1.011 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year (p &lt; 0.0001) in favour of tolvaptan.  This endpoint requires modelling assumptions to adjust for the estimated hemodynamic effects of tolvaptan. To minimize withdrawal resulting from adverse drug effects, only patients who had an acceptable burden of side effects from tolvaptan during a pre-randomization period that included sequential placebo and tolvaptan phases underwent randomization. Therefore these results are specifically for a subset of patients who could take the treatment without an unacceptable level of side effects. Despite selection based upon ability to tolerate the drug, the trial still had a 9.5% dropout rate for tolvaptan, and this would be higher in unselected patients. Several approaches were used to account for the impact of missing data. Although the applicant provided sensitivity analyses of the key endpoints giving results that are in line with primary analyses, the sensitivity analysis do not address a treatment policy estimand and these were requested. However, since the primary results are highly statistically significant, the statistical conclusions of the trial are unlikely to alter. The requested analysis generates very similar results to those seen in the original primary analysis, demonstrating the robustness of the trial results to the method of handling missing data. The subgroup analysis of the primary endpoints by CKD stage demonstrated significant treatment effects for subjects in Stages 3a, 3b, and 4 at baseline.  There were 262 patients in the efficacy population with severe CKD (stage 4, eGFR 15- mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) at baseline - in this subgroup- the  LS mean change in eGFR was -3.797 mL/min/1.73 m 2  /year for tolvaptan vs. -4.602 mL/min/1.73 m 2  /year for placebo. Patients over 55 were required to have an estimated GFR of 25 to 44 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2  and historical evidence of a decline in the estimated GFR that exceeded 2.0 ml per minute per 1.73 m 2 per year.  This presumably followed recommendations of the European Renal Association/European Dialysis and Transplant association, which argue against treating patients aged &gt;50 years who still have an eGFR &gt;45 mL/min/1.73 m 2  (CKD stages 1-3a), because these patients have a high probability of slowly progressive disease.  Despite the more stringent entry criteria for older patients, tolvaptan had less of an effect in patients older than 55 years of age, which correlated with a slower rate of decline of CKD in this subgroup. The overall risks versus benefits will need to be carefully considered before starting tolvaptan in patients with late-stage ADPKD. In particular, the speed of ADPKD progression should be weighed against the risk of intolerability and of compliance with monitoring aimed at reducing the risk of hepatic adverse events. However, in selected patients with stage 4 CKD, treatment with tolvaptan would seem to have benefit. The current SmPC already restricts the indication to rapidly progressing disease, and notes that treatment must be initiated and monitored under the supervision of physicians with expertise in managing ADPKD

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and a full understanding of the risks of tolvaptan therapy, including hepatic toxicity and monitoring requirements.

This was a 1 year study, and further the effectiveness of treatment with tolvaptan over the long term remains to be determined. There remains no clinical rationale for the use of tolvaptan in ADPKD patients with end-stage renal failure, and the SmPC states that the treatment should be discontinued if the stage of renal insufficiency progresses to CKD stage 5.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The key differences between the previous pivotal trial and the current one are the enrolment of subjects with later stages of CKD, and the use of GFR as primary endpoint rather than total kidney volume. Statistical significance for both the primary and key secondary endpoints was met, according to the applicant's pre-specified analyses. The LS mean change in eGFR was very similar to the effect size in the pivotal trial, and would be considered clinically relevant.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The pharmacodynamically predictable and most commonly reported adverse reactions are thirst, polyuria, nocturia, and pollakiuria (frequent urination) - with the resulting risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. An increase in serum uric acid is also well documented, and a small reversible reduction in GFR has been observed in ADPKD trials at the initiation of tolvaptan treatment. Furthermore, tolvaptan has been associated with idiosyncratic elevations of blood alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST) with infrequent cases of concomitant elevations in total bilirubin.

In the pivotal ADPKD trial, elevation (&gt; 3 × upper limit of normal [ULN]) of ALT was observed in 4.4 % (42/958) of patients on tolvaptan and 1.0 % (5/484) of patients on placebo, while elevation (&gt; 3 × ULN) of AST was observed in 3.1 % (30/958) of patients on tolvaptan and 0.8 % (4/484) patients on placebo. Two (2/957, 0.2 %) of these tolvaptan treated-patients, as well as a third patient from an extension open label trial, exhibited increases in hepatic enzymes (&gt; 3 × ULN) with concomitant elevations in BT (&gt; 2 × ULN). The period of onset of hepatocellular injury (by ALT elevations &gt; 3 × ULN) was within 3 to 14 months after initiating treatment and these increases were reversible, with ALT returning to &lt; 3 × ULN within 1 to 4 month.  In the pivotal trial, the incidence of elevated transaminase levels for tolvaptan subjects (&gt; 3 × ULN) was approximately 3 to 4-fold higher than for placebo subjects. No association with tolvaptan dose or exposure was found at MAA for hepatic events.

In post-marketing experience, anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock and rash generalised) has been reported very rarely following administration of tolvaptan.

## Patient exposure

Cumulative exposure is shown in table 4 below. Through Month 12 inclusive, the cumulative percentage of subjects continuing on IMP, decreased to 84.5% and 92.6% for the tolvaptan and placebo arms, respectively. At Month 12, the average daily dose was 108.2 mg and 111.8 mg for the tolvaptan and placebo arms, respectively.

## Adverse events

For the single, blind, tolvaptan run-in period, any AE reported after a subject had received the first dose of tolvaptan was considered a TEAE. During this period, of the 1491 subjects treated, 1051 (70.5%) subjects experienced a TEAE - the most frequently reported TEAEs were polyuria (31.9%), thirst (28.8%), and nocturia (20.7%). One subject died; serious TEAEs were reported for 43 (2.9%) subjects. Discontinuations of IMP due to an AE were reported for 101 (6.8%) subjects.

During the double-blind treatment period, TEAEs were reported for 85.3% and 82.3% of subjects in the tolvaptan and placebo groups, respectively.  The most frequently occurring TEAEs (tolvaptan vs. placebo) were renal pain (16.6% vs. 19.0%), hypertension (10.7% vs. 11.5%), viral upper respiratory tract infection (10.6% vs. 12.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (8.7% vs. 8.5%), diarrhoea (6.9% vs. 3.4%), fatigue (6.8% vs. 3.5%), polyuria (5.3% vs. 1.6%); urinary tract infection (5.7% vs. 8.0%), and peripheral oedema (4.4% vs. 6.6%).

Overall, 1 subject died (placebo group); 12.5% and 8.8% of subjects in the tolvaptan and placebo groups, respectively, experienced serious TEAEs; and 9.5% and 2.2% of subjects in the tolvaptan and placebo groups, respectively, experienced IMP discontinuation due to AEs. An overview of AEs is given in table 5 below.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

There were no deaths in the study considered to be related to IMP. One subject died from a Pulmonary Embolism during the tolvaptan titration and run-in period and another subject died from a Road Traffic Accident during the double-blind treatment period (assigned to placebo)

During the single-blind treatment period, 43 (2.9%) subjects experienced ≥ 1 serious TEAE. The majority of the serious TEAEs were reported by 1 subject. The most frequently reported serious TEAEs in descending order were alanine aminotransferase increased (4 subjects, 0.3%), polyuria (4 subjects, 0.3%), and nocturia (3 subjects, 0.2%). The majority of these serious TEAEs were assessed as severe in intensity.

During the double-blind treatment period, serious TEAEs were reported for 85 (12.5%) subjects in the tolvaptan group vs. 60 (8.8%) subjects in the placebo group. The most frequently reported serious TEAEs were (in descending overall order, tolvaptan vs. placebo): hepatic enzyme increased (1.6% vs. 0.1%), alanine aminotransferase increased (1.2% vs. 0.0%), liver function test increased (0.6% vs. 0.3%), renal cyst haemorrhage (0.4% vs. 0.3%), and renal impairment (0.3% vs. 0.4%). The majority of the serious TEAEs were reported for 1 or 2 subjects overall (0.1% overall). Most serious TEAEs were considered to be severe in intensity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adverse events of particular interest

Hepatic toxicity: Treatment emergent AEs related to liver injury in the double-blind treatment period were reported for 10.9% and 5.3% of subjects in the tolvaptan and placebo groups, respectively. The most frequently reported were increased alanine aminotransferase (3.7% vs. 1.3%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (2.2% vs. 1.6%), increased hepatic enzymes (2.5% vs. 0.4%), and increased transaminases (1.5% vs. 0.7%). Serious TEAEs were reported for 31 (4.6%) and 4 (0.6%) subjects in the tolvaptan group and placebo groups, respectively. The most frequently reported TEAEs overall were (tolvaptan vs. placebo): 11 subjects with hepatic enzyme increased (1.6% vs. 0.1%) and 8 subjects with alanine aminotransferase increased (1.2% vs. 0.0%). However, no subject during the trial had concurrent transaminase and bilirubin elevations that met Hy's Law laboratory criteria (i.e., no subject had peak transaminase &gt; 3 x ULN plus peak bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN).

For the 29 subjects in the tolvaptan group who discontinued the IMP after reporting a potential clinically significant increased ALT (&gt; 3 x ULN), the values returned toward normal after the IMP was discontinued. For the 9 subjects in the tolvaptan group who did not discontinue the IMP after reporting a potential clinically significant increased ALT (&gt; 3 x ULN), the ALT values returned toward normal for all except for 1 subject - that subject had 4 serious TEAEs of liver function test increased, the last of which resulted in discontinuation of the IMP; the subject recovered from all 4 serious TEAEs.

It is noted that monthly monitoring of LFTs was done in this study, more frequent that the majority of patients in the previous pivotal study.  However the frequency is in line with the current SmPC, which requires  monitoring of liver function tests on a monthly basis during the first 18 months of treatment and 3 monthly thereafter.

Hyperuricaemia : There were 7 TEAE of increased blood uric acid in the tolvaptan group (1%) in the double-blind treatment period, compared to no cases in the placebo group.  The corresponding figures for the AE of gout were 12 (1.8%) vs 5 (0.7%).

Skin neoplasm : A possible signal of skin neoplasm was noted at the time of initial MAA. In study 156-13210, tolvaptan conversely had a smaller incidence in skin neoplasm compared with placebo, although numbers were small.

Glaucoma : A possible signal of glaucoma was noted at the time of initial MAA. There were no observed cases of with glaucoma in study 156-13-210.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The titration and run-in periods in the clinical trial were designed to test tolerability, exclude subjects unlikely to tolerate tolvaptan's aquaretic effects prior to the randomization period, minimize postrandomization withdrawal.  The adverse event profile is being reviewed with this in mind.

Generally, the reported adverse events were in line with those established in the pivotal trial and there are no new signals of concern. In the pivotal trial, the most notable safety issue associated with chronic tolvaptan use in ADPKD was the potential for idiosyncratic hepatic toxicity. At the time of granting the initial marketing authorisation, the risk was considered manageable in the context of the RMP and SmPC restrictions (including contra-indications, monitoring and stopping rules).

In the currently submitted trial 156-13-210, TEAEs related to liver injury in the double-blind treatment period were reported for 10.9% and 5.3% of subjects in the tolvaptan and placebo groups, respectively. However, no subject during the trial had concurrent transaminase and bilirubin elevations that met Hy's Law laboratory criteria (i.e., no subject had peak transaminase &gt; 3 x ULN plus peak bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and all cases were reversible.  One caveat is that the currently estimated 'window of susceptibility' for hepatic AEs was estimated at around 18 months, whilst the submitted trial ran for 1 year.

It is noted that monthly monitoring of LFTs was performed in this study, more frequent that the majority of patients in the previous pivotal study.  However the frequency is in line with the current SmPC recommendations, which requires monitoring of liver function tests on a monthly basis during the first 18 months of treatment and 3 monthly thereafter.

It is known that at the initiation of tolvaptan therapy, there is a small and reversible reduction in GFR, the mechanism for this is not fully defined. Data at the time of initial MAA suggested that the absolute decrease was lower in patients with more severe renal impairment, although the numbers of such patients are limited. Even if the decline is small, in patients with more severe renal impairment it can become more significant as a percentage of residual renal function. The CHMP requested further data on the initial change in GFR when starting therapy with tolvaptan overall and analysed by baseline CKD stage.  The applicant explained that in the pivotal AKPD trials, a reversible haemodynamic reduction in GFR was observed at the initiation of tolvaptan treatment, and this is also stated in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  In these new data, a similar effect was seen.  There is a trend for a lower initial decrease with worsening baseline renal function and this was also seen in the pivotal AKPD trials.  A greater effect was seen in some individuals, but, there were no subjects in CKD Stages 3a, 3b, and 4 that crossed their CKD stage boundary due to the initial change in eGFR, and this initial drop in eGFR recovered once a subject stopped taking tolvaptan.

There was a small difference in the TEAE of abdominal pain versus placebo and this is reflected in the SmPC.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Generally, the reported adverse events were in line with those established in the pivotal trial and there are no new signals of concern.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

| Volume depletion and dehydration | Jinarc SmPC • Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use; the text states: Tolvaptan may cause adverse reactions related to water loss such as thirst, dry mouth and dehydration (see section 4.8). Therefore, patients must have access to water (or other aqueous fluids) and be able to drink sufficient amounts of these fluids (see section 4.2). Patients have to be instructed to drink water or other aqueous fluids at the first sign of thirst in order to avoid excessive thirst or dehydration. Additionally, patients have to drink 1-2 glasses of fluid before bedtime regardless of perceived thirst and replenish fluids overnight with each episode of nocturia • Section 4.3 Contraindications: Volume | None                                    |

In a double-blind, placebo- controlled trial of patients with ADPKD, potentially clinically significant increased uric acid (greater than 10 mg/dL) was reported at a higher rate in tolvaptan- patients (6.2%) compared to placebo- treated patients (1.7%). Adverse reactions of gout were reported more frequently in tolvaptan-treated patients (28/961, 2.9%) than in patients receiving placebo (7/483, 1.4%). In addition, increased use of allopurinol and other drugs used to manage gout were observed in the double-blind, Placebo- controlled trial. Effects on serum uric acid are attributable to the reversible renal hemodynamic changes that occur in response to tolvaptan's effects on urine osmolality and may be clinically relevant. However, events of increased uric acid and/or gout were not serious and did not cause discontinuation of therapy in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Uric acid concentrations are to be evaluated prior to initiation of Jinarc therapy, and as indicated during treatment based on symptoms. |                                         |

If dehydration or renal dysfunction becomes evident, appropriate action must be taken which may include the need to interrupt or reduce doses of                                                  | None                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Teratogenicity                                                  | Jinarc SmPC • Section 5.3 states: Teratogenicity was noted in rabbits given 1000 mg/kg/day (15 times the exposure from the recommended human dose on an AUC basis). No teratogenic effects were seen in rabbits at 300 mg/kg/day (about 2.5 to 5.3 times the exposure in humans at the recommended dose, based on AUC). In a peri- and post-natal study in rats, delayed ossification and reduced pup bodyweight were seen at the high dose of 1000 mg/kg/day. The toxic potential of tolvaptan was also investigated in juvenile rats by 6-week repeated oral administration starting from 25 days of age (4 days after weaning). Tolvaptan was orally administered by gavage at doses of 30, 100, and 1000 mg/kg/day. No animal died and, overall, treatment- related changes were generally qualitatively comparable to those observed in adult rat toxicity studies of tolvaptan. • Section 4.3 contraindication: Tolvaptan shall not be used during pregnancy. One pregnancy in an ADPKD trial resulted in spontaneous abortion. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. • Section 4.6 states: Women of childbearing potential should use adequate contraceptive measures during Jinarc use.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of the data submitted in support of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated.

Section 4.1 now specifies that Jinarc is indicated in adults with CKD stage 1 to 4 at initiation of treatment, as follows: ' Jinarc is indicated to slow the progression of cyst development and renal insufficiency of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in adults with CKD stage 1 to 3 4 at initiation of treatment with evidence of rapidly progressing disease (see section 5.1). '

Section 4.8 now lists 'abdominal pain' in the table of adverse events and presents the data in line with QRD recommendations.

Section 5.1 now includes a description of Study 156-13-210 and its results.

The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

Reference to the obligation to carry out Condition 'ANX 006' has been deleted from the Annex II for Jinarc.

Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do not require user consultation with target patient groups.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

Clinical trial 156-13-210 was a Phase 3b, Multi-centre, Randomized-withdrawal, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind, Parallel-group Trial to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of tolvaptan (45 to 120 mg/day, Split-dose) in Subjects with Chronic Kidney Disease Between Late Stage 2 to Early Stage 4 Due to Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.

This is a completed Post-Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES) as mandated by the CHMP at the time of initial approval of tolvaptan for the use in adults to treat autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The study design was acceptable and the characteristics of patients at baseline were balanced between the two groups. Statistical significance for both the primary and key secondary endpoints was met, according to the MAH's pre-specified analyses. The safety analysis did not reveal any new adverse events.

Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the efficacy and safety of Jinarc in patients with CKD stage 4 is not different from that in the already treated patients with stage 1-3 and agreed on the proposed extension of indication.

The overall B/R of Jinarc is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type   | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     | I, II and IIIB     |

Extension of Indications to the treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in adults with CKD stage 4, based on the results of a completed Post Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES, Trial 156-13-210). Trial 156-13-210 is a Phase 3b, Multi-centre, Randomized-withdrawal, Placebocontrolled, Double-blind, Parallel-group Trial to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Tolvaptan (45 to 120 mg/day, Split-dose) in Subjects with Chronic Kidney Disease between Late Stage 2 to Early Stage 4 Due to Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.  Submission of these results fulfils the corresponding condition mandated by Annex II of the Product Information for tolvaptan (ANX 006).

Sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and the package leaflet were updated accordingly. Changes in line with QRD template and other minor additional editorial changes were also carried out.

Version 13.3 of the RMP, updated to reflect the study results, was approved.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

The CHMP is of the opinion that the following obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore recommends its deletion from the Annex II:

'Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further define the efficacy of tolvaptan in patients with more advanced renal dysfunction on a primary endpoint related to GFR rather than TKV the MAH should submit the Final study report of Study 156-13-210 by: Feb-2018.'
