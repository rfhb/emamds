## 1. Introduction

The present paediatric data is submitted by the MAH in accordance with article 46 of Regulation EC No 1901/2006.

This submission for Ceftaroline, in the treatment of cSSTI and CAP, relates to the submission of the results from the clinical study P903-24 D3720C00013 (A Multicenter, Randomized, Observer-Blinded, ActiveControlled Study  Evaluating  the  Safety,  Tolerability,  Pharmacokinetics,  and  Efficacy  of Ceftaroline Versus Ceftriaxone Plus Vancomycin in Paediatric Subjects with Complicated Communityacquired Bacterial Pneumonia).

The  full  benefit  and  risk  profile  in  the  paediatric  population  will  be  evaluated  when  the  additional studies in the PIP have been completed. Paediatric patient exposure will continue to be specified as missing information in the EU Risk Management Plan until the completion of the paediatric studies. In view of this no changes to the SPC and proposed at this stage.

The overall benefit to risk balance for Zinforo is not affected by this new information and therefore does  not  require  taking  further  regulatory  action  on  the  marketing  authorization  for  Zinforo  at  this stage.

## About the product

Ceftaroline fosamil is the prodrug of ceftaroline and is rapidly converted to microbiologically active drug after intravenous (iv) administration. Ceftaroline, inhibits bacterial cell growth by interfering with cell wall  biosynthesis.  Ceftaroline  has  high  affinity  for  PBP2a  and  is  highly  potent  against  resistant staphylococci.  Ceftaroline  has  also  been  shown  to  bind  with  high  affinity  to  PBPs  in  S.  pneumoniae including modified forms of PBP2x which are common in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP).

Ceftaroline is approved for treatment of adult patients with cSSTI and CAP in the EU since August 2012. The recommended dosing regimen is 600 mg (reduced to 400 mg for patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30 to ≤50 mL/min) administered as a 60-minute infusion every 12 hours (q12h) for 5 to 14 days for cSSTI and 5 to 7 days for CAP.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1 Information on the development program

The MAH stated that this study is a randomised, observer-blinded study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone plus vancomycin in paediatric patients, ages 2 months to &lt; 18  years,  with  complicated  CAP  at  high  risk  of  infection  due  to  methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and is an additional study requested by the FDA to complement Study P903-31 (PIP Study 5) by utilizing an enrichment strategy for enrolment of patients with MRSA.

## 2.2 Clinical

As part of the EU-RMP and PIP, the MAH conducted the clinical study. The study is described briefly below (for further details please refer to the full CSR).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study D3720C00013

## Study design

This study is a randomised, observer-blinded study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ceftaroline versus  ceftriaxone  plus  vancomycin  in  paediatric  patients,  ages  2  months  to  &lt;  18  years,  with complicated CAP at high risk of infection due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Subjects were stratified by age cohort and region and were randomly assigned to treatment in a 3:1 ratio, ceftaroline fosamil to ceftriaxone. The following age cohorts were defined:

Cohort 1: children from 12 years to &lt; 18 years Cohort 2: children from 6 years to &lt; 12 years Cohort 3: children from 24 months to &lt; 6 years

Cohort 4: young infants/toddlers from 2 months to &lt; 24 months

A minimum of 7 intravenous (IV) doses was required for subjects randomized to ceftaroline fosamil. A switch to open label oral study drug (amoxicillin clavulanate, clindamycin, or linezolid) was allowed on or after Study Day 4 if a subject met the protocol-specified criteria. The total duration of study drug therapy(IV and oral, or IV alone) was 5 to 21 days.

The  EOIV  assessments  were  performed  within  24  hours  after  administration  of  the  last  dose  of  IV study drug, and before oral switch, if applicable. The EOT assessments were performed within 48 hours after the last dose of oral study drug. The TOC assessments were performed 8-15 days after the final dose  of  study  drug  (IV  or  oral,  whichever  was  given  last),  and  the  LFU  visit  assessments  were performed  21-35 days after the last dose of study drug (IV or oral).

## Study site and dates

The  study  was  conducted  by  Cerexa,  US  between  23/01/2013  and  19/05/2014.  The  study  had appropriate ethics approval and was performed according to GCP. Twenty four sites were enrolled but only 11 actually enrolled patients for the study.

## Study Objectives

## Primary

-To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone plus vancomycin in paediatric patients, ages 2 months to &lt; 18 years, with complicated CAP.

## Secondary

-To evaluate the efficacy of ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone plus vancomycin in paediatric patients, ages 2 months to &lt; 18 years, with complicated CAP.

-To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ceftaroline in these subjects ( This  analysis  is  reported separately ).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study population

Male and female subjects 2 months to &lt; 18 years of age; complicated CABP (meeting the protocolspecified  criteria)  warranting  3  days  of  initial  hospitalization  and  a  minimum  of  3  days  of  IV antibacterial therapy and a minimum of 5 days but no more than 21 days total of study therapy (IV and oral combined); confirmed presence of at least 1 indicator of complicated CABP or staphylococcal pneumonia; acute onset or worsening within the previous 5 days before randomization of at least 2 of the  clinical  signs  or  symptoms  of  CABP  (cough,  tachypnea,  dyspnea,  grunting,  sputum  production, chest  pain,  cyanosis,  evidence  of  pneumonia  with  parenchymal  consolidation,  increased  work  of breathing);  presence  of  at  least  1of  the  following:  organism  consistent  with  a  typical  respiratory pathogen identified or isolated from a respiratory or blood culture, leukocytosis, &gt;15% immature white blood cells (WBCs), leukopenia, or hypoxemia.

## Study medications

## Investigational Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:

IV ceftaroline fosamil infused over 120 (± 10) minutes every 8 hours (q8h [± 1 hour]) as follows:

Children ≥ 6 months: ceftaroline fosamil 15 mg/kg for subjects weighing ≤ 40 kg or 600 mg for subjects weighing &gt; 40 kg

Children &lt; 6 months: ceftaroline fosamil 10 mg/kg

## Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:

IV ceftriaxone at a total daily dose of 75 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 4 g/day, given in equally divided doses, each infused over 30 (± 10) minutes every 12 hours (q12h [± 2 hours]).

## Optional Oral Switch, Dose and Mode of Administration:

Amoxicillin  clavulanate  was  the  drug  preferred  to  be  administered  for  the  optional  oral  therapy.  A recommended total daily dose of 45 to 90 mg/kg/day amoxicillin clavulanate was to be divided equally q12h. Clindamycin (13 mg/kg/dose q8h) was an alternative oral study drug for patients with proven or suspected MSSA or MRSA infections. Linezolid (600 mg q12h [Cohort 1] or 10 mg/kg q8h [Cohorts 2, 3, and 4]) was an alternative oral study drug for patients with clindamycin-resistant MRSA pathogens. Doses  were  based  on  institutional  and  local  prescribing  guidelines  and  information  provided  in  the package inserts.

## Duration of Treatment

Total duration of study drug therapy was 5 to 21 days; a minimum of 3 days of initial hospitalization and 3 days (72 hours) of IV study drug therapy (ceftaroline fosamil or comparators) were required. The total duration of subject participation was expected to be 26 to 57 days; the Late Follow-up (LFU) assessments were to occur 21 to 35 days after last dose of any study drug (IV or oral).

## Safety:

Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, and discontinuations due to AEs; clinical laboratory parameters; vital signs measurements

## Statistical methods

The following study populations were defined:

-ITT  Population:  all  randomized  subjects  with  study  drug  assignment  designated  according  to  initial randomization,  regardless  of  whether  subjects  receive  study  drug  according  to  the  randomization schedule, or receive a different drug from that to which they were randomized

-Safety Population: all randomized subjects who received any amount of study drug

-MITT Population: all randomized subjects who received any amount of IV study drug and who had a confirmed  diagnosis  of  complicated  CABP  with  risk  factors  for  MRSA.  Subjects  with  an  atypical pathogen as the sole causative pathogen of infection based on immunoglobulin M (IgM) or IgG titers of baseline  (or  in  some  cases  with  IgG,  paired  baseline  and  post-baseline)  serology  samples  were excluded.

-CE Population: a subset of the MITT Population and will include subjects who meet minimal disease criteria for CABP and all evaluability criteria as specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

-mMITT Population: a subset of the MITT Population, including subjects for whom at least 1 typical bacterial pathogen had been identified from an adequate microbiological specimen at baseline

-ME Population: all subjects who met the criteria for both the CE and mMITT populations.

-PK Population: all randomized subjects who received a known amount of ceftaroline fosamil and who had  had  at  least  1  PK  sample  collected  (excluding  those  who  received  blood  or  blood  component transfusions within 24 hours before any PK sample was drawn)

Efficacy: Efficacy response was analyzed using the MITT, CE, and mMITT populations. Proportions of subjects with favorable efficacy responses were summarized by treatment group. Differences between treatment groups in efficacy response rates were calculated along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between treatment groups in percentage of subjects for each efficacy response.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety:  Safety  parameters  (AEs,  SAEs,  deaths,  clinical  laboratory  parameters,  and  vital  signs measurements) were summarized for the Safety Population.

## Study monitoring

An external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was established to review safety data from this study, and other ongoing paediatric studies of ceftaroline fosamil, at prespecified intervals to ensure safety of all subjects enrolled.

## Results

## Study Disposition

Subjects  were  stratified  by  region  and  age  cohort.  A  total  of  40  subjects  were  randomized  3:1  to receive study drug (30 subjects to ceftaroline fosamil and 10 subjects to ceftriaxone) (ITT Population).

## Demographics and Baseline Characteristics

The majority of subjects were white, with a mean age of 4 years (range 16 weeks through 17 years). Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the 2 treatment groups. The  majority  of  subjects  had  normal  renal  function,  and  no  subjects  had  moderate  or  severe  renal impairment.

## Efficacy

- -The clinical response and stability at Study Day 4 were greater than 50% in both groups, but slightly higher in the comparator group.

The clinical cure rate was high, with only 3 subjects in the test group being labelled clinical failures, 2 due to AEs and 1 due to no therapeutic effect.

-Microbiological  outcomes  by  subject  and  by  baseline  pathogen  at  TOC  in  the  mMITT  Population showed a favourable microbiological response (presumed eradication or eradication) in all subjects but two in the test groups.

## Safety results

Study drug exposure was similar between the ceftaroline and ceftriaxone groups. The median duration of  IV  treatment  was 9.0 and 7.5 days, respectively. Most subjects switched to oral study drug; the median duration of  oral  study  drug  treatment  was  7.5  days  in  both  the  ceftaroline  and  ceftriaxone groups.

Fewer  subjects  in  test  group  reported  at  least  1  TEAE.  (40%  and  80%  in  the  ceftaroline  and ceftriaxone groups, respectively). The incidence of SAEs was low. No SAEs were related to study drug. Two  subjects  in  the  ceftaroline  group  discontinued  IV  study  drug  due  to  an  AE.  No  deaths  were reported during the study.

No  trends  were  seen  in  changes  from  baseline  for  clinical  laboratory  parameters.  The  incidence  of potentially clinically significant laboratory abnormalities was low and no subject met potential Hy's law criteria.  Mean  changes  over  time in  vital  signs  measurements  were  similar between  both  treatment groups and consistent with improvement in the underlying infection over the course of the study.

## Applicant's Conclusion

Safety data indicate that treatment of paediatric subjects with CABP with ceftaroline fosamil was well tolerated. The clinical outcomes in the ceftaroline treatment group were comparable to those in the ceftriaxone treatment group.

## 2.3 Discussion

This Phase 4 study was conducted to address the FDA paediatric PMR (PMR 1692-002) to perform a randomized comparison of ceftaroline fosamil and comparator in paediatric subjects with CABP. The safety and tolerability of IV ceftaroline fosamil versus IV ceftriaxone plus IV vancomycin (comparators) were evaluated in the treatment of paediatric subjects aged 2 months to &lt; 18 years with complicated CABP. The study was designed to enrich for subjects at risk for infection due to MRSA. However only 1 subject enrolled (ceftaroline group) had MRSA identified.

The  study  was  designed  to  primarily  look  at  safety  and  tolerability  of  ceftaroline  in  the  mentioned doses in patients with CABP requiring hospitalisation. Ceftriaxone was selected as an active comparator agent for its microbiological spectrum of activity, effectiveness as treatment for CABP, its widespread global  use,  and  acceptance  as  a  therapy  for  CABP  based  on  expert  opinion  and  national  adult  CAP guidelines.  The  switch  to  oral  therapy  at  the  investigator's  discretion  is  based  on  normal  clinical practice.

The selected ceftaroline dose regimens (15 mg/kg [600 mg if &gt; 40 kg] for subjects ≥ 6 months and 10 mg/kg  for  subjects  &lt;  6  months  of  age,  as  a  2-hour  infusion  q8h)  were  predicted  to  achieve pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets in plasma associated with 1-log kill of S. aureus in the murine pneumonia model for organisms with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values up to 1  mg/L in  &gt;  90% of subjects ages2 months to &lt; 18 years. The high PK/PD target attainment was expected to result inefficacy for paediatric subjects comparable to efficacy in adult subjects with CABP dosedwith ceftaroline 600 mg q8h. The median Cmax value in children 2 months to &lt; 18 years with normal renal function dosed with 15 mg/kg q8h (up to 600 mg) as a 2-hour infusion, or 10 mg/kg q8h as a 2-hour infusion for children &lt; 6 months, was predicted to be less than the median Cmax value in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adults dosed with 600 mg q8h as a 1-hour infusion. The median AUC0-24h (AUC from time zero to 24 hours) in children 2 months to &lt; 18 years dosed with the above regimen was predicted to be up to 15% greater than in adults dosed with 600 mg q8h. The median %T &gt; MIC for an MIC of 1 mg/L was predicted to be 84- 93% for the recommended paediatric dose regimens compared to 100% in adults dosed with 600 mg q8h.

In  general,  demographics  were  balanced  between  treatment  groups.  In  the  study  there  were  no unexpected safety issues, the tolerability was acceptable and efficacy was similar to the comparator. Although PK results will be reported separately, it appears the choice of doses for the various cohorts was appropriate based on the efficacy seen.

In  addition  to  this  study,  further  studies  are  planned  as  part  of  PIP.  Therefore  no  further  action  is proposed at this stage.

## 2.4 Changes to the product information

The MAH proposed no changes to the Product Information, which is acceptable at this stage as further paediatric studies are planned.

## 3. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

Based  on  the  results  of  the  newly  completed  study  which  evaluates  the  safety  and  tolerability  of ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone plus vancomycin in paediatric patients, aged 2 months to &lt; 18 years, with CAP, it is considered that the safety and efficacy of ceftaroline in this population is acceptable and no unexpected concerns have been identified.

Therefore this does not change the benefit/risk balance.

## 4. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

The  benefit/risk  balance  remains  positive  in  the  approved  indications  at  present.  A  final  decision regarding any change to the product information related to the paediatric population will be taken upon completion of all the clinical studies planned in this population under the PIP.
