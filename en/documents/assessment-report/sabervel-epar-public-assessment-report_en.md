Scientific discussion Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.1. Introduction

Sabervel 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg film-coated tablets is a generic medicinal product containing irbesartan as active substance. The reference medicinal product is Aprovel 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg film-coated tablets from Sanofi Pharma Bristol-Myers Squibb SNC, which was centrally authorized on 27 August December 1997. The active substance of the reference product is irbesartan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Irbesartan is a nonpeptide tetrazole derivative, which is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin II receptor (type AT1) antagonist. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II (AT1) receptors results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II levels, and a decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly affected by irbesartan alone at the recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase-II), an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin into inactive metabolites.

The efficacy and safety of irbesartan has been demonstrated in several randomised, double-blind placebo controlled studies, and controlled studies with active comparators in patients with hypertension. Irbesartan was also studied in two large studies in kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. A summary of these studies can be found in the EPAR of Aprovel.

The indication proposed for Sabervel is the same as authorised for the reference medicinal product Aprovel. Irbesartan is indicated in adults for the treatment of essential hypertension. It is also indicated for the treatment of renal disease in adult patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive medicinal product regimen. 2.2. Quality aspects 2.2.1. Introduction Sabervel is presented as film-coated tablets containing irbesartan as active substance. Three strengths have been developed: 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg. Excipients used in the preparation of Sabervel are well known excipients used in tablet preparations such as lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, silica colloidal anhydrous, hypromellose, magnesium stearate (present in the tablet core), and Opadry Y-1-7000 white (coating agent) which is composed of hypromellose, titanium dioxide (E171), and macrogol 4000. Sabervel is presented as white, concave, round film-coated tablets. The diameter of the tablets varies depending on the strength (75mg- 7 mm diameter, 150 mg - 9 mm diameter, 300 mg-11 mm diameter). The tablets are packed in white PVC/PVDC/alu-PVDC blisters. 2.2.2. Active  substance The active substance is irbesartan, a well known active substance described in Ph.Eur. It is chemically designated as 2-Butyl-3-[p-(O-1 H -tetrazol-5-yl-phenyl)benzyl]-1,3-diazaspiro-[4.4]non-1-en-4-one or 2-Butyl-3[(2'-(1 H -tetrazol-5-yl)[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)methyl]-1,3-diazaspiro-[4.4]non-1-en-4-one and has the following structure: Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Irbesartan is a white to off-white crystalline, non hygroscopic powder, which is slightly soluble in ethanol (96%), chloroform and methylene chloride, and practically insoluble in water. Irbesartan is practically insoluble at acidic pHs. Its solubility increases when increasing the pH, becoming slightly soluble around pH 9 and freely soluble at around pH 13.

Irbesartan has no chiral centers and exhibits no stereoisomerism. The chemical structure of the molecule has been established by spectral (UV, IR, 1 H and  13 C NMR and mass spectra) and elemental analyses.

Two crystalline polymorph forms of irbesartan are known from the literature: form A and form B. X-ray powder diffraction, DSC and IR analysis confirmed that the manufacturing processes used consistently produce polymorphic form A. In addition stability data showed that irbesartan form A is a highly stable crystalline form, and it does not convert to the other crystalline form in any of the conditions tested. Manufacture Irbesartan is supplied by different manufacturers, and an Active Substance Master Files (ASMF) has been  submitted  for  each  manufacturer.  The  manufacturing  processes  of  irbesartan  have  been adequately  described  and  satisfactory  specifications  have  been  set  for  starting  materials,  reagents, solvents  and  auxiliary  materials  used.  Suitable  in-process  controls  to  ensure  quality  of  the  final compound have been established. Irbesartan active substance is packaged into a polyethylene or an aluminum laminate bag. This bag is further introduced into a second aluminum foil bag again, which is sealed and placed in a fibrous drum. Specifications  and  analytical  reports  for  the  packaging  components  have  been  presented  and  the suitability of the polyethylene bags for use with food and pharmaceuticals has been confirmed. Specification The specification of irbesartan was set to be in line with the current Ph.Eur. monograph and relevant ICH guidelines. It includes tests for appearance, solubility, identification (FTIR, HPLC and XRD), water content (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph.Eur.), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC) and assay (Ph.Eur.). A reasoned discussion on impurities arising from the starting materials, the route of synthesis and on degradation products has been provided. All the impurities are controlled in the final active substance specification in accordance with the Ph.Eur. requirements. The impurity limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety. The  residual  solvents  are  also  controlled  at  release  with  specifications  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q3C (R3). The  specification  proposed  is  considered  suitable  to  control  the  quality  of  the  drug  substance manufactured using the current processes. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Non-compendial analytical procedures have been satisfactorily described and validated in accordance with the ICH Q2 (R1) guideline. The analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the drug substance.

Data on three consecutive batches of irbesartan manufactured according to the proposed manufacturing  processes  in  the  proposed  manufacturing  sites  has  been  provided.  All  batches represented  full  scale  production  and  complied  with  the  requirements  in  the  drug  substance specification.  These  results  confirm  batch-to-batch  consistency  and  compliance  with  the  proposed specification.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Stability

Data from stability studies on three production scale batches have been provided. Samples were stored for  up  to  36  or  48  months  under  long  term  conditions  (25°C/60%  RH)  and  for  6  months  under accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH) in accordance with ICH requirements.  All batches have been tested for conformance with the specifications using stability indicating analytical methods. In all cases the batch analysis data met the predefined specifications and no significant changes were observed.

In  addition  stability  data  have  been  provided  under  stress  conditions  (heat,  acid  hydrolysis,  base hydrolysis,  photo  degradation,  water  hydrolysis  and  hydrogen  peroxide  treatment).  The  proposed retest  period  of  three  years  for  the  drug  substance,  stored  in  the  proposed  packaging  material,  is supported by the stability results provided.

None of the excipients used in the drug product is of human or animal origin, with the exception of lactose  monohydrate.  Lactose  monohydrate  is  derived  from  milk  and  calf  rennet  and  is  therefore compliant  with  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  Minimising  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products (EMEA/410/01 Rev. 3).

2.2.3. Finished medicinal product Pharmaceutical development The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  obtain  immediate-release  tablets  containing qualitatively  and  quantitatively  the  same  active  substance,  and  exhibiting  comparable  dissolution profiles and the same bioavailability as the reference medicinal product, Aprovel. Sabervel  film-coated  tablets  contain  lactose  monohydrate,  cellulose  microcrystalline,  croscarmellose sodium, silica colloidal anhydrous, hypromellose and magnesium stearate. The formulation of Sabervel does not contain pregelatinised  maize  starch  or  poloxamer  188,  as  the  reference  medicinal  product does. All the excipients employed are widely used in the production of tablets and comply with the Ph. Eur. The development approach was to obtain a unique granulate to tablet proportionally at different weight for each dose. Hence, the 75 mg tablet has a final weight of 125 mg, the 150 mg tablet a weight of 250 mg and the 300 mg tablet a weight of 500 mg. Further to development studies wet granulation was chosen as the most appropriate process for the manufacture of the drug product. The manufacturing process is common for all strengths. The  dissolution  test  design  has  been  extensively  discussed  and  has  been  found  adequate  based  on data  from  solubility  tests  of  the  active  substance  and  dissolution  tests  for  the  new  and  reference products in different pH media. Since Irbesartan film-coated tablets application concerns several strengths (300 mg, 150 mg and 75 mg)  of  active  substance  and  the condition of dose  proportionality is complied  according to CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  rev1,  only  one  bioequivalence  study  of  one  strength  (300  mg)  has  been carried out. Adventitious agents Medicinal product no longer authorised

Magnesium stearate used in the formulation is of vegetal origin.

## Manufacture of the product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  proposed  manufacturing  process  is  standard  process  utilised  in  the  tablets  manufacture  and consists  of  several  steps  including  premixing,  wet  granulation,  blending,  drying,  milling,  mixing  of blend, compression (tabletting) of the final blend, film-coating and packaging.

A  flow  diagram  and  detailed  description  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  provided.    The process has been sufficiently described. Several in-process controls have been identified.

Irbesartan shows polymorphism. Adequate data has been presented to confirm that the polymorphic form of the active substance does not change during the manufacturing process or during the storage of the medicinal product.

All  batches  were  tested  for  physical  and  technological  (appearance,  dissolution),  chemical  (assay, degradation products) and microbiological parameters using stability indicating methods.  In all cases the  parameters  tested  remained  within  the  proposed  specifications  and  no  significant  changes  were observed.

A validation protocol has been provided and the applicant has committed to conduct the manufacturing process validation on three consecutive industrial batches of Irbesartan 300 mg film-coated tablets, Irbesartan  150  mg  film-coated  tablets  and  Irbesartan  75  mg  film-coated  tablets  according  with  the CPMP guideline QWP/848/96 on process validation. Product specification The  product  specification  is  a  standard  one  for  tablets  and  contains  tests  with  suitable  limits  for appearance, uniformity of mass (Ph. Eur), hardness (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.),  uniformity of dosage units by mass variation (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), identification by HPLC and TLC (Ph. Eur.),  assay  (Ph.  Eur.),  related  substances  (Ph.  Eur.),    and  microbial  contamination  (Ph.  Eur.).  The specification and control test applied for the finished product is considered appropriate for this dosage form, and it is in compliance with Ph. Eur. and ICH Q6A guideline. All  the  analytical  methods  have  been  satisfactorily  described.  All  non  pharmacopoeial  methods  have been satisfactory validated in accordance with the ICH Q2 (R1). Batch analysis data for each strength have been provided on five pilot scale batches of the finished product (2 or 3 batches manufactured with active substance from a different supplier). Batch analysis results confirm that the film-coated tablets can be manufactured reproducibly according to the finished product specification. Stability of the product Stability  studies  under  ICH  conditions  of  25ºC/60%RH  (long  term,  48 months)  and  40ºC/75%RH (accelerated, 6 months) were carried out on five pilot scale batches of Sabervel 75 mg or 300 mg filmcoated tablets manufactured with active substance sourced from the two active substance manufacturers  (two  batches  from  one  and  three  from  the  other).  All  of  them  have  the  same formulation and are packaged in the same container closure system proposed for marketing. Sabervel 150mg film-coated tablets were not placed on stability study as according to ICH Q1D, the stability of the intermediate dose is represented by the stability of the extremes tested. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Furthermore, photostability studies have been performed as per ICH Q1B guideline and demonstrate that the film-coated tablets are not sensitive to light.

In  conclusion,  the  stability  results  presented  support  the  proposed  shelf-life  for  the  commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SmPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Information  on  development,  manufacture,  packaging  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug product  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform  performance  in  the clinic.

2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. 2.3. Non- clinical aspects 2.3.1. Introduction A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 2.3.2. Environmental Risk Assessment No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was submitted. This was justified by the Applicant as the introduction of Sabervel is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all irbesartan containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 2.4. Clinical aspects 2.4.1. Introduction This is an application for Sabervel film-coated tablets containing irbesartan. To support the marketing authorisation application the Applicant conducted one bioequivalence study with cross-over design after a single dose under fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as efficacy and safety of irbesartan based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the reference product.

No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) in its current version is of particular relevance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

## Methods and study design

The basic demographic data such as sex, age, weight and height of all 29 subjects enrolled into the study are presented in the table below.

Study GE03IRB/1/06 This study was a single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-way crossover, comparative bioavailability study of Irbesartan 300 mg tablets (J. Uriach y Compañía, S.A.) and Aprovel 300 mg film-coated tablets (Sanofi Pharma Bristol-Myers Squibb SNC, Spain) in normal, healthy subjects under fasting conditions. The washout period was a minimum of 7 days between each dosing, but no more than 14 days. The wash-out was considered adequate since the drug has a long half-life (11-15 hours) and pre-dose levels were not detected. Moreover, 5% levels of the lowest Cmax for irbesartan (68.59 ng/mL) could be detected with this LLOQ (25.08 ng/mL). Test and reference products Test Product: Irbesartan 300 mg film coated tablets, manufactured by J. Uriach y Compañía, S.A., Spain. Batch number: Z002 (biobatch: 0701). Batch size: 100,000 film coated tablets. Assay (content): 98.89% of label claim. Reference Product: Aprovel 300 mg film coated tablets, manufactured by Sanofi Pharma Bristol-Myers Squibb SNC (marketed in Spain). Batch number: 2525 (biobatch 0701). Assay (content): 97.04% of label claim. Mode of Administration The subjects included in the study were divided in 5 groups and all performed two experimental sessions, leaving a washout period of 7 days. The subjects were assigned to one of two treatment sequences Test/Reference (TR) and Reference/Test (RT) using a SPSS v14.0 program, in a balanced way (an equal number of subjects in each treatment sequence). Subjects were randomised in 4 blocks of 7 subjects. Population studied A total of 47 young subjects were initially selected; 29 were included in the study (14 male and 15 female) and 28 were analysed. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Analytical methods

The pre-study validation of the analytical method was satisfactory. No (outlier) value was excluded from calculations.

The in-study validation shows acceptable calibration standards (zero) and QC values.

The LLOQ (20.08 ng/mL) was lower than 5% of the minimum Cmax. Therefore, in case a carry-over effect was present it would have been detected.

The long-term stability data in frozen human plasma cover the period of time that the samples have been stored in this study. Pharmacokinetic variables The main standard pharmacokinetic variables (AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ , Cmax) were determined through noncompartmental analysis by the linear log trapezoidal rule. As other secondary pharmacokinetic variables tmax, Kel, t1/2 and % extrapolated area were assessed. Statistical methods The comparative study of the bioequivalence parameters Ln (AUC0-t), Ln (AUC0-∞ ) and Ln Cmax was performed by means of ANOVA, controlling for the sequence, subjects nested in the sequence, the period and the formulation; in order to obtain an estimation of the residual variance and determine the role of these factors. Bioequivalence was concluded if the 90% IC of the relative mean AUC y Cmax were included within 80125% limits according EMA guidance. Tmax was analyzed by the non-parametric Hauschke method. The pharmacokinetic analysis based on the linear trapezoidal rule is considered adequate. The statistical analysis performed is parametric, except for Tmax, in accordance with the Guideline on the investigation on bioequivalence. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Safety data

Bioequivalence assessment Based on the statistical analysis submitted by the Applicant both test products are equivalent to the reference with respect to the extent and rate of absorption / exposure. The 90% confidence intervals calculated for AUC(0-t) , AUC(0-inf) and Cmax of irbesartan were inside the normal range of acceptability (0.80 - 1.25). Absence of quantifiable levels in pre-dose samples indicates a lack of carryover effect. Therefore, an unequal carry-over effect can be excluded and the cross-over design can be considered to represent the relative bioavailability between test and reference products. The AUC estimated is considered representative enough of the extent of absorption/exposure since the extrapolation is lower than 20% in all but one of the individual profiles. The LLOQ was 20.08 ng/mL, therefore, it was considered sensitive enough to detect levels of 5% of the minim Cmax (68.59 ng/mL) to exclude the possibility of a relevant carry-over effect. The non-parametric 90% CI of Tmax has not been provided, which is considered acceptable since Tmax is not critical for onset of action. Medicinal product no longer authorised

No serious AEs were reported during the conduct of this study. There were Fifteen (15) adverse events. Eight (8) AEs were reported in subjects under reference treatment and seven (7) AEs when they were under test treatment. Only five (5) AEs were related with study drug in both groups of treatment. The main AEs were migraine (7 cases) and sickness (4 cases).

## Conclusions

Based on the presented bioequivalence study Sabervel is considered bioequivalent with Aprovel.

The results of study GE03IRB/1/06 with the 300 mg formulation can be extrapolated to the other strengths 75mg and 150 mg, according to conditions in the Guidelines.

## Pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.

Safety The safety profile of Sabervel seems to be comparable with Aprovel although it is obvious that the design of the PK study undertaken was not powered to compare the safety profile. No difference in the safety profile can be anticipated. 2.4.3. Post marketing experience No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 2.4.4. Conclusions on clinical aspects Bioequivalence between the test product and the reference product has been shown in a cross-over study after a single dose in fasting conditions. A waiver of two proportional strengths has been applied for based on dissolution profiles. The different tablet strengths are manufactured with the same process, they have the same qualitative composition and a proportional quantitative composition in the tablet core and the dissolution profiles have been shown to be sufficiently similar. Therefore, a biowaiver can be granted and the bioequivalence shown for the 300 mg strength can be extrapolated to the proportional strengths of 75 and 150 mg. 2.5. Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the Applicant fulfils the legislative requirements. The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, as presented in Module 1.8.1. of the Marketing Authorisation Application, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market. Risk management plan No Risk Management Plan has been provided by the Applicant. Since the application concerns a generic with a reference medicinal product for which no safety concerns require additional risk minimisation activities, this approach is considered acceptable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.

No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

3. Benefit-risk balance This application concerns a generic version of irbesartan film-coated tablet. The reference product Aprovel is indicated for treatment of essential hypertension and treatment of renal disease in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of an antihypertensive drug regimen. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant's clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a cross-over design after a single dose under fasting conditions. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Irbesartan exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. As indicated in the Guideline on investigation of bioequivalence 'evaluation of bioequivalence should be based upon measured concentrations of the parent compound'. Therefore, there was no need to measure any other analyte different to the parent compound. The use of the highest dose and strength in case of linear kinetics is recommended for analytical reasons and solubility reasons except in case of safety concerns. Irbesartan's absorption is independent of food intake, therefore a 2x2 cross-over single dose study in fasting conditions is considered adequate to compare two formulations containing the same drug, when the drug can be taken with or without food and the formulations is a conventional formulation. Consequently, a single dose study in fasted state was considered the most adequate study design to investigate the pharmacokinetic bioequivalence of irbesartan. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The test formulation of Sabervel met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with Aprovel. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals, and Cmax were all contained intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0- within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated.

A waiver of two proportional strengths has been applied for based on dissolution profiles. The different tablet strengths are manufactured with the same process, they have the same qualitative composition and a proportional quantitative composition in the tablet core and the dissolution profiles have been

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

shown to be sufficiently similar. Therefore, a waiver can be granted and the bioequivalence shown for the 300 mg strength can be extrapolated to the proportional strengths of 75 and 150 mg.

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.
