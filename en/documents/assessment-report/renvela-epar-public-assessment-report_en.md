## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Hyperphosphataemia  is  common  in  patients  with  end-stage  renal  failure  (ESRF)  and  may  be associated with debilitating sequelae. Treatment of hyperphosphataemia consists of dietary phosphorus  restriction  and/or  dialysis  and  phosphate  binders.  Almost  all  dialysis  patients  require phosphate binders. The use of calcium-based phosphate binders (calcium acetate, calcium carbonate) can result in chronic calcium overload, hypercalcemia and soft tissue calcification. Hypercalcemia is particularly  common  in  patients  treated  with  calcitriol  and  other  vitamin  D  analogues.  Aluminiumbased phosphate binders (aluminium hydroxide) are associated with significant toxicity due to small amounts of absorbed aluminium (encephalopathy, osteomalacia, myopathy).

Sevelamer is a non-absorbed phosphate binding poly (allylamine hydrochloride) polymer, free of aluminium  and  calcium.  It  contains  multiple  amines  separated  by  one  carbon  from  the  polymer backbone. These amines become partially protonated in the intestine and interact with phosphate ions through ionic and hydrogen bonding. By binding phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract, sevelamer lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum. Sevelamer decreases the incidence of hypercalcaemic  episodes  as  compared  to  patients  using  calcium  based  phosphate  binders  alone, probably because the product itself does not contain calcium.

Genzyme initially developed sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel®), which is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis (Marketing Authorisation Application [MAA] EU/1/99/123/004-012). Sevelamer hydrochloride capsules were approved in the United States on 30 October 1998, and in the European Union, via the Centralised Procedure, on 28 January  2000  for  use  in  adult  haemodialysis  patients.  Approval  for  the  tablet  form  followed  on  23 April  2001.  The  indication  was  extended  in  2007  for  use  in  peritoneal  dialysis  patients.  Sevelamer hydrochloride is restricted for use in adult patients receiving dialysis.

Genzyme continued the development of sevelamer, seeking another salt which would have equivalent phosphate  binding  properties  for  use  in  the  hyperphosphataemic  CKD  (chronic  kidney  disease) population  regardless  of  dialysis  status,  and  this  led  to  the  development  of  sevelamer  carbonate. Sevelamer carbonate is classified pharmacologically as a phosphate binder (ATC Code: V03AE02).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sevelamer carbonate has been formulated as a tablet and as a powder for oral suspension. The powder formulation  provides  an  alternative  dosage  form  for  those  patients  who  dislike  tablets  or  have difficulties in swallowing tablets, or who have a high pill burden. In addition, a powder formulation provides an appropriate dosage form for use in paediatric patients. However, no data in the paediatric population has been submitted.

## The indication as proposed by the applicant was:

'Renvela is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus in hyperphosphataemic adult patients with chronic kidney disease.'

## Approved indication:

'Renvela is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

Renvela is also indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis with serum phosphorus &gt; 1.78 mmol/l.

Renvela should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplement, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D3 or one of its analogues to control the development of renal bone disease.'

The recommended starting dose of sevelamer carbonate is 2.4 g or 4.8 g per day based on clinical needs and serum phosphorus level.  Renvela tablets or powder must be taken three times per day with meals. For  patients  previously  on  phosphate  binders  (sevelamer  hydrochloride  or  calcium  based),  Renvela should be given on a gram for gram basis with monitoring of serum phosphorus levels to ensure optimal daily doses.

Serum phosphorus levels must be monitored and the dose of sevelamer carbonate titrated every 2 to 4 weeks  until  an  acceptable  serum  phosphorus  level  is  reached,  with  regular  monitoring  thereafter. Patients taking Renvela should adhere to their prescribed diets.  The daily dose is expected to be an average of approximately 6 g per day.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Renvela is presented as film-coated tablets containing 800 mg of anhydrous sevelamer carbonate or as powder for oral suspension containing 1.6 g and 2.4 g of sevelamer carbonate. Sevelamer carbonate is a  new  sevelamer  salt,  a  cross-linked  polymer  with  the  same  structure  as  sevelamer  hydrochloride, where carbonate replaces chloride as the anion. While the anions differ for the two salts, the polymer, which is the active moiety responsible for binding of phosphate, is the same.

## Drug Substance (to be changed in the EPAR to 'Active Substance')

Sevelamer carbonate is a cross-linked poly (allylamine carbonate) polymer.  The cross-linking agent is epi-chlorohydrin  (1-chloro-2,3-epoxypropane).    The  cross-linking  groups  consist  of  two  secondary amine groups derived from the starting material, poly (allylamine hydrochloride) and one molecule of epichlorohydrin giving 2-hydroxypropyl linkers.  A portion of the amine is present as the carbonate salt,  at  14  -  21%  by  weight;  this  is  similar  to  sevelamer  hydrochloride  where  the  chloride  salt  is present at 15 - 20%, by weight.

There is no evidence for stereoregularity of the cross-linked polymer according to 1H and 13C NMR data.  Similarly,  there  is  no  stereochemical  preference  for  the  cross-linking  reaction,  i.e.,  randomly distributed crosslinks are expected.

Sevelamer  carbonate  is  a  highly  cross-linked  polymer  of  varying  size,  and  each  particle  can  be considered as one molecule.  Since the molecular weight is equal to the weight of the particle itself, the molecular weight distribution of a cross-linked polymer is a function of the distribution of particle

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sizes.

Sevelamer carbonate is a white to off-white, free-flowing, non-crystalline powder that is insoluble in all tested solvents.

## · Manufacture

Sevelamer  carbonate  is  manufactured  by  two  manufacturers  using  comparable  manufacturing processes.  Briefly,  sevelamer  carbonate  is  manufactured  by  cross-linking  (using  epichlorohydrin)  a partially neutralized solution of poly (allylamine hydrochloride) to give an insoluble gel (sevelamer hydrochloride). The gel is treated with strong base to generate sevelamer free base, which is washed with water to a conductivity limit that ensures adequate removal of the water soluble impurities. The free base suspension in water is reacted with carbon dioxide to give sevelamer carbonate, the product is then dried to give sevelamer carbonate powder which is screened and packaged.

The  comparability  of  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  all  processes  and  facilities  has  been demonstrated  and  compared  with  the  clinical  trial  material.  Considering  that  the  cross-linking  and carbonation chemistry to produce sevelamer carbonate are the same for both manufacturing processes, there were no adverse or unexpected outcomes as a result of the comparability analyses.

Sevelamer  carbonate has been characterised by density, elemental analysis, extractables and leachables,  TGA,  TGA-MS,  DSC,  FTIR,  Raman  spectroscopy,  particle  size  distribution  by  laser scattering, solid state 13C NMR, pH and X-ray powder diffraction.

## · Specification

The active substance tests and corresponding specifications have been chosen to conform to ICH Q6A and  include  such  tests  as  include  tests  for  appearance,    (visual  examination),  identification  (ATRFTIR),  loss  on  drying  (NIR  and  TGA),  titratable  amines  (Acid-base  titration),  carbonate  (NIR  and TGA), swell index, soluble oligomers (UV-VIS), residual substances (GC), allylamine (HPLC), heavy metals,  (Ph.  Eur.)  residue  on  ignition  (Ph.  Eur.),  total  halides  as  chloride  (titrimetry)  and  microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).Specification limits were developed from historical batch release and stability data as well as statistical analysis where applicable.

Batch analysis results were provided for sevelamer carbonate manufactured during various campaigns. All the batches complied with the requirements in the active substance specification.

- Stability

The stability of sevelamer carbonate was investigated in six production-scale batches at 25°C/60%RH for 18 months and in additional 3-production scale batches for 12 months. At accelerated conditions (40°C/75%RH),  results  were  provided  for  up  to  one  year.  Stability  studies  were  performed  under stressed conditions (exposure to light, high temperature, hydrolysis and freeze-thaw conditions).

Fourteen batches from the alternative manufacturer of sevelamer carbonate were placed on stability at real  time  storage  conditions  of  25  ±  2°C/60  ±  5%  RH  and  accelerated  storage  conditions  of  40  ± 2°C/75 ± 5% RH.

The  active  substance  was  tested  for  appearance,  loss  on  drying,  carbonate,  titratable  amines,  swell index, soluble oligomers and residual allylamine. The microbiological limits were controlled annually.

The data provided is sufficient to confirm the proposed re-test period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Drug Product 1 (film-coated tablets) (To be changed in the EPAR to 'Medicinal Product')

## · Pharmaceutical Development

Sevelamer carbonate was developed as an alternative to the existing sevelamer hydrochloride.

Sevelamer carbonate film-coated tablets contain 800 mg of sevelamer carbonate. They are packed in HDPE bottles containing either 30 or 180 tablets.  Film-coated tablets were chosen as it is the most convenient and suitable dosage form.

The  excipients  used  in  the  formulation  of  sevelamer  carbonate  are  those  typically  used  in  the preparation  of  film-coated  tablets  such  as  microcrystalline  cellulose,  zinc  stearate,  sodium  chloride, water and opadry (film-coating). All excipients comply with PhEur specifications, except the coating materials that are commercially available mixtures of standard components used for film coating. The compatibility of sevelamer carbonate with the proposed excipients was demonstrated through stability studies.

## · Adventitious Agents

None  of  the  excipients  used  in  the  formulation  of  sevelamer  carbonate  film-coated  tablets  are  of animal or human origin.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process for sevelamer carbonate film-coated tablets consists of the following major steps:

1. Dispensing and wetting
2. Milling and blending
3. Compression
4. Coating
5. Printing

The  manufacturing  process  development  of  the  drug  product  has  been  appropriately  described  and validated. Validation of the manufacturing process showed that the manufacturing process is robust and consistently produces a finished product, which meets the proposed requirements. Adequate inprocess controls have been selected to monitor the manufacturing process.

## · Product Specification

The finished product tests and corresponding specifications have been chosen to conform to ICH Q6A and include such tests as appearance, identification, loss on drying, uniformity of mass, disintegration, potency, residual substances and microbial purity.  Specification limits were developed from historical batch release and stability data as well as statistical analysis where applicable.  These lots were used clinically, for registration purposes or related to process validation.

The  analytical  methods  have  been  satisfactorily  described  and  validated  in  accordance  with  ICH guidelines. Batch analysis data was provided for 6 commercial-scale batches. The results comply with the specification and confirm the consistency of the product.

## · Stability of the Product

The stability studies included 13 batches manufactured with active substance from both suppliers. The studies  were  performed  at  long  term  (25°C/60%RH)  for  up  to  18  to  24  months  and  accelerated conditions (40°C/75%RH) for up to 6 to 12 months. In addition, two batches were also evaluated when exposed to stress conditions, i.e. open container (in-use), light, humidity and thermal cycling.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The finished product was tested for appearance, titratable amines, other residual substances, soluble oligomers, loss on drying, disintegration and microbiological limits.

No changes were observed for appearance of the tablets. In addition, the microbiological properties are satisfactory for the period tested. For all other parameters, the results are within the specifications and statistical evaluation of the results was also performed to detect any trend and to predict the shelf life.

In summary, the stability results support the shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

## Drug Product 2 (powder for oral suspension) (To be changed in the EPAR to 'Medicinal Product')

## · Pharmaceutical Development

Sevelamer  carbonate  powder  for  oral  suspension  was  developed  as  an  alternative  to  sevelamer carbonate tablets for patients with swallowing difficulties. It is packed in sachet containing 1.6 g and 2.4 g sevelamer carbonate. A child resistant sachet was selected made of foil consisting of ethylene methacrylic acid copolymer, polyester, low density polyethylene and aluminum foil laminate. Stability data indicates it provides an appropriate moisture barrier protection.

The  excipients  used  in  the  preparation  of  sevelamer  carbonate  powder  for  oral  suspension  are propylene  glycol  alginate  (PGA),  sucralose,  sodium  chloride,  ferric  oxide  yellow  and  citrus  cream flavouring.

The compatibility of the powder with the diluent for reconstitution (water) was studied for up to 24 hours. The reconstituted suspension was tested and all results were satisfactory up to 6 hours.

## · Adventitious Agents

All excipients are of vegetable or mineral origin therefore no TSE risk assessment is needed.

## · Manufacturing process

The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  (1)  blending  the  powder  and  (2)  filling  the  blend  into  the sachets. Different trials were performed to improve blend homogeneity and to prevent the presence of aggregates.  Screening  of  the  ingredients  and  the  use  of  a  suitable  mixer  were  demonstrated  to  be suitable to obtain a homogeneous blend without aggregates.

## · Product Specification

The specification for sevelamer carbonate includes validated tests for appearance (visual examination), appearance  of  the  reconstituted  product  (visual  examination),  identification  (FTIR),  Uniformity  of Mass (PhEur), total titratable amines (titration), residual substances (HPLC), loss on drying (TGA), residual soluble oligomers, microbial purity (PhEur).

Batch  data  was  provided  on  14  batches  of  sevelamer  carbonate.  The  results  comply  with  the specification and confirm the consistency of the product.

## · Stability of the Product

Stability studies were  performed  on  nine  clinical  batches  and  four  commercial  size  batches manufactured with active substance from both suppliers and packed in sachets of 0.8g, 1.6g, 2.4g, 3.2g and 7.2g. Although only the 1.6g and 2.4g pack sizes are proposed for marketing, the 0.8g and 1.6g pack  sizes  represent  the  worst  cases  when  the  headspace  and  contact  area  of  the  powder  with  the laminate  are  taken  into  consideration.  A  total  of  3  batches  of  each  the  1.6g  and  2.4g  sachets  were placed on stability.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The stability studies included 13 batches manufactured with active substance from both suppliers. The studies  were  performed  at  long  term  (25°C/60%RH)  for  up  to  18  to  24  months  and  accelerated conditions (40°C/75%RH) for up to 6 to 12 months. In addition, three batches were also evaluated when exposed to stress conditions, i.e., light, humidity and thermal cycling.

The  finished  product  was  tested  for  appearance,  appearance  of  the  reconstituted  product,  titratable amines,  allylamine,  soluble  oligomers,  loss  on  drying  and  microbiological  limits,  according  to  the specifications.

In summary, the stability results support the shelflife and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The active substance and both finished products have been adequately described. The excipients used in the preparation of the film-coated tablets and the powder for oral suspension, and the manufacturing process selected are typical of such preparations.

The film-coated tablets are manufactured by blending the ingredients with water before compression and  film-coating.  Sevelamer  carbonate  powder  for  oral  suspension  was  developed  to  provide  a convenient alternative dosing form to the sevelamer carbonate tablets that may benefit those patients who  dislike  or  have  difficulties  in  swallowing  multiple  tablets.  The  powder  for  oral  suspension  is packed  in  sachets  and  dispersed  in  water  before  administration.  The  pharmaceutical  development mainly focused on the taste and dispersion improvement.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Since the active moiety in both Renagel and Renvela, responsible for phosphate binding, is the same (i.e., sevelamer), non-clinical and clinical data generated using sevelamer hydrochloride are submitted to support the sevelamer carbonate application.

In addition, three studies were conducted with sevelamer carbonate in order to bridge from the toxicology and pharmacokinetic data already available for the hydrochloride salt of sevelamer::

- 28-day multi-dose radiolabelled ADME study in dogs (GT-153-PK-1)
- 4-week oral toxicity study in rats (GT-153-TX-1)
- 4-week oral toxicity study in dogs (GT-153-TX-2)

The  three  bridging  sevelamer  hydrochloride/carbonate  studies  were  stated  to  be  conducted  in compliance with GLP.

The majority of the studies conducted with sevelamer hydrochloride were done in compliance with GLP regulations. One toxicology study (TX95-217) was not fully GLP compliant, in that it did not have  proper  authentication  by  the  study  director.    In  addition,  some  of  the  non-pivotal  sevelamer hydrochloride studies providing additional information on coagulation, vitamin supplementation and electrolytes were not GLP compliant.

## Pharmacolog y

- Primary pharmacodynamics

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacodynamic action of sevelamer has been studied in vitro and in vivo . Sevelamer contains partially protonated polymer amines, which bind to negatively charged phosphates. As phosphate is liberated  during  digestion,  the  free  phosphate  can  diffuse  into  the  polymer  and  interact  with  the protonated  (cationic)  polymer  amines.  Phosphate  is  preferentially  bound  because  it  is  polyvalent. Since the polymer is not absorbed, neither are the phosphate ions and both are excreted in the faeces. The equivalence of the binding capacity for both sevelamer carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride has been established.

Several  short  term  (4-5  day)  animal  studies  were  conducted  to  investigate  the  phosphate  binding capacity  of  sevelamer  hydrochloride  in  vivo.  Oral  administration  of  sevelamer  to  rats  significantly increased faecal excretion of phosphate and decreased urinary phosphorus levels.

Sevelamer did not affect phosphataemia in dogs and there is a paradoxically increased phosphataemia in  rats.  Increased  serum  phosphorus  accompanied  with  a  decreased  urine  phosphorus  concentration was also observed in the rat toxicology studies and is in contrast with the intended pharmacological action of Renvela. However, the primary endpoint (reduction of gut phosphate absorption) has been demonstrated  in  animals.  Moreover  compensatory  mechanisms  might  complicate  the  relationship between phosphate absorption and phosphataemia, and these mechanisms might operate differently in animals and patients.

Studies  on  urinary  and  serum  electrolytes  in  rats  provide  evidence  that  sevelamer  releases  chloride ions,  in  exchange  for  hydrogen  phosphate  (HPO4).  Release  of  chloride  ions  was  confirmed  in  the repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs.

In  addition  to  binding  dietary  phosphates,  sevelamer  significantly  increased  faecal  excretion  of  bile acids which indicates that it also binds bile acids due to its ion exchange properties. This may lead to changes in absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and cholesterol. It may also affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs having enterohepatic circulation.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

The  only  effect  of  sevelamer  found  in  secondary  pharmacology  studies  was  an  increased  resting tension  of  guinea  pig  ileum  and  rat  gastric  fundus.  Sevelamer  had  no  effect  on  general  behaviour, locomotor activity or other CNS activity, body temperature, cardiovascular or respiratory control in experimental animals. These findings are in line with the known mode of action of sevelamer and the lack of absorption from the intestine.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

Safety  pharmacology  studies  have  not  been  performed  according  to  the  current  standards.  It  is recognised  that  safety  pharmacology  studies  may  not  be  needed  when  systemic  exposure  is demonstrated to be low.

An in vivo safety pharmacology study in anesthetized dogs with up to 2000 mg/kg did not show any adverse effects of the drug product.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Sevelamer  increases  faecal  excretion  of  bile  acids  and  thus  may  also  change  elimination  of  drugs having enterohepatic circulation.

## Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic studies carried out with sevelamer in rats and dogs collectively demonstrate that sevelamer  is  not  absorbed  from  the  gastro-intestinal  tract.  No  in  vivo  metabolism  studies  with sevelamer  carbonate  were  therefore  conducted  since  sevelamer  is  not  absorbed.  This  is  considered acceptable.

Sevelamer is excreted in faeces in both rats and dogs, with a slower excretion in dogs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The excretion rate in dogs seems to be different for the hydrochloride and the carbonate salt. In dogs, sevelamer carbonate is excreted faster than sevelamer hydrochloride (94 % and 50-75% of the total recovered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces within 24 hours respectively). Only trace amounts of radioactivity were found in the urine.

The applicant conducted some preclinical drug interaction studies. Studies in beagle dogs showed that absorption  of  oestrone,  propranolol  and  thyroxin  may  be  delayed  by  concomitant  absorption  with sevelamer. A possible interaction with thyroxin has been confirmed in humans (SPC section 4.4 and 4.5).  A  possible  interaction  with  oestrone  and  propranolol  is  not  reflected  in  the  SPC.  However,  a general statement is included in the SPC section 4.5 :

'Renvela  is  not  absorbed  and  may  affect  the  bioavailability  of  other  medicinal  products.  When administering any medicinal product where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before or three hours after Renvela, or the physician should consider monitoring blood levels.'

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

Single  dose  toxicity  studies  in  rodents  and  dogs  showed  that  sevelamer  has  a  low  acute  toxicity profile, with the highest doses tested being well tolerated.

- Repeat dose toxicity

Repeated dose toxicity of sevelamer after oral administration was studied in rats (up to 26 weeks) and dogs  (up  to  52  weeks).  Chronic  sevelamer  treatment  was  generally  well  tolerated.  In  the  rat  studies increased numbers of haemorrhages were found, with mortalities particularly in males at high dose groups (10 g/kg/day). When high dose sevelamer was given with fat soluble vitamins D, E and K no haemorrhages were seen. Moreover, APTT and PT were increased (APTT being the most sensitive parameter).  Both  effects  are  likely  to  be  due  to  reduced  absorption  of  fat  soluble  vitamins  and particularly that of vitamin K.

Other observations in rats and dogs were decreased levels of vitamins D and E (but not vitamin A). Also, vitamin D was inconsistently increased or decreased in females.

In  a  number  of  studies  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT),  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST),  alkaline phosphatase (AP) were increased in both male and female animals. Since the rises were only moderate and  since  no  histopathological  changes  in  organs  contributing  to  enzyme  levels  in  blood  were observed, these observations are considered of no clinical relevance.

Treatment with sevelamer hydrochloride may be associated with an increase in serum chloride and/or reduction  in  serum  bicarbonate  and  the  potential  for  worsening  of  pre-existing  metabolic  acidosis. The  chloride  anion  liberated  from  the  sevelamer  backbone  may  contribute  to  these  effects.  The applicant developed sevelamer carbonate, expecting that acid base disturbances observed in clinical studies  with  sevelamer  hydrochloride  would  not  occur  with  another  salt.  However,  in  the  repeated dose toxicity in rats and dogs, the impact on acid-base balance of sevelamer carbonate as compared to sevelamer hydrochloride was not studied.

No target organ toxicity was observed in rats or dogs as evidenced by gross anatomical observations and histopathological studies. Some evidence of gastrointestinal toxicity was found in rats, as gastric mucosa thickening was occasionally seen (a dose-dependent phenomenon in female rats). In addition, eosinophilic crystalloid material, which is likely to be sevelamer based, was found in intestinal lumen in high dose rats. A possible explanation for this is that high dose sevelamer could induce submucosal oedema  due  to  increased  osmotic  pressure.  These  findings  were  not  considered  to  be  of  clinical relevance.

- Genotoxicity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sevelamer hydrochloride was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay. After metabolic activation  sevelamer  hydrochloride  caused  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  the  number  of structural  chromosome  aberrations  in  a  mammalian  cytogenic  assay  with  Chinese  Hamster  Ovary (CHO) cells.  The in  vivo study  was  considered  invalid  since  sevelamer  is  not  absorbed.  However, additional  mutagenicity  assays  are  not  requested,  since  no  concerns  related  to  genotoxic  properties from  sevelamer  were  raised  from  repeated  dose  toxicity,  carcinogenicity  or  reproductive  toxicity studies.

## · Carcinogenicity

## Carcinogenicity studies were performed in mice and rats over a period of 104 weeks.

In  the  mice  study,  lymphomas  were  observed  in  the  high  dose  female  group  (50,000 ppm),  which represents a two to four-fold safety factor. The percentage of lymphomas in female mice, was above the limit of control groups. However, when compared to the historical control data (same strain, same site) of the incidence of lymphoma in studies carried out within a time span of +/- 5 years of the study termination, a wide range of up to 46 % lymphoma incidences was detected in female control animals. CHMP accepted that the occurrence of lymphoma is not related to treatment with sevelamer.

Treatment at the high dose of 3 g/kg/day in male rats is associated with proliferative findings in the transitional epithelium of the urinary tract. In contrast to what is claimed by the applicant (20 times the maximum projected human dose), this dose represents only a two-fold safety factor when the doses are compared on a mg/m 2 basis (for a human max dose of 14.4 g/d). In these high dose male rats, both the incidence and severity of transitional cell hyperplasia were increased in the kidney and in the urinary bladder  when  compared  with  the  control  groups.  Urinary  bladder  transitional  papillomas  and carcinoma were also observed in the high dose males. The applicant considers these changes to be a response to the abnormal crystalline deposits evident in the urine as well as to the systemic mineral imbalance  and  as  such  do  not  represent  a  carcinogenic  effect.  CHMP  agreed  that  tumor  formation most  likely  occurs  as  a  secondary  effect  and  a  direct  carcinogenic  effect  of  the  substance  is  very unlikely, since sevelamer is not absorbed. However, as this is clearly a treatment related effect, the results  of  this  study  are  included  in  the  SPC  section  5.3.  Furthermore  as  requested  by  CHMP  the Applicant committed to conduct further studies to investigate the mechanism of action of proliferative findings  in  the  transitional  epithelium  addressing  questions  such  as  the  nature  of  the  crystalline deposits seen in the urine, under what conditions they are formed, whether there any critical conditions to look for to prevent their occurrence, and if similar crystals can occur in humans. The results of such studies will apply equally to both Renvela and Renagel.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Reproduction toxicity was investigated in rats and rabbits.

Sevelamer hydrochloride did not impair the fertility of male or female rats in a dietary administration study.

In pregnant rats given sevelamer hydrochloride during organogenesis, reduced or irregular ossification of foetal bones occurred in mid- and high dose groups, probably due to a reduced absorption of fatsoluble vitamin D. This was at a human equivalent dose of twice the maximum clinical trial dose.

In  pregnant  rabbits  given  sevelamer  hydrochloride  by  gavage  during  organogenesis,  an  increase  of early resorption occurred in the high dose group . This was at a human equivalent dose of three times the maximum clinical trial dose.

The fact that sevelamer reduces the absorption of different vitamins including folic acid is included in the  SPC  Pregnancy  section  4.6  with  a  cross-reference  to  paragraph  4.4  Special  warnings  and precautions for use.

A pre-and post-natal development study was performed. The highest dose tested was 1000mg/kg/day, since  a  higher  dose  of  1.5  or  2 g/kg  was  not  feasible  via  oral  gavage  without  stimulating  a  reflux response. Since the Applicant accepted to include the warnings in the SPC 4.4 on reduced absorption

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of several vitamins and the warning in the SPC 4.6 on use in pregnancy and lactation, the study design of the pre-and post-natal development study has been accepted.

- Toxicokinetics

Since sevelamer carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride are non-absorbed products, no toxicokinetic analyses were performed; this is acceptable.

- Local tolerance

No local tolerance studies were performed, and this is acceptable for an orally administered product.

- Other toxicity studies

Coagulation  studies  were  conducted  with  sevelamer  hydrochloride;  these  were  discussed  under  the section Repeat Dose Toxicity.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The applicant has provided an environmental risk assessment (Phase I, Phase II Tier A &amp; B). The use of sevelamer carbonate does not seem to represent a risk to the environment.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The sought indication for sevelamer carbonate (tablet and powder) is for control of serum phosphorus in  hyperphosphataemic  adult  patients  with  chronic  kidney  disease  (CKD).  This  includes  both  CKD patients on dialysis (haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) and CKD patients not on dialysis. In  addition,  the  applicant  investigated  a  different  dosing  regimen  (once  daily  (OD)  of  sevelamer carbonate versus three times per day (TID)). The latter corresponds to the current dosing regimen of sevelamer hydrochloride.

To support the current application, clinical efficacy was studied in four phase 3 studies with sevelamer carbonate  (Table  xx).    No  sevelamer  carbonate  studies  were  performed  in  patients  on  peritoneal dialysis.

Supportive  data  is  provided  from  existing  studies  conducted  with  sevelamer  hydrochloride,  which have  been  previously  submitted  and  assessed  as  part  of  the  sevelamer  hydrochloride  MAA  and subsequent post-approval activities

Scientific advice was sought by Genzyme regarding the design of a clinical dose titration study using sevelamer  carbonate  in  hyperphosphataemic  CKD  patients  not  on  dialysis  (study  SVCARB00105). Advice was provided by the CHMP on 26 May 2005. The Company did not completely follow the Scientific Advice; the points of dissent (number of patients studied and comparator-arm) are discussed in the section 'Clinical Efficacy'.

## GCP

The pivotal Clinical trials (GD3-163-201, SVCARB00205, GD3-199-301 and SVCARB00105) were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A routine EMEA GCP Inspection was done at the sponsor site Genzyme Europe BV, The Netherlands and at one investigator site (UK) for the clinical study SVCARB00205, in accordance with Article 57 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004.

These  inspections  revealed  critical  and  major  issues,  with  regard  to  eligibility  criteria,  drug compliance, and adverse event reporting:

Inspection at the investigator site revealed critical, major and minor findings.

Inspection at the sponsor site revealed critical and major findings.

Based on these deviations the inspection team concluded that the conduct of the study SVCARB00205 at the investigator site was not fully compliant with GCP and the sponsor did not adequately manage this non-compliance.  The nature of the shortcomings and critical finding are of relevance for the potential use of this study in a Marketing Authorization Application. The inspectors recommended  the  assessors  to  carefully  look  into  the  non-compliances  with  the  protocol (especially eligibility criteria, drug compliance, adverse event reporting) in order to assess their importance  for  the  integrity  of  the  statistical  analysis  of  the  PPS  and  the  extrapolation  of  the conclusion to the population as a whole.

The inspected investigator site participated in two of the carbonate pivotal clinical trials: SVCARB00205  &amp;  SVCARB00105 .  As  critical  and  major  observations  were  made  during  the inspection  of  this  site,  compliance  with  GCP  for  both  trials  was  questioned.    As  these  trials  are proposed to be supportive for the powder formulation on one side and the Applicant`s broad indication claim - to include non dialysis CKD patients- a major objection was endorsed by CHMP.

In response to the CHMP List of Outstanding Issues the Applicant presented a sensitivity analysis and addressed this issue at the oral explanation.

Based on the data presented the majority of the CHMP members accepted that the proposed data could be accepted to support the claimed indications, provided that additional data are gathered in a postmarketing study to reinforce the safety data set (see discussion under Risk Management Plan below).

## Pharmacokinetics

To support the pharmacokinetics of sevelamer carbonate, the pharmacokinetic studies submitted for sevelamer hydrochloride are also submitted in this application:

- GTC-10-801 - absorption study of C14- sevelamer hydrochloride
- ICR013769 - interaction study with digoxin
- ICR013821 - interaction study with warfarin
- GTC-45-803 - interaction study with metoprolol
- GTC-45-804 - interaction study with enalapril
- GTC-45-807 - interaction study with ciprofloxacin
- GTC-45-808 - interaction study with iron

In addition, an in vitro equilibrium and kinetic binding study (study TR-2527-07-SC) is submitted to bridge data between different formulations and salts. As the 2 products only differ regarding the salt form,  it  is  considered  acceptable  to  use  the  studies  submitted  for  sevelamer  hydrochloride.  A difference in pharmacokinetics is not expected, as the sevelamer molecule will not be absorbed.

- Absorption

Based  upon  a  study  in  20  healthy  subjects  (young  and  elderly)  and  use  of  14C-labelled  medicinal product, sevelamer (at the clinically relevant daily dose of approximately 7g) is not absorbed from the gastro-intestinal  tract.  Less  than  0.2%  of  the  administered  radioactivity  dose  could  be  recovered  in urine, but this may represent unlabelled radioactivity, and absorption in healthy subjects is considered negligible.  However,  it  cannot  be  ruled  out  that  absorption  may  increase  in  the  presence  of  bowel obstruction or inflammatory bowel disease.

Comparison of trial formulations with finished product:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Sevelamer is not absorbed and therefore conventional pharmacokinetic studies cannot be applied to bridge  data  between  different  formulations  and  salts.  Instead  an  in  vitro  equilibrium  and  kinetic binding study (study TR-2527-07-SC) is submitted, to compare sevelamer HCl, sevelamer carbonate tablets  and  sevelamer  carbonate  powder  for  oral  suspension.  The  applied  in  vitro  method  to  study phosphate  binding  is  adapted  from  the  FDA  guidance  for  the  in  vitro  method  for  cholestyramine. Phosphate binding  was  evaluated  using  different  phosphate  concentrations  (2.5  and  38.7  mM),  and with or without pre-treatment with acid, as well as constant concentrations of phosphate for varying lengths of time. The in vitro studies showed comparable phosphate binding of sevelamer hydrochloride, and sevelamer carbonate (tablets and powder).

- Distribution
- Elimination
- Dose proportionality and time dependencies
- Special populations

As sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed; these pharmacokinetic studies were not possible. This is also considered to be the case in special patient groups such as patients with impaired renal function or impaired hepatic function.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

Sevelamer  may  bind  active  medicinal  product  substances,  and  thereby  interfere  in  the  absorption. According  to  preclinical  studies,  sevelamer  is  a  bile-acid  binding  compound.  In  contrast,  in  vivo clinical  pharmacokinetic  interaction  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  did  not  reveal  any  clinically significant  interactions  between  sevelamer  and  digoxin  (known  to  interact  with  cholestyramine, enterohepatic circulation), warfarin (known to interact with cholestyramine, positive in vitro binding to sevelamer), enalapril (positive in vitro binding), metoprolol, and iron.

For ciprofloxacin, a statistically significant decrease by about 50% in AUC and Cmax is observed.

As was the case for sevelamer hydrochloride, interactions are difficult to predict. In line with the SPC of  sevelamer  hydrochloride  a  general  statement  is  included  in  the  SPC  with  regard  to  a  possible interaction where a reduction in the bioavailability could have a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy, and administration of the medicinal product should be at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer carbonate administration.

The amount of data available on interactions is limited; as these interactions are difficult to predict CHMP was  of  the  opinion  that  the  Applicant  should  put  much  more  effort  in  elucidating  its  full interaction profile. Two clinical studies in healthy subjects were performed to assess the interaction profile  of  larger  (9.6g),  single  doses  of  sevelamer  carbonate  powder  with  digoxin  and  warfarin, respectively.  The  Clinical  Study  Report  for  the  healthy  volunteer  study  (SVCARB01107)  with warfarin  was  submitted  with  the  responses  to  the  Day  120  List  of  Questions.  Sevelamer  carbonate powder was found to have no effect on the bioavailability of warfarin. The second interaction study with digoxin (SVCARB01307) has been completed. The applicant has committed to submit the study report as part of the Follow-up measures.

## · Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials Not applicable

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

Sevelamer carbonate is a non-absorbed, insoluble, cross-linked polymer formulated as a coated tablet or powder for oral suspension. The amines in the polymer exist in a partly protonated form and can bind to negatively charged ions. It exerts is primary pharmacodynamic action in the small intestine through binding of negatively charged phosphates liberated during the digestive process. Phosphate sequestered  in  the  polymer  is  not  absorbed  into  the  body,  but  passes  through  the  intestine  and  is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

excreted  in  the  faeces  resulting  in  reduced  phosphorus  absorption  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract.. While the anions differ for the sevelamer carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride, the polymer itself, the active moiety responsible for binding of phosphate, is the same.

- Primary and Secondary pharmacology

The primary pharmacodynamic action of sevelamer hydrochloride (binding of dietary phosphate) was adequately demonstrated before in the development of sevelamer hydrochloride. As the active moiety responsible for binding of phosphate is the same in sevelamer carbonate, it is acceptable that no new pharmacodynamic studies were performed.

Study GTC-02-101 was a single centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study  in  healthy  volunteers  on  a  phosphate-controlled  diet.  The  study  demonstrated  the  phosphatebinding capacity of sevelamer following repeated dose administration (placebo or 1, 2.5 and 5 g t.i.d. for 8 days). A dose-dependent decrease in total urine phosphorus (indicating decreased absorption of phosphorus) and increases in the ratio of stool to urine phosphorus (to assess the effect of sevelamer hydrochloride on dietary phosphorus absorption) were observed

Secondary pharmacodynamic actions of sevelamer relate to the ability to bind bile acids, which was shown for  sevelamer  hydrochloride in  vitro and in  vivo in  experimental  animal  models.  In  clinical studies, sevelamer  hydrochloride  lowered  low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL)  and  total cholesterol. The lowering of LDL may be beneficial to the patient as most CKD patients on dialysis have cardiovascular morbidity and approximately 30% to 40% have elevated LDL cholesterol levels. Therefore, the effect on LDL cholesterol was considered a secondary efficacy endpoint in the studies and is discussed in the assessment of clinical efficacy.

## Clinical efficacy

Efficacy data for sevelamer carbonate are based on four clinical studies:

In  CKD  patients  on  dialysis  two  trials  were  designed  to  demonstrate  therapeutic  equivalence  of sevelamer carbonate with sevelamer hydrochloride (study GD3-163-201 and study SVCARB00205) in CKD patients on haemodialysis.  One study (study GD3-199-301) was designed to demonstrate noninferiority  of  sevelamer  carbonate  powder  once  daily  to  sevelamer  hydrochloride  tables  three  times daily in CKD patients on haemodialysis.

In  CKD  patients  not  on  dialysis  one  study  (study  SVCARB00105 ) was  designed  to  demonstrate efficacy and safety of sevelamer carbonate in CKD patients not on dialysis.

No studies with sevelamer carbonate were performed in peritoneal dialysis patients. The applicant had performed one study with sevelamer hydrochloride in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (REN-00304).

An  overview  of  the  clinical  development  program  (efficacy  and  safety  studies)  with  sevelamer carbonate is given on the next page in tabular format (table 1).

- Dose response study(ies)

No  separate  dose-response  studies  were  performed  with  sevelamer  carbonate  to  be  used  in  CKD patients on haemodialysis. The dose was based on the titrated dose of sevelamer hydrochloride obtained during  the  run-in  period  (studies  GD3-163-201  and  SVCARB00205)  or  the  highest  starting  dose  of sevelamer hydrochloride as proposed in the SPC (study GD3-199-301). The starting dose of sevelamer hydrochloride ranges from 2.4 g/day to 4.8 g/day, and is titrated at regular intervals based on serum phosphorus levels until an acceptable serum phosphorus level is reached. If prescribed as an alternative phosphate  binder,  sevelamer  hydrochloride  is  given  in  equivalent  doses  on  a  gram  for  gram  basis compared to the patient's previous phosphate binder.

The starting dose of sevelamer carbonate in CKD patients not on dialysis (study SVCARB00105) was based on the phase 2 dose titration study with sevelamer hydrochloride in CKD patients not on dialysis (study  GTC-45-204,).  Study  SVCARB00105  is  both  a  dose  titration  study  and  a  pivotal  study  for clinical efficacy and safety in CKD patients not on dialysis. Therefore this study is discussed in the section main studies.

Only  two  small  trials  are  submitted  comparing  sevelamer  hydrochloride  with  sevelamer  carbonate. The  studies  GD3-163-201  (sevelamer  carbonate  tablets)  and  SVCARB00205  (sevelamer  carbonate powder) were designed to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence of sevelamer carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride in CKD  patients on haemodialysis. Study GD3-163-201  was a double-blind, randomized, crossover study whereas study SVCARB00205 was an open-label, randomized, crossover

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study. Because of the similarity in study design and methodology, the methods of these studies are described in a combined section. The results of the individual studies are described separately.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Adult  (&gt;18  years)  patients  with  CKD  on  haemodialysis  treatment  for  three  months  or  longer,  who were on oral phosphate binder treatment.

Other major inclusion criteria included stable vitamin D dose, stable diet, stable dose of cinacalcet, negative pregnancy test and an acceptable contraceptive method. Patients should be willing and able to avoid antacids and phosphorus binders containing aluminium, magnesium, calcium or lanthanum for the duration of the study unless prescribed as an evening calcium supplement.

In study GD3-163-201, serum phosphorus was ≥ 1.0 and ≤ 2.1 mmol/l and iPTH ≤ 66 pmol/l before screening  and  at  randomisation.  In  study  SVCARB00205,  serum  phosphorus  was ≥ 1.0  and ≤ 2.3 mmol/l and iPTH ≤ 99 pmol/l before screening. Patients had a serum phosphorus level ≥ 1.8 mmol/l after the two weeks washout period and serum phosphorus was ≥ 1.0 and ≤ 2.1 mmol/l and iPTH ≤ 88 pmol/l prior to randomisation.

Major exclusion criteria included poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled hypertension, active dysphagia, swallowing disorder, bowel obstruction, or severe gastrointestinal motility disorder.

## Treatments

Both  studies  were  cross-over  studies  in  which  patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  two  treatment sequences; sevelamer carbonate followed by sevelamer hydrochloride or vice versa (eight weeks each in study GD3-163-201 and four weeks each in study SVCARB00205). The major difference in study design was the place of the washout period. In study GD3-163-201 the patients entered a two-week washout  period  after  the  randomisation  period  whereas  in  study  SVCARB00205  patients  entered  a two-week washout period prior to the sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period (see Figure 1).

The randomisation period was preceded by a sevelamer hydrochloride run-in period. The starting dose of the sevelamer hydrochloride was based on the most recently prescribed phosphate binder dose prior to screening on a gram per gram basis and with an opportunity to titrate the sevelamer hydrochloride dose  (once  in  study  GD3-163-201  and  twice  in  study  SVCARB00205  at  week  -3  and  -2  before randomisation). The starting dose during the randomised treatment periods was individualised for each patient  based  on  the  prescribed  daily  dose  during  the  run-in  period  and  patients  were  instructed  to maintain a fixed daily dose throughout both treatment periods. In study SVCARB00205, patients were instructed to return to their pre-study phosphate binder medication at the end of the treatment period and patients returned for a follow-up visit 7 days later.

During  the  randomisation  period,  patients  had  weekly  visits  in  study  GD3-163-201  during  each treatment period. In study SVCARB00205, patients had weekly study visits for the first 2 weeks and 2 study visits during each of the last 2 weeks of each treatment period.

## Dosing

Study GD3-163-201: The mean actual dose during the randomized treatment periods was 5.8 ± 2.8 g/day of sevelamer carbonate tablets and 5.6 ± 2.9 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets in the full analysis population (FAS, for definition, see section on statistical methods). In the Per Protocol Set (PPS), the mean actual dose during the randomized treatment periods was 6.0 ± 2.8 g/day of sevelamer carbonate tablets and 6.0 ± 2.8 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets.

In study SVCARB00205, the mean actual dose during the randomised treatment periods was 5.9 ± 2.8 g/day of sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.5 ± 3.3 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets in the FAS.

In  the  PPS,  the  mean  actual  dose  during  the  randomised  treatment  periods  was  6.0  ±  3.1  g/day  of sevelamer carbonate powder and 6.4 ± 3.3 g/day of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets.

In both studies, none of the patients changed their prescribed dose during the randomized treatment periods.

## Objectives

## Primary objectives:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Therapeutic equivalence of sevelamer carbonate tablets (GD3-163-201) or powder (SVCARB00205) and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (dosed TID with meals) on the control of serum phosphorus
- To compare the safety and tolerability of sevelamer carbonate tablets (GD3-163-201) or powder (SVCARB00205) and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (dosed TID with meals)

## Secondary objectives:

- To compare the effects of sevelamer carbonate tablets (GD3-163-201) or powder (SVCARB00205) and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (dosed TID with meals) on serum lipid profiles

SVCARB00205 only:

- To compare the effects of sevelamer carbonate powder and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (dosed TID with meals) on serum calcium-phosphorus product

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary efficacy endpoint:

The time-weighted mean of the serum phosphorus values was used as the primary efficacy endpoint. In study GD3-163-201, this endpoint was calculated from the last two weeks of each treatment period (mean  of  non-missing  measurements  from  week  6  and  8  and  from  week  14  and  16).  In  study SVCARB00205, this endpoint was calculated from the last two weeks of each treatment period (mean of non-missing assessments from week 3, 3a, 4 and 4a and from week 7, 7a, 8, 8a).

Safety  endpoints: These  included  incidence  of  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  serious  adverse  events (SAEs),  clinically  relevant  changes  in  vital  signs  and  clinically  relevant  changes  in  laboratory evaluations. Changes were assessed from baseline until end of treatment (ET, week 8 or week 16 in study GD3-163-201 and week 4a or 8a in study SVCARB00205). Clinical relevance was assessed by the investigator and included a medical intervention.

## Secondary efficacy endpoint:

Study  GD3-163-201:  The  mean  serum  lipid  levels  (total  cholesterol,  HDL  cholesterol,  LDL cholesterol, triglycerides) calculated by the mean of the measurements at weeks 4 and 8 or the mean of the measurements of weeks 12 and 16.

Study  SVCARB00205:  Serum  lipid  levels  (total  cholesterol,  HDL  cholesterol,  LDL  cholesterol, triglycerides) at the end of the treatment period (week 4a and week 8a).

For  calcium-phosphorus  product,  the  time-weighted  mean  of  the  serum  calcium-phosphorus  values calculated from the last two weeks of each treatment period (mean of non-missing assessments from week 3, 3a, 4 and 4a and from week 7, 7a, 8, 8a) were used.

## Sample size

Study GD3-163-201: One hundred twenty enrolled and 80 randomised patients were planned for this study.  Sample  size  calculations  showed  that  7  evaluable  patients  per  sequence  for  a  total  of  14 evaluable  patients  were  required  to  achieve  90%  power  to  detect  equivalence  based  on  a  5% equivalence test. This was based on the assumption that the expected ratio of means is 1 and the within subject mean square error from a crossover analysis of variance (ANOVA) is 0.0265. The latter was derived from a simulation based on serum phosphorus levels during a steady-state phase of a prior parallel arm study since no direct data was available. Additional patients were planned to account for dropouts and to expose additional patients to study treatment for the evaluation of safety.

Study  SVCARB00205: Allowing  for  withdrawals,  a  sample  size  of  12  patients  per  sequence (powder/tablet vs. tablet/powder; 24 in total) are required to be randomized to achieve 90% power to detect equivalence based on a 5% Two One-Sided Test (TOST) equivalence test (i.e., reject both the null hypotheses that the ratio of the powder to tablet mean is less than 0.8 and that the ratio of the powder to tablet mean is above 1.25 at the 5% level) assuming that the expected ratio of means is 1 and the standard deviation of the difference between treatments on the log scale is 0.22 (derived from pilot data comparing once-a-day versus TID dosing with sevelamer hydrochloride tablets). For both studies, no interim analyses were planned.

## Randomisation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study  GD3-163-201:  The  patients  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  fashion  to  one  of  the  two  treatment sequences:  sevelamer  carbonate  for  8  weeks  followed  by  sevelamer  hydrochloride  for  8  weeks  or sevelamer hydrochloride for 8 weeks followed by sevelamer carbonate for 8 weeks. No stratification was performed.

Study SVCARB00205: Patients were randomised within each site on a 1:1 basis in blocks of 4 to one of  the  two  treatment  sequences:  sevelamer  carbonate  powder  TID  for  four  weeks  followed  by sevelamer hydrochloride tablets TID for four weeks, or sevelamer hydrochloride tablets TID for four weeks followed by sevelamer carbonate powder TID for four weeks.

## Blinding (masking)

In study GD3-163-201 the patients were blinded to the study medication during the run-in period and both the investigator and the patients were blinded to the treatment sequence assignment and study treatment during the randomisation period. There was no blinding in study SVCARB00205.

## Statistical methods

## Populations analysed:

The safety set included all randomised patients who received at least one dose of randomised study medication.  The  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  included  all  randomized  patients  with  at  least  one  postbaseline assessment of serum phosphorus. In study GD3-163-201, the Per Protocol Set (PPS) included all FAS-evaluable patients who completed both Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2 with no significant protocol deviations. In study SVCARB00205, the PPS included all FAS-evaluable patients who completed at least 3 weeks of each treatment period and with no significant protocol deviations.

## Primary analysis:

The primary analysis set used in both studies to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence was the PerProtocol  Population.  Therapeutic  equivalence  was  assessed  using  natural-log  transformed  timeweighted mean serum phosphorus data. Least squares means for each treatment and the mean squared error  from  a  2x2  ANOVA  with  a  random  subject  effect  and  fixed  sequence,  period,  and  treatment effects was used to derive the 90% confidence interval for the difference between sevelamer carbonate (test)  and  sevelamer  hydrochloride  (reference)  data  on  the  log  scale.  Back  transformation  to  the original  scale  yielded  an  estimate  of  the  ratio  (test/reference)  and  corresponding  90%  confidence interval which was the basis of a 5% Two One-Sided Test (TOST) equivalence test. This test required that  the  90%  confidence  interval  for  the  ratio  be  within  the  interval  (0.80,  1.25)  to  conclude equivalence.

If the sequence effect is significant (p-value ≤ 0.05), then equivalence inferences will be drawn from the treatment period 1 results.

The primary analysis set for safety included all randomised patients who were treated with at least one dose  of  randomised  study  medication.  Adverse  events  were  collected  at  each  visit  and  treatment groups were compared using McNemar's test (statistical analysis only in study GD3-163-201). Vital signs and laboratory measurements were compared among treatment groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, while within treatment group changes were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

## Secondary analyses:

For  the  secondary  efficacy  analysis  to  assess  the  differences  between  sevelamer  carbonate  and sevelamer  hydrochloride  dosing  on  lipids  (total  cholesterol,  HDL  cholesterol,  LDL  cholesterol  and triglyceride  levels)  or  calcium-phosphorus  product  (SVCARB00205  only),  a  2x2  ANOVA  model based on natural-log transformed data with a random subject effect and fixed sequence, period, and treatment effects was used. Comparisons between the treatment groups were tested at the 5% level.

In  study  GD3-163-201  the  mean  of  the  lipid  measurements  from  the  two  visits  in  each  treatment period  (mean  of  Weeks  4  and  8  and  mean  of  Weeks  12  and  16)  was  used,  while  in  study SVCARB00205  lipids  were  assessed  only  at  the  end  of  the  study  treatment  (week  4  and  8).  For calcium-phosphorus product (study SVCARB00205) the time-weighted average was used.

In  study  SVCARB00205  also  the  geometric  least  squares  means  ratio  and  corresponding  90% confidence  intervals  was  derived  for  lipids  and  calcium-phosphorus  product  as  described  for  the primary efficacy parameter to provide a relative sense of magnitude of any difference that is observed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Changes in the planned analysis:

The original protocol of study GD3-163-201 specified that lipids would be assessed for equivalence. At the analysis planning phase and prior to unblinding, it was decided that such a hypothesis was not necessary  and  a  simple  assessment  of  differences  in  lipid  profiles  between  the  two  regimens  was appropriate.

The  Wilcoxon  signed  rank  test  was  used  rather  than  the  Wilcoxon  rank  sum  test  to  compare  the treatment  regimens  for  the  bicarbonate  concentration  of  the  dialysate  bath,  dietary  parameters, laboratory measures and vital signs due to the paired nature of the data. No changes were made in study SVCARB00205.

## RESULTS

## RESULTS OF STUDY GD3-163-201

## Participant flow

Overall,  101  patients  were  enrolled  for  screening,  97  entered  the  sevelamer  hydrochloride  run-in period  and  79  were  randomised  to  treatment  sequence  1  (carbonate/hydrochloride)  or  sequence  2 (hydrochloride/carbonate) (see Figure 2). Seven patients did not enter the randomisation phase due to withdrawal of consent, 4 patients did not meet exclusion/inclusion criteria, two patients experienced adverse events and 5 were excluded because of other reasons.

Of the 40 patients assigned to the carbonate/hydrochloride sequence, 39 (97.5%) completed treatment period  1  and  37  (92.5%)  patients  completed  treatment  period  2.  One  patient  discontinued  during treatment  period  1  because  of  non-compliance  with  study  procedures,  one  patient  discontinued treatment period 2 because of an adverse event and one due to another reason. Twenty-five patients (62.5%) entered the washout period, 12 withdrew consent. The original study design did not include the  two-week phosphate binder washout period, but was added to the study to confirm the patients included in the study were hyperphosphataemic. As this change was implemented while the study was in progress, not all patients opted to participate in the washout period.

Of the 39 patients assigned to the hydrochloride/carbonate sequence, 35 (89.7%) completed treatment period  1.  All  patients  discontinued  because  of  an  adverse  event.  One  patient  discontinued  between treatment period 1 and 2 because of an adverse event. Of the 34 patients entering treatment period 2, 32  (82.1%)  completed  this  period.  One  patient  died  and  the  other  patient  was  lost  to  follow-up. Twenty-two patients entered the washout period and 21 completed this period.

## Recruitment

The first patient signed informed consent on March 30, 2005 and the last patient completed on March 15, 2006. The study was conducted in the United States.

## Conduct of the study

There  was  one  protocol  amendment  before  the  end  of  the  study,  dated  July  11,  2005.  The  most important change was the inclusion of the two-week phosphate binder washout period, to confirm that patients included in the study were hyperphosphataemic.

## Baseline data

The  most  important  baseline  characteristics  of  the  safety  set  are  shown  in  Table  3.  Overall,  the baseline characteristics were comparable for both sequences. About 50% of the patients was male and the mean age was 58 years. The primary cause of CKD was diabetes, followed by hypertension. The median time  on  dialysis  was  3.2  years  for  patients  receiving  treatment  sequence  1  and  2  years  for patients  receiving  treatment  sequence  2.  The  percentage  of  patients  with  partial  parathyroidectomy varied from 3%-8% and over 80% of the patients were on vitamin D.

## Concomitant medication / dietary intake

All patients used concomitant medication, which reflects the disease status of the patients. For patients receiving sequence 1, 14 started or changed vitamin D analogues while on sevelamer carbonate and 7 while on sevelamer hydrochloride. For patients receiving sequence 2, 9 started or changed vitamin D analogues while on sevelamer carbonate and 7 while on sevelamer hydrochloride. The dietary intake of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D seemed comparable during both treatment periods within one sequence.

## Numbers analysed

Seventy-nine  patients  were  randomized,  but  one  patient  never  received  study  medication,  therefore there  are  78  patients  in  the  safety  set.  All  patients  in  safety  set  had  post-baseline  efficacy  data, therefore the FAS (Full Analysis Set) also included 78 patients. The total number of patients included in  the  PPS  (Per  Protocol  Set)  was  56.  Twenty-two  (22)  patients  had  had  one  or  more  protocol deviations for which they were excluded from the PPS: 9 patients had a greater than 15% difference in compliance between treatment periods, 9 patients had less than 6 weeks of treatment in either of the treatment periods, 7 patients changed their Vitamin D or Vitamin D analogue significantly, one patient had a significant study medication interruption, and 1 patient used a proscribed medication.

Three  patients  were  treated  in  an  opposite  sequence  than  was  delineated  by  the  randomization schedule. These patients were analyzed according to their randomized sequence for the FAS, but were analyzed according to their actual sequence for the safety set and PPS analyses.

## Outcomes and estimation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Primary efficacy endpoint

For  patients  in  sequence  1,  the  mean  serum  phosphorus  was  1.5  ±  0.3  mmol/l  during  sevelamer carbonate  and  sevelamer  hydrochloride  treatment.  For  patients  in  sequence  2,  the  mean  serum phosphorus  was  1.5  ±  0.2  mmol/l  during  sevelamer  hydrochloride  treatment  and  1.5  ±  0.3  mmol/l during sevelamer carbonate treatment. There was no sequence effect and the results of the mean serum phosphorus level for both treatments and of the equivalence tests for both the PPS and FAS are shown in Table . There was no statistical difference between the mean serum phosphorus levels and the 90% CI  of  the  geometric  least  square  mean  ratio  (sevelamer  carbonate  /sevelamer  hydrochloride)  was within the range of 80%-125%. The 95% CI of the ratio for the PPS was 0.94-1.03.

A  total  of  40  patients  entered  the  washout  period.  At  the  end  of  the  treatment  period  the  serum phosphorus was 1.6 ± 0.4 mmol/l in all FAS patients participating in the washout period (1.5 ± 0.4 mmol/l in patients treated according to sequence 1 and 1.7 ± 0.5 mmol/l in patients treated according to  sequence  2).  Following  the  two-week  washout  period,  the  serum  phosphorus  level  increased significantly  to  2.1  ±  0.6  mmol/l    with  an  overall  increase  of  serum  phosphorus  level  of  0.5  ±  0.6 mmol/l (Sequence 1: increase of 0.5 ± 0.5 mmol/l; Sequence 2: increase of 0.4 ± 0.7 mmol/l).

## Secondary efficacy endpoint

At baseline, the mean LDL cholesterol was 1.5 ± 0.6 mmol/l in the sevelamer carbonate treated group and 1.5 ± 0.7 mmol/l in the sevelamer hydrochloride treated group. After treatment, the mean LDL cholesterol was 1.5 ± 0.6 mmol/l during sevelamer carbonate treatment and 1.4 ± 0.6 mmol/l during sevelamer hydrochloride treatment, which was statistically different. The geometric least square mean ratio (sevelamer carbonate /sevelamer hydrochloride) was 1.07 (90% CI: 1.01-1.12) (see Table 5). No differences were observed with regard to HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The differences in total cholesterol  (3.7  ±  0.9  mmol/l  with  sevelamer  carbonate  and  3.6  ±  0.9  mmol/l  with  sevelamer hydrochloride) reflected the differences in LDL cholesterol. Safety analyses assessing the change from baseline to end of treatment only showed statistically significant changes for total cholesterol.

Ancillary analyses

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Post-hoc analyses were performed for the primary efficacy parameter to understand the results across dose  level  as  a  marker  for  degree  of  underlying  hyperphosphataemia.  The  geometric  mean  ratio  of serum phosphorus level (carbonate/hydrochloride) was 0.97 (90% CI: 0.91-1.04) for a dose ≤ 4.8 gram, 0.95 (90% CI: 0.85-1.05) for a dose &gt; 4.8 - &lt;9.6 gram, and 1.04 (90% CI: 0.98-1.10) for a dose ≥ 9.6 gram. A regression analysis of the equivalence ratio (sevelamer carbonate/sevelamer hydrochloride) on  prescribed  dose  showed  a  flat  regression  line  and  a  non-significant  p-value  (y=0.95  +0.01*x; p=0.2745) indicating that the equivalence ratio is invariant to prescribed dose.

## Change in serum phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product, iPTH, calcium and vitamin D

For safety analysis, changes from baseline to end of treatment (week 8/16/final) were calculated for amongst  others  calcium  (adjusted  for  albumin),  calcium-phosphorus  product,  iPTH,  25  hydroxy vitamin D and 1-25 dihydroxyvitamin D. (The values in mmol/l, etc were calculated as these were not provided by the applicant).

There was a small, but statistically significant increase in calcium-phosphorus product during  sevelamer  hydrochloride  treatment  (mean  change  of  0.25  ±  0.91  mmol 2 /l 2 ;  from  3.4  ±  0.86 mmol 2 /l 2 to 3.6 ± 0.94 mmol 2 /l 2 ), but not during sevelamer carbonate treatment (mean change of 0.17 ± 0.89 mmol 2 /l 2 ;  from 3.4 ± 0.82 mmol 2 /l 2 to  3.6 ± 0.89 mmol 2 /l 2 ).  Again, there was no statistically significant difference in the change in calcium-phosphorus product between the treatment regimens.

Median iPTH increased significantly during both sevelamer carbonate treatment (from 27.0 pmol/l to 32.7 pmol/l) and sevelamer hydrochloride treatment (from 27.4 pmol/l to 28.4 pmol/l). The difference between treatment regimens was statistically significant.

There was no statistically significant change in serum calcium during either treatment (from 2.3 ± 0.2 mmol/l at baseline to 2.3 ± 0.1 mmol/l after treatment for sevelamer carbonate and from 2.3 ± 0.2 mmol/l at baseline to 2.3 ± 0.2 mmol/l after treatment for sevelamer hydrochloride) and no statistically significant difference in the change in serum calcium between the treatment regimens.

There were no statistically significant changes in the vitamin D measures for either treatment and no statistically significant difference in change  in these parameters between  the treatments. 25 Hydroxyvitamin changed from 75.2 ± 48.1 nmol/l at baseline to 79.7 ± 52.1 nmol/l after treatment with sevelamer carbonate and from 75.4 ± 46.7 nmol/l at baseline to 75.7 ± 43.3 nmol/l after treatment with sevelamer hydrochloride. 1-25 Dihydroxyvitamin changed from 70.5 ± 26.4 pmol/l at baseline to 68.1 ± 28.8 pmol/l after treatment with sevelamer carbonate and from 71.7 ± 26.4 pmol/l at baseline to 65.2 ± 24.9 pmol/l after treatment with sevelamer hydrochloride.

## Results of study SVCARB00205

## Participant flow

Overall,  75  patients  individuals  enrolled  for  screening  of  which  one  was  re-screened  and  counted twice in pre-randomisation disposition data, giving an overall of 76 patients. Of the screened patients enrolling  the  two-week  washout  period,  42  (55.3%)  entered  the  run-in  period.  The  most  common reason  for  not  entering  the  run-in  period  was  screen  failure  (26/34,  76%)  (predominantly  (17/26) because of serum phosphorus levels below 1.78 mmol/l). Of the 42 patients entering the run-in period, 31 (40.8%) were randomised to study treatment, 7 patients were excluded because of screen failure (mostly because of high iPTH levels or high phosphorus levels), 1 because of non-compliance and 3 patients were excluded for other reasons.

Of the 17 patients assigned to the carbonate/hydrochloride sequence (sequence 1), 14 completed both treatment period 1 and 2. One patient discontinued during treatment period 1 because of an adverse event and two patients withdrew consent.

Of  the  14  patients  assigned  to  the  hydrochloride/carbonate  sequence  (sequence  2),  14  completed treatment  period  1  and  10  completed  treatment  period  2.  One  patient  discontinued  because  of  an adverse event and three patients withdrew consent.

Recruitment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The first patient signed informed consent on 31 January 2006 and the last patient completed the last visit on 21 March 2007. The study was conducted in the United Kingdom.

## Conduct of the study

There was one amendment to the clinical study report, dated January 11, 2008. Additional information not reported during the study was identified by the sponsor at site 02 during preparatory activities for a site  inspection  by  the  Medicines  and  Healthcare  products  Regulatory  Agency  (MHRA).  The amendment describes changes in the text and tables from the original clinical study report, the original study report was not modified to reflect these changes.

The main changes in the conduct of the study included:

a. Increase in number of patients to be screened was changed from approximately 35 to approximately 75 due to a higher than anticipated screening failure rate.

b. Sevelamer hydrochloride did not need to be the primary phosphate binder in those patients taking combination therapy before entry into the study.

c.  Study  entry  limits  of  iPTH  and  serum  phosphorus  levels  measured  at  the  local  laboratory  were increased due to the variation between local and central laboratory analyses, which meant that some patients may not be considered eligible by the local analysis and would therefore not be screened.

## Baseline data

The  most  important  baseline  characteristics  of  the  safety  set  are  shown  in  Table  6.  Overall,  the baseline characteristics were comparable for both sequences. The majority of patients was male (65% in treatment sequence 1 and 71% in treatment sequence 2) and the mean age was 52-55 years. The primary cause of CKD was glomerulonephritis. The median time on dialysis was 4.4 years for patients receiving treatment sequence 1 and over 4.6 years for patients receiving treatment sequence 2. The percentage of patients with partial parathyroidectomy varied from 12%-14%. The majority of patients received vitamin D (88% of patients in treatment sequence 1 and 71% in treatment sequence 2).

## Concomitant medication / dietary intake

Thirteen percent of the patients had partial parathyroidectomy and 81% were on vitamin D. For patients receiving sequence 1, 1 patient started, stopped or changed vitamin D analogues while on sevelamer  carbonate  and  for  patients  receiving  sequence  2,  2  patients  started,  stopped  or  changed vitamin D analogues while on sevelamer carbonate.

## Numbers analysed

Thirty-one patients were randomised and treated and all included in the safety set. All but 1 patient in the safety set had post-baseline serum phosphorus data, and therefore there are 30 patients in the FAS. Nine patients were excluded from the FAS, and therefore the PPS includes 21 patients. Of the nine patients excluded, 6 were on study medication for less than 3 weeks in both treatment periods and 3 had at least 30% difference in compliance between treatment periods.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary efficacy endpoint

For  patients  in  sequence  1,  the  mean  serum  phosphorus  was  1.59  ±  0.54  mmol/l  during  sevelamer carbonate treatment and 1.67 ± 0.34 mmol/l during sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. For patients in sequence  2,  the  mean  serum  phosphorus  was  1.62  ±  0.42  mmol/l  during  sevelamer  hydrochloride treatment and 1.66 ± 0.38 mmol/l during sevelamer carbonate treatment. There was no sequence effect and the results of the mean serum phosphorus level for both treatments and of the equivalence tests for both the Per Protocol Set and Full Analysis Set are shown in Table 7.

There was no statistically difference between the mean serum phosphorus levels and the 90% CI of the geometric  least  square  mean  ratio  (sevelamer  carbonate  /sevelamer  hydrochloride)  was  within  the range of 80%-125%. The 95% CI of the ratio for the PPS was 0.85-1.05.

## Phosphorus during screening/washout and run-in period

The mean serum phosphorus at screening, at the end of the washout period, and before randomisation are shown in Table 8 for the PPS. Overall, the mean serum phosphorus level was 1.6 ± 0.3 mmol/l at screening and increased to 2.5 ± 0.6 mmol/l (mean change 0.9 ± 0.7 mmol/l). Serum phosphorus levels subsequently  decreased  to  1.6  ±  0.4  mmol/l  after  the  sevelamer  hydrochloride  run-in  period. Comparable changes were observed in the FAS and Safety Set.

## Secondary efficacy endpoint

Serum calcium (albumin-adjusted)-phosphorus product (Ca x Pi)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The overall average serum calcium (albumin-adjusted)-phosphorus product at randomisation was 3.8 ± 0.8  mmol 2 /l 2 and  comparable  for  both  treatment  sequences.  There  was  no  sequence  effect  and  the average Ca x Pi product was 3.7 ± 1.1 mmol 2 /l 2 upon sevelamer carbonate treatment and 3.7 ± 0.8 mmol 2 /l 2 upon  sevelamer  hydrochloride  treatment  (FAS).  The  geometric  least  squares  mean  ratio (sevelamer  carbonate  powder/sevelamer  hydrochloride  tablets)  was  0.98  with  a  corresponding  90% confidence interval of 0.88-1.09.

The mean serum calcium (albumin-adjusted)-phosphorus product at screening was 3.8 ± 0.9 mmol 2 /l 2 and  increased  to  5.4  ±  1.5  mmol 2 /l 2 (mean  change  1.6  ±  1.8  mmol 2 /l 2 ;  p&lt;0.001)  after  the  washout period.

## Serum lipids

There  were  no  differences  between  treatments  with  regard  to  LDL  cholesterol,  HDL  cholesterol, triglycerides, or total cholesterol as shown in Table 9.

Table 9: Analysis of serum lipids (mmol/l) - Full analysis set.

*median

Analysis of the PPS showed a statistically significant treatment sequence effect for LDL cholesterol and  therefore  the  results  were  analyses  using  treatment  period  1.  No  differences  were  observed between treatment regimens when only the results of treatment period 1 were analysed.

## Ancillary analyses

Median serum iPTH increased significantly during sevelamer hydrochloride tablet treatment (median change 4.4 pmol/l; from 23.1 pmol/l to 28.3 pmol/l). Median serum iPTH levels also increased during sevelamer carbonate powder treatment (3.1 pmol/l; from 30.6 pmol/l to 41.0 pmol/l) but the change from baseline was not statistically significant. There was no statistically significant difference between treatment regimens with regards to change in serum iPTH levels.

There  was  no  statistically  significant  change  in  serum calcium (albumin-adjusted)  during  either treatment (serum calcium level of 2.3 ± 0.2 mmol/l at baseline and after treatment for both treatment regimens).

There were no statistically significant changes from baseline to end of treatment in 25-hydroxyvitamin levels (sevelamer carbonate: from 53.6 ± 32.7 nmol/l to 47.6 ± 29.0 nmol/l; sevelamer hydrochloride: from  54.7  ±  32.7  nmol/l  to  52.1  ±  34.4  nmol/l)  and  1,25  dihydroxyvitamin  D  levels  (sevelamer carbonate: from 58.5 ± 27.7 pmol/l to 69.3 ± 45.7 pmol/l; sevelamer hydrochloride: from 56.5 ±28.3 pmol/l to 64.2 ± 23.4 pmol/l).

## CKD PATIENTS NOT ON DIALYSIS

Study SVCARB00105 : A phase 3, multi-centre, open-label, single arm, dose titration study in hyperphosphataemic CKD patients not on dialysis, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate tablets dosed TID with meals.

## Scientific advice

Scientific advice was sought by Genzyme regarding the design of a dose titration study using sevelamer carbonate in hyperphosphataemic CKD patients not on dialysis (study SVCARB00105). Advice was provided by the CHMP on 26 May 2005. This advice concerned; the proposed sample size, study design with respect to the use of an active comparator or placebo, proposed starting and maintenance dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In summary, the Company did not completely follow the Scientific Advice. The points of dissention are:

- It  can be argued whether 49 pre-dialysis CKD patients recruited across 18 sites (41 patients completed the study) is a 'reasonable number of patients in clear need for phosphate binders' for such a prevalent disease. The safety database in pre-dialysis CKD patients is very small.
- The Company did not follow the suggestion that 'Descriptive data from a reasonably large randomised, active comparator-controlled study with patients in real need for treatment with a phosphate binder without predefined non-inferiority criteria would nevertheless be regarded as informative by the CHMP.' In particular, the non-comparative nature of study SVCARB00105 makes it  impossible  to  examine  safety  issues  related  to  calcium  and  PTH levels.  Calcium  carbonate  is  registered  in  a  number  of  EU  countries  for  the  indication hyperphosphataemia,  regardless  of  dialysis  status,  and  it  could  have  been  considered  as  an adequate active control.

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Inclusion criteria:

Adult (&gt;17 years) patients with CKD not on dialysis. Patients did or did not use phosphate binders at screening and had iPTH ≤ 88  pmol/l  and  25  hydroxyvitamin D ≥ 25  nmol/l.  Other  major  inclusion criteria included stable diet, negative pregnancy test and an acceptable contraceptive method. Patients should  be  willing  and  able  to  avoid  antacids  and  phosphorus  binders  containing  aluminium, magnesium,  calcium  or  lanthanum  for  the  duration  of  the  study  unless  prescribed  as  an  evening calcium supplement. Patients with a serum phosphorus level &gt; 1.78 mmol/l either at screening or after the two week washout period (in case patients were on phosphate binder therapy at screening) were eligible for study treatment.

Major exclusion criteria included poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled hypertension, active dysphagia, swallowing disorder, bowel obstruction, or severe gastrointestinal motility disorder.

## Treatments

The study consisted of four periods: a 2-week screening period, a 2-week washout period, an 8-week treatment  period  followed  by  a  second  2-week  washout  period  (see  Figure  2).  The  initial  2-week washout period was only applicable for those eligible patients taking phosphate binder(s) at screening.

Eligible patients who were not taking phosphate binder(s) at screening proceeded directly to the start of the 8-week treatment period. Patients started treatment with sevelamer carbonate at a dose of 4.8 g daily (2 x 800 mg tablets TID). The starting dose of sevelamer carbonate of 4.8 g/day was based on data from a Phase 2 study, GTC-45-204, with sevelamer hydrochloride in hyperphosphataemic CKD patients not on  dialysis,  where  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  serum  phosphorus  was

demonstrated  with  an  average  dose  of  sevelamer  hydrochloride  of  3.53  g/day.  However  this  study showed the number of patients attaining serum phosphorus within the target range was not as high, and the magnitude of reduction in serum phosphorus was lower than previously seen in clinical trials involving haemodialysis patients where average doses of approximately 6 g/day were used. Therefore, the starting dose for the current study was set at 4.8 g daily. The sevelamer carbonate dose was titrated to a maximum dose of 12 g/day (15 x 800 mg tablets) during the treatment period in increments of 2.4 g daily (1 x 800 mg tablet TID) at visits on Days 14, 28, and 42 to attain a target serum phosphorus level ≥ 0.86 and ≤ 1.47 mmol/l. At day 56/ET blood samples were taken, sevelamer carbonate was stopped  and  patients  entered  a  second  washout  phase  of  two  weeks.  During  the  treatment  period, patients were supplemented with a daily dose of 400 IU of the native form of vitamin D to minimize the  effects  of  any  dietary  absorption  of  vitamin  D  that  may  occur  during  treatment  with  sevelamer carbonate,  this  was  to  be  taken  at  bedtime  away  from  the  dose  of  sevelamer  carbonate.  This supplement was to be given in addition to any active vitamin D therapy routinely prescribed at the start  of  the  study.  After  the  second  washout  period,  patients  were  returned  to  their  pre-treatment phosphate binders(s), if applicable.

Blood draws were obtained every 2 weeks for the 8-week treatment period beginning at baseline (i.e. Days 0, 14, 28, 42, and 56) and at day 70 after the second washout period.

At the end of treatment, the mean prescribed daily dose for the Safety Set was 7.59 g/day, similar to that in the FAS and PPS. The mean actual daily dose for all three analysis populations was similar; for the Safety Set it was 5.38 g/day; for the FAS it was 5.52 g/day; and for the PPS it was 5.93 g/day.

## Objectives

## Primary objectives:

1. To evaluate the efficacy of sevelamer carbonate tablets dosed three times a day (TID) with meals in controlling serum phosphorus levels in CKD patients not on dialysis.
2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sevelamer carbonate tablets dosed TID with meals in CKD patients not on dialysis.

## Secondary objectives:

1. To evaluate serum calcium-phosphorus product
2.  To evaluate serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and low density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol)
3.  To evaluate percent responders (serum phosphorus between 0.86 mmol/l and 1.47 mmol/l at day 56/early termination (ET).

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary efficacy endpoint:

The primary efficacy variable was the change in serum phosphorus from baseline to day 56/ET.

## Secondary efficacy endpoint:

1. Change in serum calcium-phosphorus product (Ca x Pi) from baseline to day 56/ET
2. Change in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol from baseline to day 56/ET
3. Percent responders (serum phosphorus between 0.86 and 1.47 mmol/l) at day 56/ET

## Safety endpoints:

These included incidence of adverse events and serious adverse event, changes in vital signs, physical examination abnormal changes, and changes in clinical laboratory evaluations.

## Sample size

To detect a 0.32 mmol/l average change from baseline based on a two-sided paired t-test with 5% type I  error  rate  and  an  assumed standard deviation for the change from baseline of 0.45 mmol/L it was calculated that 23 evaluable (Full Analysis Set) patients were required. To account for a possible 20% dropout  rate,  a  minimum  of  28  patients  needed  to  be  treated.  However  recruitment  continued  until 30th September 2006 to maximize generation of safety data for this population. No interim analysis was planned.

Blinding (masking) Not applicable

## Statistical methods

For the primary efficacy analysis (i.e., change in serum phosphorus at day 56/ET), a wilcoxon signed rank test was used to assess the changes. The last non-missing post-baseline observation (scheduled or unscheduled) was carried forward to represent the day 56/ET value for patients who terminated from the study prior to day 56 and did not complete day 56/ET visit.

The primary analysis set for safety included all randomised patients who were treated with at least one dose  of  randomised  study  medication.  Descriptive  statistics  of  adverse  events  were  shown,  no statistical testing was performed. Changes in vital signs and laboratory measurements were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

For  the secondary  efficacy  analyses ,  the  changes  between  baseline  and  day  56/ET  for  total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and calcium-phosphorus product were assessed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test.

## Changes in the planned analysis:

No changes were made to the protocol-defined analysis.

Additional post hoc analyses that were performed among the FAS included serum phosphorus over time by CKD Stage (4 versus 5), serum phosphorus over time among the subset of patients who were on  phosphate  binder(s)  at  study  entry,  serum  phosphorus  over  time  by  investigative  site  and compliance,  dosing,  and  baseline  serum  phosphorus  by  serum  phosphorus  responder  status  at  day 56/ET

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

A total of 129 individual patients were screened for this study, of which 12 were re-screened. Fortynine patients entered the treatment phase of which 41 completed the study. Four patients discontinued due  to  an  adverse  event,  2  patients  withdrew  consent  and  2  patients  discontinued  due  to  'other' reasons.

## Recruitment

Patients were screened for study entry at 19 study centres and patients were treated in 18 centres (14 in Europe and 4 in Australia). The first patient signed informed consent on 14 February, 2006 and the last patient completed the last visit on 23 January, 2007.

## Conduct of the study

There was one protocol amendment made, to allow additional enrolment of patients for the purpose of increasing the understanding of the safety profile in the CKD population, dated 21 August, 2006. This  amendment  specifically  made  provision  for  including  study  sites  in  Australia  and  raising  the number of sites in Europe, extension of study enrolment period and increasing the number screened and treated patients and extension of the time of AE and concomitant medication recording from start of screening to time of signing informed consent.

## Baseline data

Baseline demographics and characteristics are shown in Table 10. Sixty-five percent (n=32) of patients were male and 35% (n=17) of patients were female, with a mean age of 62.0 years (sd=12.2; range: 23-81).  Most  patients  were  Caucasian  (n=45,  92%).  The  most  common  primary  causes  of  chronic kidney  disease  were  diabetes  (n=9,  18%),  glomerulonephritis  (n=8,  16%)  and  polycystic  kidney disease (n=8, 16%). Sixty-one percent (n=30) of patients were taking a phosphate binder prior to entry and 49% (n=24) used vitamin D pre-study. A total of 35% (n=17) of the patients were classified as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CKD stage 4 (GFR 15-29 mL/minute/1.73m2), with the remaining 65% (n=32) of the patients being classified CKD stage 5 (GFR &lt;15 mL/minute/1.73m2) according to KDOQI definitions.

## Numbers analysed

The  Safety  Set  included  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  sevelamer  carbonate.  One hundred and twenty nine individual patients were screened, of these, 49 patients were dispensed and administered sevelamer carbonate and are included in the Safety Set.

The FAS included the subset of patients in the Safety Set with a baseline and at least one post-baseline serum phosphorus measure during the study treatment period (± 5 days). All but three patients in the Safety Set had post-baseline efficacy data, therefore the FAS includes 46 patients.

The PPS includes all FAS-evaluable patients with no significant protocol deviations who had more than  75% treatment  compliance,  and  were  on  treatment  for  at  least  42  days.  A  total  of  11  patients (11/46=24%)  were  excluded  for  the  PPS-analysis,  mostly  (n=6)  because  treatment  compliance  was below 75%. Other reasons for exclusion were entry criteria violation (n=1), treatment for less than 42 days (n=1), proscribed medication usage (n=2) and other (n=1). Thus, the PPS includes 35 patients.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary efficacy endpoint

The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  the  change  from  baseline  in  serum  phosphorus  levels.  Mean baseline serum phosphorus levels were 2.01 mmol/l for the FAS. The corresponding mean levels at Day 56/ET were 1.56 mmol/l and the mean change from baseline was -0.45 mmol/l (95%CI: -0.55, 0.35).  The  decrease  in  serum  phosphorus  values  from  baseline  to  Day  56/ET  was  statistically significant.  The  results  of  the  PPS-analysis  were  comparable  (mean  change  from  baseline  to  day 56/ET of -0.45 mmol/l, 95% CI: -0.57, -0.34).

Analysis of serum phosphorus levels over time clearly showed a decrease in serum phosphorus level during  treatment  and  an  increase  of  serum  phosphorus  level  during  the  phosphate  binder  washout period (Figure 3).

First washout is only applicable for patients taking phosphate binders at study entry

A comprehensive literature search by the applicant yielded only a small number of randomised clinical trials in hyperphosphataemic CKD patients not on dialysis using calcium as a phosphate binder.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints

## Serum phosphorus responders

By the  end  of  study  treatment  (Day  56/ET),  50%  (95%  CI:  35.6%,  64.5%)  of  patients  in  the  FAS reached the titration target level of serum phosphorus ≥ 0.86 and ≤ 1.47 mmol/l following treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with  sevelamer  carbonate.  Comparable  results  were  obtained  when  only  patients  with  a  day  56 response  were  analysed  (54%  responders;  95%  CI:  38.4%,  68.9%).  Using  descriptive  statistics  of baseline serum phosphorus, compliance and mean dose, these seemed comparable for responders and non-responders.

## Calcium (albumin-adjusted)-phosphorus product

The  mean  level  of  calcium  (albumin-adjusted)-phosphorus  product  at  baseline  was  4.3  ±  0.57 mmol2/l2 and significantly  decreased  to  3.4  ±  0.65  mmol2/l2  at  day  56/ET  in  the  FAS  population (mean change: -0.8 ± 0.73 mmol2/l2, n=43). During washout, Ca x Pi increased again (mean change: 1.1 ± 0.77 mmol2/l2, n=40). Comparable results were obtained for the PPS population.

## Serum lipids

In the FAS population, serum levels of total cholesterol significantly decreased during treatment with a  mean  change  from  baseline  to  day  56/ET  of  -0.9  ±  0.79  mmol/l  (mean  percent  change:  -19.5  ± 17.1%; from 4.5 ± 1.08 mmol/l to 3.5 ± 0.94 mmol/l). The mean change in serum LDL cholesterol from baseline to day 56/ET was -0.9 ± 0.58 mmol/l (mean percent change: -31.9 ± 18.1%; from 2.7 ± 0.87 mmol/l to 1.8 ± 0.65 mmol/l), which was statistically significant. Serum HDL and triglycerides did  not  change  significantly  during  treatment.  Comparable  results  were  observed  with  the  PPSpopulation.

## Ancillary analyses

Subgroup analyses stratified for CKD stage 4 and 5, show that statistically significant decreases from baseline  to  day  56/ET  in  serum  phosphorus  levels  were  found  for  both  CKD  Stage  4  and  Stage  5 patients.

A subgroup analysis in patients on phosphate binders at screening showed a statistically significant decrease in baseline to day 56/ET in serum phosphorus level.

## Change in iPTH, calcium and vitamin D

Median iPTH was 36 pmol/l at baseline, 34 pmol/l at day 56/ET, and 38 pmol/l at day 70 in the safety set. Median iPTH levels decreased significantly from baseline to Day 56/ET, (mean change -4 pmol/l; p = 0.013).

Mean calcium (albumin-adjusted)  was  2.13  ±  0.22  mmol/l  at  baseline,  2.20  ±  0.19  mmol/l  at  day 56/ET,  and  2.14  ±  0.14  mmol/l  at  day  70.  Mean  serum  calcium  (albumin-adjusted)  increased significantly from baseline to day 56/ET (mean change 0.08 mmol/l; p &lt; 0.001).

The mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D was  72.2  ±40.6  nmol/l  at  baseline  and  77.5  ±  32.1  nmol/l  at  day 56/ET. There was a slight but not statistically significant increase (5.1 ± 25.7 nmol/l; p = 0.080) in mean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D from baseline to day 56/ET.

Mean levels of 1,  25  dihydroxyvitamin D increased  over  the  course  of  the  study.  At  baseline,  the mean 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D level was 60.9 ± 24.2 pmol/l which increased to 76.4 ± 29.0 pmol/l at day 56/ET. This represents a statistically significant mean increase of 12.8 ± 35.6 pmol/l (p = 0.025) from baseline to day 56/ET.

## CKD patients on haemodialysis

In  clinical  study  GD3-199-301,  sevelamer  carbonate  powder  administered  once  per  day  resulted  in clinically  and  statistically  significant  reductions  in  serum  phosphorus  from  baseline,  but  it  did  not demonstrate non-inferiority to sevelamer hydrochloride tablets dosed three times per day (Table 12).

The upper confidence bound was 0.48 mmol/l (1.50 mg/dl). Therefore, based on a pre-specified noninferiority margin of 1 mg/dl, non-inferiority of sevelamer carbonate powder once per day compared to sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day was not demonstrated. The percentage of serum phosphorus responders (serum phosphorus between 1.13 and 1.76 mmol/l [3.5 and 5.5 mg/dl]) was higher  in  the  sevelamer  hydrochloride  tablets  TID  group  (73%)  than  in  the  sevelamer  carbonate powder OD group (56%). Thus the Applicant's claim for once daily administration was not granted by CHMP.

## CKD patients not on haemodialysis

The  applicant  performed  a  phase  2  open-label,  dose  titration  study  of  sevelamer  hydrochloride  in chronic renal failure patients not requiring dialysis to determine the efficacy and safety of sevelamer hydrochloride. After discontinuing any phosphate binders, patients entered a 4-week phosphate binder washout  period.  Patients  who  developed  hyperphosphataemia  (serum  phosphorus  &gt;  1.61  mmol/l) received sevelamer hydrochloride treatment for 12 weeks. The dose was titrated during the treatment period  to  achieve  a  serum  phosphorus  level  between  0.81  and  1.45 mmol/l.  The  average  dose  of sevelamer hydrochloride was 3.5 g/day. A statistically significant mean decrease in serum phosphorus level was noted during the treatment period (-0.26 mmol/l; p &lt; 0.001). These changes reversed within 4 weeks after sevelamer hydrochloride treatment ended.

## CKD patients on peritoneal dialysis

No studies with sevelamer carbonate were performed in peritoneal dialysis patients.

The applicant submitted study REN-003-04 (An Open Label, Randomized, Parallel Design Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Sevelamer Hydrochloride (dosed three times per day) Compared with Calcium Acetate in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients) to support both safety and efficacy.  A total of 143 patients on peritoneal dialysis were randomised to study treatment in a 2:1 fashion: 97 patients received sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times per day and 46 patients received calcium acetate tablets three times per day.  Based on the data from study REN-003-04, the indication for sevelamer hydrochloride  was  extended  in  2007  to  include  hyperphosphataemic  patients  on  peritoneal  dialysis following approval of a Type II variation by CHMP.

In study REN-003-04, treatment with sevelamer hydrochloride for 12 weeks was non-inferior to 12week treatment with calcium acetate in reducing serum phosphorus levels.  In the Per Protocol Set, there were  statistically significant changes  from  baseline in  serum  phosphorus  (p&lt;0.001)  of -0.52 mmol/L (-1.61 mg/dL) and -0.58 mmol/L (-1.81 mg/dL) for the sevelamer hydrochloride group and  the  calcium  group,  respectively.    The  difference  in  mean  change  (difference  =  sevelamer hydrochloride - calcium) was 0.061 mmol/L (0.197 mg/dL) with an upper 97.5% confidence bound of 0.237 mmol/L (0.741 mg/dL) thus establishing non-inferiority of sevelamer hydrochloride compared to  calcium  acetate  based  on  a  pre-specified  non-inferiority  margin  of  0.3 mmol/L  (0.929 mg/dL). Similar results were found with the Full Analysis Set.

## CKD patients on haemodialysis

Only two small trials are submitted comparing HCl formulation with the carbonate formulation (TID dosing).  The  studies  GD3-163-201  (sevelamer  carbonate  tablets)  and  SVCARB00205  (sevelamer carbonate powder) were designed to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence of sevelamer carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride in CKD patients on haemodialysis. Study GD3-163-201 was a double-blind, randomized, crossover study whereas study SVCARB00205 was an open-label, randomized, crossover study.

A large amount of patients were excluded, in particular patients with active dysphagia, swallowing disorders,  bowel  obstruction,  severe  gastrointestinal  motility  disorders  or  any  unstable  medical condition  which  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator  would  prohibit  the  patient's  participation.  This hampers the extrapolation of the clinical data set to the real life use of the medicinal product.

In study GD3-163-201, the mean serum phosphorus was 1.49 ± 0.3 mmol/l (4.6 ± 0.9 mg/dl) during sevelamer carbonate treatment and 1.52 ± 0.3 mmol/l  (4.7 ± 0.9 mg/dl) during sevelamer hydrochloride  treatment.  The  geometric  least  square  mean  ratio  (sevelamer  carbonate/sevelamer hydrochloride) was 0.99 with a corresponding 90% confidence interval of 0.95-1.03. The confidence interval  is  within  the  interval  of  0.80-1.25,  indicating  that  sevelamer  carbonate  and  sevelamer hydrochloride are equivalent in controlling serum phosphorus. The results of a confirmatory analysis conducted  with  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  are  similar.  Post-hoc  analyses  were  performed  to understand the results across dose levels as a marker for the degree of underlying hyperphosphataemia. An analysis of the geometric least squares mean ratio (sevelamer carbonate/sevelamer hydrochloride) was conducted by dose group and is presented in Table 13. The confidence intervals for each of the dose groups are within the interval of 0.80-1.25 indicating that sevelamer  carbonate  and  sevelamer  hydrochloride  are  equivalent  in  controlling  serum  phosphorus regardless of dose group.

In study SVCARB00205, the mean serum phosphorus level was 1.6 ± 0.5 mmol/l (5.0 ± 1.5 mg/dl) during  sevelamer  carbonate  powder  treatment  and  1.7  ±  0.4  mmol/L  (5.2  ±  1.1  mg/dl)  during sevelamer hydrochloride tablet treatment. The geometric least square mean ratio (sevelamer carbonate powder/sevelamer hydrochloride tablets) was 0.95 with a corresponding 90% CI of 0.87-1.03. The CI is  within  the  interval  of  0.80-1.25,  indicating  that  sevelamer  carbonate  powder  and  sevelamer hydrochloride  tablets,  each  dosed  TID  with  meals,  are  equivalent  in  controlling  serum  phosphorus. The results of a confirmatory analysis conducted with the FAS were similar. In the FAS, the mean serum calcium (albumin-adjusted)-phosphorus product was 3.7 ± 1.1 mmol2/l2 (45.9 ± 13.8 mg2/dl2) during sevelamer carbonate powder treatment and 3.7 ± 0.8 mmol2/l2 (45.8 ± 10.0 mg2/dl2) during sevelamer  hydrochloride  tablet  treatment.  No  statistically  significant  differences  were  observed between  sevelamer  carbonate  powder  and  sevelamer  hydrochloride  tablets  with  regards  to  serum calcium  (albumin-adjusted)-phosphorus  product.  The  geometric  least  square  mean  ratio  (sevelamer carbonate powder/sevelamer hydrochloride tablets) was 0.98 with a corresponding 90% CI of 0.881.09, which is within the 0.80-1.25 interval.

With  regard  to  the  Secondary  Efficacy  Parameter-LDL  Cholesterol-  in  Dialysis  Patients  the  most direct  comparisons  of  sevelamer  carbonate  and  sevelamer  hydrochloride  on  LDL  cholesterol  are provided  by  studies  GD3-163-201  and  SVCARB00205.  In  these  studies,  there  were  no  clinically significant  differences  in  LDL  cholesterol  between  treatments.  The  geometric  least  squares  ratios (sevelamer  carbonate/sevelamer  hydrochloride)  and  corresponding  90%  confidence  intervals  were calculated (GD3-163- 201: ratio=1.07; CI 1.01-1.12; SVCARB00205: ratio=1.05; CI 1.00-1.10) and observed to be well within the traditional equivalence boundary criteria, 0.80-1.25.

In addition, study GD3-199-301 (open label, randomised, parallel study) was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority  of  sevelamer  carbonate  powder  once  daily  (QD)  to  sevelamer  hydrochloride  tablets three times daily (TID) in CKD patients on haemodialysis. Sevelamer carbonate powder administered once per day resulted in clinically and statistically significant reductions in serum phosphorus from baseline,  but  it  did  not  demonstrate  non-inferiority  to  sevelamer  hydrochloride  tablets  dosed  three times per day.

## CKD Patients Not on Dialysis

Study SVCARB00105 was an open label, single arm, dose titration study conducted in hyperphosphataemic CKD patients not on dialysis with sevelamer carbonate tablets dosed three times per day. This is a very small clinical trial including less than 50 patients (49 included, 41 finishing the trial).

The mean serum phosphorus level decreased from 2.0 mmol/L (6.2 mg/dl) at baseline to 1.6 mmol/l (4.8  mg/dl)  at  the  end  of  treatment  (Day  56/ET).  The  decrease  in  serum  phosphorus  level  was statistically  significant  (mean  -0.5  mmol/L [-1.4 mg/dl], p value &lt;0.001). During the post-treatment washout period, there was a statistically significant (p&lt;0.001) increase in serum phosphorus level of 0.6 mmol/l (1.7 mg/dl) confirming the efficacy of sevelamer carbonate in hyperphosphataemic CKD patients not on dialysis.

The  mean  actual  daily  dose  of  sevelamer  carbonate  in  SVCARB00105  was  5.5  g/day,  a  dose  not dissimilar to that documented for dialysis patients despite the differences in trial design.

There are several concerns with the efficacy data in study SVCARB00105:

- The dataset is very small (n=41 patients completing this 8-week active treatment study).
- Patients with active dysphagia, swallowing disorders, bowel obstruction, severe gastrointestinal motility disorders or any unstable medical condition which in the opinion of the  investigator  would  prohibit  the  patient's  participation  were  among  those  excluded.  This limits the external validity of the trial.
- By the end of study  treatment  (Day  56/ET),  only  50%  of  patients  in  the  Full  Analysis  Set reached the titration target level of serum phosphorus ≥ 0.86 mmol/l and ≤ 1.47 mmol/l ( ≥ 2.7 and ≤ 4.6  mg/dl).  Mean  doses  of  sevelamer  carbonate  &gt;5.5  g/day  may  be  needed  for  this population, but the safety of such high doses in this population is unknown.
- Four  patients  (8-10%)  discontinued  due  to  adverse  events  during  this  short  trial.  Four discontinued for other reasons.
- Median iPTH was 36 pmol/l at baseline, 34 pmol/l at day 56/ET, and 39 pmol/l at day 70 in the safety set. Median iPTH levels decreased significantly from baseline to Day 56/ET, (mean change  4  pmol/l;  p  =  0.013).  Mean  calcium  (albumin-adjusted)  was  2.13  ±  0.22  mmol/l  at baseline, 2.20 ± 0.19 mmol/l at day 56/ET, and 2.14 ± 0.14 mmol/l at day 70. Mean serum calcium (albumin-adjusted) increased significantly from baseline to day 56/ET (mean change 0.08  mmol/l;  p  &lt;  0.001).  Although  small,  these  changes  may  indicate  a  trend  following treatment with sevelamer carbonate.

CHMP was of the opinion that this trial is at most supportive but is not sufficiently large to support an indication for such a large group of patients. The applicant was asked to address this issue during an oral  explanation  and  the  majority  of  CHMP  members  concluded  that  although  the  database  is  very

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

small, sevelamer carbonate is approvable for pre-dialysis CKD patients with serum phosphorus level ≥ 1.78 mmol/l (the population included in the study), as these patients are CKD patients (stage 4 and 5 CKD) with the same underlying disease as those patients on dialysis. The absolute decrease in serum phosphorus and the percentage of responders was similar to that observed in haemodialysis patients. Moreover,  the  type  of  AEs  and  the  frequencies  observed  were  in  line  with  those  observed  in sevelamer-naïve  patients  in  the  sevelamer  hydrochloride  studies.  Information  on  AEs  in  a  larger population including drug interactions can be followed as part of the Risk Management Plan.

CHMP found there is a need for regular monitoring of these patients (this was added in the SPC). In addition,  the  applicant  committed  to  perform  a  post-marketing  surveillance  trial  in  patients  not  on dialysis with serum phosphorus ≥ 1.78 mmol/l to obtain additional safety data.

CHMP considered the data are insufficient to extrapolate safety and efficacy to the entire population of CKD patients not on dialysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As observed in dialysis patients, sevelamer carbonate treatment also reduced LDL cholesterol levels in hyperphosphataemic CKD patients not on dialysis. In study SVCARB00105, LDL cholesterol levels decreased from 2.7 ± 0.87 mmol/l (104.7 ± 33.64 mg/dl) at baseline to 1.8 ± 0.65 mmol/l (69.7 ± 25.17 mg/dl) at the end of treatment. The decrease from baseline in LDL cholesterol (-0.9 mmol/l [-35.1 mg/dl]) was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). The reduction is of similar magnitude to that seen in dialysis patients in studies of differing design.

## CKD patients on peritoneal dialysis

No studies with sevelamer carbonate were performed in peritoneal dialysis patients.  Further to the oral  explanation  CHMP  nevertheless  agreed  to  peritoneal  dialysis  as  part  of  the  indication  for sevelamer carbonate, based on the data available for sevelamer hydrochloride in this population, the demonstration of therapeutic equivalence in haemodialysis and the scientific rationale that use of the carbonate  salt  (instead  of  the  hydrochloride  salt)  is  not  expected  to  impact  negatively  on  patients' safety.

## Clinical safety

## · Patient exposure

The  safety  of  sevelamer  (as  either  carbonate  and  hydrochloride  salts)  has  been  investigated  in numerous clinical trials involving a total of 969 haemodialysis patients with treatment duration of 4 to 50 weeks  (724 patients  treated  with  sevelamer  hydrochloride  and  245  with  sevelamer  carbonate), 97 peritoneal  dialysis  patients  with  treatment  duration  of  12 weeks  (all  treated  with  sevelamer hydrochloride) and

Very  few  non-dialysis patients received sevelamer (128 patients in total: 79 for sevelamer hydrochloride; 49 for sevelamer carbonate).

Treatment duration  ranged  from  approximately  4  to 50  weeks.  The  mean  actual  dose  of  sevelamer varied across studies from 3.6 to 6.7 g/day. In dialysis studies, the maximum average actual daily dose was 15 g for sevelamer hydrochloride and 14 g for sevelamer carbonate (both recorded in study GD3199-301 and including some patients who took 14 g as a single daily dose). In hyperphosphataemic CKD  patients  not  on  dialysis,  the  maximum  average  actual  daily  dose  was  6.7  g  for  sevelamer hydrochloride in study GTC-45-204 and 10 g for sevelamer carbonate in study SVCARB00105.

The mean age of patients was similar in each study and ranged from 53 to 64 years. Within each study, more male than female patients were treated.

## · Adverse events

The  safety  profile  of  sevelamer  carbonate  dosed  three  times  per  day  in  hyperphosphataemic  CKD patients is similar to the established safety profile of the sevelamer hydrochloride. An assessment of the safety data submitted for sevelamer showed the following:

-  The  AE  profiles  of  sevelamer  hydrochloride  tablet,  sevelamer  carbonate  tablet  and  sevelamer carbonate powder formulations are comparable when administered three times per day with meals to hyperphosphataemic CKD patients.
-  The  safety  profiles  of  sevelamer  hydrochloride  and  sevelamer  carbonate  were  similar  in hyperphosphataemic CKD patients on dialysis and not on dialysis.
-  The  safety  profile  seen  with  sevelamer  carbonate  is  similar  to  the  established  safety  profile  of sevelamer  hydrochloride,  as  represented  in  the  sevelamer  hydrochloride  clinical  studies,  the sevelamer hydrochloride post-marketing safety profile, and the sevelamer hydrochloride SmPC.
-  AEs for  both  sevelamer  hydrochloride  and  sevelamer  carbonate  were  distributed  across  similar system organ classes, and the majority of AEs were of mild or moderate intensity.
-  The most common treatment emergent AEs observed for sevelamer hydrochloride and sevelamer carbonate  across  studies  were  gastrointestinal  events,  including  nausea  and  vomiting.  The sevelamer safety profile was consistent with the non-absorbed nature of the product.
-  Overall,  AEs  seen  during  treatment  with  sevelamer  carbonate  powder  and  tablets  in  clinical studies  were  similar  in  nature  to  adverse  drug  reactions  spontaneously  received  by  Genzyme during sevelamer hydrochloride post-marketing surveillance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  most  common  all  causality  AEs  during  sevelamer  carbonate  treatment  were  nausea,  vomiting, urinary  tract  infection,  arteriovenous  fistula  operation,  diarrhoea,  muscle  spasms  and  arteriovenous fistula complication.

In study REN-003-04, apart from peritonitis the reported AEs are consistent with the safety profile of sevelamer hydrochloride in haemodialysis patients.  The AE of peritonitis is a known risk of peritoneal dialysis and the SPC recommends that patients on peritoneal dialysis should be closely monitored to ensure the correct use of appropriate aseptic technique with the prompt recognition and management of any signs and symptoms associated with peritonitis.

As requested by CHMP Genzyme has undertaken, as part of extended safety surveillance to collect additional  safety  information  in  patients  receiving  peritoneal  dialysis  who  are  taking  sevelamer hydrochloride or carbonate (Observations study by the French Language Peritoneal Dialysis Registry (RDPLF database).

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

In  study  SVCARB00205  (an  open-label,  randomised,  cross-over  study,  of  sevelamer  carbonate powder  dosed  TID  with  meals  versus  sevelamer  hydrochloride  tablets  dosed  TID  with  meals  in hyperphosphataemic  CKD  patients  on  haemodialysis)  the  frequency  of  SAEs  was  low  in  each treatment regimen .

Overall,  the  majority  of  SAEs  observed  during  sevelamer  hydrochloride  and  sevelamer  carbonate treatment was consistent with the patients` underlying co-morbidities of CKD and was considered by the investigators as not related to sevelamer.

For  both  sevelamer  carbonate  and  sevelamer  hydrochloride,  deaths  were  rare  and  were  generally consistent with the patients' underlying CKD.

## · Laboratory findings

Across  clinical  studies,  fluctuations  in  laboratory  parameters  were  most  often  representative  of  comorbidities in hyperphosphataemic CKD patients.

## · Safety in special populations

No paediatric studies have yet been conducted with sevelamer carbonate.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Patients  with  CKD  may  develop  low  levels  of  fat-soluble  vitamins  A,  D,  E  and  K,  depending  on dietary intake and the severity of their disease. It cannot be excluded that Renvela can bind fat-soluble vitamins contained in ingested food. In patients not taking supplemental vitamins but on sevelamer, serum  vitamin  A,  D,  E  and  K  status  should  be  assessed  regularly.  It  is  recommended  that  vitamin supplements be given if necessary.  It  is  recommended  that  CKD  patients  not  on  dialysis  are  given vitamin  D  supplements  (approximately  400 IU  of  native  vitamin  D  daily)  which  can  be  part  of  a multivitamin  preparation  to  be  taken  apart  from  their  dose  of  Renvela.  In  patients  undergoing peritoneal dialysis additional monitoring of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid is recommended, since vitamin A, D, E and K levels were not measured in a clinical study in these patients.

There is at present insufficient data to exclude the possibility of folate deficiency during long term Renvela treatment.

In interaction studies in healthy volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50% when co-administered with sevelamer hydrochloride in a single dose study. Consequently, sevelamer should not be taken simultaneously with ciprofloxacin.

In  healthy  volunteers,  sevelamer  hydrochloride,  had  no  effect  on  the  bioavailability  of  digoxin, warfarin, enalapril or metoprolol.

Reduced levels of ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus have been reported in transplant patients  when  co-administered  with  sevelamer  hydrochloride  without  any  clinical  consequences  (i.e graft rejection). The possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded and a close monitoring of blood concentrations of ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus should be considered during the use of combination and after its withdrawal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Very  rare  cases  of  hypothyroidism  have  been  reported  in  patients  co-administered  sevelamer hydrochloride,  which  contains  the  same  active  moiety  as  sevelamer  carbonate,  and  levothyroxine. Closer monitoring of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is therefore recommended in patients receiving sevelamer carbonate and levothyroxine.

Patients  taking  anti-arrhythmic  medicinal  products  for  the  control  of  arrhythmias  and  anti-seizure medicinal  products  for  the  control  of  seizure  disorders  were  excluded  from  clinical  trials.  Caution should  be  exercised  when  prescribing  sevelamer  carbonate  to  patients  also  taking  these  medicinal products.

Sevelamer carbonate is not absorbed and may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products. When  administering  any  medicinal  product  where  a  reduction  in  the  bioavailability  could  have  a clinically significant effect on safety or efficacy, the medicinal product should be administered at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer carbonate, or the physician should consider monitoring blood levels.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

Across  studies  with  both  sevelamer  hydrochloride  and  sevelamer  carbonate,  AEs  leading  to  study discontinuation were most commonly gastrointestinal disorders or renal transplant. Renal transplant is common in CKD dialysis patients, as many patients on dialysis are awaiting kidney transplantation. Gastrointestinal events which  led  to study discontinuation are consistent with the  sevelamer hydrochloride safety profile.

## · Post marketing experience

Sevelamer  carbonate  has  been  given  a  Marketing  Authorisation  in  the  following  countries:  USA (2007), Argentina, Kuwait (both 2008), Chile and India (2009).

Furthermore  sevelamer  hydrochloride  has  been  on  the  EU  market  since  2000  (haemodialysis)  and 2007 (peritoneal dialysis).

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.

The  safety  of  sevelamer  hydrochloride  has  been  well  characterised  from  the  clinical  development programme and from nearly ten years of post-marketing experience with sevelamer hydrochloride in hyperphosphataemic CKD patients on dialysis. Overall, the safety profile of sevelamer is consistent with the non-absorbed nature of the product (sevelamer) with gastrointestinal adverse effects the most common adverse effects experienced.

The two sevelamer salts have been shown to be pharmacodynamically equivalent in terms of control of serum phosphorus and adverse event profile.

Renvela  is  proposed  under  2  pharmaceutical  forms,  as  tablets  or  powder  for  oral  suspension.  The formulation administered may be based on patient preference.

The EU RMP is well written and globally acceptable. The identified  and  potential  risks  associated with  the  use  of  sevelamer  carbonate  are  Intestinal  Obstruction/Ileus,  Vitamin  Deficiency,  Potential Peritonitis,  Drug  Interactions,  and  Pregnancy  and  Lactation.  These  safety  concerns  have  not  been identified or studied with sevelamer carbonate in clinical trials but are mainly the results of the clinical or  post-marketing  experience  with  sevelamer  hydrochloride  (Renagel)  use  in  the  haemodialysis patients. Consequently, similar pharmacovigilance actions are proposed for sevelamer carbonate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is acknowledged that the major potential mechanism by which sevelamer carbonate can interact with other  drugs  is  by  affecting  their  absorption,  or  in  the  case  of  drugs  undergoing  enterohepatic circulation, by affecting excretion. Interaction studies were performed with sevelamer hydrochloride in healthy volunteers but not with sevelamer carbonate. Consequently, the applicant has proposed to include  the  same  warnings  of  sevelamer  hydrochloride  in  sections  4.4.  and  4.5.  of  the  SPC  of sevelamer carbonate, and this was accepted by the CHMP.

The  risk  of  intestinal  obstruction/ileus  is  included  in  the  Renvela  RMP.  A  total  of  20  reports  of intestinal  obstruction/ileus  have  been  received  for  patients  on  sevelamer  hydrochloride  403  mg capsules, 400 mg and 800 mg tablets. Of these reports, 7 were assessed as severe by the reporter, and 1 was assessed as moderate. Because sevelamer carbonate contains the same active moiety as sevelamer hydrochloride similar risks are expected for both sevelamer salts. Consequently, the conclusion that intestinal obstruction/ileus is a potential serious identified risk is endorsed. The warnings in proposed sevelamer carbonate SPC for intestinal obstruction, ileus and constipation are acceptable.

Peritonitis is a major risk in the PD population. In a single Peritoneal Dialysis Study with sevelamer hydrochloride  (REN00304),  a  total  of  11  patients  (11.3%)  on  sevelamer  hydrochloride  experienced peritonitis.  Eight  of  the  11  (8.2%)  reports  of  peritonitis  were  serious.  In  this  study,  there  was  no statistical  difference  in  the  frequency  of  peritonitis  in  patients  treated  with  sevelamer  hydrochloride versus  those  treated  with  calcium  acetate,  although  this  may  be  explained  by  the  large  confidence intervals.  However,  the  rates  of  peritonitis  in  the  calcium  acetate  treated  arm  were  lower  than  the background  rates  of  peritonitis  anticipated  in  this  population  (0.31  episodes/patient  year).  This unbalanced  distribution  was  not  observed  in  the  French  RDPLF  registry  data,  where  a  decreased peritonitis risk  was  observed  in  the  sevelamer  hydrochloride  (Renagel)  group.  The  potential mechanisms are infection from skin organisms such as coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcal  species,  Corynebacterium,  Bacillus  species;  unwashed  hands/fingers  contaminating dialysate/catheter.

The proposed risk minimisation activities are acceptable:

- ¾ Provision of educational material to patients and health professionals containing information on the risk factors for and prevention of peritonitis.
- ¾ Warning in the proposed sevelamer carbonate SPC.
- ¾ Comprehensive post-marketing surveillance as part of routine PV practice; 6-month PSURs to include an analysis of cases of peritonitis.

The risk minimisation measures proposed for sevelamer carbonate in peritoneal dialysis patients are a continuation  of  those  already  in  place  for  sevelamer  hydrochloride.  An  observational  study  will  be conducted with the French registry (RDPLF) to determine whether the risk of peritonitis differs in PD patients  taking  sevelamer  hydrochloride  or  sevelamer  carbonate,  compared  to  patients  receiving treatment with other phosphate binders.

The objectives of this study are:

- 1) To  determine,  whether  the  risk  of  peritonitis  differs  in  peritoneal  dialysis  (PD)  patients  with sevelamer use compared to patients receiving treatment with other phosphate binders.
- 2) To  estimate,  the  rates  of  peritonitis  in  peritoneal  dialysis  (PD)  patients  on  treatment  with sevelamer, and those who are receiving treatment with other phosphate binders.
- 3) To evaluate the identity of causative organisms in peritonitis infections in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients  on  treatment  with  sevelamer  compared  to  patients  receiving  treatment  with  other phosphate binders.

As sevelamer carbonate may be used off-label (e.g. in less than 18 year old patients), the applicant is requested to provide risk minimisation measures to monitor and avoid risk of such off-label use. In addition, all cases of off-label use in children should be clearly reviewed and discussed in the PSURs.

Finally the Applicant agreed to perform a post-marketing study in CKD patients not on dialysis with serum  phosphorus  &gt;  1.78  mmol/l  in  order  to  better  document  the  safety  of  the  product  in  these patients.

| In interaction studies in healthy  volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride,  which contains the same active moiety  as Renvela, decreased the  bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by  approximately 50% when co-  administered with sevelamer  hydrochloride in a single dose study.  Consequently, Renvela should not be  taken simultaneously with  ciprofloxacin.  Reduced levels of ciclosporin,  mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus  have been reported in transplant  patients when co-administered with  sevelamer hydrochloride without any  clinical consequences (i.e graft  rejection). The possibility of an  interaction cannot be excluded and a  close monitoring of blood  concentrations of ciclosporin,  mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus  should be considered during the use of  combination and after its withdrawal.  Very rare cases of hypothyroidism  have been reported in patients co-  administered sevelamer hydrochloride,  which contains the same active moiety  as sevelamer carbonate, and  levothyroxine.  Closer monitoring of  thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)  levels is therefore recommended in  patients receiving sevelamer carbonate  and levothyroxine.  Patients taking anti-arrhythmic  medicinal products for the control of  arrhythmias and anti-seizure medicinal  products for the control of seizure  disorders were excluded from clinical  trials. Caution should be exercised  when prescribing Renvela to patients  also taking these medicinal products.  In interaction studies in healthy  volunteers, sevelamer hydrochloride,  which contains the same active moiety  as Renvela, had no effect on the  bioavailability of digoxin, warfarin,  enalapril or metoprolol.  Renvela is not absorbed and may affect  the bioavailability of other medicinal  products. When administering any  medicinal product where a reduction in  the bioavailability could have a  clinically significant effect on safety or  efficacy, the medicinal product should  be administered at least one hour  before or three hours after Renvela, or  the physician should consider   |

Studies in animals have shown some reproductive toxicity when sevelamer was administered to rats at high doses (see section 5.3). Sevelamer has also been shown to reduce the absorption of several vitamins including folic acid (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). The potential risk to humans is unknown. Renvela should only be given to pregnant women if clearly needed and after a careful risk/benefit analysis has been conducted for both the mother and the foetus. Lactation: It is unknown whether sevelamer is excreted in human breast milk. The non-absorbed nature of sevelamer indicates that excretion of sevelamer in breast milk is unlikely. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Renvela should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Renvela therapy to the |

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the MA application is of the opinion that the following risk minimisation activities are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product: see as detailed in section 2.3 of this CHMP Assessment Report

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The active substance and both finished products have been adequately described. The excipients used in the preparation of the film-coated tablets and the powder for oral suspension, and the manufacturing process selected are typical of such preparations.

The results of the tests indicate that the active substance and the film-coated tablets as well as the powder for oral suspension can be reproducibly manufactured and therefore the products should have a satisfactory and uniform performance.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The applicant gave a Letter of Undertaking and committed to resolve these as Follow-up measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The main pharmacodynamic effect of sevelamer and its mechanism of action have been adequately demonstrated in the primary pharmacodynamic studies. The secondary pharmacology studies showed that sevelamer is devoid of any measurable effects on general behaviour, locomotor activity or other CNS  activity,  body  temperature,  cardiovascular  or  respiratory  control  in  experimental  animals. Preclinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  demonstrated  that  sevelamer  is  excreted  entirely  in  the  faeces without significant systemic absorption.

Overall, the toxicology program revealed that sevelamer is generally well tolerated without any major signs of systemic toxicity. The decreased serum levels of vitamin D, vitamin E and folic acid as well as the coagulation defect detected at high doses in rats, likely to result from vitamin K deficiency, can be  ascribed  to  adsorption  of  the  vitamin  itself  (in  the  case  of  folic  acid)  or  of  biliary  acids  to  the polymer. This information is included in the SPC.

## Efficacy

- Patients on dialysis:

Two small trials compared the sevelamer hydrochloride formulation with the carbonate formulation. The  studies  GD3-163-201  (sevelamer  carbonate  tablets)  and  SVCARB00205  (sevelamer  carbonate powder)  were  designed  to  demonstrate  therapeutic  equivalence,  in  terms  of  the  control  of  serum phosphorus (time-weighted mean  serum phosphorus), of sevelamer carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride  in  CKD  patients  on  haemodialysis.    Study  GD3-163-201  was  a  double-blind, randomized, crossover study whereas study SVCARB00205 was an open-label, randomized, crossover study.  The  results  from  these  2  studies  indicate  that  sevelamer  carbonate  (powder  and  tablets)  and sevelamer  hydrochloride  tablets,  each  dosed  TID  with  meals,  are  equivalent  in  controlling  serum phosphorus.

In addition, study GD3-199-301 (open label, randomised, parallel study to demonstrate non-inferiority of sevelamer carbonate powder once daily (QD) to sevelamer hydrochloride tablets three times daily (TID).  Non-inferiority  of  sevelamer  carbonate  powder  (QD)  compared  to  sevelamer  hydrochloride tablets (TID) was not demonstrated. Thus CHMP did not agree to the once daily administration.

No  studies  are  submitted  with  sevelamer  carbonate  in  peritoneal  dialysis  patients.  The  CHMP nevertheless agreed to peritoneal dialysis as part of the indication for sevelamer carbonate, based on the  data  available  for  sevelamer  hydrochloride  in  this  population,  the  demonstration  of  therapeutic equivalence  of  sevelamer  hydrochloride  and  carbonate  in  haemodialysis  and  the  scientific  rationale

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that use of the carbonate salt (instead of the hydrochloride salt) is not expected to impact negatively on patients` safety.

## - Patients not on dialysis

Study SVCARB00105 was an open label, single arm, dose titration study (sevelamer carbonate tablets dosed TID) conducted in hyperphosphataemic CKD patients not on dialysis. The trial in itself was considered too small to support the large group of non-dialysis CKD patients. However, the majority of  CHMP  members  concluded  that  although  the  database  is  very  small,  sevelamer  carbonate  is approvable for pre-dialysis CKD patients with serum phosphorus level ≥ 1.78 mmol/l (the population included in the study), as these patients are CKD patients with the same underlying disease as those patients on dialysis. The absolute decrease in serum phosphorus and the percentage of responders was similar  to  that  observed  in  haemodialysis  patients.  Moreover,  the  type  of  AEs  and  the  frequencies observed were in line with those observed in sevelamer-naïve patients in the sevelamer hydrochloride studies. Information on AEs in a larger population including drug interactions can be followed as part of the Risk Management Plan. CHMP found there is a need for regular monitoring of these patients, and  this  was  added  in  the  SPC.  In  addition,  the  applicant  committed  to  perform  a  post-marketing surveillance trial in patients not on dialysis with serum phosphorus ≥ 1.78 mmol/l to obtain additional safety data.

## Safety

The  safety  profile  of  sevelamer  carbonate  dosed  three  times  per  day  in  hyperphosphataemic  CKD patients is similar to the established safety profile of the sevelamer hydrochloride. The AE profiles of sevelamer hydrochloride tablet, sevelamer carbonate tablet and sevelamer carbonate powder formulations are comparable when administered three times per day with meals to hyperphosphataemic  CKD  patients.  The  safety  profiles  of  sevelamer  hydrochloride  and  sevelamer carbonate were similar in hyperphosphataemic CKD patients on dialysis and not on dialysis. AEs for both sevelamer hydrochloride and sevelamer carbonate were distributed across similar system organ classes, and the majority of AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. The sevelamer safety profile was consistent with the non-absorbed nature of the product. The most common treatment emergent AEs observed  across  studies  were  gastrointestinal  events,  including  nausea  and  vomiting.  Overall,  AEs seen during treatment with sevelamer carbonate powder and tablets in clinical studies were similar in nature to adverse drug reactions spontaneously received by Genzyme during sevelamer hydrochloride post-marketing  surveillance.  The  most  common  all  causality  AEs  during  sevelamer  carbonate treatment  were  nausea,  vomiting,  urinary  tract  infection,  arteriovenous  fistula  operation,  diarrhoea, muscle spasms and arteriovenous fistula complication.

In the peritoneal dialysis study with sevelamer hydrochloride, apart from peritonitis the reported AEs are consistent with the safety profile of sevelamer hydrochloride in haemodialysis patients.  Peritonitis is  a  known  risk  of  peritoneal  dialysis  and  the  SPC  recommends  that  patients  on  peritoneal  dialysis should be closely monitored to ensure the correct use of appropriate aseptic technique with the prompt recognition and management of any signs and symptoms associated with peritonitis.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

## · User consultation

A cross bridging has been performed adequately referring to the sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel) PIL  (Patient  Information  Leaflet)  for  the  items  which  are  exactly  the  same,  mainly  the  safety.  In addition a new limited user test (four questions) has been performed only for the small differences with regard to the new population (for non dialysed patients).

The user testing report is in accordance with EU guidance on user testing of the PIL.

## Risk-benefit assessment

A routine EMEA GCP Inspection at the sponsor site and at one investigator site for the clinical study SVCARB00205 revealed critical and major issues, with regard to eligibility criteria, drug compliance, and adverse event reporting. Further to additional analyses and oral explanations by the applicant the data submitted were considered acceptable to support the current application.

The results from 2 small clinical studies in CKD patients on haemodialysis showed that sevelamer carbonate (powder and tablets) and sevelamer hydrochloride tablets (each dosed TID with meals) are equivalent in controlling serum phosphorus, and have a similar safety profile.

No  studies  are  submitted  with  sevelamer  carbonate  in  peritoneal  dialysis  patients.  The  CHMP nevertheless accepts this part of the indication for sevelamer carbonate, based on the data available for sevelamer hydrochloride in this population, the demonstration of therapeutic equivalence of sevelamer hydrochloride and carbonate in haemodialysis and the scientific rationale that use of the carbonate salt (instead of the hydrochloride salt) is not expected to impact negatively on patients` safety.

The database is very small for patients not on dialysis with serum phosphorus &gt; 1.78 mmol/l, however as these patients are CKD patients with the same underlying disease as those patients on dialysis, the majority of CHMP members also endorsed the use of sevelamer carbonate in this group, provided that additional  data  are  gathered  in  a  post-marketing  study  to  reinforce  the  safety  data  set  (follow-up measure).

Based on the data available, no difference in terms of efficacy or safety profile has been shown as compared to sevelamer hydrochloride. The applicant`s claim that sevelamer carbonate would have a lower  risk  for  metabolic  acidosis  and  therefore  would  be  of  particular  benefit  for  the  treatment  of paediatric patients and non-dialysis CKD patients is not supported by data: (i) whether there is indeed a higher risk for metabolic acidosis in these patient groups is not discussed and no data for this claim are submitted; (ii) no data are submitted to support the better safety profile of sevelamer in reducing the  appearance  of  metabolic  acidosis  in  haemodialysis  or  pre-dialysis  patients  (although  there  is  a small,  statistically  significant  difference  in  plasma  bicarbonate  concentration  at  the  end  of  the treatment period); (iii) currently, the use of sevelamer (either hydrochloride or carbonate) in paediatric patients would be off-label.

In  conclusion,  the  claimed  improved  clinical  benefit  of  sevelamer  carbonate,  as  compared  to sevelamer  hydrochloride  remains  unsubstantiated  both  in  clinical  practice  in  CKD  patients  and  in experimental animal settings.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.
-  the following additional risk minimisation activities were required: see as detailed in section 2.3

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by majority decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Renvela  for  the control  of  hyperphosphataemia  in  adult patients  receiving  haemodialysis  or  peritoneal  dialysis  and  in  adult  patients  with  chronic  kidney disease  not  on  dialysis  with  serum  phosphorus  &gt;  1.78  mmol/l was  favourable  and  therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

Divergent views were expressed, considering that:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Efficacy and safety data submitted to support the 'control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis with serum phosphorus &gt; 1.78 mmol/l are based on a very small clinical study.

-  The  follow-up  of  pre-dialysis  patients  is  not  the  same  as  for  dialysis  patients.  The  latter  are  seen every other day and adverse events can be prevented by closely monitoring the blood lab values and adapting treatment given on this basis . This can not be done in the case of  patients who are not on dialysis and who are seen at a much lower frequency.
