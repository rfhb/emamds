## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Topotecan  Hospira  4mg/4ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  is  a  hybrid  medicinal  product containing topotecan hydrochloride as active substance. It is intended for intravenous infusion only after  dilution  with  either  sodium  chloride  9  mg/ml  (0.9%)  solution  for  injection  or  glucose  50 mg/ml  (5%)  solution  for  injection,  resulting  in  a  final  concentration  between  25  and  50 micrograms/ml in the solution for infusion. The reference medicinal product Hycamtin 4 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion has been centrally authorised on 12 November 1996. The reference product has also been registered at a dose of 1 mg; Hospira didn't apply for a 1mg/1ml presentation  of  this  product.  The  active  substance  of  the  reference  product  is  topotecan  also present  as  topotecan  hydrochloride  salt.  The  difference  compared  to  this  reference  medicinal product is a change in the pharmaceutical form, which results in the non inclusion of Mannitol.

Topotecan is a cytotoxic anti-cancer agent (semi-synthetic analogue of the alkaloid camptothecin). Topotecan is exerting its activity by the inhibition of the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase I that is involved  in  DNA  replication.  The  inhibition  is  due  to  stabilisation  of  the  intermediate  covalent complex of enzyme and strand-cleaved DNA. As a result, DNA damage induces apoptotic cell death predominantly in replicating cells such as tumour cells.

The safety and efficacy profile of Topotecan has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, details of which can be found in the EPAR of the reference medicinal product. In addition, there is a longterm post-marketing experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this active substance.

The indication for Topotecan Hospira is different from the reference medicinal product. It is part of the indication approved for the reference medicinal product.

Topotecan Hospira concentrate for solution for infusion is indicated (as monotherapy) for treatment of patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) for whom re-treatment with the first-line regimen  is  not  considered  appropriate.  Topotecan  in  combination  with  cisplatin  is  indicated  for patients with carcinoma of the cervix recurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IVB disease.  Patients  with  prior  exposure  to  cisplatin  require  a  sustained  treatment  free  interval  to justify treatment with the combination.

Hycamtin powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is indicated (as monotherapy) for the treatment of:

- Patients with metastatic carcinoma of the ovary after failure of first-line or subsequent therapy.
- Patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) for whom re-treatment with the first-line regimen is not considered appropriate.

Topotecan in combination with cisplatin is indicated for patients with carcinoma of the cervix which is recurrent after radiotherapy, and for patients with Stage IVB disease. Patients with prior exposure to cisplatin require a sustained treatment-free interval to justify treatment with the combination.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Topotecan  Hospira  Concentrate  for  Solution  for  Infusion  is  available  in  a  single  presentation  of 4mg/4ml. It is  supplied  in  a  5  ml  glass  vial  containing  4mg  of  topotecan  (as  the  hydrochloride salt).

The bulk product is a solution of topotecan hydrochloride in Water for Injections.

Tartaric acid is used to maintain the pH of the solution within the target range, and hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide are used to adjust the bulk solution prior to filling.

It is presented in clear Type I glass vials. The vials are closed with chlorobutyl rubber closures and aluminum seals with plastic flip-off tops. The final sealed, labeled vial may also be sheathed with a clear protective plastic sleeve.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Active Substance

Topotecan hydrochloride is a yellow to orange powder. The molecule has one chiral centre and its chemical name is (S)-10-[(Dimethylamino)methyl]-4-ethyl-4,9-dihydroxy-1H pyrano[ 3',4':6,7]indolizino[1,2-b]quinoline-3,14(4H,12H)-dione hydrochloride.

The chemical structure is characterised by several physicochemical studies such as elemental analysis,  Ultraviolet  (UV),  Infrared  (IR),  Mass  Spectrometry  (MS)  and  Nuclear  Magnetic Resonance (NMR).

The  crystal  form  of  topotecan  hydrochloride  is  very  sensitive  to  the  recrystallisation conditions and this compound is polymorphous. The polymorphism of topotecan hydrochloride has been suitably studied and XRPD patterns show that the same crystalline form is consistently obtained in the GMP batches and in the in-house reference standard.

## · Manufacture:

Topotecan hydrochloride is synthesised by a two-step process (one chemical reaction followed by a salt formation). Detailed information about the manufacturing process, process validation and control of critical manufacturing steps has been supplied in the form of an Active Substance Master

File. At the time of the opinion, only one active substance manufacturer is authorised. specifications and control methods for intermediate product, starting material and reagents have

Adequate in-process controls are applied during the manufacture of the active substance. The been presented and are satisfactory. All relevant impurities, degradation products and residual solvents have been appropriately characterised.

## · Specification:

As no monograph of topotecan exists in the Ph. Eur or USP, in-house specifications have been set for the active substance, in accordance with the principles of ICH guidelines.

The specification proposed is suitable to control the quality of the drug substance manufactured using the current process and includes: appearance, identification (HPLC and FT-IR). Assay and purity (HPLC), water content (Karl Fisher), residual solvents (GC), residual TEA (GC),  heavy metals, sulphated ash, chloride content (titration), specific rotation, bacterial endotoxin, microcount and x-ray powder diffraction.

The analytical methods used in routine controls are correctly described and have been correctly validated following the ICH Q2 (R1) guideline. All validation parameters are correctly determined and comply with their acceptance criteria.

Batch analysis (n=3) data have been presented and all batches were in compliance with the proposed specification.

- Stability:

The  manufacturer  has  conducted  stability  studies  at  long-term  (5±3ºC)  during  18  months  and accelerated conditions (25±2ºC/60±5% RH) during 6 months on two batches. Additionally, forced degradation studies and solid state stressed studies have been performed.

Parameters  tested  included:  appearance,  assay  and  purity  by  HPLC  and  water  content  by  KarlFisher. The test methods are the same as those used in the active substance specification.

Topotecan hydrochloride is double packed in low density polyethylene (LDPE) bags before sealed in aluminium bags. Structural supports are provided by HDPE bottles/drums.

Based on the stability results, it is recommended for topotecan hydrochloride to be stored at 28ºC, protected from light, moisture and excessive heat. The retest period for the drug substance, stored in the proposed packaging material, is supported by the results provided.

## Medicinal Product

- Pharmaceutical development:

The formulation of Topotecan Hospira was based on the innovator product Hycamtin. The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a ready to use solution formulation, as an alternative to the lyophilised product Hycamtin, whilst retaining the innovator's dosing regimen and route of administration.

All excipients are widely used in parenteral products and comply with pharmacopoeial requirements.

The excipients used in the formulation are tartaric acid, water for injection and sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid. They are the same as those contained in the innovator, except for the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

exclusion of mannitol. Mannitol is used in freeze-dried products as a bulking agent and as such is not required in Topotecan Hospira, a solution product.

The development activities focused on delivering a solution product, whilst ensuring stability by managing factors such as pH, temperature, oxygen exposure and maintaining topotecan in its active form while in infusion solution.

During the manufacturing process development, the possibility of terminal sterilisation was investigated and found not possible as the samples experienced significant degradation. Therefore, in accordance with the CPMP/QWP/054/98 guidance 'Decision tree for the selection of sterilisation methods', the product is manufactured via a combination of aseptic filtration and aseptic processing.

The primary packaging components used for Topotecan Hospira were evaluated. The containers comply with the requirements of Ph.Eur. &lt;3.2.1&gt; and the closure formulation complies with the requirements of Ph.Eur. &lt;3.2.9&gt;. Studies have been performed to support the use of the proposed closure and container as primary packaging for Topotecan Hospira:

- the elastomeric closure has been qualified for use based on the results of biological, physicochemical, functionality and other characterisation tests.

- the suitability of the proposed closure formulation with Topotecan Hospira was investigated by studying the compatibility of the product when in contact with the closure for extended periods.

- The container closure integrity has been demonstrated by microbial challenge methods.

Compatibility studies were performed to ensure that the drug product is compatible with the diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride and 5% Dextrose) and the container closure system.

- Adventitious agents:

Not applicable

## · Manufacture of the product:

The manufacturing process can be divided in 7 steps: Compounding, Pre-filtration, Sterilising filtration, aseptic filling, complete stoppering, sealing and packaging.

The manufacturing process is considered as a non-standard process as per Annex II to Note for Guidance on Process Validation (CPMP/QWP/2054/03) but the applicant:

- Provided results of the drug product manufacturing process's validation in pilot batches

- Supported its own experience in the use of aseptic manufacturing process

Therefore, the manufacturing process will be validated according to the protocol provided on the first 3 full-scale manufacturing batches.

Adequate in-process controls are applied. No critical steps are identified, nor there are any intermediates isolated.

## · Product specification

The finished product specification includes appropriate tests for appearance, identification (UV and HPLC), Colour of solution, pH, assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), volume in container, particulate matter, sterility and bacterial endotoxins.

Compendial methods have been verified suitable for their intended use. The non-compendial methods are perfectly described and validated in accordance with ICH Q2(R1) guideline.

Batch results were provided for 3 batches representative of the proposed commercial formula and manufacturing process. The results indicate satisfactory uniformity and compliance with the proposed specification, and that the process is under control.

## · Stability of the product:

Three registration batches of the finished product packed in the intended for marketing primary packaging were put on ICH long-term (5ºC±3ºC during 12 months), and accelerated (25ºC±2ºC/60%RH during 6 months) conditions. In addition, samples were placed under intermediate (15ºC during 12 months) and stress (-20ºC during 1 month) conditions. The following parameters were tested: appearance, colour of solution, pH, assay, related substance, particulate matters, chiral impurities, Sterility and bacterial endotoxins.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In general, the results presented support the shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

Topotecan Hospira was diluted in two different intravenous solutions (0.9% Sodium Chloride and 5% Dextrose) at two concentrations (0.02mg/mL and 0.5mg/mL) that were stored at room temperature (25 ± 2°C) under normal light and refrigerated conditions (5 ± 3°C protected from light) for up to 24 hours. The results support the label claim regarding stability of the drug product when commixed with intravenous solutions as prescribed in the product information.

## Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 2.3 Non-Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The Applicant submitted 27 non-clinical studies from the literature published up to February 2009. A justification why no additional studies were submitted was provided.

## Pharmacology

A review of the literature which details the pharmacology of topotecan has been submitted by the Applicant.

Topotecan  has  been  described  as  a  water-soluble  semi-synthetic  derivate  of  natural  alkaloid camptothecin.  Topotecan  is  a  selective  and  reversible  inhibitor  of  topoisomerase  I  (TOPI),  an enzyme  that  catalyses  the  cleavage  and  re-ligation  of  supercoiled  DNA  during  replication  and transcription. TOPI is essential in eukaryotic cells. The primary cytotoxic mechanism  of camptothecin is replication fork collision with the stabilized TOPI cleavage complex, resulting in a double strand break, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Topotecan is generally considered to be S-phase-specific, and cells outside of S-phase tend to be resistant to treatment.

Cell lines with low TOPI level or with altered or reduced binding of topotecan to TOPI were shown to be resistant to its cytotoxic activity. Topotecan also seems to be a substrate, although poor, for the multidrug resistance associated P-glycoprotein.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

Topotecan  doses  of  0.25,  0.5,  2.5  and  3  mg/kg  did  not  result  in  adverse  CNS  pharmacological effects on locomotor activity, hexobarbital sleeping time, behaviour, body temperature, electroshock response, pain response, or response to seizure-producing drugs in male CD-1 mice. Topotecan dosing caused minor (&lt;10%) and no dose-related changes in cardiac parameters (heart rate, blood pressure and left ventricular pressure) in dogs. No dose-related biologically significant changes were noted in respiration rate or depth, blood pressure or heart rate in rats. Topotecan did not affect intestinal motility or contractility in mice and in isolated guinea pig ileum. Doses of 15  mg/m 2   in  rats  (10  times  the  clinical  dose  on  a  mg/m 2 bases)  caused  significant  (22-34%) increases in urine volume 2-5 hours after dosing compared to the effects of saline. This increase was accompanied by changes in urinary Na + , K +  and Cl - .  These  changes  at  the  highest  dose  of topotecan  tested  suggested  mild  kidney  damage,  but  were  not  considered  clinically  significant because of the 10-fold safety margin.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

A sequence dependent interaction occurs when topotecan is used in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin,  depending  on  whether  the  platinum  is  given  on  Day  1  or  Day  5  of  the  topotecan administration. If either cisplatin or carboplatin is given with  topotecan on Day 1, the dose of both drugs must be decreased to improve tolerability, compared to administration of the platinum on Day 5.

## Pharmacokinetics

A  review  of  the  literature  was  submitted  which  described  the  pharmacokinetic  aspects  of topotecan.

Topotecan possesses a lactone ring that is necessary for interaction with the DNA-TOPI cleavage complex. Topotecan undergoes a pH-dependent reversible hydrolysis from the lactone form to the biologically  inactive  carboxylate  form.  In  vivo,  the  lactone:  carboxylate  ratio  approaches  0.5  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dogs at 12 hours following an intravenous dose, while the AUC ratio of lactone to total topotecan in humans is approximately 35%.

Topotecan pharmacokinetics is approximately linear with dose in all species, with little evidence of accumulation following repeated doses. In mice, following a single intravenous dose of 25 mg/kg, the estimated half-lives of the lactone and total drug were 115 min and 125 min, respectively.

Topotecan rapidly distributes into tissues, and the large steady state volume of distribution (2.8 L/kg in dogs, 75 L/m 2  in humans) indicates extensive binding to tissue components. At 6 hours after dosing, no more than 1% of the dose was present in any tissue. The elimination half-life is similar across species, ranging from 50 min in rats to 100 min in dogs and 2 to 3 hours in humans. Unchanged drug also accounts for the majority excreted in urine and faeces in dogs, although the N-desmethyl derivatives of topotecan and the inactive carboxylate form accounted for 21% of the dose in dogs, and only 4% in rats. There is evidence of enterohepatic recycling in mouse and rat.

Protein  binding is  similar  in  humans,  dogs  and  rats,  ranging  from  25  to  40%,  with  no  apparent variation with drug concentration.

In nonhuman primates and in humans, the AUC of topotecan lactone has been shown to correlate with bone marrow suppression, which is the dose-limiting toxicity.

## Toxicology

A  review  of  the  literature  was  submitted  which  described  the  toxicology  aspects  of  topotecan. There were no toxicology studies submitted as part of the application.

## · Single dose toxicity

The maximum non lethal doses (MNLD) following a single administration of topotecan to mice, rats and dogs were 40, 75 and 7.4 mg/m 2 , respectively (27-fold, 50-fold, and 5-fold higher than the intended clinical dose) while the minimum lethal doses were 56, 148 and 74 mg/m 2 , respectively. Target organs of toxicity were bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, gastrointestinal tract and ovaries.

## · Repeat dose toxicity

Intravenous repeat dose studies of topotecan were conducted in mice (5 day study), rabbits (13 days),  rats  and  Beagle  dogs  (5-28  days).  An  additional  oral  study  was  conducted  in  rats  for  6 months. The dog showed the closest maximum tolerated dose (MTD) when compared to humans for an administration regimen of five daily intravenous doses (dog 1.38 mg/m 2 /day; humans 1.5 mg/m 2 /day). The signs of toxicity were consistent with the pharmacological effects of topotecan.

The toxicity profile was reversible and characterized by myelotoxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia,  lymphopenia  and  anaemia),  lymphoid  depletion,  thymus  atrophy and cellular depletion of the spleen at or below the maximum tolerated dose (4.7 mg/m 2 /day in rats, and 1.3 mg/m 2 /day  in  dogs;  3-fold  higher  and  0.9-fold  the  intended  clinical  dose,  respectively).  Other tissues  with  a  rapid  cell  turnover,  such  as  hair  follicules  and  testis,  exhibited  degeneration  and necrosis. Damage to the gastrointestinal tract was remarkably rare and only seen in the long term oral study. These observations are concordant with clinical findings.

Non-human  primate  (rhesus  monkeys)  and  murine  myeloid  progenitors  were  less  sensitive  to topotecan than human myeloid progenitors. In contrast to mice, dog myeloid progenitors were 5fold more susceptible to topotecan than those from humans.

Repeated  dosing  with  topotecan  caused  increases  in  ALT  and  AST  suggesting  liver  damage, although it was not confirmed histologically.

## · Genotoxicity/ Carcinogenicity

Topotecan was evaluated for potential toxicity in a battery of standard tests in vitro and in vivo . Topotecan was not genotoxic in bacterial test, but it was genotoxic and clastogenic in mammalian cells as predicted by its pharmacological activity.

Long  term  carcinogenicity  studies  have  not  been  performed.  However,  considering  topotecan  is known to be genotoxic to mammalian cells, it is a probable carcinogen.

## · Reproductive and developmental toxicity

Topotecan did not show any toxic effect on male fertility in reproductive toxicity studies conducted in rats.

Topotecan  administration  affected  early  embryonic  development  and  implantation  (i.e.  fetal resorption, microphtalmia, pre-implant loss, mild maternal toxicity and an increase in the number of corpora lutea) when administered to female rats at 1.36 mg/m 2 /day prior to, during and post coitus.

Foetal malformations were observed in rats dosed with topotecan as well as in the control group in an embryo-foetal development study. The most frequent ones occurred in the eye (microphthalmia,  anophthalmia,  rosette  formation  of  the  retina,  coloboma  of  the  retina,  ectopic orbit),  brain  (dilated  lateral  and  third  ventricles),  skull  and  vertebrae.    In  rabbits,  a  dose  of topotecan  approximately  equivalent  to  the  clinical  dose  (1.25  mg/m 2 /day)  caused  maternal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

toxicity, anorexia, decreased litter size and embryolethality, although foetal morphology was not affected.

It  was  concluded  that  topotecan  is  teratogenic,  embryotoxic  and  foetotoxic  at  doses  less  than those recommended clinically (1.5 mg/m 2 /day) and therefore, topotecan may cause foetal harm in humans.

No studies were found to evaluate the toxic effects of topotecan in juvenile animals.

Lactating rats secrete topotecan into breast milk.

## · Local tolerance

Topotecan  intravenous  or  perivenous  administration  to  dogs  at  1x  to  5x  the  concentration administered to humans revealed a level of irritation equivalent to that seen for vehicle and saline controls and consistent with minor trauma.

## · Other toxicities

## Immunotoxicity

Topotecan was found to be weakly antigenic following subcutaneous and intravenous administration to guinea-pigs.

## · Impurities

Chemical analysis of the drug substance and the final product has identified potential impurities that may be present in Hospira´s Topotecan Injection product.

The  Applicant  proposed  suitable  release  and  shelf  life  limits  for  these  impurities  and  issues  of patient safety have been addressed by the literature provided.

## Environmental Risk Assessment

No environmental risk assessment has been submitted..

## Discussion on Non-Clinical aspects

The  non-clinical  studies  presented  by  the  Applicant  provided  an  adequate  overview  of  the pharmacological,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  aspects  of  topotecan.  There  were  no  major issues raised during the assessment from a non-clinical point of view.

The  acceptance  limits established by  the  Applicant  for  impurities  are  in  accordance  with qualification  thresholds  established  in  guidelines  ICH  Q3A  and  ICH  Q3B,  and  therefore  further qualification is not required.

In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), the lack of ERA studies is acceptable

## 2.4 Clinical Aspects

## Introduction

The  Applicant  has  provided  a  review  of  the  literature  with  35  publications  dated  from  1979  to 2009.

This is an application of a Generic of a Centrally Authorised Medicinal Product in accordance with Article  3(3)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  (MAA)  for Topotecan  Hospira  is  classified  as  a  hybrid  generic  application  under  Article  10(3)  of  Directive 2001/83/EC  because  the  pharmaceutical  form  of  the  proposed  product  is  different  from  the Hycamtin reference product. Topotecan Hospira is a concentrate for solution for infusion, whereas Hycamtin is a lyophilised powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. Based on the definition of generic  product  of  Directive  2001/83  as  amended,  different  dosage  forms  of  immediate  release products are considered the same dosage form only if they are administered orally.

The active ingredient in Topotecan Hospira is topotecan (as topotecan hydrochloride) and it is the same with  the  active  ingredient  in  Hycamtin.  The  strength  of  the  Topotecan  Hospira  product  is 4mg/4ml. This is identical to the concentration of reconstituted Hycamtin product (4 mg), when prepared for administration in 4 ml. As such, the in-use strength of the proposed and reference products is considered to be the same.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Exemption

The  pharmaceutical  form  of  Topotecan  Hospira  is  a  'Concentrate  for  Solution  for  Infusion'.  This differs  from  the  reference  product,  which  is  a 'Powder for Concentrate for Solution for Infusion'. The  Applicant  developed  the  solution  product  eliminating  the  initial  reconstitution  step  in  the preparation of the product prior to administration. As a consequence  of  the change  in pharmaceutical form, the formulation of the proposed and reference products is different.

Both Topotecan Hospira and reference products are administered as an intravenous infusion. The Applicant proposed that Topotecan Hospira should have part of the indication approved and, the same dosage regimen and route of administration as Hycamtin. Comparative testing has confirmed that the innovator and proposed products are pharmaceutically equivalent and have a comparable impurity profile. As the innovator and proposed products are intended for intravenous administration,  bioequivalence  studies  are  not  required.  Therefore  no  additional  detailed  study reports from clinical have been trials submitted by the Applicant.

## Clinical studies

The  Application  contained  clinical  data  from  the  review  of  the  publication  literature  for  the proposed indication:

## Topotecan monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of:

Patients  with  relapsed  small  cell  lung  cancer  [SCLC]  for  whom  re-treatment  with  the  first-line regimen is not considered appropriate (see section 5.1).

Topotecan  in  combination  with  cisplatin  is  indicated  for  patients  with  carcinoma  of  the  cervix recurrent after radiotherapy and for patients with Stage IVB disease. Patients with prior exposure to cisplatin require a sustained treatment free interval to justify treatment with the combination (see section 5.1).

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## PSUR

The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference product.

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  version  5.3  dated  November  2009  as described by the Applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

No description of the Risk Management Plan has to be provided by the Applicant. The application is based  on  a  reference  medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring  additional  risk minimisation activities have been identified.

## Discussion on Clinical aspects

Topotecan  hydrochloride  has  a  well-recognized  efficacy  and  an  acceptable  level  of  safety  in  the indications  claimed  for  Topotecan  Hospira.  There  were  no  major  objections  or  other  concerns raised  during  the  assessment  of  the  clinical  aspects  and  no  additional  clinical  studies  were required.

Regarding the waiver of bioequivalence studies and/or clinical studies it is important to highlight that  this  product  is  an  aqueous  intravenous  solution,  as  the  reference  product  at  the  time  of administration. Both products are at the same concentration at the time of administration and the excipients are similar. The absence of the mannitol as diluent for lyophilisation is irrelevant in a product for injection.

In conclusion and in accordance with the Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence, Bioequivalence testing with the reference product is not required under the provisions  of  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  investigation  of  Bioequivalence  and  Bioavailability (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98): 'The Applicant is not required to submit a bioequivalence study if the

product  is  to  be  administered  as  an  aqueous  intravenous  solution  containing  the  same  active substance in the same concentration as the currently authorised product'.

An  RMP  was  considered  not  required  as  there  are  no  safety  concerns  requiring  additional  risk minimisation  activities  with  respect  to  the  reference  medicinal  product.  It  was  considered  that routine pharmacovigilance according to the Detailed Description of Pharmacovigilance System was sufficient for safety monitoring, without the need for additional actions.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

The  application  contains  adequate  quality,  non  clinical  and  clinical  data.  A  benefit/Risk  balance comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are required beyond those included in the product information

## Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of Topotecan Hospira in the treatment of patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) for whom re-treatment with the first-line regimen is not considered appropriate. Topotecan in combination with cisplatin is indicated for patients with carcinoma of the cervix which is recurrent after radiotherapy, and for patients with Stage IVB disease. Patients with prior exposure to cisplatin require a sustained treatment-free interval to justify treatment with the combination.

Was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
