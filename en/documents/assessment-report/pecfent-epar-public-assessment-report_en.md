Through nasal administration, gastrointestinal and hepatic presystemic elimination is  bypassed  which  is  expected  to  enable  high  absolute  bioavailability  of  the drug substance. The  purpose  of  Archimedes'  nasal  fentanyl  product  PecFent  is  to  deliver  fentan quantity into the nasal cavity and thereby to achieve rapid systemic absorption as w action.  Fentanyl is  assumed to be suitable for nasal administration due to its low mo high pote

The PecFent formulation incorporates PecSys, a proprietary pectin-based gelling agent which aims to optimise the profile of fentanyl by modulating absorption; allowing short time to Tmax but controlled Cmax.  It  comprises  fentanyl  in  the  form  of  the  citrate  salt,  pectin,  tonicity  adjusting  agent  and preservatives. The solution has a low viscosity and can be delivered using a conventional nasal spray pump. When the spray droplets  are  deposited  into  the  nose,  the  pectin  interacts  with  calcium  ions present in the nasal mucosal secretions to form soft, mildly adherent gel droplets on the surface of the nasal mucosa.

Fentanyl  crosses  the  placenta  in  animals  and  humans,  and  it  is  excreted  into  human  breast  milk. Therefore, women should only breast-feed while taking fentanyl after a careful benefit-risk evaluation, because of the possibility of sedation and/or respiratory depression in their infants. SmPC and PL have been labelled accordingly.

In  order  to  develop  a  suitable  intranasal  formulation  for  FNS,  the  applicant  performed  three pharmacokinetic studies (non-GLP)  in  sheep to evaluate the absorption of different fentanyl formulations, also in part with or without the presence of pectin.

Findings in these studies w restricted to typical pharmacological side effects of fentanyl treatment.

The  applicant  was unable to correlate these signs of anaemia to FNS treatment, because of the progressive or terminal disease  status  of  these  patients.

Moreover, signs of hypercellular bone comparable extent also among controls. Due to the lack of a clear correlation with the limitation to a single study  and  the  reversibility of the mild effects investigations are not deemed necessary.

## Local Tolerance

Local tolerance was analysed as part of the repeated-dose toxicity studies. Both in the three months toxicity study in rats and the nine months chronic toxicity study in dogs, no signs of local intolerability were apparent. In contrast, a higher incidence of minimal to slight goblet cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia in the most anterior and the next following segment of the nasal cavity was found in female rats of the high dose group in the six months toxicity study in rats. No such changes were evident at the end of the recovery period. Hypertrophy/hyperplasia of this cell type is considered to be a reversible regular physiological adaptive response to exposure to a mild irritant. In addition, there is evidence that the rat may be generally more susceptible to toxic effects on nasal cavity than non-rodents due to their thinner nasal mucosa. Although in clinical trials with FNS nasal mucosa related side effects such as sneezing,  nasopharyngitis  and  rhinitis  were  observed,  the  overall  nasal  tolerability  was  adequately demonstrated  in  humans.  Altogether,  the  risk  that  patients  who  are  using  FNS  will  suffer  from irreversible nasal toxicity is considered to be highly unlikely.

The  primary  efficacy  measures  were  the  Cmax,  Tmax,  and  AUC  of  plasma  fentanyl  following administration of each formulation. The secondary efficacy measure was the bioavailability of the nasal formulations relative to the oral lozenge, Frel. Safety and tolerability were assessed by a reactogenicity (local  nasal  tolerability)  questionnaire,  completed  after  each  nasal  dose,  and  by  monitoring  other adverse events throughout the study. This study was performed to select a nasal fentanyl formulation that would maint obtained  with  nasal  administration  of  fentanyl  whilst  modulating  Cmax,  to  achieve  a

During the study, 18 healthy male and female subjects (aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 50 years) each received 100 µg  fentanyl  (1.0  mg/ml  fentanyl  base,  in  the  form  of  the  citrate  salt)  in  the  three  different  nasal formulations  and  200  µg  fentanyl  as  the  lozenge  formulation,  on  four  separate  dosing  periods (following a randomised Latin square design). Naltrexone was administered to the subjects before and during each dosing period to block the pharmacological effects of the fentanyl. Blood samples were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

collected  at  regular  intervals  up  to  24  hours  after  each  dose  administration.  There  was  a  washout period of, at least, three days between each dose.

The data presented above were not dose normalised for the Actiq 200 µg dose. As compared to the 100  µg  doses  of  the  fentanyl  formulations,  Actiq  displayed  lower  Cmax  values.  This  finding  is explainable by the fact that only a portion of the OTFC dose is absorbed transmucosally. The remaining portion is swallowed  and  is  either later absorbed  or  presystemically  eliminated by  first-pass metabolism.  The  first  pass  effect  observed  after  oral  administration  also  explains  the  less  than proportional increase in AUC for the 200 µg Actiq dose as compared to the 100 µg FCNS dose.

Standardised methods  were  employed  for assessing product safety in the Phase I studies. Local tolerability was assessed by the subjects using a specifically designed reactogenicity questionnaire and completing an overall assessment of the convenience of nasal dosing at the end of each nasal treatment. A clinical safety  assessment by an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist was

Despite its long t½, fentanyl is known to exhibit a short duration of action that is consistent with rapid and  extensive  uptake  of  fentanyl  in  highly  perfused  tissues  (brain,  heart,  and  lungs)  (Mather  and Gourlay  1991).  This  rapid  uptake,  as  well  as  the  redistribution  of  fentanyl  between  a  deep  tissue compartment  and  the  plasma,  results  in  plasma  concentrations  that  decrease  rapidly  to  below  a clinically relevant threshold.

## Metabolism

The metabolism of fentanyl has been extensively described in the literature, and there is no reason to believe that administration by the intranasal route would alter the metabolic pathways; therefore, the

As known from study CP037/02, Tmax is expected to occur after about 19 minutes. Five blood samples were taken within the first 30 min post-administration, which is believed to adequately cover the time of  maximum  plasma  concentration.  Terminal  elimination  of  fentanyl  is  known  to  take  long  due  to redistribution from peripheral tissues. Hence, the overall sampling period of 48 hours was considered adequate.

17 subjects were enrolled, of which 12 (8 males, 4 females) completed the study successfully and comprised the PK population.

Although the test products were administered under naltrexone block, high doses (up to 800 µg) were applied to healthy volunteers in study CP042/05. Accordingly, it does not surprise that five out of 17 enrolled subjects dropped out. 4 subjects were withdrawn from the study (1 due to AEs [vomiting after

Statistical demonstration of dose proportionality was been provided for Cmax and AUC. More than dose of absorption from proportional increases in plasma concentration have been observed for the extent time zero to the last quantifiable timepoint post-dose (AUCt).

the  one  side  and considered ax  and  Cmax  are evant PK parameters since they characterize the rapid increase in fentanyl's ons. The  applicant  argued  that  this  may  be  related  to  the  low  number  of  subjects  on plasma  concentrations  below  LLOQ  for  the  lower  doses  on  the  other  side,  and  was acceptable  by  CHMP.  In  any  case,  for  this  kind  of  on-demand  medication,  Tm considered the more rel plasma concentrati onality over the proposed dose range of 100 to 800 µg per puff was shown to an Overall, dose proporti acceptable degree.

## Safety results

Local  tolerability  was  monitored  objectively  (ENT  specialist  assessment)  and  su volunteers  (reactogenicity bjectively  by  the questionnaire).  The  most  often  reported  clinical  finding  was  erythema  of mild intensity. In one case local findings are considered to be related to an ongoing upper respiratory tract fection.  However,  occurrence  of  local  findings  appears  to  be  related  to  the  number  of  nasal ll  (accumulation in the right nostril). Overall, the PecFent formulation did not cular local tolerability problems and the majority of subjects rated FCNS in spray actuations as we demonstrate parti administration as not inconvenient.

## Study CP047/07

This was a single centre, five-way open trial to assess the relative bioavailability, ph safety  of  multipl armacokinetics and e  doses  of  PecFent  (Fentanyl  Citrate  Nasal  Spray  [FCNS])  compared  to  a  single NasalFent dose.

Five treatments regime each subject in the order listed below ('dose escalation'), with a washout peri between each regimen:

The primary objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PecFent followi consecutive administrations of 100 μ g (8 x 100 μ l) and after various time periods b (2 x 100 μ l) doses. The safety objective was to determine and compare the local a and tolerability profiles of si ain insight into the a second dose of PecFent for pain relief. Eight doses of 100 μ g of PecFent were administered to the same nostril to determine what happens if the contents of one device (8 x 100 μ l) is taken at once. The PK data obtained following a single dose of 100 μ g of PecFent were used as reference. Subjects received two doses of 100 μ g of PecFent 1, 2 or 4 h apart in order to g length of time a patient should wait before taking

The proposed PecFent labelling specifies that PecFent is to be used for treatment of BTP episodes with an interval of at least 4 hours in-between. The design of study CP047/07 (two sprays of FCNS 1, 2 and 4  hours  apart)  is  suitable  to  provide  data  on  possible  dose  accumulation  and  thus  to  justify  the proposed dosing recommendation.

The  intranasal  fentanyl  doses  were  administered  in  an  ascending  total  dose  manner  as  a  safety precaution. Each treatment was administered under a naltrexone block to prevent the development of the unwanted effects of opiate administration in naïve subjects.

## Special populations

## · Impaired renal or hepatic function

No data are available on the use of nasal fentanyl in patients with severe hepatic or renal disease. After IV administration, the PK of fentanyl is unaffected in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis, whereas  high  dosages  result  in  a  markedly  prolonged  elimination  half-life  (Scholz  et  al.  1996).  As fentanyl is metabolised to inactive metabolites in the liver, patients with severe hepatic disease may have a decreased metabolism and should therefore be observed carefully. Approximately 75-80% of a fentanyl dose is excreted into the urine, mostly as metabolites with less than 6% as unchanged drug (McClain  &amp;  Hug  1980).  Thus,  patients  with  renal  impairment  might  have  a  delayed  elimination. However,  renal  insufficiency  does  not  appear  to  alter  PK  properties  significant  after  fentanyl  bolus administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The lack of specific data on the influence of hepatic and renal impairment on the p Instanyl  has  been  appropriately  addressed  in  the  product  particulars.

## · Elderly, Children

y (older than 65 No specific PK studies have been conducted on the use of PecFent in either the elderl years) or children and adolescents less than 18 years old.

Due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy, PecFent is not recommended for use in children and adolescents.

Differences in the PK profile as a function of age have been reported in the literature. In individuals aged &gt;60 years the apparent elimination half-life of nasal administered fentanyl may be significantly longer. In a study by Bentley et al (1982) higher serum concentrations of fentanyl in elderly patients than  in  younger  adult  patients  (&lt;  50  years)  were  seen,  despite  equivalent  dosing.  The  prolonged fentanyl elimination in elderly patients results mainly from reduced drug clearance. In a postoperative study of five younger (age 30-65 years) and 6 elderly (age 78-88 years) the elimination half-life of fentanyl was 23 hours longer in the elderly compared to the younger patients (Esteve et al. 1991). These data suggest that a given dose of fentanyl will last longer in elderly patients than in younger

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adult  patients.  Hence,  elderly  patients  should  be  observed  carefully  for  sig ns  of  fentanyl  toxicity.

The Applicant was requested to pool data from the pivotal trials by age, and examine whether any trends (successful dose, PK etc) were discernible for elderly patients.

Eligible patients were experiencing, on average, but not necessarily every day, 1 to 4 episodes of BTCP (Breakthrough Cancer Pain) per day that were adequately controlled with a stable dose of standard rescue medication, typically a fast-acting opioid, of which the patient was to have an adequate supply throughout the study. Breakthrough pain was defined as a transitory flare of moderate to severe pain (on  a  4-point  scale  from  0  to  3  [none,  mild,  moderate,  severe])  that  occurred  on  a  background  of persistent pain controlled to moderate intensity or less by the opioid regimen. If the patient had more than 1 type of breakthrough pain, or had breakthrough pain in more than 1 location, only 1 of the pains was identified as a 'target' breakthrough pain.

Patients who successfully completed the dose-titration phase were then to continue into a double-blind treatment phase, where up to 10 episodes of breakthrough pain were treated with the study drug.

Note: Pain Intensity Scores were recorded in an e-diary on a rating scale of 0 to 10, where 0 represented 'no pain' and 10 represented 'worst possible pain'. The Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method was used to input missing scores for evaluable episodes due to omission or use of rescue medication, prior to calculating the average value for each patient/treatment group. The higher the SPID score the better.

The CHMP, considering the results obtained with the (PID at different times, percentage of responders, need for rescue medication) co supported a statistical and clinical difference in favour of PecFent versus pl acebo treated episodes at the 5 minute time point (p=0.0298) and decreased over the subsequent time points (10 to 60 minutes) (p ≤ 0.0014). The mean PI score for PecFent treated episodes was statistically different from that of pl

The mean PID was statistically significantly greater for PecFent treated episodes than for the placebo treated episodes at each time point from 10 to 60 minutes post dose.

Similar  results  were  observed  for  PR  and  TOTPAR.  The  overall  mean  patient-averaged  acceptability assessment  score  was  significantly  greater  for  PecFent  as  compared  with  placebo  at  30  minutes postdose (2.63 vs. 2.01, p&lt;0.0001) and at 60 minutes postdose (2.73 vs. 2.02, p&lt;0.0001).

ecFent used rescue scue medication by episodes, no difference was found during the first 30 minutes between PecFent and placebo. This could be  explained  by  the  fact  that  more  episodes  were  treated  with  PecFent  than  with  placebo  for  each patient (7 compared to 3). After 30 minutes, the use of rescue medication is statistically significantly higher for patients with placebo than with PecFent. Even if rescue medication was not allowed before 30 minutes, more patients with P medication during the first 30 minutes than placebo patients. When evaluating re

## Efficacy conclusion

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  this  study  was  the  SPID  from  5  to  30  minutes  post-dose.  BTCP episodes treated with PecFent showed a mean SPID score that was significantly higher than that for episodes treated with placebo (6.57 vs. 4.45, respectively, p&lt;0.0001).

The  mean  PI  score  was  significantly  lower  following  PecFent  treatment  than  following  placebo treatment at each observed time-point from 5 to 60 minutes post-dose, indicating that the onset of

## Study CP045/06

This study was initially submitted as an interim report. The final report was submitted with the answers to Day 120 List of Questions.

## Methods

## Study Participants

ability  of  Nasalfent ncer pain (BTCP) in Study CP045/06 was an open-label study investigating long-term safety and toler (Fentanyl Citrate Nasal Spray, now: PecFent) in the treatment of breakthrough ca patients taking regular opioid therapy.

Patients with cancer who experienced on average one to four episodes of BTCP over 2 weeks, but not while taking at least 60 mg per day of oral morphine (or equivalent opioid) for their underlying cancer pain were eligible to enrol into the study. Only results from the planned Interim enrolment  of  132 in  the  study.  Patients  were  newly  enrolled  (N  =  73)  or  were  enrolled  after  successfully necessarily every day, Analysis  are  presented  in  this  report.  The  Interim  Analysis  was  performed  upon patients completing studies CP043/06 or CP044/06 (N = 59).

## Treatments

The  open-dose  titration  phase  for  newly  enrolled  patients  was  identical  to  that  described  in  study CP043/06.

he dose of PecFent target  BTCP  were same dose without effective doses s 14 days. The objective of the titration phase of the study was to titrate for each patient t needed  to  treat  breakthrough  pain  episodes  until  2  consecutive  episodes  of successfully treated (defined as acceptable pain relief within 30 minutes) with the unacceptable AEs. Study site personnel assisted patients in determining their individual using daily telephone contact.

Patients were instructed to self-administer the effect nasal spray established during the open, dose-titration phase. Fentanyl nasal spray treat  a  maximum of 4 episodes of BTCP per day. At least four hours between e BTCP  occurred  before  the  next  dose  of  fentanyl  nasal  spray  was  permitted  (i.e patients were allowed to take their usual BTCP analgesia as rescue medication (at also to elapse between the use of rescue medication and the next dose of fentanyl n

re  similar  to  study Collection  of  data  for  each  episode  and  the  recording  of  data  in  the  e-diary  we CP043/06.

For the first 4 weeks, telephone visits were scheduled weekly to review safety and adjust dose levels, if needed. Clinic visits were to subsequently occur at weeks 4, 8, and 12 to assess safety and tolerance, to review e-diary data, and to collect old medication and dispense new study medication. Extra clinic visits occurred where necessary to dispense additional study drug, according to the patient's needs.

In order to provide patients who were gaining clinical benefit from the use of PecFent with access to the  treatment  following  their  participation  in  the  main  study,  they  were  allowed  to  enter  the CP045/06/FCNS extension period, at their discretion and that of their physician. Following completion of the End-of-Treatment Phase of the Main Study, patients were provided with further supplies of trial medication for as long as necessary, according to their clinical need, up until the time that PecFent becomes commercially available in their country. No e-diary (efficacy) data were collected during the extension period, only safety and drug accountability data.

## Participant flow

In the initially submitted interim report, a total of 132 patients were included in the ITT Population; 73 (55.3%) were newly enrolled and 59 (44.7%) were rolled over from study CP043/06/FCNS. No patient was included from study CP044/06/FCNS because very limited amounts of data were available from this study. Furthermore, as this study had yet to be un-blinded, no causality assessment of AEs was possible, so the data were not included in the interim analysis.

In the final report, 351 patients were screened for the entry into the study, of which 64 patients failed screening. Subsequently, 287 patients entered the Open, Dose-Titration Phase. Of these, 51 patients withdrew (including 6 patients who did not take any doses of Nasalfent). A total of 236 patients of the 287  were  successfully  titrated  (82.2%).

For speed of relief, patients reported being 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' following the use of Nasalfent spray for the treatment of 15550 (64.8%) and 6072 (25.3%) BTCP episodes, respectively.

Usage of rescue medication during dose titration is an expected phenomenon in case the tested dose proves  to  be  insufficient.  In  only  about  6%  of  episodes  rescue  medication  was  used  during  the treatment period. This figure points to good efficacy and acceptability of the individual FCNS dose on the one side, and considerable stability of this dose over time on the other side.

The  portions  of  patients  requiring  rescue  medication  within  60  min  post-dose  were  evenly  spread across the entire dose range of 100 to 800 µg, which is indicative of the appropriateness of the dose range tested in this patient population.

Due to high vasculature of the nasal mucosa fentanyl is expected to be absorbed fast onset of action when applied as nasal spray. Therefore, the choice of SPID30 endpoint is considered to be rather cautious or conservative. With regard to earlier t assessment as secondary endpoints, however, study CP043/06 demonstrated signif of PI and PR at all time points from 10 minutes after dosing (and for some endpoints,

During the initial dose escalation period of study CP043/06 patients were titrated to their individual successful dose. The successful dose was reached when the patient achieved adequate pain relief over two consecutive episodes with the same dose and without experiencing undue adverse events. The protocol  of  the  titration  procedure  was  straightforward  and  delivered  unambiguous  information  on adequacy of the chosen dose. Patients did not have the option of a 'second puff' of PecFent. Pain relief was subjectively assessed by the patient after 30 min. In case of insufficient pain relief the patient was free to use his usual rescue medication and the patient used a higher dose for the next episode. A dose range of 100 to 800 µg per single dose was tested in phase III. In study CP043/06, 72.85% of patients were able to find their successful dose during titration (6.1% withdrawn due to lack of efficacy, 5.3%

## Patient exposure

Safety information has been collected from eight studies, four Phase I studies and four Phase II/III studies. Of these, three Phase III studies (CP043/06, CP044/06 and CP45/06) have been performed with the multi-dose device that is proposed for marketing: CP043 and an interim report for CP045/06 were submitted with the original MAA; CP044 and the final report for CP045 were submitted with the response to the list of questions (LOQ) at Day 120 and considerably increased the size of the Phase III database (506 patients were included in the integrated Phase II/III safety population compared to 209 submitted with the original application)

All  patients  treated  with  fentanyl  nasal  spray  in  the  Phase  III  studies  were  administered  one  of  the following  doses:  100mc  g,  200mcg,  400mcg,  or  800mcg  fentanyl.

Of the 523 subjects in the safety population, 7 subjects from CP041 did not receive 1 of the 4 doses of FNS that comprise the basis of this summary of safety. Thus, for displays that present data by dose, 516 subjects comprise the safety population.

During the Phase I studies, 62.0% of the subjects experienced one or more adverse events that were assessed  by  the  investigator  as  treatment-related.    The  most  frequently  reported  treatment-related adverse events were rhinitis, headache, rhinorrhoea, and nausea. The majority of treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate in intensity. Severe adverse events included one event each of vomiting, rhinitis, balance disorder, headache, and rhinorrhoea.

Fentanyl nasal spray should be administered with caution to patients with moderate or severe hepatic or renal impairment.

The influence of hepatic and renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of the medicinal product has not  been  evaluated,  however,  when  administered  intravenously  the  clearance  of  fentanyl  has  been shown to  be  altered  in  hepatic  and  renal  impairment  due  to  alterations  in  metabolic  clearance  and plasma proteins. After administration of fentanyl nasal spray, impaired hepatic and renal function may both increase the bioavailability of fentanyl and decrease its systemic clearance, which could lead to increased and prolonged opioid effects.

Therefore, special care should be taken during the titration process in patients with moderate or severe hepatic or renal impairment. (SmPC Effentora, 2008).

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

The  risk  profile  of  nasally  applied  fentanyl  in  elderly,  hepatic  or  renal  impairment  is  considered  to correspond  to  the  risk  profile  of  intravenously  applied  fentanyl.  The  respective  warning  notes  and dosing recommendations in the proposed SmPC are in line with those approved for Effentora. However, the CHMP decided that the PSUR cycle will be independent from the one of the reference products, to allow identification of any issues related to the new formulation and novel mode of administration.

## Benefits

- Beneficial effects

There  is  a  recognised  clinical  need  for  analgesics  with  rapid  onset  of  action  in  cancer  patients  with breakthrough pain. Due to its pharmacokinetic profile the fentanyl-containing PecFent nasal spray is suitable to meet this clinical need. Efficacy of PecFent in the proposed dose ranging from 100 to 800 mcg per administration has been shown in adequately designed, placebo- and active- controlled phase III studies.

Efficacy of the PecFent formulation was mainly demonstrated by the phase II dose-finding, proof-ofprinciple  study  CP041/04,  the  pivotal  phase  III  trial  CP043/06  and  the  supportive  phase  III  trial

An aspect of product safety arising from inclusion of pectin, is the possible implication of intravenous misuse of the intranasal solution. The gel is formed when the solution interacts with calcium ions. On the one side, pectin inclusion may be regarded as an additional deterrent against intravenous misuse. Section 4.4 of the SmPC alerts against intravenous misuse of the PecFent solution.

## 2.9. Recommendation

ered by consensus Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP consid that the risk-benefit balance of PecFent in the management of:

opioid  therapy  for that  occurs  on  a Patients  receiving  maintenance  opioid  therapy  are  those  who  are  taking  at  least  60 mg  of  oral t  least  30 mg  of oxycodone daily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another breakthrough  pain  (BTP)  in  adults  who  are  already  receiving  maintenance chronic  cancer  pain.  Breakthrough  pain  is  a  transitory  exacerbation  of  pain background of otherwise controlled persistent pain.

opioid for a week or longer. morphine  daily,  at  least  25 micrograms  of  transdermal  fentanyl  per  hour,  a was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
