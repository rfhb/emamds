* HRV PCV-free: No detection of PCV-1 and PCV-2 according to the limit of detection of the tests used.

## Assessor comments

Two formulations of the Rotarix vaccine (liquid PCV-free and lyophilized) are administered in this study.

The HRV liquid formulation is administered as a 1.5 ml oral dose while the HRV lyophilized formulation is administered as a 1 ml oral dose. For each formulation, two doses of the vaccine were given.

In EU, both a liquid and lyophilized formulation of the Rotarix vaccine are approved for use in infants from 6 to 24 weeks to protect against gastroenteritis  (diarrhoea  and  vomiting)  caused  by  rotavirus

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

infections. However, the HRV liquid formulation used in the ROTA-096 study is PCV free (no detection of PCV-1 and PCV-2 according to the limit of detection of the test used).

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- study ROTA-096 entitled ' A phase III, observer -blind, randomized, multi-country study to assess the reactogenicity and safety of the Porcine circovirus (PCV) free liquid formulation of GSK's oral live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine as compared to the lyophilized formulation of the GSK's HRV vaccine, when administered as a 2 -dose vaccination in infants starting at age 6-12 weeks.'

Rotarix  is  a  live  attenuated  HRV  vaccine  (strain  G1P[8],  RIX4414)  for  oral  administration  that  is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA (referred to as GSK). Two pharmaceutical forms of Rotarix are available: the lyophilized formulation to be reconstituted with a liquid diluent and the liquid formulation  ready  to  use.  The  active  ingredient  (rotavirus  strain  RIX4414)  is  the  same  for  both formulations;  only  the  excipients  differ,  which  is  linked  to  manufacturing  and  vaccine  stability constraints. The lyophilized formulation was approved in the European Union (EU) via the centralized procedure  on  21  February  2006  and  the  liquid  formulation  was  approved  as  a  line  extension  on  1 September 2008. the Rotarix liquid formulation is prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO). The current indication in the EU summary of product characteristics (SmPC) is active immunization of infants aged 6 to 24 weeks for prevention of gastroenteritis due to rotavirus infection.

The ROTA-096 study report is being submitted to comply with the requirements of Article 46 of the pediatric regulation 1901/2006.

Study ROTA-096 has not been conducted in accordance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan.

On 15-16 March 2010, GSK informed the Health Authorities worldwide (including the European Medicines Agency [EMA], WHO, and the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) of the unexpected presence of a non-pathogenic viral strain of porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV-1) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in its Rotarix vaccine. Further investigations confirmed the presence of PCV-1 DNA fragments in Rotarix and in its starting materials as well as low levels of PCV-1 viral particles during the production process and in the final container.

EMA initiated an Art 20 procedure (EMEA/H/C/639/A-20/0024) and concluded that:

1. The benefit outweighed the risk in the authorized therapeutic indication of Rotarix,
2. A PCV-1 free vaccine should be developed, and
3. The marketing authorisation for Rotarix should contain information regarding the development of  a  PCV-1  free  vaccine  and  therefore  recommended  the  amendment  of  Annex  II  of  the  EU Product Information (European Public Assessment Report available at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/variation-report/rotarix-h-c-639-a20-0024-eparassessment-report-article-20\\_en.pdf, document dated 30 September 2010, last accessed 6 May 2021).

GSK conducted a clinical study to evaluate the reactogenicity and safety of a PCV-free HRV liquid vaccine.

## Assessor comments

This trial has two primary safety objectives. There are no immunogenicity or efficacy objectives in this trial.

The first primary objective is to assess solicited AEs during the 8-day (Day 1 -Day 8) follow-up period after dose 1 and dose 2 of the HRV liquid PCV free and HRV lyophilized vaccines.

The second primary objective is to assess unsolicited AEs during the 31-day (Day 1 -Day 31) follow-up period after each vaccination and SAEs during the entire study period, meaning up to 6 months after the last dose.

The follow up period for solicited/unsolicited AEs and SAEs are in line with previous HRV vaccine trials. Overall, the objectives and endpoints are considered appropriate.

The HRV lyophilized vaccine is used as a control in this study because the liquid formulation is not licensed in the US. Therefore, the company used the lyophilized vaccine as a control in all phase III studies as part of the PCV-free development program. This is considered acceptable as a comparable safety profile of both formulations was shown in clinical trials with approximately 1900 infants.

## 2.3.2.2.2. Study design

Two oral doses of the study vaccines were administered at 1-month or 2-months interval to subjects, according to the immunization schedule for RV vaccine administration in participating countries.

Due to the difference in the appearance and volume between lyophilized HRV vaccine and PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine, the study was observer-blinded.

The total duration of the study, per subject, was approximately 7-8 months including the 6 months of extended safety follow-up (ESFU) period after the last dose of HRV vaccine.

## Assessor comments

The study ROTA-096 is a Phase III, observer-blind, randomized (1:1), controlled, multi-country study with 2 parallel groups: HRV liquid PCV-free and HRV lyophilized.

The study is observer-blind because double blinding was not possible due to a difference in appearance and volume of the HRV liquid (1.5 ml, clear and colourless liquid) and HRV lyophilized (1.0 ml, turbid liquid after reconstitution) formulation. This approach is acceptable.

Each subject received 2 doses of the vaccine with an interval of 1 to 2 months. The first dose was administered at an age between 6 and 12 weeks. Although Rotarix is indicated for immunization of infants from 6 to 24 weeks, a lower age limit is preferred as it is known that the first infection with a rotavirus is more severe than the subsequent infections  which  can be either  mild or asymptomatic. Therefore, it is most  important  to  prevent  the  first  rotavirus  infection in  infants.

## Assessor Comments

The study targets to enrol 1350 subjects, 675 subjects per group.

The main criteria for inclusion are male or female infants of 6 to 12 weeks of age at the time of first vaccination.

Criteria  for  exclusion  from  participation  in  the  trial  are  several  medical  conditions  related  to immunological conditions or intussusception, which is a known risk associated with rotavirus vaccination. In addition, prematurely born infants ( born =&lt;28 weeks of gestation) could not participate. No weight limit was applied to qualify for participation.

Concomitant use of another vaccine was not allowed from 30 days before until 30 days after study vaccination.  However,  an  exception  are  inactivation  influenza  vaccine  and  other  licensed  routine childhood vaccines, which can all be administered without restriction. Clinical studies have shown that the immune response and the safety profiles of routine childhood vaccines are unaffected when given concomitantly with Rotarix. Only concomitant administration of an oral polio vaccine may slightly reduce the immune response of Rotarix. Clinical protection against severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis was shown to be maintained in a clinical trial involving more than 4,200 subjects who received Rotarix concomitantly with OPV.

## 2.3.2.2.4. Treatments

The doses used in this study were based on previous preclinical and clinical studies that demonstrated acceptable toxicological, safety and immunogenicity profiles.

## Analysis of Demographics and baseline characteristics

The median, mean, range and standard deviation of age (in weeks) at each study vaccine dose and of the gestational age at birth was computed by study group. The median, mean and standard deviation of length  (in  centimetres)  and  weight  (in  kilograms)  at  Visit  1  will  be  computed  by  study  group.  The distribution of racial and sex composition of the study population will be presented.

## Analysis of safety and reactogenicity

The primary safety analysis will be performed on the Exposed set.

The percentage of doses and of subjects reporting at least 1 AE (solicited or unsolicited) during the 8 day (Day 1-Day 8) solicited follow-up period post-vaccination was computed, along with exact 95% CI. The same calculations were done for AEs (solicited or unsolicited) rated as grade 3 in intensity, those assessed as causally related to vaccination, those rated as grade 3 in intensity with causal relationship to vaccination and those that resulted in a medically attended visit.

The percentage of doses and of subjects reporting each individual solicited general AE was computed, over the 8-day (Day 1-Day 8) solicited follow-up period post- vaccination, along with exact 95% CI. The same calculations were done for each individual general solicited AE rated as grade 3 in intensity, those assessed as causally related to vaccination, those rated as grade 3 in intensity with causal relationship to vaccination and those that resulted in a medically attended visit. For fever, additional analyses will be performed by 0.5°C increments. These calculations were also performed by country, sex and frequent race.

The verbatim reports of unsolicited AEs were reviewed by a physician and the signs and symptoms were coded according to MedDRA. Every verbatim term were matched with the appropriate preferred term. The percentage of subjects with unsolicited AEs occurring within 31-day (Day 1-Day 31) follow-up period after any dose with its exact 95% CI were tabulated by group, and by preferred term. Similar tabulation was done for unsolicited AEs rated as grade 3, for unsolicited AEs with causal relationship to vaccination, for unsolicited AEs rated as grade 3 with causal relationship to vaccination and those that resulted in a medically attended visit. These calculations were also performed by country.

For each study group, the percentage of subjects who started taking at least 1 concomitant medication, antipyretic medication and prophylactic antipyretic medication during the 8-day (Day 1 Day 8) and 31day (Day 1-Day 31) follow-up periods post-vaccination was tabulated by dose, by subject for each dose and across the 2 doses.

Subjects who experienced at least 1 SAE during the entire study period (from Dose 1 till ESFU contact at Month 7-8) were summarised by study group and all SAEs were tabulated.

## Assessor Comments

The exposed set (ES) consist of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of a study vaccine. All safety analyses are based on the exposed set.

The proposed analysis methods for reactogenicity and safety are considered appropriate.

## 2.3.2.3. Results

## 2.3.2.3.1. Recruitment/ Number analysed

The study enrolled 1351 subjects, all of which were vaccinated and included in the exposed set (ES), and of which 1310 subjects completed the study (Table 2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

None of the withdrawals was due to COVID-19.

One subject in the HRV Liq group was withdrawn due to an unsolicited non-serious AE (Hematochezia) assessed by the investigator as related to study vaccine.

## Assessor Comments

In total 1351 subjects were enrolled in the study, 677 in the HRV liquid PCV-free group and 674 in the HRV lyophilized group, which approximately meets the enrolment target of 675 subjects per group. All subjects enrolled in the trial were vaccinated and included in the ES. The study was completed by the majority of the subjects enrolled (653 subjects in the HRV Liquid group and 657 subjects in the HRV Lyophilized group). One subject in the HRV liquid group was withdrawn due to a non-serious adverse event of Hematochezia which the investigator considered related to the vaccine (further discussed in Section  2.3.2.3.4.  Safety  results -unsolicited  adverse  events).  The  most  common  reason  for  not completing the study was due to consent withdrawal, not due to an AE (N=25 subjects) and lost to follow-up (N=10 subjects).

## 2.3.2.3.2. Baseline data

The mean age of subjects was 9.0 ± 1.5 weeks at Dose 1 of HRV vaccine; 51.3% of the subjects were female. White (50.7%) was the predominant race followed by Asian (44.6%) (Table 3).

Among all subjects of the exposed set (ES), 26.9% were enrolled in Hong Kong, 20.4% in Turkey, 19.1% in the US, 17.7% in Canada and 15.9% in Taiwan.

The demographic characteristics were comparable across the groups in each country.

## Assessor Comments

Overall, the baseline characteristics are well balanced between both groups.

The mean and median age at dose 1 of the HRV vaccine was 9.0 weeks in both groups. The youngest participant was 5 weeks old in the HRV lyophilized group and 6 weeks in the HRV liquid group. In both groups the maximum age was 13 weeks at the first dose. The median age at the second dose was 17.0 weeks in both groups, ranging from 10 to 23 weeks in the HRV liquid group and from 10 to 29 weeks in the HRV lyophilized group. As Rotarix was administered at young age, it is expected that most subjects have not been infected yet with rotavirus before. The majority of the subjects in the ROTA-096 study received Rotarix according to the EU label, meaning at an age of 6 to 24 weeks old.

The median gestational age of participants in the trial was 39 weeks, with a minimum of 30 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall the number of females and males is well balanced (693 vs. 658, respectively). While in the HRV liquid group the gender distribution is almost equal (49.6% females and 50.4% males), there are slightly more females in the HRV lyophilized group compared to males (53.0% vs. 47.0%, respectively).

The majority of the subjects originate from Hong Kong (26.9%), followed by Turkey (20.4%), United States (19.1%), Canada (17.7%) and Taiwan (15.9%). The race of most participants was White (50.7%) or Asian (44.6%) and similar in both groups.

Co-administration (= on the same day) or concomitant administration (=on any other day in the trial) of routine childhood vaccines was allowed in the ROTA-096 trial and not expected to impact the safety data. In total, co-administration occurred in 43.7% of subjects at Dose 1 and 43.0% of subjects at Dose 2. Most frequently co-administered vaccines were Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine (43.1% with Dose 1, 39.3% with Dose 2), Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (40.6% with Dose 1, 42.4% with Dose 2), diphtheriatetanus-pertussis  vaccine  (40.5%  with  Dose  1,  42.3%  with  Dose  2)  and  inactivated  poliovirus  vaccine (40.5% with Dose 1 and 42.3% with Dose 2). A concomitant vaccine was administered to 39.2% of the subjects between Dose 1 and 2 and to 50.8% of the subjects between Dose 2 and the visit at Month 2-4.

## Assessor Comments

The analysis of safety was performed on the exposed set (ES), comprising 1351 subjects of which 677 received at least 1 dose of the HRV liquid vaccine and 674 received at least 1 dose of the HRV lyophilized vaccine. The second dose was administered to 663 and 657 subjects, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The number of subjects who reported at least one solicited or unsolicited AEs during the 8-day period following vaccination (overall/subject) was similar for the HRV Liq group (85.2%) compared to the HRV Lyo group (82.5%).

## Assessor Comments

Solicited AEs collected during the 8-day post-vaccination period are Cough/Runny nose; Diarrhea; Fever; Irritability/Fussiness; Loss of appetite and Vomiting.

Similar percentages of subjects reported solicited AEs after administration of the HRV Liquid PCV-free or HRV  Lyophilized  formulation (overall/subject). The  most  frequently reported solicited AEs  are irritability/Fussiness (74.9% and 72.1%, respectively in the HRV Liquid and HRV Lyophilized group), followed by Loss of appetite (42.8% vs. 38.4%, respectively), cough/Runny nose (35.0% vs. 34.9%, respectively), vomiting (22.3% vs. 24.0%) and Diarrhea (8.6% vs. 10.5%). Fever was only solicited AE reported by less than 10% of the subject and was mainly mild.

The  frequency  of  solicited  AEs  reported  after  the  first  and  second  dose  is  similar.  Only  for Irritability/Fussiness, the frequency is slightly lower after the second dose in both the HRV Liquid PCVfree (Dose 1: 63.7% (95% CI: 59.9-67.3) vs. Dose 2: 55.5% (95% CI: 51.6-59.3)) and HRV Lyophilized group (Dose 1: 63.5% (95% CI: 59.7-67.1) vs. Dose 2: 55.1% (95% CI: 51.2-58.9)).

The most commonly reported Grade 3 solicited AEs were Irritability/Fussiness (9.7% vs. 7.1% in the HRV Liquid and HRV lyophilized group, respectively) and Vomiting (6.1% vs. 5.8%, respectively). For all other solicited AEs, Grade 3 events were reported for less than 1.5% of the subjects. No significant differences in frequency of Grade 3 events are observed between both groups, or between first and second dose.

Clinical investigators considered approximately 70% of all events of Diarrhea, Irritability/Fussiness, Loss of Appetite and Vomiting related to the study vaccine. Relatedness was a bit lower for Cough/Runny

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Nose (approximately 40%) and none of the fever episodes were considered related. Overall, relatedness was well balanced between the HRV liquid and HRV lyophilized group and after the first and second dose.

Medically attended solicited AEs were reported for ≤ 1% of the subjects, except for Cough/Runny nose (3.0% vs. 2.7% in the HRV Liquid and HRV Lyophilized group, respectively) and Vomiting in the HRV Liquid group (1.3%).

In  the  current  SmPC,  only  diarrhea  and  irritability  are  considered  common  AEs  possibly  related  to vaccination. The severity of all solicited AEs was not found to be significantly different in the group receiving Rotarix compared to placebo, in 3 placebo-controlled trials. In addition, there was also no difference in incidence or severity after the first or second dose.

To  conclude,  no  meaningful  differences  are  observed  in  the  frequency  of  solicited  adverse  events between the HRV Liquid and HRV Lyophilized group.

## Assessor Comments

During  the  31-day  post-vaccination  period,  unsolicited  AEs  were  reported  by  29.7%  and  30.6%  of subjects in the HRV Liquid group and HRV Lyophilized group, respectively.

Unsolicited AEs considered causally related to vaccination by the investigator were reported in 2.5% and 4.5% of subjects in the HRV Liquid group and HRV Lyophilized group, respectively. Most frequently reported was constipation in the HRV Liquid group (4 subjects, vs. 0 subjects in HRV Lyophilized) and somnolence in the HRV Lyophilized group (5 subjects, vs. 1 subject in HRV Liquid). The incidence rates of constipation and somnolence observed in Rota-096 are line with the observations in two other studies where subjects were vaccinated with HRV Liquid  and HRV Lyophilized  (Rota-081 and Rota-090). In addition, it is acknowledged that sleep disorders and constipation are common and not unexpected in infants (Rajindrajith S et al.;  Mindell JA et al.). In the HRV Liquid group, one subject was diagnosed with Hematochezia. This non-serious adverse event was assessed as related to the study vaccine by the clinical investigator . The subject's parents/legally acceptable representatives decided to withdraw the subject  from  the  study.  Hematochezia  is  a  known  adverse  reaction  with  unknown  frequency  after vaccination with Rotarix. However, the information provided for this AE is limited.

At least one Grade 3 unsolicited AE was reported by 1.2% (8 subjects) and 1.6% (11 subjects) of the subjects in both groups respectively. Each individual Medra PT was reported by only 2 subjects or less in each group.

Grade 3 unsolicited AEs considered as causally related were reported for 2 subjects in the HRV Liquid group (including Abdominal Pain; Ill-defined disorder) and by 3 subjects in the HRV Lyophilized group (including abdominal discomfort; Bronchiolitis; Somnolence). Of note: intussusception is a known very rare adverse reaction associated with rotavirus vaccine.

Medical attention following an unsolicited AE was needed for 16.1% of the subjects in the HRV Liquid group and for 20.3% of the subjects in the HRV Lyophilized group. Upper respiratory tract infection was the most commonly reported unsolicited AE requiring medical attention in both groups (3.0% and 4.7% of the subjects in HRV Liq and HRV Lyo groups, respectively). These frequencies are overall in line with the  observations  in  the  Rota-081  study  (6.5%  and  6.2%  in  HRV  Liquid  vs  HRV  Lyophilized  group, respectively) and Rota-090 study (9.0% and 9.5% in HRV Liquid vs HRV Lyophilized group, respectively). Although it is known that upper respiratory tract infections are common in young children (Cinaroglu, S ; Weintraub B.), there is no data on the incidence of medically attended upper respiratory tract infection in the general population to compare with.

No meaningful differences were observed between countries in the frequency and type of unsolicited AEs.

It is unclear which adverse events occurred after the first or the second dose of the HRV vaccine as this is not discussed in the CSR.

Overall, unsolicited AEs, including Grade 3, medically attended and causally related AEs, are comparable after administration of the HRV Liquid or HRV Lyophilized formulation.

## Deaths and Serious Adverse Events

There was no death reported in this study.

SAEs were collected during the entire study period.

- A total of 62 SAEs were reported in 39 subjects in the HRV Liq group (5.8% of subjects) and 59 SAEs were reported in 38 subjects in the HRV Lyo group (5.6% of subjects) (Table 8).
- In the HRV Liq group, 1 SAE (constipation) reported in 1 subject was assessed by the investigator as possibly causally related to the study vaccine.
-  One subject developed constipation on Day 7 of the first dose of the HRV liquid vaccine administration. The event was reported as resolved within 14 days from the onset day.
- None of the SAEs in the HRV Lyo group were assessed by the investigator as related to the study vaccine (Table 8).

## Assessor Comments

At least one SAE was reported by 39 subjects (62 events) in the HRV Liquid group and by 38 subjects (59 events) in the HRV Lyophilized group. All subjects with an SAE were hospitalized, except for one subject with Exanthema Subitum.

The most frequently reported SAEs were upper respiratory tract infection (5 vs. 6 events in the HRV Liquid and HRV Lyophilized group, respectively), Urinary tract infection (6 vs. 4, respectively), Eczema (6 vs. 2, respectively), Respiratory Syncytial Virus bronchiolitis (5 vs. 2, respectively) and gastroenteritis (2 vs. 5, respectively).

One SAE of constipation was considered as possibly related to the vaccine in the HRV Liquid group. A 8weeks old male infant developed mild constipation 6 days after the first vaccination and was hospitalized due to no bowel output for 4 days and reduced oral intake. An abdominal X-ray was performed 3 days after  onset  and  revealed  no  dilated  bowels.  The  event  resolved  after  14  days.  The  subject  had  no symptoms after the second dose of the vaccine.

None of the SAEs in the HRV Lyophilized group were considered related to the study vaccine by the clinical investigator.

Intussusception, a known very rare adverse reaction associated with rotavirus vaccines was not reported in this trial.

The majority of the SAEs were mild or moderate in intensity and 14 SAEs were severe.

No deaths were reported in this trial.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

In  the  phase  III  randomized  Rotarix  trial  ROTA-096,  the  safety  profile  of  a  HRV  Liquid  PCV-free formulation was compared with the HRV Lyophilized formulation in 675 infants per group (target sample size) of 6-12 weeks old at time of first vaccination.

The study  was  performed  in Hong Kong, Turkey, United States, Canada and Taiwan. The race of most participants was White (50.7%) or Asian (44.6%) and baseline characteristics are well balanced between both groups.

The number of subjects who reported at least one solicited or unsolicited AEs during the 8-day period following vaccination (overall/subject) was similar for the HRV Liquid group (85.2%) compared to the HRV Lyophilized group (82.5%).

The most frequently reported solicited AEs during 8 days following vaccination are irritability/Fussiness (74.9% and 72.1%, respectively in the HRV liquid and HRV Lyophilized group), followed by Loss of appetite (42.8% vs. 38.4%, respectively), cough/Runny nose (35.0% vs. 34.9%, respectively). Grade 3 events were reported for approximately 5-10% of Irritability/Fussiness and Vomiting events, while for all other solicited AEs Grade 3 events were reported for less than 1.5% of the subjects. In the current SmPC, only diarrhea and irritability are considered common AEs possibly related to vaccination. The severity of the all solicited AEs was not found to be significantly different in the group receiving Rotarix compared to placebo, in 3 placebo-controlled trials.

During  the  31-day  post-vaccination  period,  unsolicited  AEs  were  reported  by  29.7%  and  30.6%  of subjects  in  the  HRV  Liquid  group  and  HRV  Lyophilized  group,  respectively.  Grade  3  unsolicited  AEs considered as causally related were reported for 2 subjects in the HRV Liquid group (including Abdominal Pain;  Ill-defined  disorder)  and  by  3  subjects  in  the  HRV  Lyophilized  group  (including  abdominal discomfort; Bronchiolitis; Somnolence).

In  total  121  SAEs  were  reported  by  77  subjects.  One  SAE  of  constipation,  starting  6  days  after vaccination, was considered as possibly related to the HRV Liquid vaccine. The SAE was resolved after 14 days. Intussusception, a known very rare adverse reaction associated with rotavirus vaccines was not reported in this trial.

No deaths were reported in the trial.

Overall, the reactogenicity and safety profile of the PCV-free liquid vaccine, was comparable to the HRV lyophilized vaccine  when administered as a 2-dose vaccination. No safety concerns were raised and the data are in line with the current version of the SmPC.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The  reactogenicity  and  safety  profile  of  the  HRV  Liquid  PCV-free  and  HRV  Lyophilized  formulation, administered in a 2-dose schedule, is comparable in infants of 6-12 weeks of age at the time of first vaccination. No additional safety concerns have been identified. No update of the SmPC is needed.

## 4. Additional clarification requested

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following question as part of this procedure:

- 1) The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs considered causally related to vaccination by the investigator  were  constipation  in  the  HRV  Liquid  group  (4  subjects,  vs.  0  subjects  in  HRV Lyophilized) and somnolence in the HRV Lyophilized group (5 subjects, vs. 1 subject in HRV

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Liquid).  Upper  respiratory  tract  infection  was  the  most  commonly  reported  unsolicited  AE requiring medical attention in both groups (3.0% and 4.7% of the subjects in HRV Liq and HRV Lyo groups, respectively). As these AEs are currently not listed as adverse reactions in the SmPC, the MAH is required to discuss their incidence in the light of the observation made during previous clinical studies.

The timetable is a 30 day response timetable without clock stop.

## MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

## Question 1

Studies Rota-081  and  Rota-090 were  selected  for  this  discussion  since these  studies compare HRV PCV free Liquid versus HRV Lyophilized formulations as does Rota-096. The age groups in the three studies are similar and the sample size of the analysis sets was comparable.

- Rota-081 : A phase IIIA, randomised, observer-blind, multi-centre study to evaluate the clinical consistency of 3 production lots of the PCV-free liquid formulation of GSK's oral  live  attenuated HRV  vaccine  and  to  evaluate  the  PCV-free  liquid formulation of GSK's HRV vaccine as compared  to  the  currently  licensed  lyophilised  formulation  of  the  HRV  vaccine  in  terms  of immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety when administered as a 2-dose vaccination in healthy infants starting at age 6-12 weeks.
- Rota-090 :  A  phase  IIIA,  randomised,  single-blind,  multi-centric  study  to  evaluate  the immunogenicity,  reactogenicity and  safety  of  3  doses  of  Pediarix,  Hiberix  and Prevenar 13 when  co-administered  with  2  doses  of  the  PCV-free  liquid  formulation  of GSK's    oral    live attenuated  HRV  vaccine  as  compared  to  the  currently  licensed lyophilised formulation of the HRV vaccine in healthy infants 6-12 weeks of age.

In the Rota-096 study, causally related adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) were collected up to 31 days following vaccination. In order to discuss the incidence of constipation and somnolence in the Rota-096 study, we used the tables presenting the percentage of subjects reporting unsolicited adverse events classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term with causal relationship to vaccination, during the 31 days following HRV vaccination.

In the Rota-096 study, medically attended AEFI were collected up to 31 days following vaccination. In order to discuss the incidence of upper respiratory tract infection in the Rota-096 study, we used the table presenting the percentage of subjects with unsolicited adverse events leading to medical attention classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term during the 31 days following HRV vaccination.

## Incidence of constipation and somnolence with causal relationship to vaccination in Rota-096 and other clinical studies:

A summary of the data from the different studies is presented in Table 9 and Table 10.

Given  the  low  number  of  reported  constipation cases  in  the  studies,  data  should  be interpreted with caution. Based on the data presented in Table 9 and Table 10 no trend of increased incidence of constipation or somnolence with causal relationship to vaccination was observed in Rota-096 compared to Rota-081 and Rota-090.

## Conclusion

Table 9, Table 10 and Table 11 show that the observed incidence of constipation and somnolence related to vaccination and upper respiratory tract infection requiring medical attention in Rota-096 study is in line with the incidence observed in studies Rota-081 and Rota-090.

Childhood constipation is a common problem worldwide. Constipation could be caused by underlying functional or organic causes. Because only a minority of patients suffering from constipation seek health care, it is difficult to capture the exact burden (Mugie SM et al). The prevalence of childhood constipation in the general population ranged from 0.7% to 29.6% in children from 0 to 18-year-old (Rajindrajith S et al.).

Sleep  disorders  are  common  problems  for  children  and  adolescents,  with  estimates indicating that approximately  20% to 25% of the paediatric  population  experience  some  type  of  sleep  disturbance (Mindell JA et al.). Sleep patterns develop rapidly during the first few years of life and this development is a highly dynamic process. At birth, infants lack an established circadian rhythm and hence sleep across multiple intervals throughout the day and night (Tham EK. et al.). Because of these sleep disorders, somnolence is not unexpected in the paediatric population.

Respiratory  tract  infections  (RTI)  are  a  major  public  health  issue  in  both  developed  and  developing countries (Ge X et al.). In Turkey, one of the countries in which study Rota-096  was  conducted,  upper respiratory tract  infections  (URIs) were  the  most  common diseases in children aged 0 -6 years with a prevalence of 41.9% (Cinaroglu, S). Children get two to eight URIs annually in the first 2 years after birth; those who attend day care may have as many as 14 annually (Weintraub B.). URIs are more common in children compared to adults because their immune systems are still developing. Functional immune immaturity, anatomical immaturity of respiratory system, seasonality and frequent contact with the family members are the main causes of URIs.

The observed incidence of constipation and somnolence related to vaccination and upper respiratory tract infection requiring medical attention in Rota-096 study is therefore in line with the prevalence in similar age group irrespective of Rotarix administration.

Based on the above information and evaluation,  no  concern  is  raised  regarding  incidence  of  AEs  of constipation  and  somnolence  related  to  vaccination  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  requiring medical attention in Rota-096 study.

## Assessor Comments

The MAH compared the incidence of constipation and somnolence with causal relationship to vaccination, and upper respiratory tract infection requiring medical attention in the Rota-096 study with the incidence

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in two other studies, Rota-081 and Rota-090. In all three studies, healthy infants of 6-12 weeks old received  a  2-dose  vaccination  with  the  PCV-free  liquid  formulation  or  the  lyophilised  HRV  vaccine formulation.

In  all  3  studies,  related  AEs  and  medically  attended  AEs  were  collected  up  to  31  days  following vaccination.

For constipation, overall the number of cases reported in all 3 studies was low. Although taking this into consideration, there was a small imbalance in number of subjects reporting this related AE between the HRV liquid group (4 subjects out of 677) and the HRV Lyophilized group (0 subjects out of 674) in the Rota-096  study.  There  was  no  indication  for  a  difference  between  the  HRV  liquid  group  and  HRV Lyophilized group in the Rota-081 (2 subjects out of 1198 and 2 subjects out of 402 reported related constipation in both groups, respectively) and Rota-090 study (0 subjects out of 632 and 2 subjects out of  640  reported  related  constipation  in  both  groups,  respectively).  The  MAH  refers  to  a  publication describing that childhood constipation in the general population ranges from 0.7% to 29.6% in children 0-18 yoa (Rajindrajith S et al.).

The incidence of somnolence in the study Rota-096 was higher in the HRV Lyophilized group (5 subjects out of 674) compared to the HRV liquid group (1 subject out of 677). This data is in line with the Rota081 (3 subjects out of 1198 and 0 subjects out of 402 reported related constipation in HRV Liquid vs HRV Lyophilized group, respectively) and Rota-090 study (5 subjects out of 632 and 4 subjects out of 640 reported related constipation in both groups, respectively), with the overall incidence being similar in  both  groups.  The  MAH  indicates  that  approximately  20%  to  25%  of  the  paediatric  population experience some type of sleep disturbance (Mindell JA et al.).

Although not possible to compare incidence rates of constipation and somnolence within 31 days after vaccination in the Rota-studies, with the incidences reported in referred publications, it is acknowledged that sleep disorders and constipation are common and not unexpected in infants. We agree that the incidences of constipation and somnolence observed in Rota-096 are line with the observations form Rota-081 and Rota-090.

In the Rota-096 study, upper respiratory tract infection was the most commonly reported unsolicited AE requiring  medical  attention  in  both  groups  (3.0%  and  4.7%  of  the  subjects  in  HRV  Liquid  and  HRV Lyophilized groups, respectively). However, the incidence was similar or even higher in the Rota-081 study (6.5% and 6.2% in HRV Liquid vs HRV Lyophilized group, respectively) and Rota-090 study (9.0% and 9.5% in HRV Liquid vs HRV Lyophilized group, respectively). The MAH indicates that the prevalence of upper respiratory tract infections in 0-6 yoa children in Turkey (were 20.4% of subjects in Rota-096 were enrolled) is 41.9% (Cinaroglu, S). In addition, Children get two to eight URIs annually in the first 2 years after birth; those who attend day care may have as many as 14 annually (Weintraub B.).

We acknowledge that upper respiratory tract infections are common in children, although the incidence of medically attended upper respiratory tract infection in the general population is unknown and the data of the Rota-studies cannot be compared with the incidences reported in the publications. The frequencies observed in Rota-096 are in line with the observations from Rota-081 and Rota-090.

Based  on  the  data  provided,  we  can  conclude  that,  in  Rota-096,  the  incidence  of  constipation  and somnolence related to vaccination, and upper respiratory tract infection requiring medical attention is in line with results from Rota-081 and Rota-090. Moreover, although the available data are very limited, the observed incidences do not seem to be higher than the expected incidences in similar age group irrespective of Rotarix administration.
