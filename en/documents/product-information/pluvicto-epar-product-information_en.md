## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Pluvicto 1 000 MBq/mL solution for injection/infusion

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

One mL of solution contains 1 000 MBq of lutetium ( 177 Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan at the date and time of calibration.

The total amount of radioactivity per single-dose vial is 7 400 MBq ± 10% at the date and time of administration. Given the fixed volumetric activity of 1 000 MBq/mL at the date and time of calibration, the volume of the solution in the vial can range from 7.5 mL to 12.5 mL in order to provide the required amount of radioactivity at the date and time of administration.

## Physical characteristics

Lutetium-177 decays to a stable hafnium-177 with a physical half-life of 6.647 days by emitting beta-minus radiation with a maximum energy of 0.498 MeV (79%) and photon radiation (γ) of 0.208 MeV (11%) and 0.113 MeV (6.4%).

## Excipient with known effect

Each mL of solution contains up to 0.312 mmol (7.1 mg) of sodium. Each vial contains up to 88.75 mg of sodium.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Solution for injection/infusion.

Clear, colourless to slightly yellow solution, pH: 4.5 to 7.0.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Pluvicto in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with or without androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been treated with AR pathway inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Important safety instructions

Pluvicto should be administered only by persons authorised to handle radiopharmaceuticals in designated clinical settings (see section 6.6) and after evaluation of the patient by a qualified physician.

Radiopharmaceuticals, including Pluvicto, should be used by or under the control of healthcare professionals who are qualified by specific training and experience in the safe use and handling of radiopharmaceuticals, and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate governmental agency authorised to license the use of radiopharmaceuticals.

## Patient identification

Patients should be identified for treatment by PSMA imaging.

## Posology

The recommended treatment regimen of Pluvicto is 7 400 MBq intravenously every 6 weeks (±1 week) for up to a total of 6 doses, unless there is disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Medical castration with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue should be continued during treatment in patients not surgically castrated.

## Treatment monitoring

Laboratory tests should be performed before and during treatment with Pluvicto. Dosing may need to be modified based on the test results (see Table 1).

- Haematology (haemoglobin, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, platelet count)
- Kidney function (serum creatinine, calculated creatinine clearance [CLcr])
- Liver function (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, blood serum albumin, total blood bilirubin)

## Dose modifications for adverse reactions

Recommended dose modifications of Pluvicto for adverse reactions are provided in Table 1. Management of severe or intolerable adverse reactions may require temporary dose interruption, dose reduction or permanent discontinuation of treatment with Pluvicto. If a treatment delay due to an adverse reaction persists for &gt;4 weeks, treatment with Pluvicto must be discontinued. The dose of Pluvicto may be reduced by 20% to 5 900 MBq once; the dose should not be re-escalated. If a patient has further adverse reactions that would require an additional dose reduction, treatment with Pluvicto must be discontinued.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is recommended in patients aged 65 years or older.

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment with baseline CLcr ≥50 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault. Treatment with Pluvicto is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment with baseline CLcr &lt;50 mL/min or end-stage renal disease as the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of Pluvicto have not been studied in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. Pluvicto has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of Pluvicto in the paediatric population in the indication of treatment of PSMA-expressing prostate cancer.

## Method of administration

Pluvicto is a ready-to-use solution for injection/infusion for single use only.

## Administration instructions

The recommended dose of Pluvicto may be administered intravenously as an injection using the syringe method, as an infusion using the gravity method, or as an infusion using the peristaltic pump method.

When using the gravity or peristaltic pump method, Pluvicto should be infused directly from its original container.

The syringe method or the peristaltic pump method should be used when administering a reduced dose of Pluvicto following a dose modification for an adverse reaction. When using the gravity method for a reduced dose, the Pluvicto dose should be adjusted before the administration to avoid the delivery of an incorrect volume of Pluvicto.

Prior to administration, the intravenous catheter used exclusively for Pluvicto administration should be flushed with ≥10 mL of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure patency and to minimise the risk of extravasation. Cases of extravasation should be managed as per institutional guidelines. Patients should be advised to remain well hydrated and to urinate frequently before and after administration of Pluvicto (see section 4.4).

For instructions on the method of preparation and intravenous methods of administration, see section 12.

For patient preparation, see section 4.4.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Individual benefit/risk justification

For each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity administered should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required therapeutic effect.

## Risk from radiation exposure

Pluvicto contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk for cancer.

Radiation exposure to patients, medical personnel, and others should be minimised during and after treatment with Pluvicto consistent with institutional good radiation safety practices, patient management procedures, and instructions to the patient for follow-up radiation protection at home.

## Patient preparation

Patients should be encouraged to increase oral fluids and urged to void as often as possible to reduce bladder radiation, especially after high activities, e.g. for radionuclide therapy.

## After the procedure

Before the patient is released, the nuclear medicine physician or healthcare professional should explain the necessary radioprotection precautions that the patient should follow to minimise radiation exposure to others.

After each administration of Pluvicto, the following general recommendations for patients can be considered along with national, local and institutional procedures and regulations.

- Limit close contact (less than 1 metre) with others for 2 days or with children and pregnant women for 7 days.
- Refrain from sexual activity for 7 days.
- Sleep in a separate room from others for 3 days, from children for 7 days, or from pregnant women for 15 days.

## Myelosuppression

In the VISION study, myelosuppression, including fatal cases, occurred more frequently in patients who received Pluvicto plus best standard of care (BSoC) compared to patients who received BSoC alone (see section 4.8).

Haematology laboratory tests, including haemoglobin, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count and platelet count, should be performed before and during treatment with Pluvicto. Pluvicto should be withheld, dose reduced or permanently discontinued and patients should be clinically managed as deemed appropriate based on the severity of myelosuppression (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal toxicity

In the VISION study, renal toxicity occurred more frequently in patients who received Pluvicto plus BSoC compared to patients who received BSoC alone (see section 4.8).

Before and after administration of Pluvicto, patients should be encouraged to increase oral fluids and urged to void as often as possible, especially after high activities, e.g. for radionuclide therapy. Kidney function laboratory tests, including serum creatinine and calculated CLcr, should be performed before and during treatment with Pluvicto. Pluvicto should be withheld, dose reduced or permanently discontinued based on the severity of renal toxicity (see section 4.2).

## Renal/Hepatic impairment

Careful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation exposure is possible.

Exposure (AUC) of lutetium ( 177 Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan is expected to increase with the degree of renal impairment (see section 5.2). Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment may be at greater risk of toxicity. Renal function and adverse reactions should be frequently monitored in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (see section 4.2). Treatment with Pluvicto is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment with baseline CLcr &lt;50 mL/min or end-stage renal disease.

## Fertility

Radiations of lutetium ( 177 Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan may potentially have toxic effects on male gonads and spermatogenesis. The recommended cumulative dose of 44 400 MBq of Pluvicto results in a radiation absorbed dose to the testes within the range where Pluvicto may cause infertility. Genetic consultation is recommended if the patient wishes to have children after treatment. Cryopreservation of sperm can be discussed as an option for male patients before treatment (see section 4.6).

## Contraception in males

Male patients are advised not to father a child and to use a condom for intercourse during treatment with Pluvicto and for 14 weeks after the last dose (see section 4.6).

## Specific warnings

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains up to 3.9 mmol (88.75 mg) sodium per vial, equivalent to 4.4% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

Precautions with respect to environmental hazard see section 6.6.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No clinical drug interaction studies were performed.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Contraception in males

Because of potential effects on spermatogenesis associated with radiations of lutetium ( 177 Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan, male patients are advised not to father a child and to use a condom for intercourse during treatment with Pluvicto and for 14 weeks after the last dose (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy

Pluvicto is not indicated for use in females. No animal studies using lutetium ( 177 Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan have been conducted to evaluate its effect on female reproduction and embryo-foetal development. However, all radioactive emissions, including those from Pluvicto, can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

## Breast-feeding

Pluvicto is not indicated for use in females. There are no data on the presence of lutetium ( 177 Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan in human milk or its effects on the breast-fed newborn/infant or on milk production.

## Fertility

No studies were conducted to determine the effects of lutetium ( 177 Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan on fertility. Radiations of lutetium ( 177 Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan may potentially have toxic effects on male gonads and spermatogenesis. The recommended cumulative dose of 44 400 MBq of Pluvicto results in a radiation absorbed dose to the testes within the range where Pluvicto may cause infertility. Genetic consultation is recommended if the patient wishes to have children after treatment. Cryopreservation of sperm can be discussed as an option for male patients before treatment (see section 4.4).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Pluvicto may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of safety profile

Unless otherwise stated, the frequency of listed adverse reactions is based on data from the VISION study in which 529 patients received at least one dose of 7 400 MBq (median number of doses was five).

The most common adverse reactions include: fatigue (48.0%), dry mouth (39.3%), nausea (35.7%), anaemia (31.9%), decreased appetite (21.4%) and constipation (20.2%). The most common grade 3 to 4 adverse reactions include: anaemia (12.9%), thrombocytopenia (7.9%), lymphopenia (7.8%) and fatigue (6.6%).

At the time of VISION final analysis, after a median follow-up duration of 14.2 months (range: 0.6 to 60.9 months), the overall safety profile remained consistent with that previously reported.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions (Table 2) are listed by MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention (CIOMS III): very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000); very rare (&lt;1/10 000).

## Second primary malignancies

Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary defects. The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer and mutations. In all cases it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation are less than from the disease itself. As Pluvicto contributes to a patient's overall long-term radiation exposure, which is associated with an increased risk for cancer (see section 4.4), a potential risk of second primary malignancies cannot be ruled out for radiopharmaceuticals such as Pluvicto. At the time of the VISION primary analysis (cut-off date 27-Jan-2021), cases of squamous cell carcinoma (4 patients; 0.8%) and basal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (1 patient each; 0.2% each) were reported in patients who received Pluvicto plus BSoC.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In the event of administration of a radiation overdose with Pluvicto, the absorbed dose to the patient should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the body by frequent micturition or by forced diuresis and frequent bladder voiding. It might be helpful to estimate the effective dose that was applied.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, Other therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code: V10XX05

## Mechanism of action

The active moiety of Pluvicto is the radionuclide lutetium-177 which is linked to a small-molecule ligand that targets and binds with high affinity to PSMA, a transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in prostate cancer, including mCRPC. Upon the binding of Pluvicto to PSMA-expressing cancer cells, the beta-minus emission from lutetium-177 delivers therapeutic radiation to the targeted cell, as well as to surrounding cells, and induces DNA damage which can lead to cell death.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Vipivotide tetraxetan does not have any pharmacodynamic activity.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## VISION

The efficacy of Pluvicto in patients with progressive, PSMA-positive mCRPC was evaluated in VISION, a randomised, multicentre, open-label phase III study. Eight hundred and thirty-one (N=831) adult patients were randomised (2:1) to receive either Pluvicto 7 400 MBq every 6 weeks for up to a total of 6 doses plus best standard of care (BSoC) (N=551) or BSoC alone (N=280). Patients who received 4 doses of Pluvicto were reassessed for evidence of response, signs of residual disease, and tolerability and could receive up to 2 additional doses per physician's discretion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To maintain castration status, all patients continued to receive a GnRH analogue or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. Eligible patients were required to have progressive, PSMA-positive mCRPC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 to 2, at least one metastatic lesion present on computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or bone scan imaging, and adequate renal, hepatic and haematological function.

Eligible patients were also required to have received at least one AR pathway inhibitor, such as abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide, and 1 or 2 prior taxane-based chemotherapy regimens (with a regimen defined as a minimum exposure of 2 cycles of a taxane). Patients treated with only 1 prior taxane-based chemotherapy regimen were eligible if the patient was unwilling or the physician deemed the patient unsuitable to receive a second regimen. Patients with unstable symptomatic central nervous system metastases or symptomatic or clinically/radiologically impending spinal cord compression were not eligible for the study. Patients underwent a gallium ( 68 Ga) gozetotide positron emission tomography (PET) scan to evaluate PSMA expression in lesions defined by central read criteria. Eligible patients were required to have PSMA-positive mCRPC defined as having at least one tumour lesion with gallium ( 68 Ga) gozetotide uptake greater than in normal liver. Patients were excluded if any lesions exceeding size criteria in short axis (organs ≥1 cm, lymph nodes ≥2.5 cm, bones [soft-tissue component] ≥1 cm) had uptake less than or equal to uptake in normal liver.

BSoC administered at the physician's discretion included: supportive measures including pain management, hydration, blood transfusions, etc.; ketoconazole; radiation therapy (including seeded form or any external beam radiotherapy [including stereotactic body radiotherapy and palliative external beam]) to localised prostate cancer targets; bone-targeted agents including zoledronic acid, denosumab and any bisphosphonates; androgen-reducing agents including GnRH analogues, any corticosteroid, and 5-alpha reductases; AR pathway inhibitors. BSoC excluded investigational agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes and hemi-body radiotherapy treatment.

Patients continued randomised treatment until evidence of tumour progression (based on investigator assessment per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 [PCWG3] criteria), unacceptable toxicity, use of prohibited treatment, non-compliance or withdrawal, or lack of clinical benefit.

The primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) as determined by blinded independent central review (BICR) per PCWG3 criteria. Among the secondary efficacy endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) as determined by BICR per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) defined as first new symptomatic pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, tumour-related orthopaedic surgical intervention, requirement for radiation therapy to relieve bone pain, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Radiographic imaging for tumour assessment (CT with contrast/MRI imaging and bone scan) was done every 8 weeks (±4 days) after the first dose for the first 24 weeks (independent of dose delays), then every 12 weeks (±4 days).

Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 71 years (range: 40 to 94 years); 86.8% White; 6.6% Black or African American; 2.4% Asian; 92.4% had ECOG PS0-1; 7.6% had ECOG PS2. Randomisation was stratified by baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH ≤260 IU/L vs. &gt;260 IU/L), presence of liver metastases (yes vs. no), ECOG PS score (0 or 1 vs. 2), and inclusion of an AR pathway inhibitor as part of BSoC at the time of randomisation (yes vs. no). At randomisation, all patients (100.0%) had received at least one prior taxane-based chemotherapy regimen and 41.2% of patients had received two; 97.1% of patients had received docetaxel and 38.0% of patients had received cabazitaxel. At randomisation, 51.3% of patients had received one prior AR pathway inhibitor, 41.0% of patients had received 2, and 7.7% of patients had received 3 or more. During the randomised treatment period, 52.6% of patients in the Pluvicto plus BSoC arm and 67.8% of patients in the BSoC alone arm received at least one AR pathway inhibitor.

## Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity

Mutagenicity and long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out with lutetium ( 177 Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan; however, radiation is a carcinogen and mutagen.

## 6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS

## 6.1 List of excipients

Acetic acid Sodium acetate Gentisic acid Sodium ascorbate Pentetic acid Water for injections

## 6.2 Incompatibilities

This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in sections 4.2 and 12.

## 6.3 Shelf life

120 hours (5 days) from the date and time of calibration.

## 6.4 Special precautions for storage

Do not freeze.

Store in the original package in order to protect from ionising radiation (lead shielding).

Storage of radiopharmaceuticals should be in accordance with national regulations on radioactive materials.

## 6.5 Nature and contents of container

Clear, colourless type I glass vial, closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium seal.

Each vial contains a volume of solution that can range from 7.5 mL to 12.5 mL corresponding to a radioactivity of 7 400 MBq ±10% at the date and time of administration.

The vial is enclosed within a lead container for protective shielding.

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

## General warning

Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in designated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken.

For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12.

If at any time in the preparation of this medicinal product the integrity of the lead container or the vial is compromised it should not be used.

Administration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory.

The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or contamination from spill of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with national regulations must therefore be taken.

This preparation is likely to result in a relatively high radiation dose to most patients. The administration of Pluvicto may result in significant environmental hazard. This may be of concern to the immediate family of those individuals undergoing treatment or the general public depending on the level of activity administered. Suitable precautions in accordance with national regulations should be taken concerning the activity eliminated by the patients in order to avoid any contaminations.

Lutetium-177 for Pluvicto may be prepared using two different sources of stable nuclides (either lutetium-176 or ytterbium-176). Lutetium-177 for Pluvicto prepared using the stable isotope lutetium-176 ('carrier added') requires special attention with regard to waste management due to the presence of the long-lived metastable lutetium-177 ( 177m Lu) impurity with a half-life of 160.4 days. Lutetium-177 for Pluvicto is prepared using ytterbium-176 ('non-carrier added') unless otherwise communicated on the product batch release certificate. The user must consult the product batch release certificate provided before using Pluvicto to ensure appropriate waste management.

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## 11. DOSIMETRY

Radiation dose to specific organs, which may not be the target organ of therapy, can be influenced significantly by pathophysiological changes induced by the disease process. This should be taken into consideration when using the following information.

Dosimetry of lutetium ( 177 Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan was collected in 29 patients in the phase III VISION sub-study, in order to calculate whole body and organ radiation dosimetry. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the estimated absorbed doses to different organs for adult patients receiving Pluvicto are shown in Table 4. The organs with the highest absorbed doses are lacrimal glands and salivary glands.

The maximum penetration of lutetium-177 in tissue is approximately 2 mm and the mean penetration is 0.67 mm.

## 12. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS

The user must consult the product batch release certificate provided before using Pluvicto to ensure appropriate waste management (see section 6.6).

Withdrawals should be performed under aseptic conditions. The vials must not be opened before disinfecting the stopper, the solution should be withdrawn via the stopper using a single-dose syringe fitted with suitable protective shielding and a disposable sterile needle or using an authorised automated application system.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Preparation instructions

- Use aseptic technique and radiation shielding when handling or administering Pluvicto, using tongs as needed to minimise radiation exposure.
- Visually inspect the product under a shielded screen for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. Discard the vial if particulates and/or discolouration are present.
- Do not inject the Pluvicto solution directly into any other intravenous solution.
- Confirm the amount of radioactivity delivered to the patient with an appropriately calibrated dose calibrator prior to and after each Pluvicto administration.

## Intravenous methods of administration

## Instructions for the syringe method

- Withdraw an appropriate volume of Pluvicto solution to deliver the desired radioactivity by using a disposable syringe fitted with a syringe shield and a disposable sterile needle that is 9 cm, 18 gauge (long needle). To aid the withdrawal of the solution, a filtered 2.5 cm, 20 gauge needle (short venting needle) can be used to reduce the resistance from the pressurised vial. Ensure that the short needle does not touch the Pluvicto solution in the vial.
- If using a syringe pump, fit the syringe into the shielded pump and include a 3-way stopcock valve between the syringe and an intravenous catheter primed with sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection and used for Pluvicto administration to the patient.
- Administer Pluvicto to the patient by slow intravenous push within approximately 1 to 10 minutes (either with a syringe pump or manually without a syringe pump) via an intravenous catheter that is primed with sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection and that is used exclusively for Pluvicto administration to the patient.
- When the desired Pluvicto radioactivity has been delivered, stop the syringe pump and then change the position of the 3-way stopcock valve to flush the syringe with 25 mL of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Restart the syringe pump.
- After the flush of the syringe has been completed, perform an intravenous flush of ≥10 mL of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection through the intravenous catheter to the patient.

## Instructions for the gravity method

- Insert a 2.5 cm, 20 gauge needle (short needle) into the Pluvicto vial and connect via a catheter to 500 mL sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (used to transport the Pluvicto solution during the infusion). Ensure that the short needle does not touch the Pluvicto solution in the vial and do not connect the short needle directly to the patient. Do not allow the sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to flow into the Pluvicto vial prior to the initiation of the Pluvicto infusion and do not inject the Pluvicto solution directly into the sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection.
- Insert a second needle that is 9 cm, 18 gauge (long needle) into the Pluvicto vial, ensuring that the long needle touches and is secured to the bottom of the Pluvicto vial during the entire infusion. Connect the long needle to the patient by an intravenous catheter that is primed with sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection and that is used exclusively for the Pluvicto infusion into the patient.
- Use a clamp or an infusion pump to regulate the flow of the sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection via the short needle into the Pluvicto vial (the sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection entering the vial through the short needle will carry the Pluvicto solution from the vial to the patient via the intravenous catheter connected to the long needle within approximately 30 minutes).
- During the infusion, ensure that the level of solution in the Pluvicto vial remains constant.
- Disconnect the vial from the long needle line and clamp the sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection line once the level of radioactivity is stable for at least five minutes.
- Follow the infusion with an intravenous flush of ≥10 mL of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection through the intravenous catheter to the patient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Instructions for the peristaltic pump method

- Insert a filtered 2.5 cm, 20 gauge needle (short venting needle) into the Pluvicto vial. Ensure that the short needle does not touch the Pluvicto solution in the vial and do not connect the short needle directly to the patient or to the peristaltic pump.
- Insert a second needle that is 9 cm, 18 gauge (long needle) into the Pluvicto vial, ensuring that the long needle touches and is secured to the bottom of the Pluvicto vial during the entire infusion. Connect the long needle and a sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to a 3-way stopcock valve via appropriate tubing.
- Connect the output of the 3-way stopcock valve to tubing installed on the input side of the peristaltic pump according to manufacturer's instructions.
- Prime the line by opening the 3-way stopcock valve and pumping the Pluvicto solution through the tubing until it reaches the exit of the valve.
- Prime the intravenous catheter which will be connected to the patient by opening the 3-way stopcock valve to the sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection and pumping the sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection until it exits the end of the catheter tubing.
- Connect the primed intravenous catheter to the patient and set the 3-way stopcock valve such that the Pluvicto solution is in line with the peristaltic pump.
- Infuse an appropriate volume of Pluvicto solution at approximately 25 mL/h to deliver the desired radioactivity.
- When the desired Pluvicto radioactivity has been delivered, stop the peristaltic pump and then change the position of the 3-way stopcock valve so that the peristaltic pump is in line with the sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Restart the peristaltic pump and infuse an intravenous flush of ≥10 mL of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection through the intravenous catheter to the patient.

## Quality control

The solution should be visually inspected for damage and contamination before use, and only clear solutions free of visible particles should be used. The visual inspection of the solution should be performed under a shielded screen for radioprotection purposes. The vial must not be opened.

If at any time in the preparation of this medicinal product the integrity of the lead container or the vial is compromised, it should not be used.

The amount of radioactivity in the vial must be measured prior to administration using a suitable radioactivity calibration system in order to confirm that the actual amount of radioactivity to be administered is equal to the planned amount at the administration time.

## 1. What Pluvicto is and what it is used for

## What Pluvicto is

Pluvicto contains lutetium ( 177 Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan. This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for therapy only.

## What Pluvicto is used for

Pluvicto is used to treat adults with progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) and has already been treated with other cancer treatments. Castration-resistant prostate cancer is a cancer of the prostate (a gland of the male reproductive system) that does not respond to treatment that reduces male hormones. Pluvicto is used if the prostate cancer cells have a protein on their surface called prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA).

## How Pluvicto works

Pluvicto binds to PSMA found on the surface of the prostate cancer cells. Once bound, the radioactive substance in Pluvicto, lutetium-177, gives off radiation that causes the prostate cancer cells to die.

Your doctor will carry out tests to see if PSMA is present on the surface of the cancer cells. Your cancer is more likely to respond to treatment with Pluvicto if the test result is positive.

The use of Pluvicto involves exposure to amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation.

If you have any questions about how Pluvicto works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your nuclear medicine doctor.

## 2. What you need to know before Pluvicto is used

Follow all instructions given by your nuclear medicine doctor carefully. They may differ from the general information contained in this leaflet.

## Pluvicto must not be used

- -if you are allergic to lutetium ( 177 Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

- -if you have low levels of certain types of cells in the blood (red blood cells, white blood cells, neutrophils, platelets)
- -if you have or have had tiredness, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, bleeding or bruising more easily than normal or bleeding for longer than normal, or frequent infections with signs such as fever, chills, sore throat or mouth ulcers (possible signs of myelosuppression [a condition in which the bone marrow cannot make enough blood cells])
- -if you have or have had kidney problems
- -if you have or have had any other type of cancer or treatment for cancer, as Pluvicto contributes to your overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure

## Before administration of Pluvicto you should:

- -drink plenty of water so that you remain hydrated and urinate as often as possible during the first hours after administration

## Children and adolescents

The safety and efficacy of this medicine have not been established in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This medicine should not be given to children or adolescents aged under 18 years because no data are available in this age group.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

Pluvicto is not intended for use in women.

Before you receive Pluvicto, tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are sexually active as all radioactive emissions, including those from Pluvicto, can cause harm to an unborn baby.

## Fertility

Pluvicto may cause infertility. Please ask your nuclear medicine doctor how this may affect you, especially if you are planning to have children in the future. You may wish to seek advice on preservation of sperm before treatment starts.

- -People who are confined to bed or have reduced mobility will preferably receive assistance from a care giver. It is recommended that when providing assistance in the bathroom, the care giver wears disposable gloves.
- -Care givers who clean up vomit, blood, urine or faeces should wear plastic gloves, which should be disposed of in a separate plastic waste disposal bag (see 'Waste disposal recommendations' below).

## Waste disposal recommendations

- -All items to be thrown away should be discarded in a separate plastic waste disposal bag to be used only for this purpose.
- -Keep the plastic waste disposal bags separate from the other household waste and away from children and animals.
- -A member of the hospital staff will tell you how and when to get rid of these waste disposal bags.

## Hospitalisation and emergency care

- -If for any reason you require emergency medical assistance or are unexpectedly admitted to the hospital during the first 7 days after administration, you should inform the healthcare professionals about the name, date and dose of your radioactive treatment.

## Other precautions

- -The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any other special precautions after receiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions.

## If you have been given more Pluvicto than you should
