<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Supemtek Tetra is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of influenza disease in adults and children from 9 years of age and older.

Supemtek Tetra should be used in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

Adults and children from 9 years of age One dose of 0.5 mL.

## Paediatric population

Safety and efficacy of Supemtek Tetra have not been established in individuals below 3 years of age.

Currently available safety and immunogenicity data of Supemtek Tetra in children from 3 to less than 8 years of age are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

## Method of administration

For intramuscular injection only. The preferred site is in the deltoid muscle. The vaccine must not be injected intravascularly and must not be mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe.

For instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to any trace residues such as octylphenol ethoxylate.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in patients with acute febrile illness until the fever is resolved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunodeficiency

Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient to prevent influenza.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with all injectable vaccines, Supemtek Tetra must be administered with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects.

## Syncope

Syncope can occur following or even before any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. Procedures should be in place to prevent falling and injury and to manage syncope.

## Protection

As with any vaccine, vaccination with Supemtek Tetra may not protect all vaccinees.

## Excipients with known effect

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium free'.

## Polysorbate 20 content

This medicine contains 0.0275 mg of polysorbate 20 (E432) in each 0.5 mL dose. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No interaction studies have been performed, nor data to assess the concomitant administration of Supemtek Tetra with other vaccines.

If Supemtek Tetra is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should always be administered at different injection sites.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 14 500 pregnancy outcomes from a retrospective study), indicates no malformative nor foeto/neonatal toxicity of Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (recombinant, prepared in cell culture) (Supemtek Tetra) when administered during pregnancy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One animal study performed with trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo-foetal development or early post-natal development.

Supemtek Tetra can be used during pregnancy in accordance with official recommendations.

## Breastfeeding

It is unknown whether Supemtek Tetra is excreted in human milk.

An assessment of the risks and benefits should be performed by a healthcare professional before administering Supemtek Tetra to a breastfeeding woman.

## Fertility

No human fertility data are available.

The animal study with trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine did not indicate harmful effects on female fertility.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Supemtek Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines . However, caution should be used when driving or using machines if the ability to react is reduced due to some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions occurring after vaccine administration were injection-site reactions (tenderness and pain) reported overall by 48% and 37% of study participants 18-49 years of age receiving Supemtek Tetra respectively. In study participants 50 years of age and older, injection site tenderness was reported by 34% and injection site pain reported by 19%.

In children/adolescents 9 to 17 years of age who received Supemtek Tetra, the most common injection-site adverse reaction was pain (34.4%). The most common systemic adverse reactions were myalgia (19.3%), headache (18.5%) and malaise (16.1%).

The severity of the adverse reactions was mild to moderate. Onset usually occurred within the first 3 days after vaccination. All resolved without sequelae.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class under headings of frequency using the following convention:

Very common (≥ 1/10);

Common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10);

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No cases of overdose reported with Supemtek Tetra.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, influenza vaccine, ATC code: J07BB02

## Mechanism of action

Supemtek Tetra contains recombinant HA proteins of the four strains of influenza virus specified by health authorities for inclusion in the annual seasonal vaccine. These proteins function as antigens which induce a humoral immune response, measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody that is known to protect against influenza infection.

Antibodies against one influenza virus type or subtype confer limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibodies to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Frequent development of antigenic variants through antigenic drift is the virologic basis for seasonal epidemics and the reason for the usual replacement of one or more influenza virus strains in each year's influenza vaccine. Therefore, influenza vaccines are standardized to contain the hemagglutinins of influenza virus strains (i.e., typically two type A and two type B), representing the influenza viruses likely to be circulating in the upcoming season. Immunogenicity

Supemtek Tetra was evaluated in healthy adults of 18-49 years of age in a randomized, observer-blind, active controlled, non-inferiority immunogenicity, multicenter study conducted during the 20142015 influenza season in the United States (study 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the study 1, subjects received Supemtek Tetra (N=998) or an egg-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) (N=332). Immunogenicity was assessed before and 28 days after administration of a single dose of study vaccine.

Haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) geometric mean titers (GMTs) were determined for the two vaccine groups for each vaccine antigen. Immunogenicity was compared by calculating the difference in seroconversion rates (SCR) and the ratios of GMTs of Comparator to Supemtek Tetra. Study 1 had two co-primary endpoints: GMTs and Day 28 HAI seroconversion rates for each of the four antigens contained in the study vaccines.

Supemtek Tetra met the success criterion for GMTs for three of the four antigens but did not meet the success criteria for the B/Victoria lineage antigen (Table 2). Antibody titres against the B/Victoria were low in both vaccine groups.

Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; GMT, geometric mean titer.

1 HI titers were assayed using egg-derived antigens.

2 Comparator: egg-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine.

3 Success in meeting the GMTs endpoint was pre-defined as an upper bound (UB) of the two-sided 95% CI of GMT Comparator / GMT Supemtek Tetra ≤ 1.5.

Supemtek Tetra met the success criterion for SCRs for three of the four antigens (Table 3), but not for the B/Victoria lineage. The HAI response to the B/Victoria lineage antigen was low in both vaccine groups.

Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; SCR, seroconversion rate

1 HI titers were assayed using egg-derived antigens.

2 Comparator was an egg-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine.

3 Seroconversion was defined as either a pre-vaccination HAI titer of &lt; 1:10 and a post-vaccination HAI titer of ≥ 1:40, or a pre-vaccination HAI titer of ≥ 1:10 and a minimum 4- fold rise in post vaccination HAI titer, at Day 28.

4 Success in meeting the seroconversion rate (SCR) endpoint was pre-defined as an upper bound (UB) of the two-sided 95% CI of SCR Comparator - SCR Supemtek Tetra ≤ 10%.

The study 1 in adults 18-49 years of age was conducted in parallel to the study 2 in adults of 50 years of age and older. These adults 18-49 years of age were vaccinated during the same influenza season (20142015 Northern Hemisphere influenza season) and received the same Supemtek Tetra formulation (same vaccine strain composition) as adults of 50 years of age and older in the study 2. The immune response induced by Supemtek Tetra was assessed by the same HAI assay and performed by the same laboratory for both studies. The immunogenicity results in adults 18-49 years of age (study 1) and adults 50 years of age and older (study 2) are presented in Table 4.

## Clinical efficacy

Supemtek Tetra efficacy in terms of prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI) caused by any strain of influenza, was evaluated in adults ≥ 50 years of age and conducted during the 2014-2015 influenza season in the United States (study 2).

A total of 8 963 healthy, medically stable adults were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of Supemtek Tetra (N=4 474) or an egg-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (N=4 489).

A total of 5 412 (60.4%) subjects were 50-64 years of age, 2 532 (28.2%) were 65-74 years of age and 1 019 (11.4 %) were ≥ 75 years of age.

The primary efficacy endpoint of study 2 was reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR)positive, protocol-defined ILI due to any strain of influenza.

Laboratory-confirmed protocol defined ILI was defined as having at least one symptom in each of two categories of respiratory and systemic symptoms, which could include sore throat, cough, sputum production, wheezing and difficulty breathing, or systemic symptoms such as fever &gt; 99°F (&gt; 37 °C), chills, fatigue, headache and myalgia, laboratory-confirmed by rtPCR.

US epidemiological data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated and that most influenza A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar while A/H1N1 and B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens. Supemtek Tetra met the pre-specified success criterion for non-inferiority to the comparator pre-defined as a lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI &gt; 20%.

Of the 4 474 participants exposed to Supemtek Tetra in a phase 3 active-controlled study (study 2), a total of 1 761 were 65 years or older. Although no differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and younger participants, the number of patients aged 65 and over in this study was not sufficient to determine statistically whether this age group will respond differently from younger individuals.

## Efficacy of trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3)

The efficacy of trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3) is relevant to Supemtek Tetra because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.

The efficacy of trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine in protecting against influenza illness was evaluated in a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study conducted in the United States during the 2007-2008 influenza season in adults 18-49 years of age (study 3).

Study 3 enrolled and vaccinated 4 648 healthy adults randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of RIV3 (N=2 344) or saline placebo (N=2 304).

The primary efficacy endpoint of study 3 was defined as an influenza-like illness (ILI) with a positive culture for an influenza virus strain antigenically resembling a strain represented in RIV3. ILI is defined as fever of ≥ 100 °F (37.8 °C) oral accompanied by cough, sore throat, or both, on the same or consecutive days. Attack rates and vaccine efficacy (VE), defined as the reduction in the influenza rate for RIV3 relative to placebo, were calculated for the total vaccinated cohort (N=4 648).

Due to very small number of cultured confirmed influenza cases with matched strains, an exploratory analysis of VE of RIV3 against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting ILI criteria was done, demonstrated an efficacy estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 6 for VE by case definition.

## Paediatric population

Supemtek  Tetra  was  evaluated  in  healthy  participants  of  age  9  to  17 years  of  age  in  a  phase  3  nonrandomised, open label, uncontrolled, multi-centre study (study 4), enrolled a total of 1 308 participants.

The  primary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  that  vaccination  with  Supemtek  Tetra  induced  an  immune response  (as  assessed  by  haemagglutination  inhibition  [HAI],  geometric  mean  titres  [GMTs]  and seroconversion  [SCR]  rates)  in  children  and  adolescents  9  to  17 years  of  age  that  was  non-inferior  to responses induced by Supemtek Tetra in adults 18 to 49 years of age for the 4 virus strains at Day 29 postvaccination.

Non-inferiority of HAI immune response induced by Supemtek Tetra in children/adolescents 9 to 17 years of age relative to the immune response induced by Supemtek Tetra in adults 18 to 49 years of age was demonstrated for all four strains. (Table 7 and 8).

Supemtek Tetra induced a robust immune response in both age groups irrespective of age subgroup, sex, race, serological status at baseline, or prior influenza vaccination status.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety and immunogenicity of Supemtek Tetra has been evaluated in children 3 to 8 years of age. The data showed that while Supemtek Tetra induced an immune response in children 3 to 8 years of age, 1 or 2 doses of Supemtek Tetra did not induce an acceptable level of immunogenicity versus the IIV4 vaccine for all strains (see sections 4.2).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical safety data on the trivalent formulation revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose and local toxicity, reproductive and developmental (including teratogenicity) toxicity and safety pharmacology studies. The results of these studies with trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine are relevant to Supemtek Tetra because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

## 1. What Supemtek Tetra is and what it is used for

Supemtek Tetra is a vaccine for adults and children who are 9 years of age and older. This vaccine helps to protect you against flu (influenza). Supemtek Tetra is egg-free because of the technology used to produce it.

When a person is given Supemtek Tetra, the body's natural defence (the immune system) produces protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu.

As with all vaccines, Supemtek Tetra may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated.

## When to have a flu vaccine

Flu can spread very fast.

- It is caused by different types of flu virus that can change every year. This is why you might need to be vaccinated every year.
- The greatest risk of catching flu is during the cold months between October and March.
- If you were not vaccinated in the autumn, it is still sensible to be vaccinated up until the spring since you run the risk of catching flu until then.

Your doctor will be able to recommend the best time to be vaccinated.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Supemtek Tetra

Do not use Supemtek Tetra if you are allergic to:

- the active ingredients or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- octylphenol ethoxylate, a trace residue from the manufacturing process.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Supemtek Tetra.

As with all vaccines, Supemtek Tetra may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Before receiving the vaccine, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if:

- you have a short-term illness with fever. Vaccination may need to be delayed until your fever has gone.
- you have a weakened immune system (immunodeficiency or you are taking medicines that affect the immune system such as cancer medicine (chemotherapy) or corticosteroid medicines).
- you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily .
- you have fainted with an injection before. Fainting can happen after, or even before an injection.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure) talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Supemtek Tetra.

## Other medicines and Supemtek Tetra

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or if you have recently received any other vaccine.

Supemtek Tetra may be given at the same time as other vaccines by using separate limbs.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this vaccine. Your doctor or pharmacist will help you to decide if you should receive Supemtek Tetra.

## Driving and using machines

Supemtek Tetra has no or negligible effect on your ability to drive and use machine. However, use caution when driving or using machines if your ability to react is reduced due to some of the effects mentioned under section 4 (Possible side effects).
