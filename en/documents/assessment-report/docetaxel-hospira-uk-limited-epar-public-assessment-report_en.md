Scientific discussion 2.1. Introduction Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited concentrate for solution for infusion is a generic medicinal product containing the active substance docetaxel. Docetaxel is a semi-synthetic taxoid derived from a non-cytotoxic precursor (10-deacetyl  baccatin  III),  which  is  extracted  from  the  needles  of  Taxus  baccata  and  esterified  with  a chemically synthesised side chain. The  reference  medicinal  product  is  Taxotere,  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion,  authorised  on  27 November 1995. Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent which acts by promoting the assembly of tubulin into stable  microtubules  and  inhibits  their  disassembly  which  leads  to  a  marked  decrease  of  free  tubulin.  The binding of docetaxel to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  indications  for  Docetaxel  Hospira  UK  Limited  are  identical  to  the  indications  of  Taxotere  and  are  as follows:

## Breast cancer

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with:

- operable node-positive breast cancer
- operable node-negative breast cancer

For patients with operable node-negative breast cancer, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to patients eligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary therapy of early breast cancer.

Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited in combination with doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this condition. Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic therapy. Previous chemotherapy should have included an anthracycline or an alkylating agent. Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited in combination with trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours over express HER2 and who previously have not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited in combination with capecitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Head and neck cancer

Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

Docetaxel is administered as a one-hour infusion every three weeks. The recommended dose varies according to the indication (see SmPC section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited 20 mg/1 ml concentrate for solution for infusion requires no prior dilution with a solvent and is ready to be added to the infusion solution. The required volume of Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited concentrate for solution for infusion must be injected via a single infusion (one shot) into a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle containing either 5% glucose solution or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. If a dose greater than 190 mg of docetaxel is required, a larger volume of the infusion vehicle has to be used, so that a concentration of 0.74 mg/ml docetaxel is not exceeded (see SmPC section 6.6).

The single-dose vial Taxotere product is available in three presentations on the European market: 20 mg/1 ml, 80 mg/4 ml and 160 mg/8 ml. The proposed presentations of Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited are: 20 mg/1 ml, 80 mg/4 ml, and 120 mg/6 ml. Thus, Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited has an additional presentation of 120 mg/6 ml compared to Taxotere, which has been developed by Hospira based on considerations of market requirements. The proposed 120 mg/6 ml presentation has the same concentration of active ingredient per ml as the other presentations of Taxotere and is consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of use. 2.2. Quality aspects 2.2.1. Introduction The finished product is presented as 20 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion containing docetaxel (as trihydrate) as active substance. The other ingredients are polysorbate 80, ethanol (anhydrous) and citric acid monohydrate. The product is available in clear glass (type I) vial with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium seal with a flip-off cap, containing 1 mL, 4 mL or 6 mL of concentrate. Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited is diluted prior administration with either 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose solutions. 2.2.2. Active substance General information The chemical name of docetaxel trihydrate is 5β,20-epoxy-1,7β,10β-trihydroxy-9-oxotax-11-ene-2α,4,13αtriyl 4-acetate 2-benzoate 13-[(2 R ,3 S )-3-[[(1,1-dimethylethoxy)carbonyl]amino]-2-hydroxy-3phenylpropanoate] trihydrate and it has the following structure: Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The structure has been confirmed by elemental analysis, ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H-NMR and  13 C-NMR) spectroscopy and specific optical rotation. In addition, thermal (TGA and DSC) and XRD analysis were conducted to confirm its structural conformance to the Ph. Eur. reference standard.

Docetaxel trihydrate is a white or almost white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder, with a molecular mass of 861.93 gmol -1 , corresponding to the molecular formula C43H53NO14∙3H2O. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in anhydrous ethanol, soluble in dichloromethane.

Docetaxel trihydrate exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of eleven chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by specific optical rotation. Polymorphism has been observed for docetaxel trihydrate. XRD studies confirmed that the polymorph obtained is identical to the Ph. Eur. docetaxel reference standard. The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure. Manufacture, characterization and process controls The active substance is a semi-synthetic taxoid derived from a non-cytotoxic precursor (10-deacetyl baccatin II), which is extracted from the needles of Taxus baccata and esterified with a chemically synthesized side chain. The extraction and isolation steps to obtain this starting material have been adequately described and suitable IPCs and specifications have been set. The description of the manufacturing process has been adequately described and satisfactory specifications have been set for reagents, solvents and starting materials used in the process. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance by the proposed manufacturer has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. Specification The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (specific optical rotation and FT-IR), appearance of solution, assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), microbial limits and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.

Analysis data on three commercial scale batches of the active substance manufactured by the proposed manufacturer have been provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Stability

Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  The parameters tested and analytical methods used are the same as for release and were stability indicating. All the parameters remained within the predefined specification at all time points and no trends were observed.

In addition, forced degradation studies of docetaxel trihydrate were performed on one batch. Samples were stored under the conditions of heat, humidity and light. The results from these studies indicate that the active substance degrades under exposure to high temperature or strong light. Although docetaxel trihydrate does not degrade under high humidity conditions, it can absorb some moisture. Therefore, docetaxel trihydrate drug substance must be stored in an airtight container. Overall, the stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 2.2.3. Finished medicinal product Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited concentrate for solution for infusion is presented as a clear pale yellow to brownish yellow solution available in three dosage strengths: 20 mg1 mL; 80 mg/4 mL; 120 mg/6mL. The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as a stable injectable intravenous solution similar to Taxotere 20 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion that meets compendial and other relevant quality standards. The critical quality attributes (CQAs) identified were description, identification, pH, assay, ethanol content, related substances, particulate matter, extractable volume, sterility, bacterial endotoxins and leachables. The formulation and manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use of risk assessment to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters. Risk identification was based on the prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the experience from formulation development and process design. The critical process parameters have been adequately identified. The excipients were selected based on the composition of the reference medicinal product. The excipients used in the formulation are polysorbate 80, citric acid monohydrate and ethanol anhydrous. Citric acid monohydrate is used as an acidifying and stabilizing agent, polysorbate 80 as a surfactant, and anhydrous ethanol as a solvent. All the excipients employed are widely used in parenteral dosage forms and comply with their Ph. Eur. monographs. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The active substance is insoluble in water and solubilisation is achieved by adding polysorbate 80 to the formulation. The amount of polysorbate 80 added allows micelles to form, thus solubilising the docetaxel and preventing precipitation. Considering the micellar nature of the product, it was important to characterise the micelle solution and compare it to the reference product prior to administration, i.e., in the infusion bag. The physicochemical characterisation of the micelle solution included the determination of the micelle size

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

distribution in infusion solutions of 0.9% sodium chloride and 5% glucose at high and low docetaxel concentrations (spanning all potential infusion solution concentrations used in the clinic), assay, critical micelle concentration and free and bound active substance. Testing was conducted at the in-use limit of 6 h. These studies showed that both products are similar in terms of micellar characteristics, irrespective of drug concentration or infusion solution, over the six hour storage period.

Comparative batch analysis data on three commercial scale batches of Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited of each strength and five batches of Taxotere (80 mg/mL) were also presented.

## Stability of the product

Considering these in vitro results and the similarity of the generic and reference product formulations it was considered that a biowaiver for this 'complex' injectable was justified. The choice of the sterilization method was performed in accordance with the EMEA Decision Trees for the Selection of Sterilisation Methods (CPMP/QWP/054/98). Since Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited 20 mg/ml is a non-aqueous liquid terminal sterilization by moist heat is not feasible. The drug product is sterilized by double filtration. The filters are sterilized using a moist heat sterilization cycle and the filters are tested before and after the filling process to verify integrity. The primary packaging is a clear glass (type I) vial with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium seal with a flip-off cap. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and it is adequate for the intended use of the product. Manufacture of the product and process controls The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: dispensing of the active substance and excipients, solution compounding, double sterile filtration (0.2 µm), aseptic filling and labelling and packaging.  The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. Product specification The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description, identification (HPLC, TLC), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), ethanol content (GC), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial-scale batches of each presentation of the finished product confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Stability data on three commercial scale batches of each presentation of the finished product stored under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for up to 18 months, and under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 6 months, according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. Samples were also stored under intermediate conditions for up to 12 months at 30 ºC / 75% RH. The batches of finished product were manufactured at the proposed commercial site and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

marketing. Samples were tested for description, assay, related substances, particulate matter, ethanol content, sterility and bacterial endotoxins. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. All batches remained with the specifications and comparable results to the reference medicinal product were obtained.

In addition, forced degradation studies on one lab scale batch on exposure to acid, base, oxidant, heat and light were performed. Epi-docetaxel (4-epidocetaxel) was the major degradant from the acid, base and oxidative degradations. Base degradation also generated two additional major impurities. No severe degradation was observed under UV and heat conditions. This study was employed to demonstrate the stability indicating nature of the assay HPLC method used.

An infusion stability study was also conducted to compare the stability of Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited and the reference medicinal product when diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride and 5% glucose. The infusion solutions were prepared at the lowest concentration of 0.3 mg/mL and the highest concentration of 0.74 mg/mL. The study was conducted in non-PVC bags for both infusion solutions and in glass bottles for the 5% glucose solution. Testing was conducted for appearance, pH, assay, related substance and particulate matter. The results showed that the Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited drug product is comparable to Taxotere and is stable in either solution and at each concentration for up to 48 hours when refrigerated (5±3 °C) and for up to 6 hours at room temperature (25±2 °C). Based on available stability data, a shelf-life of 18 months stored below 25°C in the original package is acceptable. Adventitious agents No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects The active substance and finished product have been adequately described. The medicinal product consists of a micellar solution. Development of the generic product was based on the formulation, dosage form, concentration and use of the reference product. The composition of the generic formulation is qualitatively identical and quantitatively nearly identical to the innovator product Taxotere concentrate for solution for infusion. No bioequivalence study has been submitted by the applicant to demonstrate the pharmaceutical equivalence of his product to the reference medicinal product. Comparative experimental data regarding the physicochemical characteristics, e.g. micelle size distribution, critical micellar concentration, potency in the product ready to use (after dilution with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose) and impurity profile have been provided. No significant differences were observed from the comparative studies between the generic product and the reference product. Therefore, similarity between Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited and the reference product Taxotere can be accepted and no human bioequivalence study has been considered necessary. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The finished product is manufactured by aseptic filling which is a nonstandard process. Sufficient validation data has been provided to assure that the process is robust and well controlled and produces a uniform product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## 2.2.6. Recommendation for future quality development

n/a 2.3. Non-clinical aspects 2.3.1. Introduction A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. According to ICH Q 3 B (R2), the applicant has provided a toxicological expert statement to support the qualification of impurities (see also quality aspects). The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant  and accepted by the CHMP as the introduction of Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited manufactured by Hospira UK Limited is considered unlikely  to  result  in  any  significant  increase  in  the  combined  sales  volumes  for  all  docetaxel  containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 2.4. Clinical aspects 2.4.1. Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as efficacy and safety of docetaxel based on published literature. The relevant SmPC sections are in line with the SmPC of the reference product.

No formal scientific advice by the CHMP has been requested for this medicinal product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Exemption

No bioequivalence studies have been conducted. The Applicant outlined that docetaxel injection 20 mg/mL is a  non-aqueous  micelle  forming  formulation  and,  according  to  the  Guideline  on  the  investigation  of Bioequivalence (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98/Rev 1), micelle formulations may be eligible for biowaiver if rapid disassembly  of  the  micelle  on  dilution  occurs,  the  method  and  rate  of  administration  is  the  same  as  the reference medicinal product and the excipients do not affect the disposition of the drug substance.

The applicant justified that the criteria of the above referred Guideline are met for Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited as detailed below:  Rapid disassembly of the micelle on dilution occurs: Polysorbate 80 is rapidly cleared, after intravenous administration, by plasma carboxylesterases. This fact is adequately documented by scientific literature (Baker S Zhao M et al.). Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited is not designed to control release or disposition.  Docetaxel  Hospira  UK  Limited  has  the  same  active  and  inactive  ingredients,  indications,  route  of administration, dosage form and strength as Taxotere.  The excipients do not affect the disposition of the drug substance.  Physicochemical characteristics: Studies regarding micelle size and micelle distribution in diluted solutions (dilution was done in 0.9% NaCl and in 5% glucose solution) were performed. The micelle size and distribution were tested within 6 hours of initial dosing of infusion bags using dynamic light scattering. The results of the dynamic light scattering study showed the similarity of both products (Taxotere, Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited) with regard to micelle size and  size  distribution  at  concentrations  of  0,74  mg/mL  and  0,3  mg/mL  in  0,9%  NaCl  and  in  5%  Glucose solutions An equilibrium dialysis method was developed and used to compare the extent of docetaxel protein binding to human plasma in vitro from Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited Injection or Taxotere. Results of this study clearly showed that the percent unbound docetaxel is similar between both drug products. The Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) for PS80 has been reported as 13 to 15 µg/mL or 23 to 37 mcg/mL in the literature (Product Information Tween 80 Sigma Ultra (P8074); Patist A, Bhagwat SS, Penfield KW et al.). At the recommended docetaxel concentration range in infusion solutions (approximately 0.3 mg/mL to 0.7  mg/mL),  the  concentration  of  PS80  is  approximately  7,800  µg/mL  to  19,240  µg/mL.  Therefore,  the concentration of PS80 in Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited Injection 20 mg/mL is significantly higher than the concentration at which PS80 forms micelles in aqueous solution. It should be noted that this concentration is highly  similar  to  the  PS80  concentration  derived  from  dilution  of  Taxotere.  Consequently,  the  quantity  of PS80 in Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited formulation, which is highly similar to that found in Taxotere, on a mg PS80  per  mg  docetaxel  basis  is  well  in  excess  of  that  required  to  form  micelles  in  docetaxel  solutions. Therefore, no difference in micelle characteristics would be expected between Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited product and Taxotere. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Based  on  the  Reflection  paper  on  the  pharmaceutical  development  of  intravenous  medicinal  products containing  active  substances  solubilised  in  micellar  systems (EMA/CHMP/QWP/799402/2011)  which  states that  the  same  surfactant  is  a  condition  and  that  formulations  may  be  qualitatively  identical,  with  small quantitative changes only, the Applicant provided tables showing the concentrations of all ingredients, not only in their product as presented for the market, but also in the infusion solution(s) immediately prior to administration to the patient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  composition  of  Docetaxel  Hospira  UK  Limited  and  Taxotere  is  qualitatively  identical,  with  small quantitative  changes  only.  There  was  a  slight  difference  in  the  content  of  Polysorbate  80  (Taxotere:  540 mg/ml vs Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited: 520 mg/ml), which is  not likely  to  have  a  significant  impact  on micellar  stability  or  disposition  of  the  drug.  A  small  quantitative  difference  is  acceptable  since  the  great dilution factor upon infusion to the patient would probably reduce any effects below the threshold of clinical relevance.

The infusion solutions from the Hospira product have higher amount in citric acid compared to those derived from Taxotere but as shown in the micelle characterization study this difference has no impact on micelle characteristics. A comprehensive discussion on the safety implications of differences in composition was also provided by the Applicant.  Citric  acid  is  not  considered  to  affect  the  safety  or  efficacy  profile,  especially  when  the  drug  is diluted and later injected into systemic circulation. The slight difference in the content of Polysorbate 80 is also not considered to affect the safety. Taken all these data into consideration, the biowaiver requirements for micelle forming formulations as described in the 'Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98/Rev1)' are considered met. Furthermore, the Applicant's development program is in line with recommendations made in the 'Reflection paper on the pharmaceutical development of intravenous medicinal products containing active substances solubilised in micellar systems'. Therefore, no additional human bioequivalence study was considered necessary in this particular case. The additional \"pack size\" presentation of 120 mg/6 ml Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited has the concentration of  active  ingredient  same  (per  ml  basis)  as  the  other  presentations  of  the  innovator  product  Taxotere, therefore, a waiver is accepted. 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics No new pharmacokinetic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 2.4.4. Post marketing experience No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

2.7. PSUR submission The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and  published on the European medicines web-portal. 2.8. Product information Given the presence in several Member States of a nationally approved Hospira product containing docetaxel with a similar name but different concentrations to the ones applied for Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited, measures have been taken by the Applicant to address the risk of potential medication errors. In particular, the Applicant has provided mock-ups for the packaging materials that sufficiently differentiate the product from the nationally authorised product with a different concentration. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Hospira UK Limited have informed the Agency that they will apply to change the name of the product from 'Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited' to an NRG-approved invented name, together with a new labelling proposal. In addition, the concentration of the 20 mg/ml product will be displayed more prominently and in bold on the pack. Updated mock ups will be submitted by the applicant once the new invented name is available.

## 2.8.1. User consultation

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

## 3. Benefit-risk balance

This application concerns a generic version of docetaxel, concentrate for solution for infusion. The reference product Taxotere is indicated for treatment of breast cancer, non-small lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma, head and neck cancer. No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance. The applicant's clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. As Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited is administered as a non-aqueous micelle forming formulation, the Applicant provided comparative physicochemical data on micelle size and distribution after 6 hours as well as comparative data on the extent of docetaxel protein binding to human plasma in vitro. Based on these data, Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited pharmacokinetics, micelle 'disassembly' and docetaxel protein binding are considered comparable to Taxotere. The formulation of Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited and Taxotere is qualitatively identical with small quantitative differences (in content of Polysorbate 80 and acid citric). However, these differences were not considered clinically relevant and thus considered acceptable. Overall, there were no significant difference shown between Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited and the reference product Taxotere. Therefore, no additional human bioequivalence study was considered necessary. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 4. Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Docetaxel Hospira UK Limited in the treatment of breast cancer, non-small lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma, head and neck cancer is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: Medicinal product no longer authorised
