## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Type  2  Diabetes  Mellitus  (T2DM)  is  a  common  chronic  metabolic  disorder,  which  can  lead  to substantial morbidity and increased mortality rates. Data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial,  the  Stockholm  Diabetes  Intervention  Study  in  type  1  diabetes,  and  the  United  Kingdom Prospective  Diabetes  Study  in  T2DM,  compared  intensive  with  standard  glucose  management  and showed a reduced risk of complications with improved glucose control as measured by HbA1c. Three key defects underlie the pathogenesis of the disease: insulin resistance, reduced insulin secretion, and hepatic  glucose  overproduction.  Limitations  of  current  therapies  include  a  range  of  safety  and tolerability issues, limited extent and/or durability of efficacy, and inconvenience in dosing.  The most common  adverse  events  associated  with  current  agents  are  hypoglycaemia  (with  sulphonylureas, meglitinides,  insulin),  weight  gain  (with  sulphonylureas,  meglitinides,  insulin,  thiazolidinediones [TZDs]),  and  gastrointestinal  intolerance  (with  metformin,  alpha-glucosidase  inhibitors).  DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4) inhibitors, such as saxagliptin, have distinct mechanisms of action and might offer an improved safety and tolerability profile with good efficacy and durability. Already authorised are sitagliptin (Januvia ® ) and vildagliptin (Galvus ® ).

This application concerns the centralised procedure (Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, article 3(1) indent 3). It is submitted in accordance with Article 8(3) in Directive 2001/83/EC for a new active substance. Conditional approval, an approval under exceptional circumstances or an accelerated review were not requested.

## The claimed indication was:

## Add-on combination therapy:

Onglyza  is  indicated  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  to  improve  glycaemic  control  in combination with metformin, when the single agent alone, with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control.

Onglyza  is  indicated  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  to  improve  glycaemic  control  in combination with a sulfonylurea, when the single agent alone, with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use of metformin is considered inappropriate.

## Initial combination therapy:

Onglyza is indicated for use as initial combination therapy with metformin, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both Onglyza and metformin therapy is appropriate.

## The approved indication is:

## Add-on combination therapy

Onglyza is indicated in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control:

- in combination with metformin, when metformin alone, with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control;
- in combination with a sulphonylurea, when the sulphonylurea alone, with diet and exercise, does not  provide  adequate  glycaemic  control  in  patients  for  whom  use  of  metformin  is  considered inappropriate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- in combination with a thiazolidinedione, when the thiazolidinedione alone with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use of a thiazolidinedione is considered appropriate.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Onglyza contains saxagliptin as active substance which is a highly potent, selective, reversible, and competitive  dipeptidyl  peptidase  4  (DPP4)  inhibitor.  DPP4  is  the  enzyme  responsible  for  the inactivation  of  the  incretin  hormones  glucagon-like  peptide-1  (GLP-1)  and  glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).

Incretin hormones are gastrointestinal hormones that increase insulin secretion in response to enteral stimulation.  In  humans,  incretins  such  as  GLP-1,  regulate  blood  glucose  via  multiple  mechanisms; these  include  stimulation  of  glucose-dependent  insulin  secretion,  delaying  of  gastric  emptying,  and inhibition of hepatic glucose production. However, incretins such as GLP-1 are rapidly inactivated by DPP4. Therefore, DPP4 inhibitors should extend the effects of incretins.

Onglyza  is  an  immediate  release,  film-coated  tablet.  Tablets  contain  5  mg  saxagliptin  and  are commercially supplied in Alu/Alu blister packaging.

## Active Substance

The INN name of the active substance is saxagliptin and the chemical name (IUPAC) (1 S ,3 S ,5 S )-2((2 S )-2-Amino-2-(3-hydroxyadamantan-1-yl)acetyl)-2-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-3-carbonitrile hydrate. Its molecular formula and weight are C18H25N3O2·H2O and 333.43 (315.41 anhydrous), respectively. The substance is soluble in water, and very soluble at low pH showing a minimum solubility of 17.6 mg/ml over  the  pH  range  1.2  to  8.7.  The  pKa  value  of  saxagliptin  was  determined  to  be  7.3.  The distribution coefficient octanol / water (Do/w) is at pH 7.0 is 0.607. It appears as a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic,  crystalline powder  that  exists as a  stable  monohydrate.  To  date,  only  one polymorphic form of saxagliptin (free base monohydrate) has been observed.

## · Manufacture

The  synthesis  is  performed  in  five  reactions  carried  out  as  three  steps  with  isolation  of  two intermediates.  Reproccessing  steps  have  been  laid  down  for  cases  when  they  are  required;  in  these steps  the  same  solvents  are  used  as  in  the  step  in  question  or  in  other  steps  of  the  synthesis.  The evolution from Process A to the intended Process D is characterized by changes in the use of reagents and/or  solvents  in  the  reaction,  work-up,  and  crystallization/isolation.  Process  C  and  D  can  be considered essentially equivalent and representative for the proposed synthesis route

The manufacturing process of the drug substance is thoroughly described and sufficient information is given on the syntheses of the starting materials.

A  Quality  by  Design  (QbD)  approach  has  been  utilized  during  development  of  the  manufacturing process.  The Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of the drug substance were defined and their impact on the product quality and the associated control strategies for these CQAs were presented.

Critical process parameters (CPP) and Key Process Parameters (KPP) were identified based on the risk  assessments  of  the  manufacturing  process.  Uni-  and  multivariate  experiments  were  utilized  to define the design space within the studied ranges.

Acceptable ranges for all process parameters have been established to ensure that the manufacturing process reproducibly meets the defined CQAs of the drug substance.  This was studied through a fivebatch campaign, conducted within the defined design space at scale at the commercial manufacturing site.

In  summary,  the  QbD  approach  to  the  manufacturing  process  for  saxagliptin  drug  substance  has provided  enhanced  process  knowledge  and  resulted  in  a  manufacturing  design  space  which  will consistently  deliver  high  quality  drug  substance.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  sufficently  under control.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Specification

The drug substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), colour (visual) identification (IR  or  Raman  and  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities/  degradants  (HPLC)  and  residual  solvents (methylene chloride (GC).

It has been shown that the stereochemical purity is maintained during manufacture and storage.

The levels of heavy metals and trace metals are found &lt; 20 ppm (ICP-MS) and for this reason no test or limit is included as part of specification. Finally, given the process chemistry, including aqueous extractions  as  well  as  a  wash  of  the  drug  substance  that  contains  water,  the  levels  of  inorganic materials are expected to be appreciably low. Also the results regarding residue on ignition are below the  generally  applied  limit  in  Ph.  Eur.  Monographs,  therefore  quality  control  of  the  drug  substance without a test and limit for sulphated ash and residue on ignition is considered acceptable.

Results for 9 batches manufactured by the commercial process D, at the proposed manufacturing site have been presented. The results of these batches can be considered as representative for evaluation of batch-to-batch consistency of the proposed manufacturing process.

In addition, results of 11 batches manufactured by the process C and manufactured at a different site which were provided are considered supportive, as the two processes are essentially equivalent.

## · Stability

A  stability  study  on  two  batches  manufactured  by  the  commercial  process,  Process  D  at  the commercial  site  covers  12  months  at  refrigerated  conditions  (5°C)  and  6  months  at  accelerated conditions(25°C/60%RH). For the Process D batches, a study without an outer container has also been started at the long-term condition (the data cover 12 months). The results were within specifications at the long-term condition.

Results  from  another  stability  study  for  three  batches  of  saxagliptin  manufactured  by  the  Phase  III process  at  a  former  site  have  been  provided  as  supportive  data.  The  data  cover  37  months  at refrigerated conditions and 12 months at accelerated conditions.

The differences between Process C and Process D are minor. After 12 months at long-term conditions and  6  months  at  accelerated  conditions  the  level  of  degradants  in    batches  manufactured  by  the commercial process is lower than or similar to the level seen in batches used to support the Phase III studies.

For  powder  X-ray  diffraction  no  change  from  initial  was  observed  for  any  batch.  The  sample stereochemistry remained the same and the drug substance form remained unchanged. All other tested parameters remained the same.

## Photostability study

Photostability  was  investigated  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q1B and it  was  shown that  saxagliptin is  not sensitive to light.

## Forced degradation studies

Forced degradation studies were performed with the drug substance in solution at several pH's. Based on the results a potential degradation pathway has been identified and submitted in the dossier.

Oxidative  studies  have  also  been  performed.  Some  other  degradation  products  than  the  already discussed have been encountered, which are not likely to be present, considering that they degrade further. Adequate, qualified limits are already present for contents of these oxidation degradants in the drug substance.

In conclusion the re-test period and the proposed packaging material are accepted.

## Medicinal Product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Pharmaceutical Development

Saxagliptin is prone to undergo an intra-molecular cyclisation reaction in solution and solid states to form a cyclic amidine. The tablet formulation was developed using active an active coating process to minimize this formation. Saxagliptin was embedded within a film coat of Opadry spray coated onto inert  core  tablets.  During  the  coating  process,  saxagliptin  free  base  is  converted  in-situ  into hydrochloride salt.

A specification limit for particle size of the drug substance is not relevant, considering that it is dissolved in a coating suspension during manufacturing of the drug product and is converted into the HCl salt.

There are no unusual excipients included. The selection of excipients was based upon the results of excipient compatibility studies to minimize the formation of the cyclic amidine.

During  formulation  development,  several  prototype  formulations  were  investigated  to  arrive  at  the commercial formulation.  Full excipient compatibility studies were performed.

Bridging studies for the various formulations used in phase I, II and III and the commercial one were presented and are considered acceptable from a chemical-pharmaceutical point of view.

Quality by Design concepts and a risk-based approach was employed in the manufacturing process development to identify the critical quality attributes (CQA) of the drug product. Proven acceptable ranges have been established for several of the unit processes at three specified scales.

The  risks  to  the  commercial  manufacturing  of  drug  product  and  the  factors  potentially  affecting manufacture were assessed during the development program to develop appropriate control strategies, and  assess  whether  any  factor  or  parameter  was  critical.  A  cause  and  effect  diagram  has  been developed. Based on all experiments an extensive list with the control strategy and proven acceptable ranges for production of the product has been submitted, which includes the intended operating ranges, in-process controls, etc. for all manufacturing steps. Multiple batches of drug product manufactured at each  scale  over  the  Proven  Acceptable  Ranges  met  all  CQAs  and  demonstrates  control  of  the manufacturing process.

A mechanistic model has been constructed which predicts the performance of the coating process, and has been shown to closely match the experimental data. The model captures the process knowledge and  relates  typical  operating  parameters  to  operating  conditions.  The  correspondence  of  the  model predictions with experimental values was demonstrated.

## · Adventitious Agents

Magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. The applicant has confirmed that lactose monohydrate is the only material of animal origin and that it is sourced from healthy animals in the same way as for human use complying with regulations to ensure patient safety.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process for Onglyza tablets involves active coating of saxagliptin onto an inert core tablet, followed by standard unit operations such film-coating and printing.  The manufacturing equipment and the process controls were adequately described.  Proven acceptable ranges (PAR) for each unit operation have been established.

The  process  validation  was  performed  in  a  conventional  manner,  according  to  the  NfG  on  process validation. At least three production batches were validated, and results were well within the criteria.

## · Product Specification

The specifications of the drug product include tests for description (visual), identification (HPLC, UV, only  at  release),  assay  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.Eur.  only  at  release),  impurities/ degradants  (HPLC),  dissolution  (Ph.Eur.  HPLC,  not  routinely),  microbial  limits  (Ph.  Eur.  only  at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

release).  Drug  dissolution  results  have  been  presented  for  six  commercial  scale  batches  of  drug product. All batches display fast dissolution: 86 % or more after 10 minutes. Moreover, saxagliptin can  be  classified  as  a  BCS  Class  III  (high  solubility,  low  permeability)  compound  meaning  the absorption rate is the rate limiting step in vivo. It is therefore justified not to test dissolution routinely. Instead, dissolution will be tested in the 10 first commercial batches and thereafter one batch per year. The periodical dissolution test is included in the product specification.

Batch  analysis  results  have  been  provided  for  eleven  batches  of  5 mg  tablets  from  the  proposed manufacturing site.

Also five 5 mg batches from another site have been submitted as supportive data. All results were well within specification.

## · Stability of the Product

Stability  data  were  presented  for  three  batches.  The  tablets  were  made  from  drug  substance manufactured  by  Process  C.  The  data  cover  24  months  at  25°C/60%RH,  30°C/65%RH  and 30°C/75%RH, and 6 months at 40°C/75%RH. The tablets were stable at all storage conditions tested, and statistical analysis was performed to support extrapolation of the data.

A matrix approach was applied to the long term conditions and the study was conducted as per ICH guidelines. For one batch the hold time of active suspension was the maximum proposed. The results for these batches were not significantly different from the results from the other batches.

Microbial quality  was  tested  initially  on  tablets  in  HDPE  bottles  and  on  samples  stored  at  the  two 30°C storage conditions for tablets in PVC/Aclar blister packs, which was regarded as worst case in water and oxygen permeation. No change from initial was observed.

At 25°C/60%RH no significant change in assay or dissolution was seen after 24 months.  The level of total  degradation products increased after 24 months at 25°C/60%RH but the level was well within specifications.  At  40°C/75%RH  the  level  of  total  impurities  increased  more  compared  to  normal condition as expected.

For photo-stability studies in accordance  with ICH Q1B, no change was observed for directly exposed tablets in any parameter tested.

In conclusion the proposed shelf life and storage conditions are acceptable.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  quality  of  Onglyza  film-coated  tablet  is  adequately  established.  Information  on  development, manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The quality of the active substance is considered sufficiently described and adequately supported by data. Sufficient  chemical  and  pharmaceutical  documentation  relating  to  development,  manufacture  and control of the drug product including Quality by Design principles has been presented. The results of tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

Stability tests under ICH guidelines conditions indicate that the product is chemically stable for the proposed shelf life and storage conditions.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The  non-clinical  profile  of  saxagliptin  was  established  in  a  comprehensive  investigational  program that included studies of in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics  and  metabolism,  and  toxicity  and  toxicokinetics.  The  non-clinical  data  from saxagliptin  were  also  compared  (where  possible  and  appropriate)  to  currently  available  DPP4 inhibitors  (vildagliptin  [Galvus®]  and sitagliptin  [Januvia®])  developed  for the  treatment  of  type  2 diabetes mellitus.

All  pivotal  toxicity  studies  supporting  the  safety  of  saxagliptin  were  designed  and  conducted  in compliance with ICH guidelines. Pivotal safety pharmacology and toxicology studies were performed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in  compliance with GLP regulations. Non-pivotal and investigational studies were non-GLP; this is considered acceptable.

## Pharmacology

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

Saxagliptin is a selective DPP4 inhibitor which results in increased concentration of plasma GLP-1, which subsequently leads to lower plasma glucose levels. The in vitro affinity for the DPP4 enzyme has been shown and maximal enzyme inhibition measured ex vivo in plasma is evident at low doses. The affinity for other DPPs is lower with a ratio of 75 for DPP9 and 391 for DPP8. In vivo efficacy has been demonstrated in SD and Zucker rats, and Zucker fa/fa rats, a model for type 2 diabetes by several pharmacodynamic  endpoints: plasma GLP-1,  insulin and glucose levels post-glucose challenge,  and fasting  glucose levels.  Although  all  endpoints  were affected  by  treatment,  long-term efficacy has not been demonstrated in an animal model.

The  main  metabolite,  BMS-510849,  also  has  high  affinity  for  the  DPP4  enzyme,  but  shows  less pharmacodynamic effect in terms of lowering glucose levels than the parent compound. Only at doses in  excess  of  those  required  to  produce  maximal  DPP4  inhibition,  a  significant in  vivo effect  was shown. This might be due to the decreased volume of distribution of the metabolite as compared to the parent. The contribution of the metabolite to the overall efficacy of saxagliptin is probably modest.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

Saxagliptin  was  evaluated in  vitro for  the  potential  to  antagonize  the  binding  of  appropriate radioligands to 42 receptors and ion-channels or to inhibit 14 different proteases. No significant effects were observed (&lt;25% inhibition at 10 µM) on the receptors, ion-channels, or enzymes evaluated. Cell surface  DPP4  (also  known  as  CD26)  has  been  reported  to  function  as  a  co-stimulatory  signalling molecule  in  T  lymphocyte  activation.  Inhibition  of  T-lymphocytes  was  shown  at  much  higher concentrations  of  saxagliptin  than  is  needed  for  DDP4  inhibition.  Moreover,  these  concentrations exceed the Cmax that is measured in humans after therapeutic doses. However, due to the large volume of  distribution  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  the  concentration  required  to  inhibit  T  cell  activation  is reached within the T cells. No other secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

No  significant  findings  were  reported  from  safety  pharmacology  studies,  and  therefore  no  adverse effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system are anticipated in humans.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Drug  interaction  studies  were  not  conducted  in  non-clinical  animal  models.  This  is  acceptable, considering that the issue has been adequately addressed with the clinical data.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  of  saxagliptin  and  BMS-510849  the  active  metabolite,  have  been  studied adequately. Plasma samples collected from mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and monkey were analysed with a validated LC/MS/MS method. For BMS-510849, this validated method was found to have co-eluting peaks of other mono-hydroxylated metabolites of saxagliptin with the same mass spectral characteristics.  Subsequently,  a  new  bioanalytical  assay  was  developed  and  validated  for  both saxagliptin and BMS-510849 in plasma from mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and monkey. Both the original and  the  new  validated  analytical  procedures  used  are  sensitive,  accurate  and  precise  for  the measurement  of  saxagliptin.  Only  the  new  method  is  sensitive,  accurate  and  precise  for  the measurement of BMS-510849. Comparison of both methods showed an overestimation of the plasma concentrations of BMS-510849 by the original assay (up to 42.7%).

Bioavailability following oral administration of saxagliptin was determined to be 75% in rat, 76% in dog and 51% in monkey. Saxagliptin exhibits a high volume of distribution at steady state in rat, dog and monkey (1.3-5.2 l/kg). Saxagliptin is cleared rapidly in rats (115 ml/min/kg) and at a moderate rate  in  dogs  (9.3  ml/min/kg)  and  monkeys  (14.5  ml/min/kg).  The  elimination  half-life  estimates  of saxagliptin are comparable for rat, dog and monkey (2.1-4.4 hr). When considering the toxicokinetic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

studies the AUC increase is linear with doses between 30 and 600 mg/kg for mouse, between 2 and 600 mg/kg for rat, between 0.2 and 25 mg/kg for dog, and for all doses investigated for monkey. No substantial  accumulation  of  saxagliptin  and  BMS-510849  was  observed  after  once-daily  repeated dosing of saxagliptin.

The intrinsic membrane permeability of saxagliptin is very low. Both saxagliptin and BMS-510849 were not prominent substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or for cellular uptake transporters. Protein binding of saxagliptin was not observed in dog and human, and low in mouse (27%), rat (18%) and monkey (20%). Protein binding of BMS-510849 was also very low in all species tested (up to 10%).

The  highest  concentrations  (1-12  h)  of  saxagliptin  related  material  were  found  in  gastrointestinal tissues, liver, urinary bladder and kidney. Since radioactivity was below 1% of the dose at 24 h postdose,  accumulation  is  not  expected.  Saxagliptin  and  BMS-510849  levels  were  lowest  in  the  brain. After  oral  dosing,  concentrations  in  whole blood  were  lower than  in  plasma  (blood to  plasma  ratio 0.71-0.88).  However,  12  hours  post-dose,  mean  concentrations  in  whole  blood  exceeded  those  in plasma (blood to plasma ratio 1.55), indicating binding of radioactive material to erythrocytes at later times.  Saxagliptin-derived  radioactivity  was  widely  distributed  in  both  maternal  and  foetal  tissues. This demonstrates that saxagliptin-derived components cross the placenta in rats; therefore, Onglyza should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.

The pathways for in vivo metabolism of saxagliptin in humans were qualitatively similar to those in mice,  rats,  dogs,  and  cynomolgus  monkeys.  BMS-510849  was  the  major  metabolite  identified  in plasma,  urine  and/or  faeces  in  all  species.  The  metabolic  profiles  from in  vitro studies  in  liver microsomes and hepatocytes from various species were also similar. A large difference is observed in the  number  of  metabolites  between in  vivo and in  vitro metabolism.  In  the in  vivo studies  46 metabolites were detected, while 3-6 metabolites were observed in in vitro studies. Co-administration with ketoconazole and diltiazem, CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, resulted in a 2.5 and 2.1 fold increase of the AUC of saxagliptin. No animal studies have been conducted on the effects of CYP3A4 inducers on the exposure of saxagliptin.

Following an oral dose of [ 14 C] saxagliptin, almost all the radioactivity administered was recovered in the  urine  and  faeces  of  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys.  Approximately  75%  of  the  dose  in  human  was excreted in the urine. In humans, saxagliptin and BMS-510849 accounted for 33.6% and 28.2% of the dose  in  urine  suggesting  that  both  elimination  of  unchanged  saxagliptin  and  metabolism  to  BMS510849 plays a major role in the disposition of saxagliptin. [ 14 C] saxagliptin-derived radioactivity was excreted in milk, with radioactivity detected at all time points through 24 hours post-dose; in view of this a decision must be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or therapy taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy to the woman (see section 4.6 of the SPC).

Interactions with other drugs via protein binding are not expected, since saxagliptin and BMS-510849 are  poorly  bound  to  plasma  proteins.  Saxagliptin  is  unlikely  to  cause  clinically  relevant  drug-drug interactions through either inhibition or induction of the major CYP isozymes.

As  a  consequence  of  toxic  effects  related  to  cyanide  release  seen  in  male  rats,  a  series  of in  vitro experiments were conducted to measure the cyanide released during biotransformation of saxagliptin and BMS-510849. Results from these experiments showed that cyanide formation was most abundant in  the  incubations  of  saxagliptin  with  expressed  rat  CYP2C11.  A  study  on  rats  pre-treated  with cimetidine,  a  known  CYP2C11  inhibitor,  was  performed.  Cimetidine  inhibited,  but  did  not  block entirely,  the  CYP2C11-mediated  metabolism  of  saxagliptin  to  M4  in  male  rats.  Cyanide  formation from saxagliptin was observed in the liver microsomes from male rat, and small amounts in male and female  monkeys,  but  not  from  female  rat,  mouse,  dog  and  human.  De-cyanated  metabolites  were detected in the brains of both male and female rats, but significantly lower in female than male rat brains. Small amounts of cyanide were detected in incubations of saxagliptin with CYPs -2C8, -2C19, and  -2C21.  In  humans,  the  gene  encoding  CYP2C19  shows  polymorphism,  and  as  a  consequence, individuals can be categorised as poor or extensive metabolisers (EM). The cDNA used in the in vitro

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

experiments corresponded to extensive metabolisers. Additionally, the main proportion of CYP2C19 enzymes in the pooled human liver  microsomes comes from EM. The applicant has calculated the blood cyanide concentration in the unlikely event of complete release of cyanide from saxagliptin in humans, with a resulting cyanide blood level sufficiently below that considered to elicit clinical signs and  symptoms.  Bearing  in  mind  the  low  level  of  metabolization  involving  CYP2C19  enzymes,  it seems  unlikely  that  metabolization  of  saxagliptin  by  CYP2C19  EM  could  cause  any  significant toxicological effects.

## Toxicology

## · Single dose toxicity

All  but  one  single  dose  toxicity  study  (DN01106)  were  conducted  in  compliance  with  GLP. Saxagliptin was administered orally in mice, rats and monkeys as benzoate salt in 1.25% Avicel, and the control groups received equivalent volumes of 1.25% Avicel. All animals were monitored for two weeks after dosing. Main evaluations included mortality/moribund conditions, changes in behaviour and appearance. Gross examination at necropsy was performed on selected dose groups in the GLP studies. Saxagliptin-related toxicity and mortality was observed in mice, rats and monkeys. In mice and  rats  saxagliptin  was  well  tolerated  up  to  2000  mg/kg,  while  overt  toxicity  leading  to  death occurred in monkeys at 50 mg/kg (monkey NOEL 25 mg/kg).

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

The repeat dose toxicity of saxagliptin was evaluated in mice, rats, dogs and cynomolgus monkeys at exposures  comparable  to  or  markedly  higher  than  the  therapeutic  exposure  in  a  number  of  GLPcompliant non-clinical toxicology studies. In rats, the observed target organ changes were generally minimal splenic lymphoid hyperplasia, pulmonary histiocytosis, and mononuclear-cell infiltrates/inflammation  in  the  ocular  accessory  gland  and  liver  in  short  and  long-term  studies,  and after 104 weeks of dosing, the lung, urinary bladder, and epididymis, but only at high doses.

Dose- and time-related skin lesions have been observed in monkeys, with low margins of safety. The mechanism  for  these  lesions  is  not  known.  Skin  lesions  have  been  considered  as  a  potential  class related effect of DPP4 inhibitors, and were also seen after vildagliptin treatment. However, no skin lesions  have  been  observed  with  sitagliptin.  The  clinical  relevance  of  these  lesions  is  not  known. Existing clinical data have not revealed skin lesions in humans following up to two years treatment of saxagliptin.  However,  in  view  of  the  limited  number  of  patients  with  long-term  treatment  with saxagliptin,  and  most  importantly  the  limited  experience  in  patients  with  diabetic  complications including peripheral artery disease and ulcer formations,  a clinical relevance cannot be dismissed.

Saxagliptin-related  reduction  in  plasma  lymphocyte  levels  has  been  reported  in  clinical  studies,  but were not observed in non-clinical studies. In the non-clinical dossier, saxagliptin-related effects were seen on several immune-related organs, including thymus (mouse, rat, dog: decreased organ weight, multifocal  atrophy,  lymphoid  depletion  and  necrosis),  spleen  (mouse,  rat,  monkey:  increased  organ weight,  lymphoid  hyperplasia),  mesenteric  and/or  mandibular  lymph  nodes  (rat,  monkey:  lymphoid hyperplasia,  dog:  lymphoid  depletion/necrosis)  and  bone  marrow  (monkey:  hyperplasia),  with  low margins  of  safety.  Furthermore,  mononuclear  cell  infiltrates  are  seen  in  several  species.  While  the infiltrates only were observed in liver and footpads in dogs, the infiltrates were apparent in multiple organs  in  mice  and  in  numerous  rat  studies  (including  ocular  accessory  gland,  liver,  lung  and genitourinary  tract).  The  infiltrates  were  most  extensive  in  monkeys  (including  skin,  salivary, mammary and thyroid glands, pancreas, reproductive organs, brain, kidney, and urinary bladder), and with  a  NOAEL  of  0.3  mg/kg/day  (1  and  3  times  the  human  exposure  for  females  and  males respectively).

Several  potential  explanations  for  the  multiple  immune-related  effects  have  been  proposed  by  the applicant, including stress, excessive pharmacological effects, and non-DPP4 related mechanisms. At present, the mechanism(s) is unknown, and a clinical relevance can not be excluded.

Transient  hind  leg  lameness,  tremor  and  laboured  respiration  were  observed  in  several  monkey studies, following single and repeated dosings. Due to the transient nature of these findings, they are unlikely to be drug-related.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With regard to glomerulopathy, no such effect was observed in the pivotal repeat-dose study where monkeys were dosed with up to 3 mg/kg day for 3 months. Therefore, a sufficient safety margin (21) exists, and a risk for human safety is unlikely. Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the  mechanism  for  induction  of  brain  lesion  in  male  rats.  However,  these  lesions  have  only  been observed in a single range finding study, at doses with an exposure multiple of &gt;2600-fold the human exposure. Nevertheless, the investigational studies indicate that this finding is male rat specific, and is due to the release of cyanide by CYP2C11.

## · Genotoxicity

Saxagliptin did not show mutagenicity (Ames test) and clastogenicity below cytotoxic concentrations (human lymphocytes). No genotoxic potential was demonstrated in  vivo by  saxagliptin  in  the  DNA repair, oral micronucleus, or in vivo/in vitro cytogenetics assays in rats.

Impurities BMS-537679 and BMS-554083 have been adequately qualified, and no concern regarding genotoxicity or other toxicity remains.

## · Carcinogenicity

The carcinogenic potential of saxagliptin was evaluated in 104-week oral carcinogenicity studies in CD-1 mice and Harlan SD rats. These rodent strains were selected based on the relevant historical control  tumor  databases  for  these  strains  at  the  facility  that  conducted  the  studies  and  their  use  in previous  toxicity  studies  with  saxagliptin.  Doses  were  selected  based  on  3-month  range-finding studies. These studies were adequately designed, included measurements of systemic exposure, and were conducted in conformance with ICH guidelines and in compliance with GLP regulations. With respect to tumor analysis, appropriate statistical analyses (i.e. 1-sided Peto-Pike trend tests, sensitive to tumor rates that increase with dose) were utilized.

In both two-year carcinogenicity studies, there were no treatment-related increases in tumor incidence in  any  organ at all  tested doses. CNS-related neurodegenerative brain lesions were seen in rats and were the likely cause of increased mortality in the 300 mg/kg/day male group. This CNS toxicity is not considered  relevant  for  it  is  only  shown  at  high  doses.  In  the  repeat-dose  studies  it  was  seen  that rodents are less sensitive to saxagliptin than other species.. However, the studies are in line with the guidelines and no further studies regarding carcinogenicity are considered necessary.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

A complete battery of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies was conducted with saxagliptin to assess potential effects on fertility, reproductive performance, gestation, parturition, and lactation of the  parental  generation  in  rats;  on  embryonic  and  foetal  development  in  rats  and  rabbits;  and  on growth, development, and reproductive performance of progeny in rats. Range-finding embryo-foetal development studies in pregnant rats and rabbits and 2-week and 3-month oral toxicity studies in nonpregnant  rats  were  used  to  assist  in  the  dose  selection  for  subsequent  pivotal  reproductive  toxicity studies.  Systemic  exposure  data  were  collected  in  supporting  toxicokinetic  studies  (fertility  and embryo foetal development) or within the primary study (peri- and postnatal development). All pivotal studies were conducted in compliance with GLP regulations, were adequately designed, and met the ICH guidelines.

In the fertility and early embryonic development studies effects on fertility were only seen at doses far in excess of the recommended human dose. It is therefore unlikely that saxagliptin will have an effect on human male or female fertility at therapeutic doses.

The embryo-foetal development studies in rats showed only minor effects on ossification of the pubes at the mid-dose, which is far in excess of the human recommended dose. These effects are likely to be treatment-related,  since  no  maternal  toxicity  was  evident  at  the  mid-dose.  The  high  dose  was sufficiently  high  enough  to  induce  maternal  toxicity.  Likewise,  in  rabbits,  only  minor  effects  were observed.  Four  foetuses  of  one  litter  in  the  high  dose  had  an  absent  gall  bladder.  This  could  be  a treatment-related  effect,  but  due  to  the  high  safety  margin  of  158  it  is  unlikely  to  be  of  clinical relevance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The prenatal and postnatal development studies (including maternal function) showed that at all doses fertility  rates  of  the  F1  generation  (no.  pregnant/no.  mated)  were  reduced  (68%  at  low  dose  versus 84% in controls). However, this reduction was not dose dependent and within historical control range and is therefore not likely to be treatment-related.

A reduction in epididymis and testes weight was seen in the F1 generation in the high dose group. Due to the high safety margin (3870) for this effect and the absence of any other related effects, this is unlikely to be of human concern .

No  studies  in  which  juvenile  animals  were  performed.  This  is  acceptable  as  Onglyza  is  not recommended for use in children and adolescents.

## · Local tolerance

The applicant has provided dermal and ocular irritation tests. Saxagliptin produced no ocular irritation to  isolated  bovine  corneas  and  non  dermal  irritation  to  rabbit  skin.  In  the  local  lymph  node  assay, saxagliptin was considered a skin sensitizer, able to induce allergic contact dermatitis. The applicant proposes  that  this  mechanism  is  not  relevant  for  the  skin  lesion  observed  in  cynomolgus  monkeys, since these are not consistent with allergic contact dermatitis. Because it is unlikely that the observed skin  lesions  are  due  to  direct  contact  with  saxagliptin,  it  is  agreed  that  the  positive  result  for saxagliptin  as  a  skin  sensitizer  is  not  a  plausible  explanation  for  the  skin  lesion  in  cynomolgus monkeys.  Therefore,  potential  skin  sensitization  properties  of  saxagliptin  are  not  relevant  for  the intended population.

## · Other toxicity studies

## Immunotoxicity

The applicant states that no changes in T-cell-dependent humoral response could be detected at any dose level. However, in male rats, the mean antibody titres were 2356, 3552, 1162 and 1045 for the control,  10,  50,  and  200  mg/kg/day  groups  respectively.  These  figures  suggest  that  a  decreased response is evident from 50 mg/kg/day. As the variation between the animals in one dose group is very large no conclusions can be drawn from this experiment. Although the positive control is significantly reduced,  a  more  than  50%  reduction  in  mean  antibody  titre  does  not  reach  significance  due  to individual variation.

Similarly, a substantial decrease in CD45RA cells (B cells), is seen in males and females at all doses (except  males  at  200  mg/kg/day).  These  decreases  are  also  not  significant  due  to  large  intra-group variation and no conclusions can be drawn with regard to these values.

Other findings in the 1-month study in rats were decreases in mean platelet counts in the high and middose males and high-dose females, and leukopenia in one female in the high dose group. Although all these findings either lack statistical significance, or reflect minor changes, or are evident in individual animals, taken together they are suggestive of a potential for immunotoxicity of saxagliptin.

To conclude, due to large within-group variations, no definite conclusions can be drawn regarding the immunotoxicity of saxagliptin in rats.

## Studies on impurities

Qualifying  studies  have  been  performed  for  the  process-related  impurities  BMS-537679  and  BMS554083.  In  addition,  studies  have  been  performed  with  BMS-481146  and  BMS-590102,  potential impurities below LLOQ under current manufacturing processes.

The  intended  maximum  human  intake  of  saxagliptin  is  5  mg/day.  According  to  ICHQ3A  and ICHQ3B, qualification limits for impurities in the drug substance and the drug product is 0.15% and 0.5%, respectively. While the proposed specification limits for three impurities (BMS-481146, BMS590102 and BMS-554083) all are below the qualification limits, the proposed specifications for BMS537679 in the product at release (0.2%) and at end of shelf life (0.1%) are above the qualification limit. Further, BMS-537679 has a structure-based alert for mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, and has therefore been extensively studied.

The  submitted  qualifying  studies  for  BMS-537679  are  in  accordance  with  current  regulations. Although structure-based alert for mutagenicity and carcinogenicity has been identified, BMS-537679 was considered non-genotoxic in the Ames test and a chromosomal aberration test in vitro and in a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

bone  marrow  micronucleus  test in  vivo .  Furthermore,  no  differences  in  toxicity  were  identified between saxagliptin and saxagliptin spiked with BMS-537679 in a three month repeat dose toxicity study. Based on these studies, BMS 537679 is considered qualified up to a level of 1.36%.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

A  phase  II  environmental  risk  assessment  was  conducted  for  saxagliptin  as  the  trigger  value  was exceeded. Saxagliptin is neither persistent, bioaccumulating or toxic (PBT) nor very persistent, very bioaccumulating (vPvB). Risk to the surface water, groundwater, soil, sediment and sewage treatment plant is acceptable.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The Clinical Pharmacology program consisted of 24 studies in 673 subjects, 620 of who were dosed with  saxagliptin  (see  table  below).  Ascending  dose  studies,  biopharmaceutical  studies,  a  thorough corrected QT interval (QTc) study, and studies to investigate various clinical findings were conducted. Drug-drug  interactions  with  saxagliptin  and  other  antihyperglycaemic  agents,  drug  metabolizing enzyme  inhibitors  and  probe  drugs,  as  well  as  with  other  drugs  commonly  used  in  this  patient population  were  evaluated.  The  pharmacokinetics  of  saxagliptin  was  assessed  in  relation  to  age, gender,  hepatic impairment,  and  renal  impairment,  and  several  studies  have  investigated  the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin delivered in various formulations. In addition, a population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed.

* These studies utilized a prototype film coated formulation ( early clinical tablet )

** Clinical tablets are an optimized film coated tablet formulation (in 3 strengths: 2.5, 5, and 10 mg) differing from the early clinical tablet in the amount and color of coating material used. The tablets proposed for marketing are not different from the clinical tablets except in color and imprinting.

In the Phase 3 program, saxagliptin doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg administered once daily were evaluated to  fully  characterize  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  benefit/risk  profile  of  saxagliptin  within  the  doseresponse range established in Phase 2. In addition, the potential usefulness of titration of saxagliptin as monotherapy,  using  a  starting  dose  of  2.5  mg,  was  examined.  The  rationale  for  selecting  the  dose range and  dosing  interval for Phase  3  was  based  on  an  integrated  assessment of efficacy, pharmacodynamic, and safety data generated from subjects exposed to saxagliptin in Phase 1 and 2b studies.

The Phase 2b and Phase 3 worldwide clinical development program in T2DM included 8 studies in which  4607  subjects  were  randomized  and  treated.  Of  these,  3356  subjects  received  double-blind saxagliptin; an additional 66 subjects received open-label saxagliptin 10 mg in Study CV181011. A total  of  1459  subjects  received  saxagliptin  for  more  than  48  weeks,  including  344  who  received saxagliptin 10 mg, twice the recommended usual clinical dose. The 8 Phase 2b/3 studies included one 12-week Phase 2b dose-finding study (CV181008), one 12-week Phase 3 mechanism of action study (CV181041), and 6 Phase 3 studies with final data from the 24-week short-term treatment period. In the  6  Phase  3  studies  (referred  to  as  the  Core  Phase  3  studies),  4148  subjects  with  T2DM  were randomized and received study drug, 3021 of who were treated with saxagliptin. All controlled studies in subjects with T2DM used a randomized, double blind design. Interim long-term data from the Phase 3 studies are also included in the submission.

Topline results from study D1680C0002 comparing saxagliptin+metformin with sitagliptin+metformin were submitted. These preliminary data are suggestive that saxagliptin is noninferior to sitagliptin. However, a definitive assessment is only possible after submission of the full study report, which will be submitted as a post-authorisation follow-up measure.

Formal scientific  advice  (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/110905/2007) regarding pharmacokinetics has been given by CHMP.

There is no paediatric development program.

## GCP

The CHMP requested a GCP inspection of the clinical study CV181-013. Two investigator sites were inspected in this routine GCP inspection. Although there was one critical finding the Inspectors did not find evidence that the deficiencies found had impact on the overall validity and credibility of the data reported in this clinical trial and therefore deemed the inspected clinical trial as valid for use in the assessment of the marketing authorisation application for Onglyza.

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin has been investigated in 30 PK studies with 497 subjects exposed to saxagliptin doses up to 400 mg.  Studies designed to explore drug-drug interactions, the effect of food, or pharmacokinetics in special populations conducted during the Phase 3 program applied the dose of 10 mg, as this dose represents the highest dose that could potentially be commercialized. Two drug-drug  interaction  studies  (metformin  and  ketoconazole)  conducted  early  in  the  saxagliptin development program utilized saxagliptin doses of 100 mg as this dose was the highest dose being studied  in  the  Phase  2b  program  and  represented  the  highest  dose  that  could  potentially  be commercialized at that time.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Various laboratories and several versions of the analytical method (LC-MS) have been applied for the determination  of  saxagliptin  and  BMS-510849.  The  methods  were  not  cross-validated  between  the involved  laboratories.  Two  (for  plasma  analyses)  and  three  laboratories  (for  urine  analyses),  and different versions of an LC-MS/MS method were involved at different stages during the study periods. The comparability of the analyses from the two methods (discriminating and non-discriminating) in the involved laboratories are considered justified.

## Drug formulation

For the initial clinical studies (up to the end of Phase 2b), drug substance in the benzoate salt form (designated  as  BMS  477118-08)  (tablets  and  capsules)  was  employed.  Subsequently,  the  free  base monohydrate (designated as BMS 477118-11) was selected for further development.

The applicant has utilized the following formulations in the clinical pharmacology studies: capsule, 'early clinical tablet', an adjusted 'clinical tablet' formulation, and an oral solution.

In order to provide a link between the various formulations, four relative bioavailability studies were conducted. Results from these studies indicate bioequivalence of the different formulations used.

Since the formulation of the tablet used in Phase 3 studies differs only in colour and imprinting from the  proposed  market  formulation,  no  pivotal  bioequivalence  studies  have  been  conducted.  This  is acceptable.  Therefore,  based  on  similarity  in  systemic  exposure,  saxagliptin  administered  with  the commercially proposed formulation is expected to demonstrate similar safety, efficacy and tolerability profiles to that seen with equivalent doses of the capsule and (early) clinical tablet formulations.

- Absorption

The aqueous solubility of saxagliptin in the proposed clinical dose (5 mg) is relatively high across a broad range of pH values ( ≥ 16.9 mg/mL for pH 0.7-8.7).

Oral absorption of saxagliptin in humans is high ( ≥ 75%) as demonstrated in a mass balance study using  50mg  [ 14 C]-saxagliptin  (CV181004).  Absorption  is  not  affected  by  alterations  in  gastric  pH (CV181035) and is  not  affected  by  food  (CV181034) , since co-administration  of  saxagliptin  with Maalox Max®, omeprazole, famotidine or a high fat breakfast did not affect the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin.

## Bioavailability

The applicant did not conduct an absolute bioavailability study. However, since the bioavailability is at  least  75%  (CV181004),  and  since  the  oral  pharmacokinetics  and  mass-balance  studies  have satisfactorily  characterized the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin following oral administration, this is acceptable.

## Influence of food

Food  had  relatively  modest  effects  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  saxagliptin  in  healthy  subjects. Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in no change in saxagliptin Cmax and a 27% increase in AUC compared with the fasted state. Therefore, saxagliptin may be administered with or without food.

- Distribution

Saxagliptin and its major metabolite BMS-510849 do not bind to plasma proteins in in vitro serum, which has also been confirmed by the mass balance study that also suggests that saxagliptin and its related compounds are not retained in the body to a substantial extent.

Population PK analyses suggest that the apparent volume of distribution of saxagliptin is much higher than that of BMS-510849.

## · Elimination

## Metabolism

The biotransformation of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). BMS-510849  is  saxagliptin's  major  metabolite.  BMS-510849  is  pharmacologically  active  (also  a selective,  reversible,  competitive  DPP-4  inhibitor).  However,  the  contribution  of  BMS-510849 metabolite to glucose lowering effect is unclear. The applicant defines active moiety based on plasma exposure and difference in DPP-4 inhibition potency in vitro (sum of saxagliptin AUC and 50% of the active metabolite AUC).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Applicant discussed the contribution of BMS-510849 to the glucose-lowering effect of saxagliptin in vivo in humans based on a saxagliptin-rifampicin drug-drug interaction study (CV181059) and an in vivo study in rats (Study 930008283). Study CV181059 suggests that BMS-510849 plays a significant role  in  plasma  DPP4  inhibition  in  humans,  where  exposures  to  BMS-510849  are  relatively  high compared to parent drug. The rat study suggested that although the effect on plasma DPP was similar for parent and metabolite, approximate equimolar systemic exposures of saxagliptin and BMS-510849 resulted  in  between  5-  and  20-fold  lower  glucose-lowering  activity  for  BMS-510849  compared  to parent. This is postulated to be due to differences in distribution of parent and metabolite, resulting in much lower metabolite exposure at site of action. In conclusion, the studies show that BMS-510849 contributes  to the  glucose-lowering  effect  of  saxagliptin;  however,  as  stated  above,  it  is  difficult  to elaborate  the  precise  contribution  of  the  parent  compound  compared  to  the  main  metabolite  to  the overall efficacy/safety of saxagliptin.

## Excretion

Renal excretion is an important route of clearance for saxagliptin with a total radioactivity of 75%, being recovered in urine within 24 hours (saxagliptin and BMS-510849 accounted for 24 and 36% of the radio-activity, respectively). In addition, 22% of the radioactivity was recovered in faeces mainly as  oxidative  metabolites  with  only  trace  amounts  of  parent  saxagliptin  detected  (~0.5  %  of  dose) (CV181004). The majority of total radioactivity (85.3%) was excreted in urine or faeces within 24h of dosing (0-24 h urinary [71.4%] and faecal recovery [13.9%]).

Following a single oral dose of 5 mg saxagliptin in the fasted state the mean terminal half-life values for saxagliptin and BMS-510849 were 2.5 and 3.1 h, respectively (CV181037).

Renal elimination for saxagliptin occurs via a combination of glomerular filtration and active renal secretion, whereas BMS-510849 appears to be only filtered. Saxagliptin is not a substrate for organic anion  transporter-1  (OAT1),  OAT3,  organic  anion  transporting  polypeptide-A  (OATPA),  OATPC, OATP8, organic cation transporter-1  (OCT-1),  OCT-2,  sodium  taurocholate  co-transporting  peptide (NTCP), and peptide transporters (PepT1 and PepT2).

## Inter-conversion

Inter-conversion has not been assessed as all centres have the S configuration.

## Pharmacokinetics of metabolites

The systemic exposure to BMS-510849 is about 3.3-times higher than the systemic exposure to parent saxagliptin (CV181002). The systemic exposure to saxagliptin related compounds was almost entirely (mean 97.8%) due to parent saxagliptin (mean 21.8%) and BMS-510849 plus other unidentified minor monohydroxylated metabolites (mean 76.0%). The renal clearance of BMS-510849  (51 to 103 mL/min)  was  similar  to  or  less  than  the  estimated  creatinine  clearance,  suggesting  glomerular filtration. No appreciable accumulation was observed for either saxagliptin or BMS-510849 at any of the doses investigated following up to 2 weeks of QD dosing (CV181002; CV181010).

## Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism

Given the metabolic profile of saxagliptin, genetic polymorphisms are not expected to be of relevance to saxagliptin PK.

- Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Saxagliptin  exhibits  dose  proportional  pharmacokinetics  in  dose  ranges  up  to  50  mg.  There  is  no evidence for non-linear pharmacokinetics.

There was no clinically significant accumulation observed and there was no evidence of saxagliptin inducing or inhibiting its own metabolism following once daily dosing of 40 to 400 mg for 14 days. Saxagliptin does not exhibit time dependent PK.

## Intra- and inter-individual variability

According to the Applicant saxagliptin pharmacokinetics displays moderate intra- and inter-individual variability in healthy volunteer populations, although no formal evaluation in the form of a replicatedesign study of within-subject variability has been performed. The observed inter- and intra-individual variability is however not expected to be of clinical relevance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Special populations

## Impaired renal function

In mild renal impairment, saxagliptin's AUC(INF) values were less than 2-fold higher than the mean values in subjects with normal renal function. Therefore, no dose adjustment has been recommended for patients with mild renal impairment.

The mean AUC (INF) values for BMS-510849 were however ~3-fold higher in subjects with moderate renal impairment than in subjects with normal renal function. The applicant initially proposed a dose of 2.5 mg in subjects with moderate renal impairment. Based on the efficacy, safety and PK-data, the proposed dose reduction to 2.5 mg saxagliptin in patients with moderate renal impairment, might seem reasonable.  The  modelling  and  simulation  analysis  showed  that  patients  with  moderate  renal impairment  dosed  with  2.5  mg  saxagliptin  have  BMS-510849  and  total  active  moieties  within  the exposures expected and observed in patients with normal renal function/mild renal impairment dosed with 10 mg saxagliptin in the pivotal monotherapy study (CV181011).

However,  the  importance  of  renal  excretion  of  saxagliptin  and  its  metabolites,  the  target  disease population and the limited number of subjects with moderate renal impairment, must also be taken into account. An ongoing study on saxagliptin in subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment will provide  more  data  in  this  patient  group.  It  was  therefore  considered  unjustified  to  put  this  patient group  at  unnecessary  risk  and  recommend  use  in  such  subjects,  before  results  from  this  study  are known; in particular as other treatment options are also available for use in diabetic patients with renal impairment.  Therefore,  at  this  moment,  saxagliptin  is  not  recommended  in  patients  with  moderate renal impairment, and this is reflected in the SPC sections 4.2 and 4.4.

The  applicant  proposed  similar  dose  recommendations  for  severe  renal  impairment;  the  AUC(INF) values  in  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment  are  1.6  fold  higher  than  in  subjects  with  moderate renal impairment (4.5 folds versus 2.9 fold higher exposure). In patients with creatinine clearance at the lower end of severe renal impairment and not on dialysis (CLcr about 10-15 ml/min) exposure of BMS-510849 is probably substantially higher than that observed in the severe renal impairment group. In  these  patients  exposure  after  administration  of  a  proposed  daily  dose  2.5  mg  will  exceed  the exposure  obtained  at  10  mg  in  patients  with  normal  renal  function.  Furthermore,  the  exposure  to saxagliptin  and  BMS-510849  in  end  stage  renal  disease  (ESRD)  subjects  was  evaluated  after administration of saxagliptin before dialysis, with a resulting saxagliptin exposure lower than that in subjects with normal renal function and BMS-510849 exposure similar to subjects with severe renal impairment.  Approximately  4%  of  the  dose  was  recovered  as  saxagliptin  and  19%  of  the  dose  as BMS-510849 in the dialysate following a 4 h dialysis session. Given that BMS-510849 seems to be almost  completely  excreted  unchanged  in  urine,  the  initial  proposal  to  administer  saxagliptin  after dialysis may result in very high BMS-510849 exposure. Therefore, the proposed recommendations in case of severe renal impairment and haemodialysis are not acceptable.

## Impaired hepatic function

In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A), moderate (Child-Pugh Class B), or severe (Child-Pugh Class  C)  hepatic  impairment  the  exposures  to  saxagliptin  were  1.1-,  1.4-  and  1.8-fold  higher, respectively,  and  the  exposures  to  BMS-510849  were  22%,  7%,  and  33% lower, respectively,  than those  observed  in  healthy  subjects.  The  applicant  has  compared  AUC  and  Cmax in  patients  with moderate hepatic impairment for saxagliptin and sitagliptin. This comparison is not ideal as hepatic elimination has a larger influence on saxagliptin than on sitagliptin, and the fact that saxagliptin also has an active metabolite, BMS-510849.

BMS-510849 was shown to be approximately 2-fold less potent than parent saxagliptin with respect to DPP-4,  but  is  considered  to  contribute  to  the  DPP-4  inhibitory  effect  due  to  higher  plasma concentrations than the mother substance. Clinical study experience with saxagliptin in patients with moderate  to  severe  hepatic  impairment  is  very  limited.  Therefore,  saxagliptin  should  be  used  with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, and not recommended used in severe hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Accordingly, this is to be reflected in the SPC.

## Effect of age and gender

Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had 23% and 59% higher Cmax and AUC(INF) values of saxagliptin, respectively, than young subjects (18 to 40 years). Because of the &lt;2-fold magnitude of the differences between the young and elderly subjects and the Phase 3 experience with saxagliptin with enrolment open  to  subjects  up  to  77  years,  no  dose  adjustment  on  the  basis  of  age  is  proposed.  However, experience in patients aged 75 years and older is very limited, so caution should be exercised when treating this population.

Compared to males, females had approximately 25% higher exposure values for BMS-510849, but this difference is not considered to be of clinical relevance. No dosage adjustment on basis of gender is therefore proposed.

## Race

The  Applicant  did  not  provide  data  on  studies  specifically  designed  to  characterize  saxagliptin pharmacokinetics  in  a  specific  racial  group.  A  population-based  exposure  modelling  analysis compared the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and BMS-510849 in 309 white subjects with 105 nonwhite  subjects  (consisting  of  6  race  groups).  No  significant  difference  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of saxagliptin  and  BMS-510849  were  detected  between  these  2  populations.  This  is  plausible,  since saxagliptin is not known to be metabolized by polymorphic enzymes.

## Weight

The  Applicant  has  conducted  an  analysis  on  the  effect  of  body  weight  with  a  large  dataset  (699 subjects  with  a  weight  range  of  49.5  to  116.9  kg)  from  the  Clinical  Pharmacology  studies.  Body weight did influence the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and BMS-510849, the impact was small and not considered clinically meaningful.

## Children

There are no PK data in children.

## Interactions in vitro

Saxagliptin and BMS-510849 neither inhibited CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, nor induced CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4 in vitro . Therefore, saxagliptin and its major metabolite are unlikely to alter the metabolic clearance of co-administered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes.

While the potential induction effect of these 2 compounds on CYP2C19 activity was not evaluated directly, it may be inferred from the experimental observations. In these experiments, the activities and mRNA expression levels of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, and 3A4 were measured and utilized as sensitive markers for evaluating activation of the hAhR (CYP1A2), hCAR (CYP2B6 and CYP2C9), and hPXR (CYP3A4 and CYP2C9) nuclear receptors by the 2 compounds. Since CYP2C enzymes, including CYP2C19, are known to be regulated by PXR or CAR receptors, any induction of CYP2B6, 2C9, or CYP3A4 enzymes would also indicate the possibility of CYP2C19 induction. Furthermore, literature reports suggest that CYP2C19 is comparable or less sensitive to induction effects than CYP2C9 when treated  with  known  PXR  and  CAR  inducers,  such  as  rifampicin  and  phenobarbital.  The  actual experimental results showed no increases in the activities of CYP2B6, CYP2C9, or CYP3A4, nor were there  significant  dose-related  increases  in  the  mRNA  content  of  these  enzymes  after  exposure  to saxagliptin at concentrations up to 25 µM or to BMS-510849 at concentrations up to 100 µM. These in vitro test  concentrations  were  ~300-  and  ~700-fold  higher,  for  each  analyte,  respectively,  than  the plasma Cmax values following a 5 mg dose of saxagliptin to humans (Study CV181037 - Cmax values for saxagliptin and BMS-510849 were 0.08 µM and 0.14 µM, respectively). In contrast, the positive control  inducers,  rifampicin  (for  CP3A4,  CYP2C9)  and  phenobarbital  (for  CYP2B6),  showed substantial increases in the enzyme activities and mRNA content of the corresponding enzymes. Based on these results, saxagliptin and its metabolite did not activate either CAR or PXR, and are therefore unlikely to induce CYP2C19. It is not considered necessary to further evaluate the induction potential of CYP2C19 by saxagliptin or other potential CYP2C inducers.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The biotransformation of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). Furthermore,  saxagliptin,  but  not  BMS-510849,  has  been  shown  to  be  a  substrate  for  P-gp  with basolateral to apical polarization ratios in P-gp expressing cells approximately 3-fold higher than in control  cells.  On  basis  of  the in  vitro findings  drug-drug  interactions  mediated  through  CYP3A4 and/or P-gp are possible.

## Interactions in vivo

## Interactions with oral Antidiabetic agents

## Metformin

Co-administration of 1000 mg metformin with 100 mg saxagliptin results did not affect the overall systemic exposure to saxagliptin, but has resulted in a modest decrease in the Cmax of saxagliptin and BMS-510849. This reduction is possibly due to reduction of gastrointestinal motility and is unlikely to be of clinical consequence.

## Glyburide

Glyburide is  a  CYP2C9  substrate.  Even  at  supra-therapeutic  concentrations,  neither  saxagliptin  nor BMS-510849 inhibit the activity of CYP2C9. Results from CV181026 suggest indeed that saxagliptin and glyburide do not affect the pharmacokinetics of each other.

## Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone is a CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrate. Even at supra-therapeutic concentrations, neither saxagliptin nor BMS-510849 inhibit or induce the in vitro activity of CYP3A4 or inhibit the in vitro activity  of  CYP2C8.  Saxagliptin  is  metabolized  by  CYP3A4/3A5.  There  is  no  evidence  to  date implicating  pioglitazone  in  altering  the  activity  of  CYP3A4/3A5.  Saxagliptin  Cmax  and  AUC(TAU) values were 20% higher and 18% higher, respectively, when pioglitazone was co-administered with saxagliptin compared to when saxagliptin was administered alone. There was a 14% increase in the steady state Cmax of pioglitazone when co-administered with saxagliptin, whereas the overall exposure [AUC(INF)]  remained  unchanged.  The  data  suggests  a  small  effect  on  the  absorption  rate  of pioglitazone, which is unlikely to be of clinical consequence.

## Interactions with Gastric Acid Controllers

Co-administration of saxagliptin with Maalox Max®, omeprazole and famotidine do not profoundly affect saxagliptin and BMS-510849 pharmacokinetics. Alterations in gastric pH are therefore unlikely to  cause  clinically  meaningful  alterations  in  the  pharmacokinetic,  safety,  tolerability  and  efficacy profile of saxagliptin.

## Interactions with CYP3A4/5 substrates/inhibitors

## Simvastatin

Co-administration of simvastatin with saxagliptin, increased the steady state Cmax and overall systemic exposure AUC(TAU) of saxagliptin by 21 and 12% , respectively.  However, co-administration did not significantly affect AUC(TAU) and steady state Cmax of BMS-510849, and did not significantly alter the steady state Cmax and AUC(TAU) of simvastatin or simvastatin acid. The changes in Cmax and AUC(TAU) of saxagliptin are not considered to be clinically relevant.

## Omeprazole

Since saxagliptin and omeprazole share common metabolic pathways (CYP3A4), the potential for a drug-drug interaction between these 2 agents theoretically existed. However, saxagliptin pharmacokinetics is not altered by omeprazole.

## Ketoconazole

The  effects  of  saxagliptin  on  ketoconazole  pharmacokinetics  are  limited  and  clinically  irrelevant. However, ketoconazole had a pronounced effect on saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. Compared to when saxagliptin  was  administered  alone,  the  geometric  mean  Cmax  and  AUC(INF) values for saxagliptin were  62%  and  2.5-fold  (95%  CI:  2.30-2.60)  higher,  respectively,  when  saxagliptin  was  coadministered with steady-state ketoconazole. The corresponding values for BMS-510849 were 95% (95%  CI:  0.05-0.06)  and  88%  (95%  CI:  0.10,  0.13)  lower,  respectively.  Since  the  increase  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

saxagliptin overall exposure was accompanied by a substantial decrease in BMS-510849 exposure and since  the  AUC(INF)  values  of  the  total  active  moiety  (saxagliptin+BMS-510849)  increased  by  less than  2-fold  (mean  of  13%  increase,  range  of  4%  decrease  to  28%  increase)  compared  to  when saxagliptin  was  administered  alone,  no  dose  adjustments  are  required.  However,  monitoring  of  the adverse  events  related  to  saxagliptin  should  be  recommended  by  the  SPC  when  both  drugs, ketoconazole and saxagliptin, are combined.

## Diltiazem

Co-administration  of  the  moderate  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4/5  diltiazem  with  saxagliptin  increases  the Cmax  and  AUC(INF)values of saxagliptin by  63% and  2.1-fold, respectively,  and  the  corresponding values  for  the  active  metabolite  were  decreased  by  44  and  34%,  respectively.  As  the  increase  in saxagliptin overall exposure was accompanied by a decrease in BMS-510849 exposure, the effects of diltiazem  on  saxagliptin  are  not  expected  to  lead  significant  clinical  effects.  Therefore,  no  dose adjustment for saxagliptin is recommended when co-administered with diltiazem or other moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.

## Interactions with CYP3A4 inducers

An interaction study with rifampicin, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, (CV180159) has been conducted. While there were substantial effects of rifampicin co-administration on parent saxagliptin pharmacokinetics (53% and 76% decrease in the maximum observed concentration [Cmax] and the area under the concentration time curve from time zero to infinity [AUC(INF)] values, respectively), there were  smaller  and  opposite  effects  of  rifampicin  on  BMS-510849  pharmacokinetics  (39%  and  3% increase, respectively), These pharmacokinetic effects caused by rifampicin resulted in no substantial impact  on  plasma  DPP4  inhibition  over  a  dose  interval.  Overall,  a  5  mg  dose  of  saxagliptin administered with rifampicin inhibits plasma DPP-4 to an extent slightly less than 5 mg saxagliptin administered alone.

The  co-administration  of  saxagliptin  and  CYP3A4/5  inducers,  other  than  rifampicin  (such  as carbamazepine, dexamethasone, phenobarbital and phenytoin) has not been studied and may result in decreased plasma concentration of saxagliptin. Therefore the full glycaemic benefit of Onglyza 5 mg may not be provided in patients also using potent CYP 3A4 inducers. It is recommended that glucose monitoring be conducted during the combination of saxagliptin with a potent CYP3A4 inducer.

## Interactions with P-gp substrates

## Digoxin

Digoxin when co-administered with saxagliptin did not significantly alter the steady state exposure of saxagliptin and BMS-510849. Saxagliptin co-administered with digoxin dosed to steady-state did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.

## Interactions with CYP2C19 substrates/inhibitors

## Omeprazole

Co-administration of omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) to steady-state did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin or BMS-510849.

## · Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

Incubation of saxagliptin and BMS-510849 in human hepatic microsomal suspensions at concentrations ≤ 50  µM  did  not  result  in  concentration-  or  time-dependent  inhibition  of  CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4.

## Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacodynamics were studied in eight trials, all in healthy volunteers except one multiple ascending dose trial that was performed in T2DM subjects. In order to characterize the effects of saxagliptin on DPP4  inhibition,  plasma  DPP4  activity  and  the  plasma  concentrations  of  its  substrate  of  primary interest,  active  GLP-1,  were  measured  in  the  ascending  dose  studies  CV181001,  CV181002,  and CV181010. In addition, the multiple ascending-dose studies in subjects with T2DM (CV181002) and in  healthy  subjects  (CV181010)  examined  the  effect  of  saxagliptin  on  various  markers  of  glucose regulation at selected times during the course of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Mechanism of action

Saxagliptin  is  a  potent,  selective,  reversible,  competitive,  dipeptidyl  peptidase-4  (DPP4)  inhibitor. Dipeptidyl  peptidase-4  is  an  enzyme  that  selectively  cleaves  dipeptides  from  the  N-terminus  of oligopeptides  with  proline  or  alanine  in  the  penultimate  position.  DPP4  actively  converts  the  key insulinotropic  hormone  glucagon  like  peptide-1  (GLP  1)  from  the  active  to  inactive  form,  and  is responsible for the short half-life of intact GLP-1 in vivo .  Inhibitors of  DPP-4 increase endogenous intact GLP-1 concentrations and potentiate its physiological actions, augmenting postprandial insulin secretion and improving the glycaemic profile in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because DPP4 inhibitors  stimulate  insulin  secretion  in  a  glucose-dependent  manner,  this  mechanism  of  action  is expected to present low risk of hypoglycaemia and may not lead to weight gain.

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

Pharmacodynamics were studied in eight trials, all in healthy volunteers except one multiple ascending dose trial that was performed in T2DM subjects. In order to characterize the effects of saxagliptin on DPP4  inhibition,  plasma  DPP4  activity  and  the  plasma  concentrations  of  its  substrate  of  primary interest,  active  GLP-1,  were  measured  in  the  ascending  dose  studies  CV181001,  CV181002,  and CV181010. In addition, the multiple ascending-dose studies in subjects with T2DM (CV181002) and in  healthy  subjects  (CV181010)  examined  the  effect  of  saxagliptin  on  various  markers  of  glucose regulation  at  selected  times  during  the  course  of  the  study.  Inhibition  of  plasma  DPP4  activity appeared to be dose-dependent (see figures below). Doses of 5 mg and higher did not have a similar inhibition at steady-state: in T2DM subjects maximal effect was higher with 50 mg dose. In general, plasma active GLP-1 concentrations were higher in saxagliptin-exposed subjects, but no dose related saxagliptin  effect  was  discernable.  No  clinically  meaningful  change  was  observed  in  any  of  the glycaemic parameters studied in subjects with T2DM or healthy subjects.

A mechanism of action study indicated an effect of saxagliptin on insulin release by pancreatic betacells.

Two studies investigated the effect of saxagliptin dosing on lymphocyte count. Only at the highest dose of exposures studied in CV181022 and CV181031 (20 mg + ketoconazole and 40 mg saxagliptin, respectively),  a  modest  and  transient  decrease  in  lymphocyte  count  occurred  when  dosing  was interrupted by 7 or 8 days. The mechanism for the lymphocyte decreases remains unknown.

Results of a thorough QTc study indicated that saxagliptin and its main metabolite are not associated with prolongation of the QTc interval at 40 mg dose.

## Clinical efficacy

## · Dose response study

Study CV181008 was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  dose-ranging,  placebo-controlled  parallel  group study comparing 5 doses of saxagliptin (2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg) with placebo (0-40 mg cohort) and comparing  a  higher  dose  of  saxagliptin  (100  mg  once  daily)  with  placebo  (0,100  mg  cohort)  in treatment-naïve subjects with T2DM. The 0-40 mg cohort was treated for 12 weeks, whereas subjects in  the  0,100  mg  cohort  were  treated  for  6  weeks.  The  treatment  groups  were  well  balanced  with respect  to  the  baseline  characteristics  with  the  exception  of  gender  where  the  proportion  of males/females  varied  between  the  groups.  Titration  of  study  medication  was  not  permitted  during double-blind period.

Results  on  HbA1c  are  shown  in  the  table  below.  All  doses  resulted  in  statistically  and  clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c, although 5 mg led to the numerically largest reduction. As also seen in the mechanistic studies, there was no dose-effect relationship. This might reflect the close to « all-ornone» effect on DPP-4 inhibition as also seen for a recently approved DPP-4 inhibitor. The choice of the doses for the phase 3 trials (2.5, 5 and 10 mg) is acceptable.

## Treatments

The design of the core phase 3 trials was as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

## · Monotherapy trials

Treatment naïve patients were randomised to receive saxagliptin 2.5, 5, 10 mg (CV181011) or placebo once daily in the morning. In CV181011 66 subjects were enrolled into a saxagliptin 10 mg open-label cohort study.

In CV181038 also a 5 mg saxagliptin group was studied with evening (PM) dosing and a saxagliptin titration group (2.5 to 5 mg). Double-blind metformin was administered in the LT periods to placeborandomized subjects completing the ST period without requiring rescue therapy.

## · Add-on combination studies

In CV181040 subjects with inadequate glycaemic control despite submaximal SU were randomized to saxagliptin  2.5  mg,  5  mg,  or  placebo  in  combination  with  an  intermediate  dose  of  glibenclamide. Saxagliptin with a fixed intermediate dose of glibenclamide was compared with titration to a higher dose  of  glibenclamide  plus  placebo.  Subjects  were  treated  with  a  sub-maximal  dose  of  glyburide (glibenclamide).

In CV181014 subjects  with  inadequate  glycaemic  control  despite metformin were  randomized  to saxagliptin  2.5,  5,  10  mg,  or  placebo  in  combination  with  metformin.  During  the  lead-in  period subjects received open-label metformin at their pre-study dose, up to 2500 mg daily. Subjects who had been receiving a metformin dose &gt; 2500 mg daily had their dose adjusted to 2500 mg.

In CV181013 subjects  with inadequate  glycaemic  control  despite TZD were  randomized  to saxagliptin 2.5 or 5 mg in combination with a TZD. In the lead-in period subjects received open-label TZD at their pre-study dose. No titration of study medication was allowed, and open-label metformin (500 - 2500 mg) was given as rescue medication.

## · Initial Combination Study

In study CV181039 subjects  were  randomized  to  saxagliptin  5  or  10  mg  in  combination  with metformin 500 mg, to saxagliptin 10 mg monotherapy, or to metformin 500 mg monotherapy.

## · D1680C00002

Following  the  enrolment  phase  (Period  A),  subjects  entered  a  2-week,  single-blind  lead-in  phase (Period B) with counselling on dietary and lifestyle modifications, after which eligible subjects were randomized  to  a  double-blind,  active-controlled  18-week  treatment  phase  (Period  C).  Subjects maintained  their  dose  of  open-label  metformin  therapy  and  were  randomized  (1:1)  to  one  of  the following 2 treatment groups: saxagliptin 5 mg once daily or sitagliptin 100 mg once daily.

## Objectives

All core phase 3 trials except D1680C0002  were designed to demonstrate superiority of investigational treatments over placebo/control treatments, with regards to change in HbA1c.

The primary efficacy objective of this study D1680C00002 was to compare that, after 18 weeks of oral  administration  of  double-blind  treatment,  the  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  achieved  with saxagliptin 5 mg per day added onto metformin is non-inferior to sitagliptin 100 mg per day added onto metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control on 1500 mg or higher doses of metformin therapy alone.

## Outcomes/endpoints

In all studies change from baseline to week 24 in HbA1c, except the mechanism of action study and DC1680C0002  in  which  change  from  baseline  was  noted  at  week  18,  was  the  primary  efficacy endpoint. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline to week 24 in FPG and Post-Prandial

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Glucose  Area  Under  the  Concentration  curve  (PPG  AUC),  as  well  as  the  proportion  of  subjects achieving a glycaemic response of HbA1c&lt;7% at week 24.

## Sample size

For  monotherapy studies  sample  sizes  were  calculated  to  detect  a  true  difference  of  0.7%  in  mean change from baseline HbA1c between saxagliptin and placebo for a two tailed test at α = 0.05 with a power of 90%.

In  study  D1680C00002  with  a  total  of  710  subjects  randomized  and  treated  (or  355  per  treatment group), there was 90% power to establish the non-inferiority comparison on change from baseline to Week 18 in HbA1c at the 5% level, assuming that the standard deviation of change from baseline in HbA1c is 1.1%, with a non-inferiority limit set at 0.3% and an assumed zero true difference between the  2  randomized  treatments.  The  sample  size  also  assumed  that  20%  of  the  randomized  subjects would be excluded from the Per Protocol (PP) analysis set.

## Randomisation

Subjects were randomly assigned to different treatment groups using a block randomisation schedule (permuted blocks stratified by site).

## Blinding (masking)

For blinding purposes all dose forms of saxagliptin were identical in design and there was a single placebo tablet to match all dose forms of saxagliptin. Clinical supplies were packaged with unblinding information concealed by a tear-off label to permit unblinding in emergency situations or pregnancy. After the database was locked, the data were unblinded for reporting purposes.

## Statistical methods

The primary efficacy endpoint of each core phase 3 study is the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week  24,  or  the  last  pre-rescue  post-baseline  measurement  prior  to  Week  24,  if  no  Week  24 assessment  is  available.  This  includes  subjects  in  the  Randomised  Subjects  data  set  who  have  a baseline and at least one post-baseline HbA1c assessment.

The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  an  ANCOVA  model  of  the  primary  endpoint  (LOCF),  with treatment group as a fixed effect and baseline value as a covariate in the model. Within the framework of  this  ANCOVA  model,  point  estimates  and  95%  confidence  interval  for  the  mean  change  from baseline  within  each  treatment  group  as  well  as  for  the  difference  in  mean  change  from  baseline between  each  investigative  treatment  group  and  the  placebo  or  active  comparator  treatment  group were calculated. The treatment-by-baseline interaction was also tested and distributional assumptions assessed. The treatment comparison was performed using a t-test with pre-specified value of α .

A repeated measure analysis (using MIXED model) was used to analyse the response variable change from baseline in HbA1c to each time point. In addition to the results presented for each study, the primary efficacy endpoint was analysed with the Pooled Mono data for the 2.5 mg, 5 mg (AM and PM), and placebo arms with an Analysis of Covariance model.

Secondary analyses common to all 6 pivotal phase 3 studies include change from baseline to week 24 LOCF in FPG, change from baseline to Week 24 (LOCF) in 3 hour post-prandial glucose AUC and proportion of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response at week  24 (defined as HbA1c&lt;7%).

Mean  changes  from  baseline  at  Week  24  (LOCF)  in  FPG,  PPG  AUC  and  during  the  short-term treatment period were compared between each investigative treatment group and the control group, based  on  adjusted  means  generated  by  ANCOVA.  The  percents  of  subjects  achieving  therapeutic glycaemic response at Week 24 (LOCF) were compared between each of the investigative treatment groups and the control group, using Fisher's exact test. Therapeutic glycaemic response (HbA1c&lt;7.0%) analysis at Week 24 was also performed using the Pooled Monotherapy group for the 2.5  mg,  5  mg  (AM  and  PM),  and  placebo  doses.  Overall  association  between  treatment  group  and therapeutic glycaemic response adjusted for study was analyzed using the Mantel-Haenszel test. The Breslow-Day test was used to test for homogeneity of effect across studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Time to study discontinuation for lack of glycaemic control or rescue for failing to achieve glycaemic targets during the long-term treatment period was summarized by treatment arm using Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative proportion (with 95% CI).

The Short-term Completers data set was used for Completers analysis.

Standard error and within group 95% confidence interval were calculated using Fieller's theorem for % of efficacy maintained between Week 24 and long-term Week t.

The following data sets were defined:

Lead-in subjects were defined as all subjects who took at least one dose of placebo lead-in studydrug.

Randomised subjects were defined as all randomised subjects who took at least one dose of doubleblind treatment

Treated  Subjects defined  as  all  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  double-blind  study medication during the short-term period.

Evaluable subjects is  a  subset  of  randomised  subjects,  defined  as  all  randomised  subjects  without protocol deviation that may significantly interfere with the assessment of the primary endpoint.

Since less than 10% of subjects in all treatment groups had significant protocol deviations, no analyses were performed in the Evaluable Subjects Data Set.

Due the large number of sites in the study and the small number of subjects enrolled at most sites, site was not included as a factor in the ANCOVA model.

In  study  D1680C00002 the PP analysis set, excluding non-completers and subjects with significant protocol  deviations,  was  the  analysis  set  used  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  to  establish  noninferiority  of  saxagliptin  plus  metformin  vs.  sitagliptin  plus  metformin  with  a  0.3%  non-inferiority limit  on  the  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  18.  The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  also analyzed using the Full analysis set. All other efficacy variables were analyzed using the Full analysis set only. In last observation carried forward (LOCF) analyses at Week 18, the measurement designated as the Week 18 measurement was used. If no Week 18 measurement was available, the last available earlier post-baseline measurement was used.

The  primary  efficacy  analysis  to  establish  non-inferiority  with  0.3%  non-inferiority  limit  on  the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 18 was performed on the PP analysis set using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA). The model used treatment group as a fixed effect and baseline value as a  covariate.  Within  the  framework  of  the  ANCOVA  model,  point  estimates  and  the  2-sided  95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the mean change within each treatment group were performed. These analyses  were  also  performed  for  the  differences  in  mean  change  between  the  saxagliptin  plus metformin  treatment  arm  and  the  sitagliptin  plus  metformin  treatment  group.  Saxagliptin  plus metformin would be considered not inferior to sitagliptin plus metformin if the upper limit of the 2sided 95% CI of the difference in change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 18 between saxagliptin plus metformin and sitagliptin plus metformin was less than 0.3%.

For secondary continuous glycaemic outcome variables, such as change from baseline in FPG at Week 18, a similar ANCOVA model was used: point estimates and the 2-sided 95% CIs for the mean change within each treatment group as well as for the differences in mean change between the two treatment groups were reported.

Summaries  of  categorical  endpoints  (such  as  achieving  HbA1c ≤ 6.5%  at  specific  visits)  provided frequencies and percents for each treatment group. In addition, the percent difference from sitagliptin +  metformin  and  95%  CIs  were  estimated.  No  a  priori  hypotheses  for  secondary  objectives  were proposed.

The change in PPG from baseline to Week 18 of randomized treatment was evaluated for a subset of subjects within the Full analysis set for whom an extended OGTT was conducted. The target was to include  50  subjects  in  the  subgroup.  A  total  of  51  subjects  underwent  OGTT  at  8  different  South African sites, of whom 49 had glucose values measured at each required time point.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

Across all Core Phase 3 studies, 74% of subjects in all treatment groups completed the ST period. A higher proportion of subjects in the control groups were rescued or discontinued from the study due to lack  of  efficacy  compared  with  subjects  treated  with  saxagliptin.  A  summary  of  the  disposition  of subjects in the randomized and open label data sets is given in the table below. There are expected differences  between  studies  such  as  duration  of  diabetes.  The  number  of  patients  &gt;  65  years  is adequate. The number of patients &gt;75 was low (&lt;1%).

In  study  DC1680C00002 all  randomized  subjects  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  medication  and 92.3% of subjects completed the 18-week, double-blind, randomized treatment period. The percentage of subjects discontinuing study treatment during double-blind treatment was similar overall between the 2 treatment groups. More subjects discontinued from the saxagliptin + metformin group than the sitagliptin + metformin group due to the development of study-specific discontinuation criteria (3.5% and 1.8%, respectively).

## Conduct of the study

In  CV181038,  the  only  significant  protocol  deviation  was  non-compliance  with  study  medication, which involved 6 subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  treatment  groups  and  3  subjects  in  the  placebo  group. Protocol deviations in testing of the OGTT were identified. Due to an incorrect amount of glucose solution administered at some sites in Europe, the OGTT parameters for 50 subjects were excluded from all analyses. In CV181011, four subjects (1%) had at least 1 significant protocol deviation during

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the treatment period; 3 subjects (1 in each saxagliptin treatment group) were non-compliant with study drug  and  1  subject  in  the  placebo  group  received  another  antihyperglycaemic  medication  for ≥ 14 days.

Overall the protocol amendments are considered to not have any significant impact on the conduct of the study.

In study D1680C00002, of the 801 randomized subjects, approximately 51% were female, 66% were White, and 51% were from Europe. The mean age was 58 years, and 71% were &lt;65 years of age. Mean weight was 86 kg,  and  54%  had  BMI ≥ 30  kg/m2  (i.e.,  overweight/obese  population).  Mean duration of T2DM was 6.3 years, mean baseline value HbA1c was 7.7%, and mean FPG level was 8.9 mmol/L (160.2 mg/dL). The mean baseline dose of metformin was 1829 mg/day.

The  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  of  the  PP  analysis  set  were  similar  to  those  of  the Randomized analysis set.

## Numbers analysed

In the monotherapy studies the Randomised Subjects Data Set, which included all randomised subjects who took at least 1 dose of active double-blind study medication, includes a total of 401 (CV181011) and 365 (CV181038) subjects. These are also the subjects included in the efficacy analysis.

In  the  add-on  and  initial  combination  therapy  studies  the  Randomised  Subjects  Data  Set,  which included all randomised subjects who took at least 1 dose of active double-blind study medication, includes  a  total  of  743  (CV181014),  565  (CV181013),  768  (CV181040)  and  1306  (CV181039) subjects. These are also the subjects included in the efficacy analysis.

In study DC1680C00002 a total of 801 subjects were assigned to randomized treatment with either saxagliptin + metformin (n=403) or sitagliptin + metformin (n=398).

Outcomes and estimation

## HbA1c

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the monotherapy trials , all doses of saxagliptin induced a reduction in HbA1c, and the difference with placebo was statistically significant. However, the magnitude of the difference was questioned by the CHMP. Only saxagliptin 10 mg dose in study CV181011 reached delta of -0.7%. In addition, there is no difference in response between the 5 mg and 2.5 mg. Therefore, the choice of 5 mg as optimal dose is not justified by these studies. Furthermore, the placebo response differs between both studies, suggesting  a  difference  in  study  population.  In  response  to  this  issue  a  post  hoc  analysis  was performed  for  HbA1c  reduction  from  baseline  to  12  weeks  for  the  saxagliptin  5 mg  and  2.5  mg groups. At 12 weeks a greater HbA1c reduction was observed in the 5 mg group vs. the 2.5 mg group. However, over a longer time period (50-102 weeks) the difference disappears and no difference was found at the end of this period between both doses. Therefore, it cannot be concluded with certainty that  saxagliptin  5  mg  per  day  is  the  optimal  dose.  The  Applicant  did  not  apply  for  Onglyza  as monotherapy.

Data over time during ST+LT Treatment Period of CV181013, CV181040 and CV181014 shows that not only at 24 weeks but also over time the 5 mg dose is better as compared with saxagliptin 2.5 mg in the add-on combination placebo-controlled studies.

With respect to the add-on to TZD trial, a relatively large effect was seen in the placebo group. The majority of patients were on mid-dose TZD and median duration of TZD treatment previous to the trial was 0.6 years. The data suggest that patients in this trial were not real TZD failures and part of the effect seen in the combination treatment arm might be due to ongoing TZD effect. However, addition of saxagliptin to TZD was superior to placebo and the results of the study can still be accepted.

In  the initial  combination  study ,  a  reduction  in  HbA1c  was  also  observed  for  all  doses.  The difference in change in HbA1c was statistically significant compared to metformin, but the 95% CI is wide [-0.73, -0.35] and the clinical relevance debatable (see table below).

It has not been shown in this nor in any other study that an initial combination treatment would be a better option than adding a second glucose-lowering agent (i.e. OAD) (=add-on) when the first does not show the intended effect. Moreover, in a number of subjects included in this initial combination study one glucose-lowering agent (metformin) would be sufficient to reach the glycaemic target. In addition to this, initial combination therapy with saxagliptin and metformin, as studied in CV181039, is  not  in  accordance  with  current  European  and  US  therapeutic  guidelines  (Diabetes  Care,  vol.  32, no.1, January 2009) that recommends starting with monotherapy.

The Applicant argued that patients with a high baseline HbA1c need highly effective treatment with rapid onset of action and good tolerability, and suggested restricting the initial combination therapy to the subgroup of patients with high baseline HbA1c levels (&gt;10%). A post hoc analysis was performed in  subjects  with  HbA1c ≥ 10  %.  The  CHMP  had  concerns  on  whether  the  population  with  HbA1c &gt;10% at baseline is representative for the European situation. Newly diagnosed patients with T2DM seldom have HbA1c &gt;10%: in most cases HbA1c is ≤ 8%. As could be expected, the response in this subgroup  was  higher  compared  to  subjects  with  baseline  HbA1c&lt;10%,  but  this  was  true  for  all treatment groups. In the metformin monotherapy group 27% reached HbA1c &lt;7% and would not need combination treatment. In addition the number of subjects needing rescue for metformin (8.2%) is in the same order of magnitude as for saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin (7.2%). Furthermore, claims in the SPC should have been pre-specified and the statistical  analysis  plan should  have  been  adjusted  for multiplicity. Taking into account all these considerations the claim for initial combination therapy was not granted.

In a comparative study with sitagliptin added to metformin a total of 801 subjects were randomized and treated, 403 to saxagliptin and 398 to sitagliptin. Only preliminary results were submitted. 739 subjects  (365  [90.6  %]  in  the  saxagliptin  +  metformin  group  and  374  [94.0  %]  in  the  sitagliptin  + metformin group, respectively) completed the study.

Of the 801 randomized subjects, 795 (99.3%) were included in the full analysis set, 677 (84.5%) were included in the PP analysis set, and 801 (100%) were included in the safety analysis set.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Mean baseline HbA1c values were similar in the 2 treatment groups. Both treatments resulted in a reduction from baseline to Week 18 in HbA1c values: adjusted mean change from baseline -0.52% for saxagliptin + metformin and -0.62% for sitagliptin + metformin. Based on the difference in adjusted mean  changes  from  baseline,  treatment  with  saxagliptin  +  metformin  group  was  non-inferior  to treatment with sitagliptin  +  metformin  in  the  PP  analysis  set  (difference  vs  sitagliptin  +  metformin 0.09; 95% 2-sided confidence interval [CI] -0.01 to 0.20). The upper limit of the 95% CI was below the predefined criterion for non-inferiority, an upper confidence limit of the estimate &lt;0.3%. In the full analysis set the adjusted mean changes from baseline were -0.42% for saxagliptin + metformin and 0.59 % for saxagliptin + metformin (95% CI: 0.06 to 0.28), with the upper limit of the 95% CI still within the pre-defined non-inferiority margin.

The proportions of subjects achieving a therapeutic response (defined as HbA1c ≤ 6.5%) were similar in  the  2  treatment  groups  (26.3%  and  29.1%  for  the  saxagliptin  +  metformin  and  sitagliptin  + metformin groups, respectively, (95% 2-sided CI -9.0% to 3.5% for the between group difference). These preliminary results will be assessed further when the final results are submitted as a Follow Up Measure.

## Long-term efficacy

The Core Phase 3 studies all included an extension phase of at least 12 months after the 24 weeks short-term period. Subjects on placebo in the monotherapy trials were treated with metformin 500 mg in this phase. Long-term efficacy was measured by the percentage of patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy or requiring rescue treatment, and by HbA1c. Long-term phases are still ongoing and data presented are based on interim analyses. Therefore, analyses of the long-term interim data have their limitations.

In  the  monotherapy  trials  the  Kaplan-Meier  curves  showed  no  clear  difference  between  saxagliptin treated  patients  and  placebo/metformin  treated  patients  in  number  and  percentage  discontinuing  or requiring rescue.

In the add-on trials saxagliptin patients had better control than the placebo group.

For the initial combination study, data curves seem too preliminary for a definitive assessment. Interpretation of all Kaplan-Meier curves however is hampered by the fact that after 37 weeks only a relative low amount of subjects at risk is included.

The change in HbA1c over time in the monotherapy, add-on and initial combination therapy studies in can be seen in the following figures:

Data Set: Rendomized subjects

For  the  long-term  data  on  HbA1c  there  is  always  a  'better  than  placebo'  response.  However,  in CV181011 the shape of the curve suggests typical continued diabetic progression as the HbA1c curves are  not  flat.  Also  in  CV181040  and  in  CV181014  there  is  a  suggestion  of  diabetic  progression.  In CV181038, CV181013 and CV18039 maximal HbA1c effect is relatively preserved.

Thus  the  long-term  data  in  two  of  the  three  add-on  combination  studies  and  in  one  of  the  two monotherapy  studies  are  consistent  with  progression  of  the  disease  in  the  long-term.  In  the  initial combination study maximal HbA1c effect seems to be preserved in the long-term. However, data are based on interim results. Full study reports are awaited as a post-authorisation follow up measure.

## Secondary and other efficacy endpoints

Secondary  endpoints  as  FPG,  percentage  of  patients  reaching  HbA1c&lt;7%,  and  PPG  confirmed  the results obtained for HbA1c.

Other efficacy endpoints, such as post-prandial insulin and glucagon, β -cell function (calculated using the  HOMA-2B method) were consistent with results obtained for HbA1c. The 10 mg dose did not provide increased efficacy as compared with the 5 mg dose.

Weight, BMI and waist circumference were measured in all of the Core Phase 3 studies. It appeared that saxagliptin has no clear effect on either of these parameters.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ancillary analyses

## · Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

The effect of saxagliptin on the adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c was assessed in 12 additional clinical subgroup categories of potential interest: baseline HbA1c, race, baseline HOMA2B, baseline creatinine clearance, gender, geographic region, duration of T2DM, ethnicity, age, age in women only, baseline BMI, and baseline HOMA 2-IR. The effect of saxagliptin was analyzed across all  12  subgroup  categories  by  study  to  assess  whether  there  were  subgroups  where  saxagliptin  was ineffective.

There was no subgroup where saxagliptin was found consistently ineffective. There were 4 subgroup categories  with  an  interaction  p-value  &lt;  0.1  in  more  than  1  study:  baseline  HbA1c,  race,  baseline HOMA-2B, and baseline creatinine clearance.

Saxagliptin produced greater reductions from baseline for those with higher baseline HbA1c. This is frequently seen with antidiabetic drugs.

Saxagliptin treatment resulted in reduced HbA1c in all race subgroups. The data did not suggest that variability in saxagliptin response by race should influence clinical treatment decisions. Furthermore, results  of  the  analyses  performed  to  date  have  not  revealed  any  differential  treatment  effects  in different  ethnic  groups.  Trials  in  China  and  the  Southeast  Asian  region  are  ongoing;  a  placebocontrolled monotherapy trial is planned in India.

Saxagliptin  treatment  consistently  resulted  in  reduced  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  24  for  all subgroups by baseline HOMA-2B (reflecting pancreatic β -cell  function).  The  variation  in  subgroup response identified by the interaction p-values &lt;0.1 derived primarily from the variation in the control response by baseline HOMA-2B subgroup.

The  basis  for  the  interaction  between  baseline  creatinine  clearance  and  treatment  appeared  to  be  a greater  dose-response  separation  in  subjects  in  the  subgroup  with  baseline  creatinine  clearance ≤ 80 mL/min in the add-on combination studies.

The apparent lack of a statistically significant effect vs. placebo in subjects &gt; 65 years of age in study CV181013 (add-on to TZD) might be due to the relatively large placebo effect in this study and the wide  confidence  intervals.  An  additional  pooled  analysis  for  subjects  &gt;  65  years  revealed  similar efficacy for these patients as compared to younger subjects. This is also true for patients &gt; 75 year, but their number was small (36 in total).

## · Clinical studies in special populations

No studies in special populations have been performed. Information on renally impaired and hepatically impaired patients can be found in the Pharmacokinetics section.

## · Supportive studies

All main phase 3 studies included an extension phase of at least 12 additional months (see Outcomes and Estimations section).

## Clinical safety

Safety  and  tolerability  problems  in  members  of  the  DPP4-inhibitor  class  are  skin-related  lesions (observed in monkey studies), gastrointestinal toxicity (in dogs), hypersensitivity reactions, abnormal liver function tests, increased incidence of infections and increased concentration of serum creatinine, as  well  as  skin  lesions,  selected  infections  (e.g.,  related  to  herpes  simplex  virus  or  Mycobacterium tuberculosis), decreased lymphocyte counts, decreased platelet counts and events of localized oedema (symptomatic oedema of the hands and feet).

Recently (April 2008) in a Cochrane Systematic Review on DPP-4 inhibitors it was suggested that the new DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, may influence the immune system.

## · Patient exposure

A total of 5346 subjects were studied in the saxagliptin Phase 1-3 clinical program (excluding study D1680C00002),  of  which  4042  subjects  received  saxagliptin.  In  the  Phase  2b/3  program,  which included eight studies in total, 3422 subjects received saxagliptin, including 66 subjects who received open-label  saxagliptin  10  mg  in  study  CV181011,  and  1251  received  placebo  or  control  treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, 937, 1269, and 1066 subjects received saxagliptin at doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg, once daily.

There  is  exposure  beyond  the  24-week  short-term  treatment  period.  The  total  number  of  subjects exposed to saxagliptin (2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg) for &gt;48 weeks included 303 subjects in monotherapy studies,  451  subjects  in  the  add-on  combination  study  with  metformin,  369  subjects  in  the  add-on combination study with SU, 195 subjects in the add-on combination study with TZD, and 141 subjects in the initial combination therapy with metformin. Unless specified, the safety findings described are based on exposure up to 24 weeks in duration.

The clinical safety database in number of 5346 treated subjects is extensive. However, as treatment with saxagliptin may be long-term, the time of exposure up to 24 weeks in most studies for assessing clinical safety is a limited period. The number of subjects exposed &gt;48 weeks is very limited: the total number of subjects exposed to saxagliptin (2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg) for &gt;48 weeks is: 303 subjects in monotherapy studies, 451 subjects in the add-on combination study with metformin, 369 subjects in the add-on combination study with SU, 195 subjects in the add-on combination study with TZD, and 141  subjects  in  the  initial  combination  therapy  with  metformin.  Further  long-term  data  will  be submitted post-authorisation, however to further address this point the Applicant submitted safety data from the 4 monthly safety update (MSU) (data cut-off dates of 20 June 2008 to 01 July 2008). The assessment of this data did not reveal any new safety issues.

## · Adverse events

In the placebo-controlled Core Phase 3 studies, upper respiratory tract infections (URI) and headache and  UTI  were  the  adverse  events  (AEs)  that  were  more  frequent  ( ≥ 5% and without any thresholds between treatment groups) among subjects treated with the recommended dose of saxagliptin (5 mg) as compared to placebo.

At  a  higher  dose  of  saxagliptin  (10  mg),  the  additional  AEs  of  URI,  nasopharyngitis,  nausea, arthralgia, headache, and anxiety were more common in subjects receiving saxagliptin 10 mg, based on criteria of &gt;1% difference relative to placebo.

In the add-on combination therapy studies the following findings were observed:

Add-on to Metformin (CV181014): The overall frequency of AEs (excluding events of hypoglycaemia) during the ST period was higher for subjects receiving saxagliptin (73.2%) relative to placebo (64.8%). AEs were reported by 78.1%, 69.6%, and 71.8% of the subjects in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg treatment groups, respectively. AEs were more frequent (&gt;2%) in the All saxagliptin than placebo group for the following SOCs: Infections and Infestations (38.3% vs. 35.8%); Investigations; Eye Disorders; Blood and Lymphatic Disorders. AEs that were more frequent (&gt;1%) among  saxagliptinthan placebo-treated subjects included: URI, abdominal pain, arthralgia, pharyngolaryngeal pain, and blood CK increased.

Adverse  reactions  with  saxagliptin  5  mg  were:  upper  respiratory  infection,  urinary  tract  infection, gastroenteritis, sinusitis, headache, and vomiting.  Adverse events considered at least possibly related (investigator assessed) to saxagliptin 5 mg were dyspepsia and myalgia.

Add-on  to  SU  (CV181040) :  The  overall  frequency  of  AEs  (excluding  events  of  hypoglycaemia) during the ST period was lower in subjects receiving saxagliptin (70.9%) than in subjects receiving placebo (74.2%). AEs were reported by 71.4% and 70.4% of the subjects in the saxagliptin 2.5 and 5 mg groups, respectively. AEs were more frequent (&gt;2%) in the All saxagliptin than placebo group for  the  following  SOCs:  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  and  Vascular  Disorders.  AEs  that  were  more frequent (&gt;1%) among saxagliptin- than placebo-treated subjects included: gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, headache, and hypertension. The difference in the SOC Infections and Infestations between All saxagliptin and placebo was minimal.

Adverse  reactions  with  saxagliptin  5  mg  were:  upper  respiratory  infection,  urinary  tract  infection, gastroenteritis, sinusitis, hypoglycaemia, headache, and vomiting.  Adverse events considered at least possibly  related  (investigator  assessed)  to  saxagliptin  5  mg  were:  fatigue,  dyslipidaemia,  and hypertriglyceridaemia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Add-on to TZD (CV181013) :  The  overall  frequency  of  AEs  (excluding  events  of  hypoglycaemia) during  the  ST  period  was  comparable  for  subjects  in  the  All  Saxa  and  placebo  groups  (67.7%  vs. 66.3%).  AEs  were  more  frequent  for  subjects  treated  with  saxagliptin  5  mg  (74.2%)  than  2.5  mg (61.5%).  AEs  were  more  frequent  (&gt;2%)  for  saxagliptin-  than  placebo-treated  subjects  in  the following  SOCs:  Blood  and  Lymphatic  Disorders  and  Ear  and  Labyrinth  Disorders.  AEs  that  were more  frequent  (&gt;1%)  among  saxagliptin-  than  placebo-treated  subjects  included:  URI,  sinusitis, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, headache, anaemia, peripheral oedema, and blood creatine phosphokinase increased. The difference in the SOC Infections and Infestations was 32.2% for All saxagliptin vs. 30.4% in placebo.

Adverse  reactions  with  saxagliptin  5  mg  were:  upper  respiratory  infection,  urinary  tract  infection, gastroenteritis, sinusitis, headache, vomiting, and peripheral oedema.

For  the  add-on  combination  studies  it  is  difficult  to  state  any  definite  dose-related  AEs.  However, peripheral  oedema  in  subjects  receiving  concomitant  TZD  therapy  may  be  an  AE  that  is  uniquely associated with this specific treated patient population. There was an increased frequency of peripheral oedema in the add-on combination study with TZD in the saxagliptin 5 mg group 15/186 (8.1%), but not in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg 6/195 (3.1%) and placebo 8/184 (4.3%) groups. All AEs of peripheral oedema  in  the  add-on  combination  study  with  TZD  were  of  mild  to  moderate  intensity,  and  none resulted in study drug discontinuation.

In the LT period of each of the studies CV181014 and CV181039, subjects were eligible to receive pioglitazone as rescue treatment for hyperglycaemia. The addition of pioglitazone as rescue treatment did not substantially increase the frequency of peripheral oedema.

In a pooled analysis of the 2 monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to SU  study,  the  overall  frequency  of  AEs  of  peripheral  oedema  observed  in  subjects  treated  with saxagliptin 5 mg was similar to placebo (1.7% vs . 2.4%).

In the short term treatment period of the initial combination study with metformin saxagliptin 10 mg + metformin, diarrhoea was an AE in 10% of subjects. Overall, at a frequency of ≥ 5%, nasopharyngitis, and  headache  were  more  common  for  subjects  receiving  initial  combination  saxagliptin  5  mg  + metformin relative to metformin monotherapy. Severe nasopharyngitis was reported for 1 subject in the saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin group. Headache of severe intensity was reported for 2 subjects in each of the control groups (saxagliptin 10 mg monotherapy and metformin monotherapy); otherwise, all of the events in the saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin group were of mild or moderate in intensity. The majority of these AEs were considered unrelated to treatment, and none resulted in discontinuation of treatment.  Adverse  events  considered  at  least  possibly  related  (investigator  assessed)  to  saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin were: gastritis, arthralgia, myalgia, and erectile dysfunction. The overall safety of the initial combination use of saxagliptin 5mg + metformin is similar to saxagliptin monotherapy or metformin monotherapy; this indication however has been withdrawn by the Applicant.

In  the  comparative  study  with  sitagliptin  preliminary  results  showed  that  the  incidence  of  AEs (including  events  of  hypoglycaemia)  during  the  18-week,  randomized  treatment  period  was  47.1% among saxagliptin + metformin-treated subjects and 47.2% in sitagliptin + metformin-treated subjects. Nine subjects in each treatment group discontinued treatment due to AEs (2.2% in the saxagliptin + metformin group and 2.3% in the sitagliptin + metformin group).

The most frequent AEs for saxagliptin-treated  subjects  during  the  LT  period  seem  to  be  consistent with those observed for the short term period. However, due to the large difference in exposure for the saxagliptin  group  compared  with  the  control  group  (351.60  vs.  100.71  subject-years  for  the  all saxagliptin  and  control  groups,  respectively),  and  since  subjects  that  were  randomized  to  placebo received metformin after week 24, no comparisons are possible between the saxagliptin and control groups, in pooled monotherapy studies including subjects with &gt;= 24 weeks of treatment.

'Long-term'  safety  data  cannot  be  considered  sufficient  thus  far.  This  is  a  point  of  concern  and  is addressed in the risk management plan.

The frequency of AEs (excluding events of hypoglycaemia) was similar across the 2 treatment groups (46.7% in the saxagliptin + metformin group and 46.5% in the sitagliptin + metformin group). The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

most common System Organ Class (SOC) in both groups was Infections and infestations (25.1% of subjects in each group).

The  most  common  AEs  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  treatment-related  were  in  the  SOC Nervous System Disorders (5 [1.2%] subjects in the saxagliptin + metformin group and 3 [0.8%] in the sitagliptin  +  metformin  group),  in  the  SOC  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  (4  [1.0%]  subjects  in  the saxagliptin + metformin group and 13 [3.3%] subjects in the sitagliptin + metformin group), and in the SOC Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (3 [0.7%] subjects in the saxagliptin + metformin group and 6 [1.5%] subjects in the sitagliptin + metformin group). A higher percentage of subjects in the sitagliptin + metformin group experienced treatment-related Gastrointestinal Disorders and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders than did subjects in the saxagliptin + metformin group.

Adverse events in the categories of special interest were generally infrequent and balanced across the treatment groups. The numbers of subjects with skin disorders, based on either total AEs in the SOC Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders, or AEs considered by the investigator to be related to treatment, were higher in the sitagliptin + metformin group compared with the saxagliptin + metformin group. Laboratory abnormalities classified as marked abnormalities (MAs) were few and balanced across the treatment groups. There was a small mean decrease in body weight in both treatment groups.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

The frequency of deaths in the Phase 2b/3 studies was similar in subjects who received saxagliptin and placebo. In the Phase 2b and 3 studies, a total of 16 deaths were reported; 2 subjects (0.2%) each in the saxagliptin 2.5 and 5 mg groups, 3 subjects (0.3%) in the saxagliptin 10 mg group, 5 subjects (0.5%) treated with placebo and 4 subjects (1.2%) treated with metformin. There was 1 death of a subject with a history of hepatic impairment who received saxagliptin in clinical pharmacology study CV181020 and 1 death possibly related to study medication.

At the time of the 4 MSU, a total of 22 deaths had occurred in the ST + LT period of the clinical program.

There were no deaths during study D1680C00002.

The frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) was generally comparable between the saxagliptin and  control  groups  throughout  the  six  Core  Phase  3  studies.  In  the  5  pooled  placebo-controlled monotherapy and combination studies, the proportion of subjects with SAEs was 3.4% in subjects who received saxagliptin 5 mg and 3.4% in subjects who received placebo.

Serious adverse events were uncommon in all studies, and there was no predominance of any single, specific SAE associated with saxagliptin treatment. In the individual studies, SAEs considered to be related to study drug ( ≤ 0.9%) or leading to discontinuation ( ≤ 1.6%) were infrequent in subjects who received saxagliptin and occurred at rates generally comparable to that of placebo.

In the comparative study with saxagliptin  a total of 12 subjects with SAEs were reported, 7 (1.7%) in the  saxagliptin  +  metformin  group  and  5  (1.3%)  in  the  sitagliptin  +  metformin  group.  One  subject (0.2%)  in  the  saxagliptin  +  metformin  group  and  2  subjects  (0.5%)  in  the  sitagliptin  +  metformin group had SAEs that were considered by the investigator to be treatment-related. Two subjects (0.5%) in the saxagliptin + metformin group and none in the sitagliptin + metformin group discontinued due to an SAE.

However  'long-term'  safety  data  cannot  be  considered  sufficient  until  now,  these  data  should  be updated. As stated previously this point is addressed in the risk management plan.

Incidence of hypoglycaemia was low with saxagliptin treatment. A higher incidence in hypoglycaemia was seen when saxagliptin was added to SU. This is a known phenomenon for antidiabetic drugs that are themselves not associated with hypoglycaemia. However, the incidence in the combination therapy group  was  not  different  from  that  in  the  SU  monotherapy  group,  despite  greater  reductions  in glycaemic  control  in  the  combination  treatment  group.  No  dose  reduction  of  saxagliptin  will  be required  when  it  is  added  to  an  SU.  A  lower  dose  of  SU  may  be  required  to  reduce  the  risk  of hypoglycaemia. This is reflected in section 4.4 of the SPC.

Until now evaluation of clinical data has not revealed signals that correlate to the skin findings in the Cynomolgus  monkey;  however,  the  conclusion  that  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  findings  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

monkey are applicable to humans cannot be drawn with certainty as long as there are no long-term observations.

In the pooled monotherapy analysis rash was more frequent in the All saxagliptin group relative to the placebo  group  (2.5%  vs.  0.6%).  The  pooled  placebo-controlled  safety  analysis  displayed  smaller differences between the treatment groups, but confirmed the trend of highest frequency in the 2.5 mg and 10 mg saxagliptin groups. The increases in skin-related AEs do not seem to be dose-dependent. In the pooled monotherapy analysis contact dermatitis was more frequent in the All saxagliptin group relative to the placebo group (1.2% vs. 0%). However, none of these cases were related to study drug. Taking into consideration the fact that skin lesions are a concern for other DPP-4 inhibitors and the limited  experience  in  patients  with  diabetic  skin  complications  treated  with  saxagliptin,  section  4.4 includes recommendations for monitoring for skin disorders, such as blistering, ulceration or rash in diabetic patients. Section 4.8 of the SPC also includes rash.

The  frequency  of  infection-related  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  was  low.  However,  there  are  no long-term  observations.  In  connection  to  this  it  is  of  importance  to  mention  that  in  other  DDP4inhibitors in the long-term serious allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema and exfoliative skin  reactions  as  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome  have  been  reported.  This  concern  has  been  taken  into account in the risk management plan.

Saxagliptin was not associated with prolongation of the QTc interval at 40 mg. The measurement of blood  pressure  (BP)  during  the  ST  period  for  the  pooled  monotherapy  studies  showed  a  small,  not clinically relevant, mean reduction in systolic and diastolic BP. Mean BP declined in all core phase 3 studies and specific safety signals were not detected.

Overall, the frequency of cardiovascular AEs was low across the monotherapy studies and the add-on combination  studies.  In  these  studies,  the  frequency  of  CV  deaths  was  0.2%  (4/2043)  in  subjects treated with saxagliptin and 0.8% (6/799) in subjects in the control group. In a metaanalysis of Phase 2/3 clinical trials, saxagliptin was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. The overall experience in patients with heart failure and other cardiac disorders is limited by the inclusion criteria in the studies. Information about the very limited experience in NYHA class I-II, and lack of experience in class III-IV is reflected in the SPC section 4.4.

The  frequency  of  localized  oedema  adverse  events  was  low.  However,  there  are  no  long-term observations. In relation to this it is of importance that in other DDP4-inhibitors in the long-term an increased  risk  of  localized  oedema  has  been  reported.  This  concern  is  addressed  in  the  risk management plan as a potential risk.

The frequency of oedema increased when saxagliptin 5 mg was added to TZD. This is probably due to increased fluid retention mainly because of increase in insulin secretion.

The frequency of hypersensitivity reaction adverse events was low. This is of importance as in other DDP4-inhibitors  in  the  long-term  an  increased  risk  of  hypersensitivity  reaction  adverse  events  has been  reported.  For  saxaglitpin  however  there  are  no  further  long-term  observations,  this  lack  of information is reflected in the risk management plan. In relation to the frequency of hypersensitivity AEs, although these had a low frequency, they occurred more frequently in the saxagliptin groups than in the placebo groups. These findings are reflected in section 4.8 of the SPC.

## · Laboratory findings

The clinical  significance  of  the  decrease  in  lymphocyte  count  is  not  known.  The  decrease  was  not correlated with infection related adverse events. However, there are no long-term observations. This concern is listed in the risk management plan. A pharmacoepidemiology study is proposed to further evaluate changes in lymphocyte counts over time and potential association between low lymphocyte count and infections related to T-cell dysfunction (active tuberculosis and herpes zoster).

Saxagliptin did not have an effect on CRP, fibrinogen, or IL-6 values.

In a pooled analysis of 5 Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies, comparable reductions from baseline in mean platelet count were observed in all treatment groups, including placebo. The magnitude of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

decrease was approximately 2% from a baseline platelet count of 260,000 cells/µL (260.0 x 109 c/L). There is no evidence that there is an effect of saxagliptin treatment on platelet count that is of clinical importance.

There were no clinically meaningful differences in fasting lipid parameters and physical measurements in  the  observed  long-term  values  compared  to  the  week  24  data.  The  fact  that  very  few  subjects remained in the studies at week 102 makes the interpretation difficult. After completion of the longterm extension studies, the applicant will provide results as a post-authorisation follow up measure.

## · Safety in special populations

The clinical adverse event profile of saxagliptin did not differ consistently within major subgroups, including by gender, age (&lt;65 and ≥ 65 years), race, ethnicity, BMI, duration of diabetes, and degree of renal  insufficiency.  In  an  analysis  of  5  pooled  placebo-controlled  monotherapy  and  combination studies,  71.3%  of  subjects  &lt;65  years  of  age  treated  with  saxagliptin  and  67.2%  of  subjects  in  the placebo  group  were  reported  to  have  AEs.  AEs  were  reported  in  fewer  subjects ≥ 65  years  of  age treated with saxagliptin compared with subjects treated with placebo (71.3% and 79.6%, respectively). No studies were done in pregnant subjects.

The Applicant compared AUC and Cmax in patients with moderate hepatic impairment for saxagliptin to sitagliptin. This comparison is not considered to be the most appropriate as hepatic elimination has a  larger  influence  on  saxagliptin  than  on  sitagliptin,  and  because  saxagliptin  also  has  an  active metabolite.  BMS-510849 was shown to be approximately 2-fold less potent than parent saxagliptin with respect to DPP-4, but is still considered to contribute to the DPP-4 inhibitory effect due to higher plasma concentrations than the mother substance.

The PK data available are based on an open-label single dose study including only 18 subjects with hepatic  impairment  (6  in  each  Child  Pugh  class),  thus  there  is  a  high  degree  of  uncertainty  in  the estimation  of  exposure.  No  subjects  with  hepatic  impairment  were  included  in  the  clinical  studies (2b/3-program). Based on this limited experience saxagliptin should be used with caution in patients with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  and  not  recommended  used  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic impairment. This is reflected in SPC section 4.2, 4.4 and 5.3.

As the clinical data regarding moderate renal impairment is scarce and there are no data for subjects with severe renal impairment, saxagliptin cannot be recommended for these subjects. Until more data in this patient group is available, saxagliptin should not be recommended to patients with moderate and severe renal impairment. Further data will be submitted post-authorisation.

## Immunological events

No  studies  on  immunological  events  are  presented,  nor  studies  in  immunocompromised  subjects. According to Richter et al. 1 ,  long-term  data  on  safety  are  needed  as  the  new  DPP-4  inhibitors  may influence  the  immune  system.  Together  with  complementary  activities  such  as  performing  a descriptive analysis of all events occurring in immunocompromised patients for all pharmacoepidemiology studies, and analysing all adverse events (serious and non serious) related to potentially  immunocompromised  subjects  in  the  planned  large  randomized  clinical  trial  on  CV outcomes, the Applicant will conduct 2 studies on severe hypersensitivity reactions and infections in hospitalized patients; this set of activities is considered sufficient to address immunological events.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

14  of  15  subjects  (93%)  who  received  the  combination  of  saxagliptin  and  ketoconazole,  reduced transiently  the  lymphocyte  count,  and  33%  experienced  transient  pyrexia,  chills  and  lymphopenia (study  CV181005).  In  study  CV181022,  again  a  transient  reduction  (mean  -30.6%)  in  lymphocyte count was found in subjects who received the combination of saxagliptin and ketoconazole.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

The frequency of AEs leading to discontinuation was low, most frequently lymphopenia, increased blood  CK,  increased  blood  creatinine,  nausea  and  eye  pain.  The  most  common  AEs  leading  to discontinuation in the metformin monotherapy were gastrointestinal disorders.

| Safety in patient with cardiovascular disease and/or compromised cardiac function (CHF) III and IV | Routine PhV An epidemiology study in US and European databases (CV181P66, see Annex 5) will be performed to estimate and compare the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among patients with type 2 diabetes who are new users of saxagliptin and those who are new users of other oral antidiabetic treatments. If an increased risk of MACE is noted among saxagliptin initiators, further analyses will be conducted to identify risk factors within the saxagliptin cohort. A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 4 trial to evaluate the effect of saxagliptin on the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes is planned. The proposed primary objective is to assess the time to first event for the composite endpoint of major adverse CV events (MACE, including CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non- fatal stroke) during treatment with saxagliptin compared with placebo when added to current care, in patients with type 2 diabetes. Clinically identified MACE will be adjudicated by an independent Clinical Event Committee (CEC), using prospectively defined criteria without knowledge of treatment group assignment. In addition, standard safety assessment will be performed. Trial duration: 5 years. Planned study population: 15%-20% from Europe. | 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Cardiac failure Experience in NYHA class I-II is limited, and there is no experience in clinical studies with saxagliptin in NYHA class III-IV. |

This is done for female patients who got pregnant after taking the drug and male patients taking drug at the time that the spouse or significant other becomes pregnant. Cases are followed up until final pregnancy outcome is registered. Adverse events for the mother, father, foetus and offsping are captured per pharmacovigilance standards. | 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are no data from the use of saxagliptin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity at high doses (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Onglyza should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Lactation It is unknown whether saxagliptin is excreted in human breast milk. Animal studies have shown excretion of saxagliptin and/or metabolite in milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast feeding or to discontinue therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy to the woman. |

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are a number of quality issues that will be resolved as Follow-up Measures within an agreed timeframe. None of these issues is expected to have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The in vitro affinity for the DPP4 enzyme has been shown and maximal enzyme inhibition measured ex vivo in plasma is evident at low doses. The affinity for other DPP's is low. In vivo efficacy has been

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

demonstrated in animal models by several pharmacodynamic endpoints. Long-term efficacy has not been demonstrated in an animal model.

The main metabolite of saxagliptin, BMS-510849, also has high affinity for the DPP4 enzyme, but shows less pharmacodynamic effect in terms of lowering glucose levels than the parent compound. Only at doses in excess of those required to produce maximal DPP4 inhibition, a significant in vivo effect was shown. The contribution of the metabolite to the overall efficacy of saxagliptin has not been fully elucidated.

Saxagliptin  was  evaluated in  vitro for  the  potential  to  antagonize  the  binding  of  appropriate radioligands to receptor and ion-channels or to inhibit different enzymes, with no significant effects observed. Cell surface DPP4 (also known as CD26) has been reported to function as a co-stimulatory signalling  molecule  in  T  lymphocyte  activation.  Inhibition  of  T-lymphocytes  was  shown  at  much higher concentrations of saxagliptin than is needed for DDP4  inhibition. Moreover, these concentrations exceed the Cmax that is measured in humans after therapeutic doses. However, due to the large volume of distribution is cannot be excluded that the concentration required to inhibit T cell activation is reached within the T cells.

No  significant  findings  were  reported  from  safety  pharmacology  studies,  and  therefore  no  adverse effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system is anticipated in humans. No non-clinical pharmacodynamic interaction studies were performed.

The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and BMS-510849, the active metabolite, have been adequately characterised.

Bioavailability following oral administration of saxagliptin was determined to be 70% in rat, 77% in dog and 51% in monkey. Saxagliptin exhibits a high volume of distribution at steady state in rat, dog and monkey (1.3-5.2 l/kg). Saxagliptin is cleared rapidly in rats (115 ml/min/kg) and at a moderate rate  in  dogs  (9.3  ml/min/kg)  and  monkeys  (14.5  ml/min/kg).  The  elimination  half-life  estimates  of saxagliptin are comparable for rat, dog and monkey (2.1-4.4 hr). When considering the toxicokinetic studies, the AUC increases linear with dose between 30 and 600 mg/kg for mouse, between 2 and 600 mg/kg  for  rat,  between  0.2  and  25  mg/kg  for  dog,  and  for  all  doses  investigated  for  monkey.  No substantial  accumulation  of  saxagliptin  and  BMS-510849  was  observed  after  once-daily  repeated dosing of saxagliptin.

The intrinsic membrane permeability of saxagliptin is very low. Both saxagliptin and BMS-510849 were not prominent substrates for P-gp or for cellular uptake transporters.

Protein binding of saxagliptin was not observed in dog and human, and low in mouse (27%), rat (18%) and monkey (20%). Protein binding of BMS-510849 was also very low in all species tested (up to 10%).

The  highest  concentrations  (1-12  h)  of  saxagliptin  related  material  were  found  in  gastrointestinal tissues, liver, urinary bladder and kidney. Since radioactivity was below 1% of the dose at 24 h postdose,  accumulation  is  not  expected.  Saxagliptin  and  BMS-510849  levels  were  lowest  in  the  brain. Saxagliptin-derived components cross the placenta in rats; as such Onglyza should not be used during pregnancy (see section 4.6 and 5.3 of the SPC).

The pathways for in vivo metabolism of saxagliptin in humans were qualitatively similar to those in mice,  rats,  dogs,  and  cynomolgus  monkeys.  BMS-510849  was  the  major  metabolite  identified  in plasma,  urine  and/or  faeces  in  all  species.  The  metabolic  profiles  from in  vitro studies  in  liver microsomes  and  hepatocytes from  various species were  also similar. Co-administration with ketoconazole and diltiazem, CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, resulted in a 2.5 and 2.1 fold increase of the AUC of  saxagliptin.    No  animal  studies  have  been  conducted  on  the  effects  of  CYP3A4  inducers  on the exposure of saxagliptin.

Following an oral dose of [ 14 C]saxagliptin, almost the entire radioactivity administered was recovered in  the  urine  and  faeces  of  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys.  Approximately  75%  of  the  dose  in  human  was excreted in the urine. In humans, saxagliptin and BMS-510849 accounted for 33.6% and 28.2% of the dose  in  urine  suggesting  that  both  elimination  of  unchanged  saxagliptin  and  metabolism  to  BMS510849 plays a major role in the disposition of saxagliptin. [ 14 C]saxagliptin-derived radioactivity was

excreted in milk, with radioactivity detected at all time points through 24 hours post-dose (see section 4.6 of SPC).

Interaction with other drugs via protein binding is not expected, since saxagliptin and BMS-510849 are  poorly  bound  to  plasma  proteins.  Saxagliptin  is  unlikely  to  cause  clinically  relevant  drug-drug interactions through either inhibition or induction of the major CYP isozymes.

The single and repeat dose toxicity of saxagliptin was adequately evaluated in rats, dogs and monkeys at  exposures  comparable to or markedly higher than the therapeutic exposure. In rats, the observed target organ changes were generally minimal splenic lymphoid hyperplasia, pulmonary histiocytosis, and  mononuclear-cell  infiltrates/inflammation  in  the  ocular  accessory  gland  and  liver  in  short  and long-term studies, and after 104 weeks of dosing, the lung, urinary bladder, and epididymis, but only at high doses. In dogs, the major finding was gastrointestinal toxicity characterized by bloody/mucoid feces  at  moderate  doses,  and  enteropathy  at  high  doses.  The  NOAEL  is  1  mg/kg/day  (4  times  the human exposure based on AUC). In monkeys, major target organ changes included reversible erosive and/or  ulcerative  skin  lesions  with  scab  formation  and  reversible  multi-tissue  mononuclear-cell infiltrates at low doses. The AUC at the NOAEL (0.3 mg/kg/day) for these changes was 1 (female) to 3 (male) times the human dose.

No genotoxic or carcinogenic potential was demonstrated.

The exposures of the active metabolite BMS-510849 in non-clinical studies were sufficiently high to exclude any unexpected toxic effects in a clinical setting.

Effects seen in reproduction toxicology studies were mild and confined to high doses with sufficient safety margins. High doses caused reduced ossification in both rats and rabbits, and decreased foetal body weight in rats.

Saxagliptin was considered a skin sensitizer, able to induce allergic contact dermatitis.

An  immunotoxic  effect  of  saxagliptin  cannot  be  excluded  based  on  the  data  provided,  and  this  is addressed in the risk management plan.

Two lines of investigation were conducted in monkeys and rats. In monkeys skin lesions were detected at low doses.. A possible relevance for humans cannot be excluded, and the potential of saxagliptin to induce skin lesions and gastro-intestinal effects is addressed in the risk management plan.

Saxagliptin is neither PBT nor vPvB. Risk to the surface water, groundwater, soil, and sewage treatment plant is acceptable.

## Efficacy

Core studies  of  this  application  are  6  phase  3  studies,  2  monotherapy  trials,  3  add-on  combination studies  and  1  initial  combination  therapy  trial.  Based  on  these  trials  a  marketing  authorisation  for saxagliptin as add-on combination and initial combination therapy was initially sought. Additionally topline results for an active comparator trial were submitted during the procedure. The claim for initial combination  therapy  was  withdrawn  during  the  procedure  (see  below).  Study  duration,  chosen endpoints, in- and exclusion criteria of the studies were generally adequate and in accordance with the current guideline.

Efficacy was assessed as monotherapy in  placebo controlled studies, but comparative studies were not  submitted.  The  results  on  HbA1c  lowering  as  compared  with  placebo  were  not  considered sufficient taking into account that there should be a clinically relevant difference from placebo and that only saxagliptin 10 mg dose in study CV181011 reached delta of -0.7%.

Furthermore, the choice of the 5mg dose as the optimal dose is not justified by these studies. A post hoc analysis provided showed that at 12 weeks 5 mg performed better than 2.5 mg. However, over a longer time period (50-102 weeks) no difference was found between both doses. From these studies it cannot be concluded with certainty that saxagliptin 5 mg per day is the optimal dose. At this moment the Applicant does not seek a monotherapy indication.

Efficacy was assessed in 3 add-on combination placebo controlled studies , with inclusion criteria of TZD failure, SU failure and metformin failure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  these  trials,  all  doses  of  saxagliptin,  except  saxagliptin  2.5  mg  +  TZD,  induced  a  reduction  in HbA1c that was superior to placebo:

- saxagliptin 2.5 mg + TZD : -0.36% [-0.57%, -0.15%];
- saxagliptin 5 mg + TZD : -0.63% [-0.54%, -0.42%];
- saxagliptin 2.5 mg + gly : -0.62% [-0.78%, -0.45%];
- saxagliptin 5 mg + gly : -0.72% [-0.88%, -0.56%];
- saxagliptin 2.5 mg + met : -0.73% [-0.92%, -0.53%];
- saxagliptin 5 mg + met : -0.83% [-1.02%, -0.63%];
- saxagliptin 10 mg + met : -0.72% [-0.91%, -0.52%]).

Reductions  in  HbA1c  were  observed  for  all  doses.  In  the  add-on  combination  placebo-controlled studies the 5 mg dose proved to be better as compared with the 2.5 mg dose both in the short and long term treatment.

With respect to the add-on to TZD trial the addition of saxagliptin to TZD was superior to placebo, and therefore the results are acceptable, albeit that the data suggest that patients in this study were not real TZD failures, and part of the effect might be due to the ongoing effect of the TZD.

An active comparator study is needed in the add-on studies; such a study was not originally submitted and this was a major objection. The initial combination study CV181039 did provide data to compare the safety and efficacy of saxagliptin 10 mg and metformin monotherapy. This study also showed that 10 mg is not more efficacious than 5 mg. However, it should be noted that the study population is different from the other core Phase 3 studies. A post-hoc analysis of treatment effects in subjects with a  baseline  HbA1c  &lt;10%  was  performed  to  demonstrate  generalizability  of  the  results  from  Study CV181039 to the expected treated population in clinical practice. Demographic data show a slightly higher mean age, higher body weight, and shorter duration of diabetes in this subgroup compared with the subgroup with HbA1c ≥ 10%. Results show that saxagliptin seems less effective than metformin, as is  the  case  for  other  DPP-4  inhibitors.  This  post-hoc  analysis  provides  useful  knowledge  about  the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin compared to metformin, even though the subgroup population had a somewhat  higher  mean  HbA1c  (8.8-8.7  %)  than  the  population  included  in  the saxagliptin monotherapy studies (7.8-8.0%). Even though no direct comparison between saxagliptin and the other DPP-4 inhibitors  was  originally  performed,  results  from  the  monotherapy  studies  suggest  a  similar reduction in HbA1c compared to vildagliptin and sitagliptin.

At  the  time  of  the  initial  assessment  the  Applicant  had  two  ongoing  active  controlled  trials,  one comparing saxagliptin + metformin with sitagliptin + metformin and the other saxagliptin + metformin with  SU  +  metformin.  Based  on  the  comparative  results  of  the  post-hoc  analysis  of  the  initial combination study it was considered acceptable to submit final results from these studies as follow-up measures  Concerning  the  saxagliptin  vs.  sitagliptin  study  an  abbreviated  study  report  with  topline results  was submitted during the procedure. Data from this study indicate non-inferiority within the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 0.3%. Final results of both comparative studies will be assessed further when the final results are submitted as a Follow-Up Measure.

Regarding the Initial  Combination  Active  Controlled  Study HbA1c mean changes from baseline (LOCF) during the ST + LT Treatment indicate that saxagliptin 5 mg + Met and saxagliptin 10 mg + Met are comparable over time and better than saxagliptin 10 mg or Metformin, whereas metformin is better than saxagliptin 10 mg. Although the difference in change in HbA1c was statistically significant compared  to  metformin,  the  95%  CI  is  wide  [-0.73,  -0.35]  and  hence  the  clinical  relevance  was considered questionable by the CHMP.

Initial combination therapy with saxagliptin and metformin however, is not in accordance with current European  and  American  therapeutic  guidelines  (Diabetes  Care,  vol.  32,  no.1,  January  2009)  that recommend starting with monotherapy. This claim could therefore not be granted and was withdrawn by the MAH.

## Safety

Once-daily, orally-administered saxagliptin was safe and well-tolerated at doses of up to 400 mg QD for 2 weeks, 100 mg QD for 6 weeks, 40 mg QD for 12 weeks, and at 2.5, 5, and 10 mg QD for up to 102 weeks. Saxagliptin given at doses of 2.5 and 5 mg was associated with an overall clinical AE profile that was comparable to placebo.

Although no comparative add-on combination treatment data are currently available to address how saxagliptin  compares  to  established  medications  in  treating  T2DM,  the  initial  combination  study CV181039  provided  data  to  compare  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  saxagliptin  10  mg  and  metformin monotherapy. Overall,  there  were  few  differences  between  saxagliptin  monotherapy  and  metformin monotherapy groups. The data of the ongoing comparative studies will provide further comparative data.

The  overall  profile  of  AEs  associated  with  extended  dosing  of  saxagliptin  for  up  to  2  years  was consistent with that seen at 24 weeks. However the number of long-term exposed subjects (&gt;24 weeks) is  limited.  This  point  will  be  addressed  post-authorisation  as  long-term  data  from  the  phase  3  core studies will be submitted as follow-up measures.

Specific  events  of  interest  were  hypoglycaemia  (combination  with  SU);  skin  lesions;  selected infections  (events  related  to  herpes  simplex  virus  or  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis);  decreased lymphocyte counts; decreased platelet counts; events of localized oedema (combination with TZD); the evaluation of CV events, abnormalities in liver function tests, and hypersensitivity reactions. The safety profile for saxagliptin in doses of 2.5 and 5 mg was similar to the safety profile of placebo for these events, except for those related to lymphocyte counts. At a saxagliptin dose of 5 mg, a small decrease  in  mean  absolute  lymphocyte  count  from  baseline  was  observed;  the  decreases  were  not associated with clinically relevant adverse events. No studies on immunological events are presented, nor studies in immunocompromised subjects. Long-term data on safety are needed as the new DPP-4 inhibitors  may  influence  the  immune  system.  To  address  this  concern  the  Applicant  will  perform complementary activities together with 2 studies on severe hypersensitivity reactions and infections in hospitalized patients.

A study on saxagliptin in subjects with moderate or severe renal impairment is ongoing. At this point in  time,  as  other  treatment  options  are  available  for  use  in  diabetic  patients  with  renal  impairment, saxagliptin is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.

No  dose  adjustment  is  needed  in  patients  with  mild  or  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  However,  in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) exposure to saxagliptin may be increased twofold. Saxagliptin should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and not recommended used in severe hepatic impairment.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

- User consultation

A readability  test  was  performed.  There  were  two  rounds  of  each  ten  participants  and  a  pilot  of  3 participants. There were 14 questions about the package leaflet and the participants were also asked to provide  feedback  in  terms  of  their  own  impressions.  The  questions  covered  the  following  areas sufficiently: traceability, comprehensibility and applicability. The test a criterion was that 81% of the participants must be able to answer correctly, i.e. must be able to find the information and act upon it. This test criterion has been met. The conclusions are clear, concise and clearly presented.

## Risk-benefit assessment

## Benefits

The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin is rather uncomplicated.

Saxagliptin at doses of 2.5 mg daily and higher can reduce HbA1c in T2DM subjects. However, given as monotherapy ,  results  were  not  convincing  and  less  effective  than  metformin.  Given  as  add-on treatment to metformin, SU or TZD, more relevant results were obtained: in the add-on trials all doses of saxagliptin, except saxagliptin 2.5 mg + TZD, induced a reduction in HbA1c which was superior to placebo.

At  the  time  of  the  initial  assessment  two  active  controlled  trials  were  ongoing,  one  comparing saxagliptin + metformin with sitagliptin + metformin and the other saxagliptin + metformin with SU + metformin  Preliminary  data  of  the  comparative  add-on  study  with  saxagliptin  that  were  submitted during the registration procedure indicate non-inferiority between saxagliptin and sitagliptin within the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 0.3%. Final results of both comparative studies will be submitted as a post-authorisation measure.

Neither  in  the initial  combination  study ,  nor  in  any  other,  has  it  been  shown  that  an  initial combination treatment would be a better option than adding a second glucose-lowering agent when the first does not show the intended effect. Initial combination therapy with saxagliptin and metformin is not  in  accordance  with  current  European  and  US  therapeutic  guidelines.  The  claim  for  initial combination therapy can not be granted and was subsequently withdrawn by the MAH.

## Risks

Once-daily, orally-administered saxagliptin was  safe  and well-tolerated at the doses studied. Saxagliptin given at doses of 2.5 and 5 mg was associated with an overall clinical AE profile that was comparable to placebo.

The  overall  profile  of  AEs  associated  with  extended  dosing  of  saxagliptin  for  up  to  2  years  was consistent with that seen at 24 weeks. However, the number of long-term exposed subjects is limited, a point which is addressed in the risk management plan.

As the clinical data regarding moderate renal impairment is scarce and there are no data for subjects with severe renal impairment, saxagliptin cannot be recommended for these subjects.

Data on immunological events and immunocompromised subjects is currently insufficient and will be collected through post-authorisation studies and complementary activities (see Safety section). Skin lesions  are  a  concern  for  other  DPP-4  inhibitors  and  there  is  limited  experience  in  patients  with diabetic skin complications treated with saxagliptin, therefore a warning has been included in section 4.4. At a saxagliptin dose of 5 mg, a small decrease in mean absolute lymphocyte count from baseline was observed; the decreases were not associated with clinically relevant adverse events.

The increased incidence of hypoglycaemia when saxaglipitin is administered in combination with SU, the increased incidence of peripheral oedema when saxagliptin is given in combination with TZD, and the observation of a decrease in lymphocyte count are described in the SPC.

The  overall  experience  in  patients  with  heart  failure  and  other  cardiac  disorders  is  limited  and information about the very limited experience in NYHA class I-II, and lack of experience in class IIIIV  is  reflected  in  the  SPC  section  4.4.  However,  in  a  metaanalysis  of  Phase  2/3  clinical  trials, saxagliptin was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

Saxagliptin should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

## Balance

Efficacy of saxagliptin was shown when given as add-on treatment to metformin, SU and TZD; and saxagliptin  was  considered  safe  and  well-tolerated.  However  the  number  of  long-term  exposed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects is limited in a product intended to be used in T2DM. Based on these results, the benefit-risk is considered acceptable for the currently claimed indications.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion  that  pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns. No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Onglyza  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  type  2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control:

- in combination with metformin, when metformin alone, with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control;
- in combination with a sulphonylurea, when the sulphonylurea alone, with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use of metformin is considered inappropriate.
- in combination with a thiazolidinedione, when the thiazolidinedione alone with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use of a thiazolidinedione is considered appropriate.

was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
