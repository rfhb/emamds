The SPC was updated to include information about the potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h, when the primary immunisation series is administered to very premature infants (born ? 28 weeks of gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. Nonetheless, preterm infants should not be withdrawn from the immunisation scheme because the benefit of vaccination |

A review of safety reports from the US Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, (VAERS), from the MAH's Worldwide Adverse Experience System database, (WAES) and from literature has shown that the onset of \"Polyarteritis nodosa\" and \"Eczema\" occurred in a close temporal relationship to the date of vaccination. Due to the seriousness of the events, their frequency and the temporal relationship with administration of the vaccine, the CHMP considered to include both adverse reactions in section 4.8 |
