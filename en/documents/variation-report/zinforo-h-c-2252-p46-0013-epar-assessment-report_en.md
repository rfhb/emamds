## 1. Introduction

The present paediatric data is submitted by the MAH in accordance with article 46 of Regulation EC No 1901/2006.

This submission for Ceftaroline, in the treatment of cSSTI and CAP, relates to the submission of the results from the clinical study P903-23 D3720C00004 (A Multicenter, Randomized, Observer-Blinded, Active-Controlled  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Safety,  Tolerability,  Efficacy,  and  Pharmacokinetics  of Ceftaroline  Versus  Comparator  in  Paediatric  Subjects  With  Acute  Bacterial  Skin  and  Skin  Structure Infections).

The  full  benefit  and  risk  profile  in  the  paediatric  population  will  be  evaluated  when  the  additional studies in the PIP have been completed. Paediatric patient exposure will continue to be specified as missing information in the EU Risk Management Plan until the completion of the paediatric studies. In view of this no changes to the SPC and proposed at this stage.

The overall benefit to risk balance for Zinforo is not affected by this new information and therefore does  not  require  taking  further  regulatory  action  on  the  marketing  authorization  for  Zinforo  at  this stage.

## About the product

Ceftaroline fosamil is the prodrug of ceftaroline and is rapidly converted to microbiologically active drug after intravenous (iv) administration. Ceftaroline, inhibits bacterial cell growth by interfering with cell wall  biosynthesis.  Ceftaroline  has  high  affinity  for  PBP2a  and  is  highly  potent  against  resistant staphylococci.  Ceftaroline  has  also  been  shown  to  bind  with  high  affinity  to  PBPs  in  S.  pneumoniae including modified forms of PBP2x which are common in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP).

Ceftaroline is approved for treatment of adult patients with cSSTI and CAP in the EU since August 2012. The recommended dosing regimen is 600 mg (reduced to 400 mg for patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30 to ≤50 mL/min) administered as a 60-minute infusion every 12 hours (q12h) for 5 to 14 days for cSSTI and 5 to 7 days for CAP.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that this study is a randomised, observer-blinded study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ceftaroline versus active comparator in paediatric patients, ages 2 months to &lt; 18 years, with ABSSI including patients with infection due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and is a completed study from the EU Pharmacovigilance Plan and the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP Study 3).

## 2.2. Clinical

As part of the EU-RMP and PIP, the MAH conducted the clinical study. The study is described briefly below (for further details please refer to the full CSR).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study D3720C00004

## Study design

This  was  a  phase  2/3  multicenter,  randomized,  observer-blinded,  active-controlled,  parallel-group study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  PK  of  intravenous  (IV)  ceftaroline  versus  IV  comparator (vancomycin or cefazolin with or without aztreonam) in paediatric subjects from the ages of 2 months to  &lt;  18  years  with  ABSSSI.  Aztreonam  was  available  for  administration,  if  required,  during  IV treatment  with  comparator,  if  an  infection  involving  a  Gram-negative  pathogen  was  identified  or suspected.

Subjects were stratified by age cohort and region and were randomly assigned to treatment in a 2:1 ratio, ceftaroline fosamil to comparator. The following age cohorts were defined:

Cohort 1: children from 12 years to &lt; 18 years

Cohort 2: children from 6 years to &lt; 12 years

Cohort 3: children from 24 months to &lt; 6 years

Cohort 4: young infants/toddlers from 2 months to &lt; 24 months

A minimum of 7 intravenous (IV) doses was required for subjects randomized to ceftaroline fosamil. A switch to open label oral study drug (cephalexin [preferred oral switch], clindamycin, or linezolid) was allowed on or after Study Day 4 if a subject met the protocol-specified criteria. The total duration of study drug therapy (IV and oral, or IV alone) was 5 to 21 days.

Subjects with ABSSSI presenting to the hospital or acute care facility were to receive their first dose of antimicrobial therapy within a medically appropriate time frame. Study Day 1 was defined as the first day  of  IV  study  drug  administration,  and  subsequent  study  days  were  defined  by  the  number  of consecutive  calendar  days  thereafter.  The  End-of-Intravenous  Study  Drug  (EOIV)  visit  assessments were performed within 24 hours after administration of the last dose of IV study drug, and before oral switch, if applicable. The End-of Therapy (EOT) visit assessments were performed within 48 hours after the last dose of oral study drug. The Test-of-Cure (TOC) visit assessments were performed 8 - 15 days after the final dose of study drug (IV or oral, whichever was given last), and the Late-Follow-up (LFU) visit assessments were performed 21 - 35 days after the last dose of study drug (IV or oral). At the time  of  premature  discontinuation  of  study  drug  or  early  withdrawal  from  study  during  IV  or  oral therapy (eg, Study Days 4 to ≤ 14), EOIV (if on IV study drug) or EOT  (if  on  oral  study  drug) assessments  were  to  be  performed  on  the  day  of  premature  discontinuation  of  study  drug  or withdrawal from study.

## Study site and dates

The  study  was  conducted  by  Cerexa,  US  between  21/08/2012  and  13/05/2014.  The  study  had appropriate ethics approval and was performed according to GCP. Seventy one sites were enrolled but only 38 actually enrolled patients for the study.

## Study Objectives

## Primary

-To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ceftaroline versus vancomycin or cefazolin with or without aztreonam in paediatric patients, ages 2 months to &lt;18 years, with cSSTI.

## Secondary

-To evaluate the efficacy of ceftaroline versus vancomycin or cefazolin with or without aztreonam in paediatric patients, ages 2 months to &lt;18 years, with cSSTI.

## Optional Oral Switch, Dose and Mode of Administration:

Subjects may have been switched from IV to open-label oral study drug (cephalexin at 25 mg/kg q6h [preferred switch], clindamycin 10 mg/kg q8h, or linezolid [600 mg every 12 hours (q12h) [Cohort 1] or 10 mg/kg q8h [Cohorts 2, 3, and 4]) on or after Study Day 4.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Duration of Treatment

Total duration of study drug therapy (IV and oral, or IV alone) was 5 to 14 days; a minimum of 3 days (7 infusions for subjects randomized to ceftaroline fosamil) of IV study drug therapy was required. The total duration of subject participation was expected to be 26 to 50 days.

## Criteria for Evaluation

## Efficacy:

Clinical  response at  Study  Day  3  in  the  MITT  Population  according  to  the  following definitions:

- Definition 1: ≥ 20% reduction from baseline in total infection area (length × width)
- Definition 2: cessation of spread relative to baseline as measured by total infection area (ie, the total infection area on Study Day 3 was less than or equal to that at baseline)
- Definition  3:  cessation  of  spread  relative  to  baseline  as  measured  by  length  and  width, separately  (ie,  both  length  and  width  on  Study  Day  3  was  less  than  or  equal  to  their  respective measurements  at  baseline),  AND  temperature  was  &lt;  37.6°C  on  Study  Day  3,  irrespective  of temperature collection method and baseline temperature

Clinical outcome at End-of-Intravenous Study Drug (EOIV), End-of-Therapy (EOT), and Testof-Cure (TOC) in the MITT and CE populations

Clinical and microbiological outcomes by subject and by baseline pathogen at TOC in the mMITT and ME populations

Clinical relapse at Late-Follow-up (LFU) in the MITT Population

Emergent infections

in the mMITT Population

## Safety:

Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, and discontinuations due to AEs; clinical laboratory parameters; vital signs measurements

## Statistical methods

The following study populations were defined:

ITT Population: all randomized subjects

Safety Population: all randomized subjects who received any amount of IV study drug

MITT Population: all randomized subjects who receive any amount of IV study drug and who had a confirmed diagnosis of ABSSSI

CE Population: a subset of the MITT Population and included subjects who met minimal disease criteria for ABSSSI and all evaluability criteria mMITT Population: a subset of the MITT Population and included subjects for whom at least 1 typical bacterial  pathogen was identified from a blood culture or from an appropriate microbiological tissue specimen of the primary ABSSSI at baseline

ME Population: all subjects who met the criteria for both the CE and mMITT populations.

Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  Population:  a  subset  of  the  Safety  Population  and  included  all  randomized subjects who received a known amount of ceftaroline fosamil and who had had at least 1 PK sample collected (excluding those who received blood or blood component transfusions within 24 hours before any PK sample was drawn)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Efficacy: The study was not powered for comparative inferential analysis, and no efficacy endpoint was identified as primary. Efficacy response was analyzed using the MITT, CE, mMITT, and ME populations. Proportions  of  subjects  with  favourable  efficacy  responses  were  displayed  by  treatment  group,  both overall and within each age cohort. The difference between treatment groups in efficacy response rates was calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for both the within-group response rates and the between-group difference for each efficacy response.

Safety:  Safety  parameters  (AEs,  SAEs,  deaths,  clinical  laboratory  parameters,  and  vital  signs measurements) were summarized for the Safety Population.

## Study monitoring

An external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was established to review safety data from this study, and other ongoing paediatric studies of ceftaroline fosamil, at prespecified intervals to ensure safety of all subjects enrolled.

## Results

## Study Disposition

163 subjects were randomized (2:1) to receive study drug (110 subjects to ceftaroline fosamil and 53 subjects  to  comparator)  (ITT  Population),  and  159  subjects  received  IV  study  drug).  The  2:1 randomization scheme was appropriately maintained for all age cohorts and all regions that enrolled subjects. The highest enrollment by age cohort (52 subjects) was in Cohort 2 (ie, children from 6 years to &lt; 12 years); the remaining cohorts each enrolled between 35 - 39 subjects.

## Demographics and Baseline Characteristics

The majority of subjects in the MITT Population were male (55.3%), white (87.4%), with a mean age of 7 years (range 9 weeks - 17 years). Demographic characteristics were generally similar across the 2 treatment groups. With the exception of Cohort 2, the age cohorts were evenly distributed within each treatment group. Both treatment groups had the highest percentage of enrolment in Cohort 2. The majority of subjects had normal or mildly impaired renal function. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen identified (40.2% of subjects in the ceftaroline group and 42.3% of subjects in the comparator group), and the majority of S. aureus pathogens were methicillin-sensitive.

## Efficacy

-The clinical  response  rates  at  Study  Day  3  were,  by  all  3  definitions  of  response,  high  and  similar between the 2 treatment  groups for the MITT population: (Definition 1: 85.0% vs. 84.6%; Definition 2: 91.6% vs. 90.4%; and Definition 3: 80.4% vs. 75.0%).

-Clinical cure rates at TOC were high and similar for both the ceftaroline and comparator groups for both the MITT (94.4% and 86.5%, respectively) and CE populations (100% and 97.8%, respectively). Similar results in clinical outcomes were also observed at the EOIV and EOT assessments. No subject in either treatment group had a relapse at the LFU assessment.

## Safety results

- -Study  drug  exposure  was  similar  between  the  ceftaroline  and  comparator  treatment  groups.  The median duration of IV treatment was 5.0 days in both treatment groups. More than half of the subjects switched to oral study drug and the median duration of exposure to study drug (IV and oral combined) was 10 days in both treatment groups.
- -Similar percentages of subjects in each treatment group reported at least one treatment-emergent AE (48% vs. 43%). Few SAEs were reported, with 6 SAEs reported for 5 subjects (4 [3.8%] subjects in the  ceftaroline  group,  and  one  [1.9%]  subject  in  comparator  group).  Two  of  the  SAEs  (Clostridium difficile colitis and hypersensitivity) in the ceftaroline group and no SAEs in the comparator group were considered  related  to  IV  study  drug  treatment.  Two  subjects  (1.8%)  in  the  ceftaroline  group discontinued IV study drug due to an SAE (drug hypersensitivity and osteomyelitis, one subject each).
- -No deaths were reported during this study.
- -No trends were seen in shifts from baseline for clinical laboratory parameters. The rates of occurrence of  potentially  clinically  significant  (PCS)  hematology,  chemistry,  and  other  laboratory  parameter abnormalities  were  low.  The  Coombs  test  seroconversion  rate  was  17.2%  and  was  as  expected  for subjects in the ceftaroline group, and no cases of hemolytic anemia occurred. No subject met Hy's law laboratory criteria that were applied to the paediatric population in the study.

-Mean changes over time in vital signs measurements, were similar between both treatments.

## Applicant's Conclusion

Safety data indicate that treatment of paediatric subjects with ceftaroline fosamil was well tolerated. The clinical outcomes in the ceftaroline treatment group were comparable to those in the comparator treatment group.

## 2.3. Discussion

This phase 2/3 study was conducted to address the FDA paediatric PMR (PMR 1692-003) and the EMA PIP  commitment  (PIP  Study  3)  to  perform  a  randomized  comparison  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  and comparators in paediatric subjects with ABSSSI, including subjects with infection caused by MRSA.

The ceftaroline fosamil dose regimen of 12 mg/kg (up to 400 mg for children weighing &gt; 33 kg) q8h as a 60-minute infusion for children 6 months and older and 8 mg/kg q8h as a 60-minute infusion for subjects younger than 6 months was predicted to result in ceftaroline free drug % T &gt; MIC values that were  similar  to  or  greater  than  median  model-derived  values  for  adult  patients  dosed  with  the currently approved dose of 600 mg q12h. Based on the simulations for this dose regimen, &gt; 90% of patients 2 months to &lt; 18 years of age were predicted to achieve PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) targets in plasma associated with 1-log kill of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in the murine thigh infection model (36% and 44% T &gt; MIC, respectively) for organisms with MIC values up to 1 mg/L for S. aureus and 0.5 mg/L for S. pneumoniae. The high PK/PD target attainment was expected to result in efficacy for paediatric patients comparable to that demonstrated for ceftaroline in adult patients with ABSSSI and CABP. The median Cmax and AUC values in children with normal renal function 2 months to &lt; 18 years of age dosed with 12 mg/kg (up to 400 mg) q8h were predicted to be up to approximately 12% and 38% greater, respectively, than the median Cmax and AUC values in adults dosed with 600 mg q12h.

The  comparators  and  their  dosing  regimens  were  based  on  their  approved  indications,  clinical guidelines, and local prescribing preferences.

In  general,  demographics  were  balanced  between  treatment  groups.  In  the  study  there  were  no unexpected safety issues, the tolerability was acceptable and efficacy was similar to the comparator. Although PK results will be reported separately, it appears the choice of doses for the various cohorts was appropriate based on the efficacy seen. These doses are slightly different to those utilised in study P024  in  paediatric  patients  with  CAP.  The  MAH  should  comment  on  this  during  review  of  the  final paediatric submission.

Study enrolment met minimum target numbers of subjects in each cohort. Overall, demographics were generally  balanced  between  the  2  treatment  groups  with  baseline  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of ABSSSI as anticipated for this study population.

The overall clinical response to treatment with ceftaroline fosamil at Study Day 3 was generally similar to that of comparator in the MITT Population. Clinical cure rates at TOC in the MITT and CE populations were  high  and  similar  between  both  treatment  groups.  No  subject  in  either  treatment  group  had relapse at the LFU assessment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety data indicate that ceftaroline fosamil was safe and well tolerated when administered for 3 up to 14 days. The occurrence of TEAEs was similar between the 2 treatment groups.  Mean values and changes from baseline over time for vital signs measurements were similar between both treatment groups.

In addition to this study, further paediatric studies are planned as part of PIP. Therefore no further action is proposed at this stage.

## 2.4. Changes to the product information

The MAH proposed no changes to the Product Information, which is acceptable at this stage as further paediatric studies are planned.

## 3. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

Based  on  the  results  of  the  newly  completed  study  which  evaluates  the  safety  and  tolerability  of ceftaroline versus active comparator in paediatric patients, aged 2 months to &lt; 18 years, with ABSSI, it  is  considered  that  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  ceftaroline  in  this  population  is  acceptable  and  no unexpected concerns have been identified.

Therefore this does not change the benefit/risk balance.

## 4. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

The  benefit/risk  balance  remains  positive  in  the  approved  indications  at  present.  A  final  decision regarding any change to the product literature related to the paediatric population will be taken upon completion  of  all  the  clinical  studies  planned  in  this  population  under  the  PIP.  The  MAH  should comment on the different dosing regimens for ABSSI and CAP used in paediatric patients during review of the final paediatric submission.
