1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0047            | Submission of an updated RMP version 10.2 in order to remove all important potential risks and missing information from the list of safety concerns, to align with the new RMP format according to Good Pharmacovigilance Practices Module V Revision 2 and to remove one closed post-authorisation safety study of category 2 (Recordati Rare Diseases' Vedrop registry) from the pharmacovigilance plan. C.I.11.b - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the obligations and conditions of a marketing authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of change(s) which require to be further substantiated by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH | 07/03/2024 | n/a | The Vedrop registry study (final study report was submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 20 April 2017 in variation II/0022) collected safety data on a significant proportion of treated patients and did not point to serious adverse consequences of Vedrop treatment. From a risk management perspective, no specific pharmacovigilance activities are foreseen to further characterise the risks of Vedrop. Removal of the safety concerns related to Vedrop from the RMP is justified. |

Consequently, the remaining specific obligation is considered fulfilled and the positive benefit/risk ratio for Vedrop in the approved indication remains unchanged. Due to the rarity of the disease, and despite the additional data gathered through the fulfilment of the specific obligations, the data are still not as comprehensive as a full marketing authorisation would require. The MAH shall therefore continue to provide yearly updates on any new information concerning efficacy and safety of the product in patients with congenital chronic cholestasis or hereditary cholestasis as a condition (specific obligation) to the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances.   |

Following data from the ongoing registry and spontaneous reports in which no patient reported a renal insufficiency that could be related to Vedrop and data from the registry showing no impact on estimated glomerular filtration rate the precautionary statement 'Renal function and serum osmolarity should be evaluated and monitored under treatment with Vedrop' was deleted from 4.4 of the SmPC. Furthermore following three cases of abdominal pain including one positive de-challenge reported abdominal pain was added with the frequency unknown in 4.8 of the SmPC. |
