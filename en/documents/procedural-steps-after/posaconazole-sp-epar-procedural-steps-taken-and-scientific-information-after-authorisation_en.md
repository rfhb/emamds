| II/0011 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of section 4.8 of the SPC to reflect the adverse event terms according to MedDRA terminology and to be in compliance with the most recent EU SPC guidance. In addition section 4 of the PL was aligned with the psychiatric disorders events listed in the SPC section 4.8. The MAHtook this opportunity to update the contact details of the local representatives in Austria, Bulgaria, Finland and Poland in section 6 of the PL. | 23/10/2008          | 04/12/2008                               | SPC, PL                          | Following the assessment of variation II/07 the Marketing Authorisation Holder committed to submit a variation to bring section 4.8 of the SPC in line with the correct EU SPC guidance. Based on data from clinical trials and post marketing surveillance setting, section 4.8 was thus updated in accordance with MedDRA terminology. A single table for all adverse events regardless of source and appropriate cross reference to the warnings section was included. In addition 'Sudden behaviour changes, problems with thinking or speech' was added to section 4 of the PL to reflect the psychiatric disorders events listed in section 4.8 of the SPC.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| II/0007 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC to include updated wording regarding hepatic events following CHMP assessment of PSUR 3 (covering the period 26.10.2006 - 25.04.2007). The PL has been updated accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 24/01/2008          | 03/03/2008                               | SPC, PL                          | In the framework of the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 3, a cumulative review of hepatic events was presented by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH). This cumulative review included only serious events and selected 17 cases of 'severe' liver injury out of a total 112 cases for detailed review. Of these, 11 cases had a fatal outcome with 2 outcomes unknown. Further to the assessment of this cumulative review, the CHMP concluded that it could not be excluded that posaconazole was the main contributor to the serious hepatic events and fatal outcome in many cases and the potentially fatal outcome of such events is not currently reflected in the SPC. Additionally, it was noted that the SPC already carries a warning in section 4.4 concerning serious hepatic events and lists several hepatic |

However, on the basis of the high case fatality rate associated with serious hepatic events, the CHMP concluded that the SPC should be further amended in sections 4.4 and 4.8 in relation to fatal outcomes and that section 4 of the PL has been amended to reflect the new SPC wording.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| II/0004 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC with interaction data from a clinical study evaluating the effect of posaconazole on the pharmacokinetics of four CYP3A4 substrates (midazolam, sirolimus, efavirenz and boosted atazanavir) in healthy volunteers. The MAHtook the opportunity to update the PL with the contact details of the local representatives in Italy, Latvia, Norway and The Netherlands. | 20/09/2007          | 30/10/2007                               | SPC, PL                          | This open label study was made of 4 parts corresponding to the 4 CYP3A4 substrates. The study showed that: - Co-administered with oral or intra-venous midazolam, posaconazole increases midazolam blood levels, - Co-administered with sirolimus, posaconazole had a marked effect on plasma levels of sirolimus, - Co-administered with atazanavir, posaconazole had a marked effect on unboosted atazanavir and on ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plasma levels. Furthermore, atazanavir being usually administered with ritonavir in the European Union, posaconazole has a marked effect on ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plasma levels. - Co-administration of oral efavirenz and posaconazole resulted in clinically relevant decreases in posaconazole Cmax and AUC. The Product Information has been updated to reflect that blood levels of posaconazole can be decreased by efavirenz and that posaconazole can increase blood levels of sirolimus, atazanavir and midazolam. |
| II/0002 | Extension of Indication Update of the section 4.1 of the SPC to extend the current approved indications with treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC). Consequently sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SPC have been updated. The PL has been updated accordingly.                                                                                                                                                                                             | 21/09/2006          | 30/10/2006                               | SPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL  | Please refer to the Scientific Discussion: PosaconazoleSP-H-610-II-02-AR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
