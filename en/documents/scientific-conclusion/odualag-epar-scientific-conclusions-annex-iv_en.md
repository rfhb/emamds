## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for nivolumab / relatlimab, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on immune-mediated adverse reactions in patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease is at least a reasonable possibility from the literature, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between nivolumab / relatlimab and immune-mediated adverse reactions in patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing nivolumab / relatlimab should be amended accordingly.

In view of available data on myasthenia gravis from clinical trials, spontaneous reports, literature and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between nivolumab / relatlimab and myasthenia gravis is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing nivolumab / relatlimab should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nivolumab / relatlimab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nivolumab / relatlimab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information
