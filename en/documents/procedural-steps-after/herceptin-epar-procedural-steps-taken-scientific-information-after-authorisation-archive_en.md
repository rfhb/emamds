|         | Herceptin 150mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion and sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC for Herceptin 600mg solution for injection in vial, in order to update the safety information based on the final results from study BO22227 (Hannah) listed as a category 3 study in the RMP; this is a phase III, randomised, open-label study to compare pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of subcutaneous (SC) Herceptin with intravenous (IV) Herceptin administered in women with HER2 positive early breast cancer (EBC). Section 4.7 of the SmPC is also updated to reflect Herceptin has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP version 19.0 has also been approved.

The final analysis at a median follow- up exceeding 70 months showed similar event-free-survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients who received Herceptin IV and those who received Herceptin SC. The 6-year EFS rate was 65% in both arms and the OS rate, 84% in both arms. Data were also updated concerning the incidence of cardiac failure (i.e. 0.3% in the Herceptin IV arm; 0.7% in the Herceptin SC arm is unchanged), the incidence of anti-trastuzumab antibodies (i.e. 10.1%) and neutralizing anti-trastuzumab antibodies (i.e. 2 of 30 patients in the Herceptin IV arm and 3 of 47 in the Herceptin SC arm) which had no impact on EFS.   |

| II/0135   | Submission of the final report from study BO20652 (OHERA), a non-interventional study aimed to determine the incidence of symptomatic congestive heart failure and cardiac death in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer treated with Herceptin as per routine clinical practice. This study is listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. The RMP version 18.0 has also been updated. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 28/09/2017   | n/a   | The results from the Study BO20652 (OHERA) final analysis are consistent with prior cardiac safety results reported from Herceptin adjuvant early breast cancer (EBC) studies, such as the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) (Study BO16348) but with slightly higher incidences of cardiac related events NYHA class II-IV. This difference may be related to patients with risk factors treated in OHERA and excluded in HERA. In addition, the study had limitation limiting the interpretation of the finding. The results of the study also raised the need to create awareness that cardiac monitoring in patients should be performed in line with the recommendations as per the SmPC. |

| II/0104 | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in line with long- term efficacy and safety data based on the 10-year follow-up final CSR for Study BCIRG 006. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes and to update the annexes in line with the latest QRD template. The provision of the CSR addresses the post-authorisation measure MEA 082.1. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 18/02/2016 | 11/01/2017 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | Section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated and reflects the results from the 10-year follow-up of study BCIRG 006 and the previously obtained Joint Analysis of Studies NSABP B- 31 and NCCTG N9831. It is agreed that the exploratory analyses of the patient subgroups were generally consistent with an increased DFS duration in favor of the Herceptin- containing arms compared with the AC → T arm, and were consistent with the patient subgroup findings at the 5-year follow-up. Further, it is agreed that the AC → TH and TCH treatment regimens continue to be important adjuvant therapy regimens for HER2-positive EBC patients with either node- negative or node-positive status. Symptomatic cardiac events included symptomatic congestive heart failure, Grade 3 or 4 arrhythmia, Grade 3- 4 ischemia or myocardial infarction, probable cardiac death; clinically significant asymptomatic cardiac events included decline of >15 percentage points in left ventricular ejection fraction compared with baseline and below the lower limit of normal. In this regard it is agreed that long- term follow-up is presented as 5-year data, i.e. exploratory analysis of DFS plus symptomatic cardiac events. The cardiac safety follow-up was not as rigorous between the 5- year and 10-year follow up. Regardless of the regimen used, most symptomatic cardiac events occurred within the first 18 months of treatment. |

| II/0080     | Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add the adverse reactions (ADRs) of stomatitis and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome with the frequency category of 'very common' and to reassign the frequency of existing adverse reactions of the SmPC further to a review of safety information from pivotal clinical studies. Section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC are also updated with regards to the ADRs Interstitial lung disease (ILD), pulmonary hypoplasia and renal hypoplasia reported in the post-marketing setting and currently described in other sections of the SmPC. The data in section 4.8 of the SmPC is also revised to include the information from the 1- year Herceptin treatment arm of Study BO16348 (HERA). The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

The submission of these results is in accordance with a post authorization measure requested by the CHMP at the approval of the extension of indication to include concurrent use of Herceptin with chemotherapy in the adjuvant treatment of patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer as part of a treatment regimen consisting of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel, or combination with docetaxel and carboplatin. The primary endpoint of trial NSABP B-31 was Overall Survival (OS), with Disease Free Survival (DFS) and safety as secondary endpoints. When the plan for a joint analysis was approved, DFS was made the primary efficacy endpoint and OS became a secondary efficacy endpoint. Overall survival was a secondary efficacy endpoint in study NCCTG N9831 and the Joint Analysis of Studies NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831. Updated information is provided after 8 years of follow up |

The Summary of Efficacy results from the joint analysis of  the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 trials will be reported at  the time of the definitive DFS analysis and the updated 8  year follow up preplanned overall survival analysis from the  joint analysis of trials NSABPB-31 and NCCTG N9831.  Post-hoc exploratory analysis Results from the Joint  Analysis NSABP B-31/NCCTG, N9831 and BCIRG006 Clinical  Studies combining DFS Events and Symptomatic Cardiac  Events remains as was previously, i.e. with data up to  median of 2 years follow up.  No updated information is presented in the SmPC regarding  DFS data. Since DFS has been upgraded to be the primary  endpoint  for each study and the joint analysis, the updated  DFS outcomes following 8 years approximately, were also  presented in the SmPC as follows:  'DFS analysis was also performed at the final analysis of  OS from the joint analysis of studies NSABP B-31 and  NCCTG N9831. The updated DFS analysis results (stratified  HR = 0.61; 95% CI [0.54, 0.69]) showed a similar DFS  benefit compared to the definitive primary DFS analysis,  despite 24.8% patients in the AC  →  P arm who crossed over  to receive Herceptin. At 8 years, the disease-free survival  rate was estimated to be 77.2% (95% CI: 75.4, 79.1) in  the AC  →  PH arm, an absolute benefit of 11.8%  compared  with the AC  →  P arm.'

| II/0068/G | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to include the outcomes of the final analysis of 8-year follow-up from Study B016348 (HERA) in adjuvant breast cancer. Update section 4.4 to include a statement on the traceability of Herceptin. Update of sections 4.2, 4.5 and 4.8 to harmonise information from the recent assessment of the subcutaneous formulation of Herceptin. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Editorial changes are proposed throughout the PI. Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 9.0. The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 21/11/2013 | 18/12/2013 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | The current submission to support an update to the Herceptin product information is based on the results of the final 8 year median follow up analyses from Study BO16348 (HERA), a randomized, three arm, open-label, multicenter, Phase 3 study in patients randomized upon completion of definitive surgery and systemic adjuvant chemotherapy, to receive no Herceptin (Observation), or Herceptin for 1 year or 2 years, in a 1:1:1 ratio. A final analysis was performed after a median follow-up of 8 years, which showed that 1 year Herceptin treatment is associated with a 24 %risk reduction compared to observation only (HR=0.76, 95 %CI 0.67, 0.86). This translates into an absolute benefit in terms of an 8 year disease free survival rate of 6.4 percentage points in favour of 1 year Herceptin treatment. In this final analysis, extending Herceptin treatment for a duration of two years did not show additional benefit over treatment for 1 year [DFS HR in the intent to treat (ITT) population of 2 years vs 1 year=0.99 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.13), p-value=0.90 and OS HR=0.98 (0.83, 1.15); p- value= 0.78]. This update confirms the positive benefit - risk ratio of Herceptin in the adjuvant setting. The currently recommended one-year dosing regimen is sufficient for efficacy whereas the rate of cardiac dysfunction is |

The addition of a statement on the traceability of trastuzumab is in accordance with relevant guidelines and also aims to ensure effective pharmacovigilance monitoring. This variation concerns extensive revisions of the product information requested by the CHMP in order to harmonise with changes implemented during the procedure X/60 (subcutaneous formulation) for completeness of the text and to avoid potential medication errors with the currently available two different methods of administration, throughout the product information.

| II/0062 | Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC to incorporate information regarding drug-drug interactions (DDI) for Herceptin with various chemotherapeutic agents. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 17/01/2013 | 26/08/2013 | SmPC | No formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Clinically significant interactions with the concomitant medication used in clinical trials have not been observed based on the results of a population PK analysis (HO407g, HO551g, HO649g, and HO648g). Pharmacokinetic data from studies BO15935 and M77004 in women with HER2-positive MBC suggest that exposure to paclitaxel and doxorubicin (and their major metabolites 6-α hydroxyl-paclitaxel, POH, and doxorubicinol, DOL) is not altered in the presence of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg IV loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg q3w or 2 mg/kg q1w IV,resp.). However, trastuzumab may elevate the overall exposure of one doxorubicin metabolite, (7-deoxy-13 dihydro- doxorubicinone, D7D). The bioactivity of D7D and the clinical impact of the elevation of this metabolite is unclear. Data from study JP16003, a single-arm study of trastuzumab (4 mg/kg IV loading dose and 2 mg/kg IV weekly) and docetaxel (60 mg/m2 IV) in Japanese women with HER2- positive MBC, suggest that concomitant administration of trastuzumab has no effect on the single dose pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. Study JP19959 was a substudy of BO18255 (ToGA) performed in male and female Japanese patients with advanced gastric cancer to study the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and cisplatin when used with or without trastuzumab. The results of this small substudy suggested that the exposure to the bioactive metabolites (e.g. 5-FU) of capecitabine was not affected by concurrent use of cisplatin or by concurrent use |

However, capecitabine itself showed higher concentrations and a longer half-life when combined with trastuzumab. The data also suggested that the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin were not affected by concurrent use of capecitabine or by concurrent use of capecitabine plus trastuzumab. By comparison of simulated serum trastuzumab concentrations after trastuzumab monotherapy (4 mg/kg loading/2 mg/kg q1w IV) and observed serum concentrations in Japanese women with HER2- positive MBC (study JP16003) no evidence of a PK effect of concurrent administration of docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was found. Comparison of PK results from two Phase II studies (BO15935 and M77004) and one Phase III study (H0648g) in which patients were treated concomitantly with Herceptin and paclitaxel and two Phase II studies in which Herceptin was administered as monotherapy (W016229 and MO16982), in women with HER2-positive MBC indicates that individual and mean Herceptin trough serum concentrations varied within and across studies but there was no clear effect of the concomitant administration of paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab.   |

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 19/01/2012   | 17/02/2012 | Annex II and PL | The MAH presented a comprehensive search of the global safety database including all data captured cumulatively until 16th May 2010, for pregnant women who had been exposed to Herceptin and in whom predefined foetal adverse events were reported. The search returned 98 adverse events reported in 56 case reports. All case reports were reviewed for any evidence of oligohydramnios and renal hypoplasia. The resulting analysis identified four case reports in which oligohydramnios and evidence of renal hypoplasia were observed. These four cases all originated from literature articles. There were also eleven reports of oligohydramnios in which no renal dysfunction was noted. Five infants were healthy at the time of the most recent reports received and six had died (including therapeutic abortion) of complications due to oligohydramnios/preterm delivery. One pregnancy in which oligohydramnios had been reported was ongoing at the time of the most recent and additional information for this report has been requested. There was also one report of multi-organ failure with a history of oligohydramnios, but there was no information of renal involvement. |

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 23/09/2010   | 25/10/2010   | SmPC and PL   | Following a review in the post-marketing setting requested further to the assessment of the renewal procedure (R-48), cases of oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia of the foetus, were reported in pregnant women receiving trastuzumab. The CHMP has concluded that women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with Herceptin and for at least 6 months after treatment has concluded. In addition women who become pregnant should be advised of the possibility of harm to the foetus and if a pregnant woman is treated with Herceptin, close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team is desirable. In this variation the MAH has updated Section 4.6 (Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation) of the SmPC and Section 2 (Before you use Herceptin) of the Package Leaflet of Herceptin to include these recommendations. |
