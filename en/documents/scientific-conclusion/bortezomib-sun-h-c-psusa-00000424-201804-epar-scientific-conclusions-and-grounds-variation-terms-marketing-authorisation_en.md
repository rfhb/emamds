## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for bortezomib, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Following a review of post-marketing cases and literature reports for the period covered by this PSUR, 158 cases of 'Lid, lash and lacrimal infections, irritations and inflammations' were retrieved in patients who received bortezomib. Of those, 121 cases reported chalazion, blepharitis, meibomianitis, and/or Meibomian gland dysfunction. A biological plausibility supports the association between bortezomib and chalazion/blepharitis; theoretically, bortezomib-related myelosuppression may facilitate viral infections such as herpes zoster thereby promoting chalazia. Based on this review, chalazion/blepharitis is considered associated with the use of bortezomib.

In addition, following a search of the worldwide medical and scientific literature carried out for the period covered by this PSUSA and a number of papers reporting safety information, 35 cases of Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) were retrieved. Overall, the literature results are suggestive of a possible causal association between bortezomib (and other proteasome inhibitors) and TMA.

Based on the data presented, the PRAC was of the view that the product information should be varied to update Section 4.8 the SmPC and relevant section of the package leaflet to add the following: chalazion, blepharitis abd Thrombotic Microangiopathy.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for bortezomib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing bortezomib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
