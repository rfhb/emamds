## 1.  Scientific discussion

## 1.1.  Introduction

BYETTA contains exenatide, which is glucagon like peptide 1 analogue. BYETTA received a marketing authorisation in the EU on 20 November 2006 and is approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with metformin, and/or sulphonylureas in patients who have not achieved adequate glycaemic control on maximally tolerated doses of these oral therapies.

The currently approved indication is: BYETTA is indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with metformin, and/or sulphonylureas in patients who have not achieved adequate glycaemic control on maximally tolerated doses of these oral therapies.

The purpose of the Type II variation is to include information concerning the use of exenatide with a thiazolidinedione (TZD). The following indication is proposed;

BYETTA is indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with:

-  metformin
- sulphonylureas
-  thiazolidinediones
-  metformin and a sulphonylurea
-  metformin and a thiazolidinedione

in patients who have not achieved adequate glycaemic control on maximally tolerated doses of these oral therapies.

Additionally, amendments to the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 and the PL are proposed. Also Annex II has been updated to reflect the new version number of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

The MAH has requested a waiver for the new indication in children. The PDCO has agreed with this waiver (decision 15 January 2010).

## 1.2.  Non-clinical aspects

No non-clinical data or discussion was included in the dossier therefore MAH was requested to discuss the potential for pharmacological and/or toxicological interactions between exenatide and TZD, and justify the absence of non-clinical studies on the combination.

## Potential for Pharmacokinetic Interaction

The  MAH  believes  that  based  on  the  known  clearance  properties  of  exenatide  (passive renal elimination) and TZDs (hepatic clearance), a metabolism-based interaction between these 2 agents is not probable. However, a possible pharmacokinetic interaction exists due to exenatide's known action of delaying gastric emptying, which has been shown to reduce the Cmax of concomitantly administered oral drugs without an accompanying change in AUC. Although no clinical or nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted to evaluate the interaction of exenatide and concomitant TZDs, the longterm placebo controlled studies (GWAP and GWCG) provide an assessment of the efficacy and safety of these therapies. In Studies GWAP and GWCG, subjects with type 2 diabetes, inadequately controlled with  optimally effective  doses  of  TZDs  alone,  or  TZDs  and  metformin,  were  randomly  assigned  to either placebo  or  exenatide  treatment  for  16  or  26  weeks,  respectively.  These  studies  (GWAP  and GWCG) have shown that concomitant TZD usage results in an increase in efficacy, without any signs of additive safety concerns, which confirms a lack of clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions.

## Potential for Pharmacological Interaction

Byetta  and  TZD  produce  their  antihyperglycemic  pharmacological  actions  by  2  distinctly different mechanisms of  action.  Byetta  is  a  GLP-1  receptor  agonist  that  enhances  glucose-dependent  insulin secretion  by the  pancreatic  beta  cell,  suppresses  inappropriately  elevated  glucagon  secretion,  and slows gastric emptying. Thiazolidinediones produce their antihyperglycemic pharmacological effect by improving sensitivity to insulin in peripheral tissues, especially adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the liver. TZDs are potent agonists for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). These receptors modulate the transcription of several insulin responsive genes involved in control of glucose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and lipid metabolism in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the liver. There is no known overlap of these 2 pathways. Based on the divergence in the mechanisms of action of Byetta and TZDs, there appears to  be  minimal  risk  of  pharmacological  synergism/interaction;  thus,  nonclinical  animal pharmacology studies on the combination of Byetta and TZDs are not warranted.

## Potential for Toxicological Interaction

The  target  organs  of  toxicity  for  Byetta  and  TZDs  have  been  well-characterized  in  the individual nonclinical toxicology programs for Byetta, rosiglitasone, and pioglitasone. There is no commonality of target organs identified for Byetta and the TZDs indicating a low potential for synergism/interaction. In nonclinical cardiovascular safety assessments of Byetta, there was no evidence of hERG blockade in vitro or of QT/QTc prolongation in monkeys, given single and repeated doses of 150 mcg/kg/day (482 times the human therapeutic exposure). No dose-limiting or target organ toxicity was noted in mice, rats,  or  monkeys  at  doses  up  to 760  mcg/kg/day  (182  days),  250  mcg/kg/day  (91  days),  or  150 mcg/kg/day (273 days) (519, 130, and 482 times the human therapeutic exposure, respectively). In 24-month carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, Byetta produced a weak signal for thyroid c-cell adenomas  in  female  rats  given  18,  70,  or  250  mcg/kg/day  (5,  22,  and  130  times  the human therapeutic  exposure,  respectively),  but  not  in  male  rats  or  mice. Product  labeling  for  the  TZDs rosiglitazone and pioglitazone has reported heart enlargement at 5, 22, and 2 and 11, 1, and 2 times the human therapeutic exposure, respectively, in mice, rats, and dogs. Rosiglitazone produced adipose tissue  hyperplasia and  benign  lipomas  in  24-month  carcinogenicity  studies  in  mice  and  rats, respectively,  at doses  2  times  the  human  therapeutic  exposure.  Pioglitazone  produced  benign  and malignant transitional cell tumors  of the urinary bladder in  male  rats  given  the  maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis for 24 months. No tumors were produced in mice given pioglitazone doses 11 times the human dose for 24 months. Based on the marked differences in the target organ toxicity profiles between Byetta  and the TZDs, the potential for toxicological synergism/interaction  resulting  in  reduction  of previously  determined,  single  agent  no-observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) appears to be low. Furthermore, no causes for significant toxicological concern were identified in clinical Studies GWAP and GWCG of the proposed combination. On this basis, and in agreement with ICH M3(R2) guidance on combination drug toxicity testing, nonclinical animal toxicology studies on the combination of Byetta and TZDs are not warranted.

It is endorsed by CHMP that there is no concern for any important pharmacological and/or toxicological interactions between exenatide and TZDs based on theoretical considerations and experimental data. The absence of combination studies is justified.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The MAH declared that exenatide, as a moderately sized peptide, is exempted from the environmental risk assessment requirement, according to Section 2 'Scope and Legal Basis' of the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) and that Eli Lilly and Company knows of no information that indicates a potential for significant impact on the environment from the use of exenatide.

This proposal has been endorsed by CHMP.

## 1.3.  Clinical aspects

## 3.3.1. Clinical efficacy

## Study Design

## Study GWAP

This  was  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  two-arm,  parallel,  placebo-controlled,  outpatient trial. Patients randomized to exenatide therapy administered 5 μg study drug BID for the first 4 weeks of therapy, and then increased their dose to 10 μg BID for the remaining 12 weeks of therapy. Patients took their assigned study medication for a total of 16 weeks.

The primary  objective was to  test  the  hypothesis  that  glycemic  control,  as  measured  by  change  in HbA1c (%) from baseline to endpoint (Week 16, or early discontinuation), with exenatide (BID, before morning  and  evening  meals)  is  superior  to  placebo  (BID),  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  and inadequate glycemic control taking thiazolidinediones (TZDs) alone or TZDs with metformin (Met).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients with type 2 diabetes aged between 21 and 75 years (inclusive), had been treated with TZDs alone (for at least 4 months prior to screening) or with TZDs and Met (for at least 30 days prior to screening), had an HbA1c between 7.1% and 10.0% (inclusive), had a body mass index

(BMI) &gt;25 kg/m2 and &lt;45 kg/m2, and their body weight must have been stable for at least 3 months prior to screening.

The exclusion criteria included a clinically significant history of cardiac disease or presence of active cardiac disease within the year prior to inclusion in the study and a history of renal transplantation or were currently receiving renal dialysis or had serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL (≥132 μmol/L) for males and≥1.2 mg/dL (≥110 μmol/L) for females.

The minimum doses for rosiglitazone were ≥4mg daily, for pioglitazone ≥ 30 mg daily. There was no required minimum dose for metformin. The proportion of patients treated with a combination of MET and TZD was 80%.

## Study GWCG

This  was  a  multicenter,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  randomized,  two-arm,  parallel,  outpatient trial designed to compare the effects of twice-daily (BID) exenatide plus oral antidiabetic (OAD) agents and placebo BID plus OAD with respect to glycemic control, as measured by HbA1c, in patients with type 2 diabetes who experienced inadequate glycemic control with TZD alone or TZD plus metformin. Patients were treated with study therapy (either exenatide plus OAD or placebo plus OAD) for 26 weeks, followed by an optional open-label extension period of a minimum of 12 weeks, during which all patients received exenatide BID plus OAD through to study completion.

Patients had type 2 diabetes, were at least 18 years of age, had been treated with TZDs alone (for at least 120 days prior to screening) or with TZDs and metformin (for at least 30 days prior to screening), had an HbA1c between 7.1% and 10.0% (inclusive), had a body mass index (BMI) 25 kg/m2  BMI  45 kg/m2, and had stable body weight for at least 3 months prior to screening.

The  exclusion  criteria  included  a  clinically  significant  history  of  cardiac  disease,  renal  disease,  liver disease, gastrointestinal disease, or oncolytic disease.

The minimum doses for rosiglitazone were ≥4mg daily, for pioglitazone ≥ 30 mg daily. There was no required minimum dose for metformin. The proportion of patients treated with a combination of MET and TZD was 95%.

## Study GWBG

This  was  a  multicentre,  randomised,  open-label,  parallel-arm  comparator  study  of  out-patients  with T2DM who were not adequately controlled using a combination of dual or triple OAD therapy. Patients were randomised to exenatide (5 μg twice daily [BID] for the first 4 weeks of therapy and then 10 μg BID, before the morning and evening meal) or insulin glargine ('treat to target' FPG ≤5.6 mmol/L once daily) in addition to their current OAD regimen. Patients who received exenatide during the study and completed 6 months of treatment were invited, at the discretion of the investigator, to enter an openlabel extension period.

Patients included in the study presented with T2DM, had been treated with dual or triple OAD therapy at a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to randomisation and were at least 30 years of age. HbA1c values  were  between  7.5%  and  10.0%,  BMI  was  &gt;27  kg/m2  and  patients  had  at  least  one cardiovascular risk factor. Patients were excluded if they had a malignancy or had been in remission from a malignancy for less than 5 years, had Class III or IV cardiac disease, uncontrolled hypertension, a history of renal transplantation or dialysis, clinical signs or symptoms of liver disease, hamoglobinopathy, chronic anaemia, proliferative retinopathy or metabolic acidosis.

## Study GWAY

This was a randomized, open-label, comparator-controlled, three-arm, multicenter study. One hundred and  forty-one  subjects  with  inadequate  glycemic  control  (HbA1c  ≥6.8%  and  ≤10.0%),  despite metformin treatment, were randomly assigned to receive exenatide, rosiglitazone, or exenatide plus rosiglitazone,  in  addition  to  their  current  dose  of  metformin.  A  subset  (73)  of  these  subjects participated in hyperglycemic and euglycemic clamp procedures.

The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that in patients with type 2 diabetes who had not achieved  adequate  glycemic  control  with  metformin  treatment,  the  addition  of  exenatide  and rosiglitazone would provide superior beta-cell function as measured by the argininestimulated insulin incremental  area  under  the  curve  (ASI-iAUC)  during  a  hyperglycemic  clamp  test,  than adding rosiglitazone alone after 20 weeks of treatment.

Rosiglitazone was uptitrated to the maximum recommended dose of 4 mg BID and exenatide  to 10 μg

BID. Metformin was continued at the same dose and frequency as in the pre-study setting. The exclusion criteria included cardiac disease or presence of active cardiac disease within 1 year of screening, including myocardial infarction, clinically significant arrhythmia, unstable angina, moderate to severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III and higher), coronary artery bypass surgery or angioplasty. Patients with renal disease or with serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL (males) or ≥1.4 mg/dL (females) were excluded.

## Discussion of clinical efficacy

Studies GWAP and GWCG are considered as the pivotal trials for the current application. The study designs  with  placebo  as  control  are  considered  as  adequate.  Study  GWAP  was  also  included  in  the initial MAA for Byetta.

The majority of the patients in these studies were treated with a combination of metformin and TZD at the time of inclusion in the studies and were considered as failures on this dual therapy. The number of patients  on  monotherapy  with  TZD  was  limited  (n=33).  However,  considering  the  small  target population for the TZD+exenatide combination, the very limited safety data presented (not showing any unexpected safety issues) was considered as acceptable. The dual therapy indication is therefore considered as approvable . Based on the demographic characteristics the study populations seem to be representative  of  the  target  population  with  approx.  7  years  duration  of  the  disease  and  HbA1c  of around 8% at baseline. However, the number of patients older than 65 years is limited.

Abbreviations: OAD =oral antidiabetic agent; SU= sulfonyluea; TZD = thiazolidinedione.

Of the 346 exenatide treated subjects who received TZD therapy, 125 (36%) had exposures 6 to  18 weeks, 180 (52%) had exposures 18 to  32 weeks, and 17 (5%) had exposures ≥32 weeks.

## Adverse events

Gastrointestinal events, particularly nausea, were the most common adverse events reported during Studies GWAP, GWCG, GWBG, and GWAY.

The percentage of exenatide subjects reporting nausea in these studies was similar to that of  exenatide-treated  subjects  in  non-TZD  studies. Among  treatment-emergent  adverse  events occurring at ≥  5% in the 4 core studies, oedema peripheral was notably higher than in the non-TZD studies.  This  adverse  event  is  well  recognized  with  TZD  treatment  but  was  not  more  frequent  with combination  exenatide  and  TZD  (6%)  than with  placebo  (11%).  No  treatment-emergent  cases  of pancreatitis were observed in the integrated studies database.

In the 4 core studies, cardiac disorders were reported by 1% of subjects receiving exenatide plus TZD (aortic  valve  sclerosis  and  tachycardia),  3%  of  subjects  receiving  insulin  plus  TZD  (arrhythmia  and cardiac failure), and no subjects receiving placebo and TZD.

More  exenatide  plus  TZD-treated  (9%)  than  placebo(1%)  or  insulin-treated  (4%)  subjects discontinued from the 4 core studies because of adverse events. Among exenatide-treated patients,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

nausea (17 of 32 exenatide-treated subjects) and vomiting (9 subjects) accounted for the majority of discontinuations.

The incidences of nausea and vomiting leading to withdrawal with exenatide plus TZD treatment were slightly  higher  in  the  4  core  studies  (5%  and  3%,  respectively)  than  those of  exenatide-treated subjects  in  the  long-term,  placeboand  comparator-controlled  studies,  including  Study  GWAP, presented  in  the  original  BYETTA  MAA.  In  those  long-term  controlled  studies,  the  percentage of subjects receiving exenatide who withdrew due to nausea or vomiting was 4% and 1%, respectively. However, the overall incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events leading to withdrawal for exenatidetreated subjects receiving TZD in the 4 core studies (8%) was not different from that observed for exenatide-treated  subjects  in  the  earlier,  long-term  studies  in  the  BYETTA  MAA  (placebo-controlled, 5%; insulin-controlled, 6%). These results indicate that exenatide used together with a TZD does not result in qualitatively different gastrointestinal side effects compared with other exenatide/oral agent combinations.

Other events that led to discontinuation of exenatide-treated subjects were cough (moderate severity), injection  site  reaction  (mild  severity),  chest  pain  (severe),  breast  cancer  (severe),  diarrhoea  (mild severity), and acute renal failure (severe). Of these events, injection site reaction and diarrhoea were considered related to study treatment.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

Of  346  exenatide-treated  subjects  in  the  4  cores  studies,  8  subjects  (2%)  experienced  a  serious adverse event. An additional exenatide-treated subject experienced hypoglycemia that was reported as serious in the clinical study report but was not captured as serious in the integrated dataset. All of these serious events were classified as serious because they were associated with hospitalization or were considered clinically relevant for another unspecified reason. In addition, all of the events, with the exception of a case of campylobacter infection and acute renal failure (both events reported by the same exenatide-treated subject), had resolved by the time of final reporting. Similar percentages of placebo(2%)  and  insulin-treated  (3%)  subjects  experienced  a  serious  adverse  event.  The  overall incidence of serious adverse events for exenatide-treated subjects receiving TZD in the 4 core studies was not different from that observed for exenatide-treated subjects in the earlier, long-term studies in the BYETTA MAA (placebo-controlled, 4%; insulin-controlled, 4%).

No serious  cardiac  disorders  were  reported  for  subjects  receiving  exenatide  plus  TZD  in  the  4  core studies. One other subject receiving exenatide without TZD experienced serious cardiac disorders (1, acute myocardial infarction; 1, supraventricular tachycardia). One subject receiving insulin plus TZD, metformin, and SU experienced serious cardiac failure.

## Injection Site Reactions

The  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  data  of  the  integrated  studies  database  were  searched  for MedDRA preferred terms indicative of injection site reactions. No clinically meaningful differences in injection site reactions were observed between exenatide-treated subjects who received concomitant TZDs and exenatide-treated subjects who did not receive TZDs.

## Pancreatitis

No  treatment-emergent  cases  of  pancreatitis  were  observed  in  the  integrated  studies  database.  To better understand the relationship between exenatide and pancreatitis described in some spontaneously  reported  cases,  the  MAH  continues  to  pursue  a  drug  safety  program  that  includes thorough  investigation  of  individual  spontaneous  case  reports  along  with  clinical  and  epidemiologic studies.

## Acute Renal Failure

Two cases of acute renal failure were observed in the integrated studies database; however, neither was considered related  to  treatment.  In  Study  GWBG,  1  exenatide-treated  subject  experienced  the serious event of acute renal failure and withdrew from study because of this event. In Study GWAY, 1 TZD-treated subject experienced the serious event of acute renal failure and remained in study.

While no significant safety issues have been identified in relation to acute renal failure in the exenatide preclinical or clinical development programs, spontaneously-reported events of acute renal failure have occurred and the MAH continues to monitor these events.

## Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia was reported in 11% and 7% of subjects taking TZDs who were treated with exenatide and placebo, respectively, in placebo-controlled studies. As with hypoglycemia reports in the original BYETTA MAA, hypoglycemia events among exenatide-treated subjects in the 4 core studies appeared to  be  related  to  concomitant  use  of  SU.  Twenty  eight  (54.9%)  exenatide-treated  subjects  receiving

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TZD in combination with SU reported hypoglycemic episodes. The incidence was substantially lower (12.5%) in subjects receiving exenatide in combination with TZD alone or TZD with metformin. The incidence of hypoglycemia was not notably different for subjects receiving exenatide plus TZD (6.1%) versus subjects receiving those agents and metformin (13.4%). Most hypoglycemic episodes were mild or moderate in intensity.

Eight  subjects  (5  exenatide,  3  insulin  glargine)  experienced  severe hypoglycemia.  Four of  the exenatide-treated subjects were also receiving SU treatment.

## Laboratory findings

Anti-exenatide antibodies were assessed at baseline and again at study termination or early discontinuation in Studies GWAP and GWAY. Of 115 subjects exposed to exenatide and assessed as to their antibody status in Study GWAP, 46 (40%) were treatment-emergent anti-exenatide antibodypositive and 69 (60%) were anti-exenatide antibody-negative at their last study visit. Subjects exposed to exenatide in Study GWAY had a similar incidence of treatment-emergent anti-exenatide antibody positivity.

Treatment-emergent adverse events potentially associated with immune responses were compared for exenatide, insulin, and placebo subjects in the 4 core studies. No clinically relevant differences in the incidence or types of potentially immune-related treatment emergent adverse events were observed between treatments.

## Safety in special populations

## Renal function

Subjects in the integrated studies database with mild (n= 86 exposed to exenatide) and moderate (n= 5 exposed to exenatide) renal impairment were retrospectively identified through a calculation of creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. No subjects with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease participated in the studies that compose this database.

In all treatment groups (exenatide, exenatide plus TZD, placebo, and insulin) subjects with normal and mildly impaired renal function had similar incidences and types of treatment-emergent adverse events. Age

Review of treatment-emergent adverse events by age subgroup (n= 63  for age: &gt;=65 to &lt;75 and n= 1 for age: &gt;=75 exposed to exenatide, respectively)  did not indicate any obvious age related difference.

## Safety Considerations Related to Postmarketing Reports

Concomitant  use  of  exenatide  with  TZD  has  been  approved  for  use  in  some  countries  (US,  2006). Experience with this combination therapy has been recorded in the BYETTA Periodic Safety Updated Reports  since  2006.  No  additional  safety  concerns  have  been  identified  for  exenatide  use  in combination with TZD alone or in combination with other OADs. Consequently, no changes to current pharmacovigilance activities or plans outlined in the Risk Management Plan are needed for a treatment indication involving TZDs.

## Additional data concerning safety in patients receiving triple therapy

With responses to RSI the MAH has provided, the integrated studies (H8OMC- GWAP, H8O-MC-GWAY, H8O-BP-GWBG,  and  H8O-MC-GWCG)  safety  data,  for  patients  using  triple  therapy  of  exenatide  in combination  with  TZD  plus  metformin.  The  results  from  these  studies  are  summarized  in  the  table below.

## Discussion on clinical safety

The safety assessment from the 4 safety studies included in the variation is limited to a total of 343 subjects  for  19  weeks.  As  expected,  GI  adverse  events  were  common  in  the  exenatide  treated patients. However, the combination with TZD did not seem to increase the incidence of GI symptoms compared  to  other  exenatide  combinations.  Neither  were  there  any  signs  of  an  increased  risk  of oedema when exenatide was added to TZD compared to placebo. No serious cardiac disorders, cases of treatment related renal failure or cases of pancreatitis were reported, but it should be remembered that only 17 patients had an exposure longer than 32 weeks. No deaths were reported during the 4 core studies.

Pooling  data  from  the  four  studies  may  be  an  inappropriate  way  to  describe  the  safety  profile considering that the studies differed in their demographic data, inclusion/exclusion criteria, their dose regimes,  and  use  of  exenatide  in  combination  with  other  antidiabetic  drugs.  The  applicant  was requested  to  present  the  safety  profile  for  patients  having  received  the  triple  therapy  applied  for without  addition  of  any  other  antidiabetic  drugs.  Additionaly  provided  data  in  RSI  revealed  no  new adverse event reactions, beyond those already reported for metformin plus sulfonylurea indication.

## 1.4.  Risk Management Plan (RMP)

The  MAH  submitted an  updated  RMP  (version  10)  with  responses  to  RSI. MAH included the  use  of exenatide with TZD as potentially missing data and has amended the RMP accordingly. THE CHMP, having  considered  the  data  submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that  routine  pharmacovigilance  was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.

## 1.5.  Changes to the Product Information

The MAH proposed to change the indication in section 4.1 of the SPC as follows: ' BYETTA is indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with:

-  metformin
- sulphonylureas
-  thiazolidinediones
-  metformin and a sulphonylurea
-  metformin and a thiazolidinedione

in patients who have not achieved adequate glycaemic control on maximally tolerated

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

doses of these oral therapies. '

This was accepted by the CHMP.

As a result of the new indication further changes were made to sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

## 1.6.  Overall conclusions and Benefit-Risk Assessment

In support of the extension of indication 4 clinical studies were submitted. One (GWAP) out of these 4 studies  has  already  been  assessed  in  the  initial  MAA.  At  that  time  point,  this  trial  was  deemed sufficient  to  assess  efficacy,  but  the  study  duration  was  considered  insufficient  by  the  CHMP  to determine the safety of exenatide with TZD. A new study has now been completed (Study GWCG, 26 weeks duration), and data is also available from two other studies (GWBG and GWAY) in which some patients are exposed to exenatide and TZD.

The study design and study populations are basically considered as acceptable. However, the number of patients on monotherapy with TZD at the time of inclusion was limited (n=33) and these patients may not have been representative for the restricted EU monotherapy indication for TZDs. However, according  to  further  analyses  by  the  MAH,  21  of  these  patients  may  have  been  representative according to European standards.

## Benefits

Concerning  efficacy  associated  with  the  addition  of  exenatide  to  TZD  +  metformin,  exenatide  was superior to placebo and the treatment resulted in clinically relevant reductions of HbA1c in the pivotal studies GWAP and GWCG ( mean reductions - 0.74 and -0.84 %, respectively). Furthermore, in study GWBG,  exenatide  was  non-inferior  to  insulin  glargine  concerning  reduction  of  HbA1c  and  in  study GWAY, the addition  of  exenatide  +rosiglitazone  resulted  in  a  more  pronounced  reduction  of  HbA1c compared to either of the drugs alone. Thus, a clinically relevant effect of the addition of exenatide to TZD + metformin is indicated by these results.

## Risks

As mentioned above, the main reason why the combination of exenatide with a TZD was not approved at the time of MAA, was the limited data concerning safety (121 patients treated for 16 weeks).  The exposure is now increased to 346 patients out of whom 125 had exposures 6 to 18 weeks, 180 had exposures 18 to 32 weeks, and 17 had exposures ≥32 weeks.  Approximately 90 % of these patients were treated with exenatide+TZD+ one or more additional drugs (most often metformin). Concerning safety in these patients, as expected, GI adverse events were common in exenatide treated patients. However, the combination with TZD did not seem to increase the incidence of GI symptoms compared to other exenatide combinations. Neither were there any signs of an increased risk of oedema when exenatide was added to TZD compared to placebo. No serious cardiac disorders, cases of treatment related renal failure or cases of pancreatitis were reported, but it should be remembered that only 17 patients  had  an  exposure  longer  than  32  weeks.  No  new  adverse  event  reactions,  beyond  those already provided in the SmPC for the current metformin plus sulfonylurea indication, were identified by examination of the TZD data by itself.

The target population for dual therapy with TZD + exenatide (patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise for which metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance) is not the same as for triple therapy. Patients treated with TZD monotherapy due to intolerance to Met is not likely to differ from the population treated with dual therapy, Met+TZD, and for these patients efficacy and safety data could be extrapolated between populations.

The patients with contraindications to Met may on the other hand be a more vulnerable population including  patients  with  renal/hepatic  impairment  and  cardiac  disease.  However,  considering  the warnings and contraindications for TZD, only patients with renal impairment would be eligible for TZD monotherapy.  Considering  that exenatide is not recommended  in  patients  with severe renal impairment,  it  is  indeed  agreed  that  the  target  population  in  Europe  for  the  TZD+exenatide combination is likely to be small. Still, some reassurance concerning efficacy and safety is needed and it  is  questioned  whether  data  from  21  representative  patients  is  sufficient.  Considering  the  target population (patients with mild/moderate renal impairment), the adverse events potentially expected could  be  oedema  (fluid  retention)  and  more  pronounced  gastrointestinal side  effects  (patients  with moderate renal impairment have a 36% lower clearance of exenatide). Based on the results in study GWAP as well as on the analyses of TZD only users in all studies (presented in the MAHs response),

these potential issues were not confirmed. The safety profile in the dual therapy group was similar to the triple therapy group.

Concerning  alternative  add-on  treatments  for  patients  on  TZD  monotherapy,  SU  as  an  alternative treatment  to  exenatide  can  lead  to  hypoglycaemia  and  weight  increase,  although  the  long  term experience  of  SU  speaks  in  its  favour.  Insulin,  on  the  other  hand,  should  in  general  be  avoided  in combination with TZD due to the risk of fluid retention.

## Balance

Submitted studies show that exenatide added to TZD with or without metformin, results in a clinically relevant glucose lowering effect without any new, unexpected safety concerns compared to previously approved combination indications. The benefit/risk balance is therefore considered as positive and the variation is approvable. Considering the small target population for the TZD+exenatide combination, the very limited safety data presented was considered as acceptable. The dual therapy indication is therefore considered as approvable.

## 2.  Conclusion

On  24  June  2010 the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Package Leaflet and Annex II.
