## 3. Scientific discussion

## 3.1. Introduction

Cervarix (HPV-16/18 L1 AS04 vaccine) is a prophylactic vaccine which contains 20µg per 0.5 mL dose of HPV-16 L1 protein and 20µg per 0.5ml dose of HPV-18 L1 protein assembled as virus-like particles (VLPs) as active ingredients. The L1 proteins are formulated with AS04 adjuvant system, which is composed of 50µg of 3-O-desacyl-4'-mono-phosphoryl-lipid A (MPL) and 500µg of aluminium hydroxide salt. The vaccine is preservative-free.

Cervarix was first registered in 2007 and the vaccine is currently licensed for use in more than 110 countries. In Europe, Cervarix is indicated for the prevention of premalignant cervical lesions and cervical cancer causally related to certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types. The indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy in women aged 15-25 years following vaccination with Cervarix and on the immunogenicity of the vaccine in girls and women aged 10-25 years. The vaccination course consists of three doses administered according to a 0, 1, 6 month schedule via intramuscular injection.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has conducted a pooled analysis on the three studies HPV029, HPV-030 and HPV-048 to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity in 9 year old subjects as compared to 10-14 and 15-25 year old subjects.

The purpose of this variation is to update the summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Cervarix with data obtained in subjects of 9 years of age and to extend the current indication as from 9 years.

The data from the pooled analysis demonstrate that 9 year old subjects are non-inferior to 10-14 and 15-25 year old subjects in terms of immune response and that the 9 year old subjects have a good safety and reactogenicity profile, therefore allowing for a change in the indication for the use of Cervarix as of the age of 9 years.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

-  Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA decision (Decision P/11/2009 on the granting of a product-specific waiver).

## 3.2. Clinical aspects

## 3.2.1. Background

The age at which HPV vaccination is recommended depends on National guidelines and Government vaccination schedules. Universal mass vaccination (UMV) is recommended at 12 years of age in Italy (

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

European Cervical Cancer Association, 2009; Dorleans F, 2010, Bonanni P, 2011), while in Spain UMV is recommended for girls from 11-14 years of age (European Cervical Cancer Association, 2009; Dorleans F, 2010, Bonanni P , 2011; Bermudez , 2011). In Austria UMV is recommended for girls from 9-15 years of age (European Cervical Cancer Association, 2009; Bonanni P, 2011; Impfplan, 2011).

Outside Europe, UMV is recommended from 9 years of age in some countries. In Canada UMV is recommended for girls from 9-14 years of age who have not yet become sexually active (Dube E, 2007). In the USA, vaccination can be started beginning at 9 years of age but routine vaccination is recommended for females aged 11 or 12 years (MMWR, 2010;Recommended Immunizations, 2011).

The WHO states that the primary target population is likely to be girls within the age range of 9 or 10 years through to 13 years (WHO, 2009).

In order to meet recommendations worldwide to vaccinate girls from the age of 9 years, the Company conducted a pooled analysis on three studies that enrolled female subjects from the age of 9 years. This pooling demonstrates non-inferiority in terms of GMT ratio to the age groups 10-14 and 15-25 years of age, the latter being the age range for which efficacy of Cervarix has been demonstrated before.

The data support an update of the following Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).

## 3.2.2. Design and analysis of the pooled analysis

The pooled analysis included 1792 subjects aged 9 to 25 years of age in the TVC and 1663 in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity.

Subjects included were stratified by age (9 years, 10-14 years and 15-25 years) and pooled into three different vaccine groups:

1. The HPV only group had received three doses of Cervarix at Month 0, Month 1 and Month 6;
2. The HPV+co\\_ad group had received Cervarix and HepB or HAB vaccines coadministered at Month 0, Month 1 and Month 6;
3. The Co\\_ad only group had received HepB or HAB vaccine at Month 0, Month 1 and Month 6.

From study HPV-048 only subjects who received the standard 3-dose-schedule were included in the pooled analysis.

An overview of each individual study is provided below.

HPV-029 study title: A phase IIIb, randomized, open, multicentre study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine co-administered with inactivated hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine adsorbed (Twinrix Paediatric) in healthy female subjects aged 9 15

An additional visit and additional blood sample was performed in a subset of subjects.This visit (calledVisit2B)wasscheduled at Month 2.

HPV-030 study title: A phase IIIb, randomized, open, multicentre study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine (Cervarix) co-administrated with Hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B) in healthy female subjects aged 9 - 15 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study HPV-049 title : A phase I/II, partially blind, randomized, multicenter, age-stratified, doserange study in healthy females aged 9 - 25 years to assess the safety and immunogenicity of HPV16/18 L1

VLP AS04 vaccine administered intramuscularly according to a 2-dose schedule (0,2-month or 0,6month) when compared to a standard 3- dose schedule of HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine.

## HPV-049 study design

<!-- image -->

In order to increase the number of evaluable 9 year old subjects for the analysis of the immunogenicity objective, an analysis was conducted to demonstrate non-inferiority of the HPV-16 and HPV-18 immune response in the pooled 9 year old subjects who received Cervarix (HPV only) compared to the group of pooled 9 year old females who received Cervarix concomitantly with Engerix or Twinrix (HPV+co\\_ad) in terms of GMT ratio one month after completion of the three-dose vaccination schedule (Month 7).

If non-inferiority was to be shown then the two vaccine groups HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad for the 9 year old subjects were to be pooled to form the group HPV\\_pool/9y to be used for the two non-inferiority analyses as described below.

The pooled analysis had two objectives:

-  Immunogenicity (assessed sequentially)
- 1) To demonstrate non-inferiority of the HPV-16 and HPV-18 immune response between the pooled groups HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad for the 9 year old subjects (HPV\\_pool/9y) compared to the pooled groups HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad for the 10-14 year old subjects (HPV\\_pool/10-14y) in terms of GMT ratio one month after completion of three-dose vaccination (Month 7).
- 2) To demonstrate non-inferiority of the HPV-16 and HPV-18 immune response between the pooled groups HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad for the 9 year old subjects (HPV\\_pool/9y) compared to the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pooled groups HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad for the 15-25 year old subjects (HPV\\_pool/15-25y) in terms of GMT ratio one month after completion of three-dose vaccination (Month 7).

##  Safety/Reactogenicity

To evaluate the occurrence, intensity and causal relationship to vaccination of solicited local and general symptoms during the 7-day period (day 0 to 6) following each and any vaccination in the groups HPV only, HPV+co\\_ad and Co\\_ad only for 9 year old subjects; the occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of unsolicited symptoms during the 30-day period (days 0 to 29) following each and any vaccination in the groups HPV only, HPV+co\\_ad and Co\\_ad only for 9 year old subjects; and the occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of new onset chronic diseases (NOCDs), new onset autoimmune diseases (NOADs), medically significant adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) in the groups HPV only, HPV+co\\_ad and Co\\_ad only for 9 year old subjects up to Month 7.

## Study power

The pooled analysis had no power and is purely descriptive. The three individual studies enrolled sufficient subjects per group in order to assure an acceptable global power to reach their primary objectives

## Subjects evaluated

In the three individual studies HPV-029, HPV-030 and HPV-048, healthy females were enrolled after checking eligibility criteria at study entry. Exclusion criteria aimed to prevent administration of the study vaccines to individuals with medical conditions that might have interfered with the immune response; to those individuals at risk of possible adverse reactions to the vaccine; those in whom previous exposure to the vaccine antigens through vaccination, disease or known exposure would prevent interpretation of the results; and those who were breastfeeding, pregnant or at risk of becoming pregnant during the study.

All subjects included in the pooled analysis were females between 9 and 25 years. The subjects were stratified by age (9 years, 10-14 years and 15-25 years) and pooled into three different vaccine groups: HPV only group in which all subjects received Cervarix according to a three dose schedule at Months 0, 1 and 6; HPV+co\\_ad group in which the subjects received Cervarix and Engerix or Twinrix coadministered; and Co\\_ad only group in which the subjects received Engerix or Twinrix alone. The pooled analysis included 1792 subjects aged 9-25 years in the TVC (516 were 9 years old) and 1663 in the ATP cohort (473 were 9 years old).

The demographic characteristics for the TVC were similar to the ATP cohort for immunogenicity with no major differences.

## Methodology

The primary cohort for the analysis of the immunogenicity of the pooled analysis was the According to protocol (ATP) cohort. The ATP immunogenicity cohort included all subjects who met all eligibility criteria, who complied with protocol-defined procedures, who had no elimination criteria during the study, and for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were available.

For the purpose of this pooled analysis geometric mean antibody concentration/titre (GMT), with 95% CI, was calculated using standard methods.

In order to increase the evaluable number of 9 year old subjects, non-inferiority between the HPV only group and the HPV+co\\_ad group had to be demonstrated first to allow pooling of these two vaccine groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  To demonstrate non-inferiority for the 9 year old between the HPV only group and the HPV+co\\_ad group, the pre-required margin on the GMT ratios (HPV only / HPV+co\\_ad) was set at 2.

The immunogenicity endpoints were the following:

-  To demonstrate non-inferiority between the pooled groups HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad for the 9 year old subjects compared to the pooled groups HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad for the 10-14 year old subjects. The pre-required margin on the GMT ratios (HPV\\_pool/10-14y / HPV\\_pool/9y) was set at 2;
-  To demonstrate non-inferiority between the pooled groups HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad for the 9 year old subjects compared to the pooled groups HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad for the 15-25 year old subjects. The pre-required margin on the GMT ratios (HPV\\_pool/15-25y / HPV\\_pool/9y) was set at 2.

The safety endpoints are described below:

-  The occurrence, intensity and causal relationship to vaccination of solicited local and general symptoms during the 7-day period (day 0 to 6) following each and any vaccination in the groups HPV only, HPV+co\\_ad and Co\\_ad only for 9 year old subjects.
-  The occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of unsolicited symptoms during the 30day period (days 0 to 29) following each and any vaccination in the groups HPV only, HPV+co\\_ad and Co\\_ad only for 9 year old subjects.
-  The occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of NOCDs, NOADs, medically significant AEs and SAEs in the groups HPV only, HPV+co\\_ad and Co\\_ad only for 9 year old subjects up to Month 7.

## Study cohorts

In addition to the ATP cohort, a complementary analysis was conducted on the total vaccinated cohort (TVC) which included all vaccinated subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were available. The TVC included all vaccinated subjects for whom data were available. The TVC for analysis of immunogenicity included vaccinated subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were available. The TVC analysis was performed per treatment actually administered.

## Derived and transformed data

A seronegative subject was a subject whose antibody titres were below the cut-off value. A seropositive subject was a subject whose antibody titre was greater than or equal to the cut-off value.

Seroconversion was defined as the appearance of anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies (i.e. titre greater than or equal to the cut-off value) in the serum of subjects seronegative before vaccination.

The GMT calculations were performed by taking the anti-log of the mean of the log antibody titers transformations. Antibody titers below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMT calculation.

The mean age of all pooled 10-14 year old subjects at study entry in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity was 12.1 years with a SD of 1.41 years. The majority (92.6%) of the subjects was of White-Caucasian/European heritage. The mean age, race, height and weight were comparable between the 10-14 year old subjects in the different vaccine groups.

The mean age of all pooled 15-25 year old subjects at study entry in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity was 17.4 years with a SD of 3.20 years. The majority (97.2%) of the subjects was of White-Caucasian/European heritage. The mean age is slightly different between the three groups as the pooled 15-25 age strata in the HPV+co\\_ad and the Co\\_ad only groups only contain 15 year old subjects of studies HPV-029 and HPV-030 which enrolled subjects 9-15 years. The pooled 15-25 age strata of the HPV only group has a mean age of 18.5 years with a SD of 3.30 years as it included subjects from study HPV-048. The race, height and weight were comparable between the 15-25 year old subjects in the different vaccine groups.

The percentage of initially seronegative 9 year old subjects in the HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad groups with anti-HPV-16 titres ≥ 8 EL.U/mL and anti-HPV-16 GMTs are presented in Table 2. The percentage of initially seronegative subjects in the HPV only and the HPV+co\\_ad groups with anti-HPV-18 antibody titres ≥ 7 EL.U/mL and anti-HPV-18 GMTs are presented in Table 3.

Non-inferiority assessment between HPV only and HPV with coadministration for HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens for 9 year old subjects

Non-inferiority of the pooled HPV only group to the pooled HPV+co\\_ad group with respect to the GMT ratio for 9 year old subjects was demonstrated for HPV-16 and HPV-18 since the UL of the 95% CIs on the GMT ratio was below the pre-defined limit of 2 (Table 4).

## 3.2.4. Efficacy Conclusions

Non-inferiority of the HPV-16/18 immune response, with respect to GMT ratio at Month 7, was demonstrated for the 9 year old subjects when Cervarix was administered alone at Month 0, 1 and 6, compared to when Cervarix was co-administered with Engerix or Twinrix at Month 0, 1 and 6.

The pooling of these two groups of subjects increased the number of evaluable subjects for further analyses.

For the pooled 9 year old subjects who received Cervarix with or without co-administration with Engerix or Twinrix, GMTs for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies at Month 7 were the following:

GMTs results for anti-HPV-16 antibodies at Month 7 were 29534.9 EL.U/mL in the HPV\\_pool/9y group, 21152.2 EL.U/mL in the HPV\\_pool/10-14y group and 11926.2 EL.U/mL in the HPV\\_pool/15-25y group.

GMTs for anti-HPV-16 antibodies at Month 7 in the HPV\\_pool/9y group were 1.4- fold higher than in the HPV\\_pool/10-14y group and 2.5-fold higher than in the HPV\\_pool/15-25y group.

GMTs results for anti-HPV-18 antibodies at Month 7 were 11838.2 EL.U/mL in the HPV\\_pool/9y group, 8608.0 EL.U/mL in the HPV\\_pool/10-14y group and 4905.3 EL.U/mL in the HPV\\_pool/15-25y group.

GMTs for anti-HPV-18 antibodies at Month 7 in the HPV\\_pool/9y group were 1.4- fold higher than in the HPV\\_pool/10-14y group and 2.4-fold higher than in the HPV\\_pool/15-25y group.

The immunogenicity objectives of this pooled analysis were met:

Non-inferiority of the HPV-16/18 immune response, with respect to GMT ratio at Month 7, was demonstrated for the pooled 9 year old subjects (when Cervarix was administered alone or coadministered with Engerix or Twinrix), compared to the pooled 10-14 year old subjects (when Cervarix was administered alone or co-administered with Engerix or Twinrix).

Non-inferiority of the HPV-16/18 immune response, with respect to GMT ratio at Month 7, was demonstrated for the pooled 9 year old subjects (when Cervarix was administered alone or coadministered with Engerix or Twinrix), compared to the pooled 15-25 year old subjects (when Cervarix was administered alone or co-administered with Engerix or Twinrix).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In conclusion, these data show that the 9 year old subjects are comparable to subjects aged 10-14 and 15-25 years of age in terms of seroconversion rates and that the immunological response (GMTs) in 9 year old subjects is non-inferior to the immune response in those older age groups.

## 3.2.5. Clinical safety

In the pooled analysis, a total of 516 subjects aged 9 years were included in the Total Vaccinated Cohort. Of these, 175 subjects received 3 doses of Cervarix only, 171 received 3 doses of Cervarix coadministered with HAB or HepB vaccines, and 170 received three doses of HAB or HepB only.

## Common Adverse Events

The incidence and nature of symptoms (solicited only) reported during the 7-day (Days 0-6) postvaccination period following each dose and overall is presented in Table 9.

## Solicited Local symptoms

During the 7-day post-vaccination period, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local symptom in all groups overall per dose. Pain at the injection site was reported following 78.2%, 86.5% and 50.2% of doses in the HPV only, HPV+co\\_ad and Co\\_ad only group, respectively.

Redness and swelling were reported more often for the HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad group than for the Co\\_ad only group. Redness was reported after 40.3%, 48.6% and 15.4% of the doses at the injection site for groups HPV only, HPV+co\\_ad and Co\\_ad only, respectively.

Swelling was reported after 32.5%, 42.6% and 11.3% of the doses in the HPV only group, HPV+co\\_ad group and the Co\\_ad only group, respectively.

An increase in the incidence in the reporting of swelling was observed with subsequent doses for the groups HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad. For group HPV only the reported swelling increased from 26.6% following Dose 1 to 42.0% following Dose 3. For group HPV+co\\_ad the reported swelling increased from 34.3% following Dose 1 to 51.8% following Dose 3.

Grade 3 pain was reported after 4.3% of the doses at the injection site in the HPV only group versus 9.8% of doses in the HPV+co\\_ad group and only 0.4% of the doses in the Co\\_ad only group.

Grade 3 redness was reported after 2.1% of the doses in the HPV only group, 2.8% in the HPV+co\\_ad group and 0.2% in the Co\\_ad only group. Grade 3 swelling was reported more often for groups HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad than for the Co\\_ad only group with an overall incidence no more than 3.2%. The majority of solicited local symptoms resolved within two days and the majority of grade 3 local symptoms resolved within one day.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An increase in the incidence of swelling was observed with subsequent doses for the groups HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad. The majority of solicited local symptoms resolved within two days and the majority of grade 3 local symptoms resolved within one day.

## Solicited General symptoms

The most commonly reported solicited general symptom in all groups was fatigue; with a frequency of 21.2% in the HPV only group and of 26.3% in the HPV+co\\_ad group. For the Co\\_ad only group fatigue was similar to the HPV only group (21.9%). For all other solicited general symptoms, the incidences were within the same range across groups except for myalgia which was less pronounced in the Co\\_ad only group. No increase in solicited general symptoms was observed with subsequent doses.

The rate of reported solicited grade 3 general symptoms was low and within the same range across groups. Solicited grade 3 symptoms were reported after no more than 1.8% of doses for any individual symptom. The majority of solicited grade 3 general symptoms were considered related to the vaccination by the investigator. Most solicited general symptoms resolved within two days. The majority of grade 3 general symptoms resolved within one day.

## Unsolicited symptoms

There are no major differences between the groups in terms of the number of subjects reporting at least one unsolicited symptom within the 30-day post-vaccination period and the number of unsolicited symptoms reported.

## Medically significant adverse events

During the entire study period, 60 subjects (17 in the HPV only group [9.7%], 16 in the HPV+co\\_ad group [9.4%] and 27 in the Co\\_ad only group [15.9%]) reported 71 medically significant adverse events classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term.

## New onset chronic diseases and new onset of autoimmune diseases

Six subjects reported the occurrence of a symptom classified as a new onset of chronic disease (NOCD) based on GSK assessment, as shown in Table 13. There were two subjects in each group with two cases of urticaria in the HPV group, one case of hypoaesthesia and one case of atopic dermatitis in the HPV+co\\_ad group and one case of allergic cough and one case of allergic rhinitis in the Co\\_ad only group. None of the NOCDs were classified as SAEs and none were assessed as possibly related to vaccination by the investigator (see individual CSR provided in Module 5 for investigator's assessment). The incidence of reported new onset of chronic disease was within the same range in each group. None of the reported AEs was identified as a potential new onset of autoimmune disease (NOAD) (Company assessment).

## Non-Fatal SAE

Two subjects reported two non-fatal SAE during the study in the 30-day post-vaccination period. One non-fatal event occurred in the HPV+co\\_ad group and one in the Co\\_ad only group. None of the nonfatal SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to the study vaccination.

## 3.2.6. Safety Conclusions

The safety analysis of the 9 year old subjects from this pooled analysis of studies HPV- 029, HPV-030 and HPV-048 did not show any clinically relevant differences between the different pooled vaccine groups. The rates of solicited local symptoms in the groups HPV only and HPV+co\\_ad tend to be higher when compared to the Co\\_ad only group.

However, the symptoms were generally of short duration and compliance was high.

The study vaccine administered in all three groups (either Cervarix alone (HPV only), Cervarix concomitantly with Engerix or Twinrix (HPV+co\\_ad) or Engerix or Twinrix alone (Co\\_ad only) was generally well tolerated. There were no new or unexpected safety issues following vaccination in any vaccine group.

## 3.3. Changes to the product information

The detailed changes can be found in the final approved highlighted SmPC, Annex II and PL attached to this report.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to the Product Information were requested by the CHMP and implemented:

- 1) Section 4.1: The following revision was endorsed

'Cervarix is a vaccine for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of premalignant cervical lesions and cervical cancer causally related to certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types. See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information on the data that support this indication.'

- 2) Section 4.2: The following revision was endorsed:

## Paediatric population

'Cervarix is not recommended for use in girls below 9 years of age due to lack of data on safety and immunogenicity in this age-group.'

- 3) Section 5.1: Immunogenicity data were updated.

## 3.4. Overall conclusions and benefit-risk assessment

In conclusion, non-inferiority of the HPV-16/18 immune response, with respect to GMT ratio at Month 7, was demonstrated for the pooled 9 year old subjects compared to the pooled 10-14 year old subjects and to the pooled 15-25 year old subjects.

These data showed that 9 year old subjects are comparable to subjects 10-14 and 15-25 years of age in terms of seroconversion rates and that the immunological response (GMTs) in 9 year old subjects is non-inferior to the immune response in those older age groups. No clinically relevant differences in the safety profile of the 9 year old subjects who received Cervarix alone or in co-administration with Engerix or Twinrix were observed.

Based on the safety and immunogenicity data in this pooled analysis the CHMP concluded that the risk/benefit balance for Cervarix is favourable to extend the indication to 9 years and adopted the opinion of extending its use to subjects 9 years of age.

## 4. Conclusion

On 20 October 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.
