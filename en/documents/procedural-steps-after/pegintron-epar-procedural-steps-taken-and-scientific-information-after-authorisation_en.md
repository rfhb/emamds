The frequency of such re-activation appears to be low. All patients should be screened for hepatitis B before starting treatment with interferon for hepatitis C; patients co-infected with hepatitis B and C must then be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. |

| WS/0735   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to include new information on the potential interactions of peginterferon alfa-2b with drugs metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6. In addition, the Worksharing applicant took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes to sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 23/07/2015   | 26/06/2016 no   | SmPC        | The potential interaction of peginterferon alfa 2b (PegIntron) on substrates of metabolic enzymes was evaluated in 3 multiple-dose clinical pharmacology studies. In these studies, the effects of multiple dose regimens of peginterferon alfa 2b (PegIntron) were investigated in Hepatitis C subjects (1.5 mcg/week) or healthy subjects (1 mcg/week or 3 mcg/week). A clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was not observed between peginterferon alfa 2b (PegIntron) and tolbutamide, midazolam or dapsone; therefore, no dosing adjustment is necessary when peginterferon alfa 2b (PegIntron) is administered with medicines metabolized by CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and N acetyltransferase. Concomitant administration of peginterferon alfa 2b (PegIntron) with caffeine or desipramine modestly increased the exposure of caffeine and desipramine. When patients are administered PegIntron with medications metabolized by CYP1A2 or CYP2D6, the extent of the decrease in cytochrome P 450 activity is unlikely to have a clinical impact, except with medicines which have a narrow therapeutic margin. longer authorised   |

A number of these reports are confounded with independent risk factors for the development of retinal detachment. Furthermore, retinal detachment is more common with increasing age, and many of the reports occurred in individuals over the age of 49 which is the peak age at which retinal detachment occurrs. Nevertheless, there were reports with no clear confounders and with ages below the peak incidence of retinal detachment. Therefore the term of 'serous retinal detachment' has been included into the established ocular sections of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. |

| WS/0124   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Further to request of the CHMP On 16 December 2010, as part of a class-labelling change, the Product Information of ribavirin and the interferon-containing products is updated to remove from SmPC section 4.6 the requirement of double contraceptive measures for a treated woman and male patients, and to revise SmPC section 5.2 to reflect the results of the pharmacokinetic study related to transfer in seminal fluid. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH   | 21/07/2011   | 24/08/2011 no   | SmPC and PL   | A review of reported relevant prospective cases of maternal and paternal exposure to ribavirin has been carried out. Only a limited number of cases are available. However, a large number of data would be necessary to draw a definitive conclusion on the teratogenic potential of ribavirin. The malformative risk is possible in human, but it is not confirmed. For paternal exposure, the malformative risk is unlikely in humans. Taking into account the number of reference cases outnumbering 300 after paternal exposure with no increase of congenital anomaly risk, it is recommended to remove the requirement of double contraceptive measures for a treated woman and male patient. For female patients, the CHMP agreed that they should be instructed to use an effective contraceptive. For male patients, the CHMP recommended that either male patients or their female partners of childbearing age must be advised to use an effective contraceptive. Furthermore the results of the pharmacokinetic study related to the transfer of ribavirin in seminal fluid are included in the SmPC. longer authorised   |

| WS/0080 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC further to the evaluation of FUM regarding recommendations in patients with psychiatric disorders and substance abuse/use. The addresses of the local representatives are updated for Poland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg Slovenia, Slovakia, Czech, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Romania and Austria. A number of editorial changes are made to the annexes. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 14/04/2011 | 15/06/2011 no | SmPC and PL | Interferon alfa-induced psychiatric adverse reactions still represent one of the major difficulties for the management of HCV-infected patients. In order to get a better insight to this issue, and to improve the information available to prescribers in SmPC of interferon-alfa containing products, the CHMP requested the MAH to provide yearly literature review on the management of psychiatric disorders in HCV-infected patients. This first literature review indicated that, as for patients with psychiatric disorders, patients with substance abuse/use need to be carefully managed with the aim of improving the adherence to therapy and the treatment success. It was noted that this issue was currently not addressed in the SmPC of interferon-alfa/ribavirin containing products as well as data on the management of patients with alcohol abuse. Thus, the recommendations in the product information for this sensitive population of patients have been updated. longer authorised |

| II/0095   | Update of SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 information related to growth inhibition and psychiatric side-effects in children. The MAH is also taking the opportunity to revise in the PIL the paragraph dedicated to HCV patients also HIV co-infected, for the sake of clarity/patient friendliness. Results of a user testing are reflected in the package leaflet. A QRD-related change has been made in the Annex II and the address of the Finnish respresentative has been updated in section 6 of the PL. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH product | 23/09/2010   | 28/10/2010 no | Annex II In the scope of the Renewal, the CHMP highlighted that growth inhibition is an important issue to be monitored. Information on growth retardation is already provided in the SPC section 4.4 but was not present in 4.8. As a consequence growth rate decrease (height and/or weight decrease for age)\" has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Furthermore the CHMP highlighted that an important issue arisen from previous PSURs is psychiatric adverse reactions. In the SmPC, this issue is already addressed in sections 4.3 and 4.4. However, in section 4.8, information on these adverse events in children was missing and as such has been inlcuded. Although suicidal ideation and/or attempts were not reported in the clinical trial of paediatric patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin (P02538), suicidal ideation or attempts were reported among paediatric patients participating in the standard interferon/ribavirin clinical trials (P00018/P00321). Based on these reports, these terms have been included in the IntronA and Rebetol SmPCs in Section 4.8. For harmonization of the potential paediatric events that may occur when a pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy is used, the terms suicidal ideation and suicide attempts have been added to section 4.8 of the SmPC. In the scope of these updates of safety information the package leaflet has been updated accordingly. longer authorised |

| II/0083 | Update of Section 4.4 \"Special warnings and precautions for use\" and 4.8 \"Undesirable effects\" of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) further to CHMP Request made in the context of the evaluation of PSUR 11, covering the period 25.07.2006 -24.07.2007, to include the following adverse reaction: pericardial effusion, pericarditis, bipolar disorders and mania. Other adverse reactions are added to section 4.8 to harmonise the SPC with the Company Core Data Sheet, United States Package Insert, and International Package Insert. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition the details of the local representatives are updated in the package leaflet for the following countries: Poland, Bulgaria, Finland and Austria. 25/09/2008 31/10/2008 SmPC and product no | PL Based on a cumulative review covering the period up until 31 December 2007 and data from the literature a causal relationship could not be excluded between pegylated interferon alfa 2b and the adverse reaction \"pericarditis\". Pericarditis is serious and may be fatal if diagnosis is delayed, therefore, in order to increase physicians awareness this adverse reaction has been included in section 4.8 of the SPC. A cumulative search was carried out for all reports of bipolar disorder up until 31 December 2007. The data from this review, together with abundant data from the literature, suggest that treatment with interferon alpha 2b may induce mania and bipolar disorders, especially in patients with predisposing factors such as previous psychiatric history, substance use disorders or family history of bipolar disorders. |

| II/0080 | Update of section 4.9 \"Overdose\" of the SPC further to a request of the CHMP made in the context of the assessment of PSUR 11. The MAH also takes the opportunity to make an amendment to section 9 \"Date of the first authorisation/renewal of the authorisation\" of the SPC for some strengths of PegIntron to correctly reflect the date of the initial marketing authorisation. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics product | 30/05/2008 | 10/07/2008 no | SmPC longer     | A cumulative search for overdose cases that occurred in patients taking peginterferon alfa-2b up until 24 January 2008 was conducted. Of the 68 cases reporting an overdose of peginterferon alfa-2b there were three cases of note: one was with a potential overdose of 10.5 times the intended dose (about 500 mcg), one of 7.5 times the dose (1200 mcg) and one of 5 times the dose (600 mcg, taken over a 5-day period). There were an additional seven cases reported in patients taking between 300 and 575 mcg (2 to 4 times the intended dose), with a maximum of four times the intended dose administered Based on a review of these cases, the majority of reported events resulting from an overdose of up to 10.5 times the intended dose were generally events that are part of the known spectrum of pharmacologic effects of alfa interferons but perhaps were of greater severity than the adverse events reported for peginterferon alfa-2b during therapeutic use. The SPC has been updated to reflect this. |

| II/0079   | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC with a warning regarding the concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine in HCV/HIV co-infected patients. The package leaflet is updated accordingly. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   | 21/02/2008   | 14/04/2008    | SmPC and PL   | Data from the pivotal studies conducted in HIV/HCV coinfected patients as well as published data consistently show a higher risk of anaemia when ribavirin and zidovudine are co-administered. Anaemia is the primary cause for ribavirin dose reduction. Since ribavirin dose reduction may negatively impact Sustained Virologic Response, risk factors for anaemia such as concomitant use of zidovudine is a cause of concern on a safety but also efficacy point of view. As such the product information is revised to include a warning to prescribers that the concomitant use of ribavirin with zidovudine is not recommended and to highlight the associated risk of anaemia. longer authorised   |

| II/0078   | Update of section 5.1 of the SPC with the results of a long-term follow-up study to assess the sustained virological response after the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics product                                      | 21/02/2008   | 14/04/2008 no | SmPC          | This was a multicenter, long-term follow-up study of subjects with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) who had been treated in a prior study with peginterferon alfa-2b (with or without ribavirin). This study aimed to assess the durability of virologic response and to assess HCV disease progression. Overall the results of the study confirm the durability of the virologic response up to 5 years. The likelihood of maintaining virologic response over 5 years in subjects who initially achieved a sustained response is 99 %(95 %CI: 98-100 %). However, this does not preclude the occurrence of hepatic events in patients with cirrhosis (including hepatocarcinoma).                                |

In two clinical studies in HCV-HIV coinfected patients co-administration of ribavirin with zidovudine or stavudine did not significantly affect the intracellular phosphorylation of these NRTIs in vivo. Furthermore there is evidence that ribavarin does not negatively interfere with antiviral efficacy in HIV infection. As this in vitro interaction has no clinical impact the CHMP agreed to delete the entire existing paragraph referring to this interaction from section 4.5 of the SPC.   |

| II/0067 | Update of section 4.5 of Summary of Product Characteristics with the results of a study on the effect of Pegintron treatment on the pharmacokinetics of methadone and a related warning for patients monitoring. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics Medicinal product | 21/09/2006 | 23/10/2006 | SmPC        | This variation concerns an up date of section 4.5 of the SPC following the results of a study to determine the effect of Pegintron treatment on the pharmacokinetics of methadone. This study was carried out because some individuals who have previously used injected narcotics and subsequently take methadone have been identified as being infected with hepatitis C. Therefore these patients may be candidates for therapy with PegIntron/ViraferonPeg. The results demonstrate a small (about 15% to 19%) increase in the AUC and Cmax of methadone at addition of Pegintron therapy. The clinical significance of this increase is not known, however the CHMP concluded that it appears relevant |

The MAH also takes the opportunity to update the contact details of the local representatives for Lithuania in the package leaflet. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet product | 27/07/2006 | 01/09/2006 no | SmPC and PL longer | This variation is submitted further to the CHMP conclusions on ribavirin FUM 25 in which a cumulative review of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) was requested to determine the number of reported cases and further characterize this effect. Pure red cell aplasia is a condition where the body stops or reduces the production of red blood cells. This causes severe anaemia, symptoms of which would include unusual tiredness and a lack of energy. A number of cases reported in the safety review are in favour of a potential link between ribavirin and/or interferon therapy and the development of pure red cell aplasia due to a suggestive chronology. The number of cases of pure red cell aplasia, although remaining limited, increased since the last safety review on this issue (FUM 25 dated 7th April 2005). As a result of this safety review, the CHMP agreed to the addition of the adverse reaction pure red cell aplasia in section 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the package leaflet of PegIntron. |

n/a products and ribavarin were updated to include a warning on the duration of psychiatric disorders. This update took place in September 2005.  On assessment of a subsequent pharmacovigilance follow up measure for ribavirin  the CHMP requested a class labelling to put more emphasis on psychiatric disorders in the SPC and Package Leaflet of the interferon-alfa and ribavarin containing products.  Due to differences in the indications of these products it was not possible to propose a class labelling \"text\" for all these products. Rather the existing paragraphs pertaining to psychiatric disorders in the SPCs and Package Leaflets have been moved to the beginning of the corresponding sections and placed in a warning box in order to draw attention to these serious effects.

The need to harmonise the SPCs of the ribavirin and alfa interferon containing medicinal products has been highlighted on previous occasions as existing discrepancies regarding the recommendations for pregnancy and lactation might be confusing for prescribers and patients. The CHMP concluded that contraceptive measures should be used during treatment and for 4 months after treatment discontinuation in female patients and during treatment and for 7 months after treatment discontinuation in male patients and their female partners. Section 4.6 \"Pregnancy and Lactation\" of the SPC of Pegintron has therefore been up dated to add the seven month duration of contraception after treatment termination  for male patients and their female partners when alfa-Interferon is used in combination with disorders by  the CHMP on 23 March 2006. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

clearance of PegIntron is reduced by a mean of 17 % in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/minute) and by a mean of 44 % in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) compared to subjects with normal renal function. Based on single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal impairment not on dialysis and in patients who were receiving hemodialysis. The dose of PegIntron for monotherapy should be reduced in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. Patients with creatinine clearance &lt;50 ml/minute must not be treated with PegIntron in combination with ribavirin.

Because of marked inter-subject variability in interferon pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that patients with severe renal impairment be closely monitored during treatment with PegIntron.

The SPC recommendations on use in patients with renal impairment are as follows:

Monotherapy: PegIntron should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. In patients with moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/minute), the starting dose of PegIntron should be reduced by 25 %. Patients with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance 15-29 ml/minute) should have the starting dose of PegIntron reduced by 50 %. Data are not available for the use of PegIntron in patients with creatinine clearance &lt; 15 ml/minute. Patients with severe renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, should be closely monitored. If renal function decreases during

The use of interferon alpha in patient undergoing solid organ transplantation is controversial and has been debated over the years as Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) regularly recurs after liver transplantation and concomitant CHC is common in patients undergoing renal transplantation. Based on case series, there seems to be an increased risk for rejection in patients with kidney grafts, but, surprisingly, no such tendencies have been reported (or actually refuted) in patients with liver grafts.

Following reports of several cases of liver transplant rejection in the PSUR, the following warning was added to Section 4.4 of the SPC: \"Organ transplant recipients: The safety and efficacy of PegIntron alone or in combination with ribavirin for treatment of hepatitis C in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been studied. Preliminary data indicates that interferon alpha therapy may be associated with an increased rate of kidney graft rejection. Liver graft rejection has also been reported.

Based on an analysis of safety data, the adverse reactions: rhabdomyolysis/myositis, renal insufficiency and renal failure were added as rare reactions.  Ulcerative and ischaemic colitis and aplastic anaemia were added as very rare reactions.

SPCCorresponding changes were made to the Package Information Leaflet. The applicant took the opportunity to make very minor linguistic corrections to the SPC and PL in certain languages. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Medicinal product no longer authorised

This variation refers to changes to sections 4.2, 4.4. 4.6. 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC.

Changes were made to section 4.2 and section 5.1 to include information on the  predictability of sustained  virological response with recommendations for treatment duration. During a concurrent scientific advice procedure, the MAH presented data that a reliable decision regarding treatment discontinuation can be made at 3 months.  Patients who fail to achieve virological response after 12 weeks treatment are highly unlikely to become sustained virological responders (negative predictive value 100% for combination therapy, 98% for monotherapy).

For patients with genotype 1 who are responders at week 12, combination therapy should be continued for another 9 months.  All patients with genotype 2 or 3 achieved virological response following 12 weeks of combination therapy.  These patients should be treated for a total of 6 months with the decision to extend therapy to one year
