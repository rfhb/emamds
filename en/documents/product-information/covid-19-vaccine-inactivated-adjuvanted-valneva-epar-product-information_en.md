There is no experience with use of COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3).

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution to individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals. Duration of protection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical studies. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness Individuals may not be fully protected until 14 days after their second dose. As with all vaccines, vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva may not protect all vaccine recipients (see section 5.1). Excipients Potassium This vaccine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per 0.5 mL dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium-free'. Sodium This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Fertility

Very common (≥ 1/10) Common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10) Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100) Rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000) Very rare (&lt; 1/10,000)

Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The safety of COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva (VLA2001) was evaluated from an interim analysis of an ongoing study in the United Kingdom in adult healthy participants (or with a stable medical condition) aged 18 years and older. 2,972 subjects were randomized to receive either VLA2001 (n=1,977) or the comparator AZD1222 (n=995) in a blinded manner, while 1,040 subjects from 18-30 years of age received open label VLA2001. The median age of the participants was 33 years, with less than 1% above 50 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the pivotal studies were injection site tenderness (76,4%), fatigue (57,3%), injection site pain (52,9%), headache (40,6%), myalgia (44.0%), and nausea/vomiting (14,8%). The majority of adverse reactions were mild and resolved within 2 days of vaccination. The incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar after the first and second doses. They tended to decrease with age. After a booster dose, the tolerability profile was similar to that observed after the first and second dose. The most frequent reported adverse reactions were injection site tenderness (57,3 %), injection site pain (35.0%), fatigue (32.0%), muscle pain (26.0%), headache (22.5%), nausea/vomiting (6.4%), and fever/body temperature (2.0%). The majority of adverse reactions were mild and resolved within 2 days of vaccination. A booster dose with VLA2001 was safe and well tolerated regardless of which priming (VLA2001 or COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant])) had been received previously.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Viral vaccines, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX03

Mechanism of action

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva (VLA2001) is a purified, inactivated, and adjuvanted whole virus SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan strain hCoV-19/Italy/INMI1-isl/2020) vaccine grown on Vero cells.

The vaccine manufacturing process makes the virus unable to replicate and delivers intact spike proteins on the virus surface. Adjuvants are added to increase the magnitude of vaccine-mediated immune responses.

i) superiority for VLA2001 vs. comparator for geometric mean titres (GMTs) in the IMM population and ii) non-inferiority for the seroconversion rates (defined as a 4-fold increase from baseline) ofin adults aged 30 years and older (PP population).

Following administration, VLA2001 induces SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies, as well as cellular immune responses (Th1) directed against the spike and other surface proteins, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. Using this vaccine, the cellular immune response is thus not limited to the S-protein but also directed against other SARS-CoV-2 surface antigens. No data on induction of humoral immune responses directed against SARS-CoV-2 antigens other than S-protein are available in humans. Pharmacodynamic effects Immunogenicity Efficacy of COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva (VLA2001) has been inferred by immunobridging of immune responses to the authorized ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) COVID-19 vector vaccine, for which vaccine efficacy has been established. Primary series The immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccine Valneva as a primary series was evaluated in one randomised, observer-blind, active-controlled, Phase 3 safety and immunogenicity study (VLA2001301) conducted in the UK. The study compared VLA2001 with an authorised COVID-19 vector vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) () in adults, including those with stable medical conditions. In total 2,975 participants aged ≥30 years were randomised (2:1) to receive either a 2-dose immunisation schedule of VLA2001 (n=1,978) or COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) (n=997), each given 28 days apart. Additionally, 1,042 participants aged 18 - 29 years were enrolled in a nonrandomised treatment group to receive VLA2001 in an open-label fashion. The immunogenicity population (IMM) included all randomised and vaccinated participants who were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative and had at least one evaluable post-vaccination antibody titre measurement. Samples from 990 participants who were seronegative at baseline were analysed. The mean age in the IMM population was approximately 36 years and both groups included more male than female participants (55.3% vs. 44.3% in the VLA group, 58.8% vs. 41.2% in the ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] group). The majority in both treatment groups was white (95.1% in the VLA group, 93.6% in the ChAdOx1-S [recombinant] group). The per protocol (PP) population comprised of all IMM-population participants who had no major protocol violations that impacted the immune response (n=489 VLA2001 and n=498 COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) participants met the criteria). Based on the SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralising antibodies at two weeks after the second dose (Day 43), the co-primary objectives were to demonstrate Medicinal product no longer authorised

Antibody responses measured after a single VLA2001 vaccination were lower when compared to two VLA2001 vaccinations. This indicates that the second vaccination with VLA2001 is necessary to induce robust antibody levels in baseline negative participants. At a mean observation time of 151 days, 87 (8.4%) symptomatic COVID-19 cases (exploratory endpoint) occurred in participants 18-29 years and 139 (7%) in participants ≥ 30 years who received two doses of VLA2001. 60 (6%) cases occurred in participants who received two doses of COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]). All symptomatic COVID-19 cases were assessed as mild or moderate by the investigator and none of the COVID-19 cases were severe. Booster dose The safety and immunogenicity of a single booster dose of VLA2001 was evaluated in the booster part of study VLA2001-301 in participants aged ≥18 years . A total of 958 participants (n=712 given VLA2001 and n=246 given COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) as a primary course received a booster dose with VLA2001 approximately 8 months after completing the 2-dose primary series. Tables 3 and 4 summarise the Geometric Mean Fold Rises (GMFRs) in SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralising antibodies at 14 days after booster vaccination compared with pre-boost (Table 3) or compared with Day 43 on study, i.e. 2 weeks after the second dose of the primary series (Table 4). Neutralising antibodies titres increased in both VLA2001-primed and COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1S [recombinant])-primed participants from pre-boost to 2-weeks post-boost and titres were higher 2 weeks after the booster dose compared to 2 weeks after the second dose of the primary series (i.e. Day 43).

All symptomatic COVID-19 cases were assessed as mild or moderate by the investigator and none of the COVID-19 cases was severe. Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with COVID-19 Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproduction and developmental toxicity conducted. Repeat dose toxicity Intramuscular administration of the vaccine on three occasions at 2 weekly intervals (Days 1, 15 and 29) was well tolerated in rats. The study showed microscopic findings that were still evident after a 3week treatment free period, but with reduced incidences in the administration sites and spleen compared to before the treatment free period, indicating partial recovery. The observations would be considered physiological and immunological responses to the vaccine. Genotoxicity/carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed.
