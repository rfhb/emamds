## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a histologic type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative malignancies with differing clinical features and responses to treatment (Armitage, 1993). Morphologically, it is a distinct type of mature B-cell lymphoma usually infiltrating the mantle zone of lymph nodes or the area surrounding the lymphoid follicles. The 3 key components of the complex pathobiology of MCL are an aberrant cell cycle regulation due to overexpression of cyclin D1, abnormalities in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage responses leading to accumulation of genetic lesions, and constitutive activation of anti-apoptotic pathways (Alinari, 2012; Peréz-Galán, 2011).

Mantle cell lymphoma accounts for approximately 6% of all NHLs worldwide (Anon, 1997; Swerdlow, 2008). The annual incidence of MCL in Europe was estimated as on average 0.45/100,000 persons based on cancer registry data from 20 countries in the  (Sant, 2010). Patients with MCL typically are predominantly male and Caucasian with a median age of &gt; 60 years, and present with advanced stage disease. Despite intensive induction therapies in the front-line setting of young and fit patients, the clinical course is typically that of repeated relapses, and median survival of MCL is only 3 to 5 years (Abrahamsson, 2014; Salek, 2014).

Factors associated with adverse prognosis at the time of initial diagnosis are older age (≥ 65 years), advanced stage (stage III or IV) (Fisher, 1995; Norton, 1995; Teodorovic, 1995; Velders, 1996; Weigert, 2009), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, large tumour burden, bulky disease, and occurrence of B symptoms (Armitage, 1998; Tiemann, 2005). Age, ECOG, and LDH have been combined with white blood cell (WBC) count into a validated score for MCL, the mantle cell lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI) providing a reliable risk stratification at initial diagnosis prior to therapy(Geisler, 2010a; Hoster, 2008). Another prognostic tool is the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells as a measure of cellular proliferation (Determann, 2008; Hoster, 2008), although the Ki-67 assay has not yet been standardized across laboratories.

In patients who have relapsed after initial therapy, the prognosis is poor (Ghielmini, 2009; Herrmann, 2009; Zaja, 2014; Zucca, 1995). This includes patients who received autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), which provides reasonable disease control only in a limited percentage of relapsed MCL patients. Median overall survival (OS) is &lt; 1 year in early post-transplant relapse (Cassaday, 2013; Dietrich, 2011; Vose 2013). In the relapsed setting, additional important factors affecting the prognosis include refractoriness to prior therapy, number of prior therapies and responses thereto, types of prior therapies, and duration since last prior therapy.

In the European Union (EU) bortezomib in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is approved for first line MCL in patients who are unsuitable to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and temsirolimus and ibrutinib are the approved treatments for relapsed or refractory MCL.

The lenalidomide mechanism of action includes anti-neoplastic, anti-angiogenic, pro-erythropoietic, and immunomodulatory properties. Specifically, lenalidomide inhibits proliferation of certain haematopoietic tumour cells (including multiple myeloma [MM] plasma tumour cells and those with deletions of chromosome 5), enhances T cell- and Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and increases the number of NK T cells, inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the migration and adhesion of endothelial cells and the formation of microvessels, augments foetal haemoglobin production by CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells, and inhibits production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) by monocytes. In MDS Del (5q), lenalidomide was shown to selectively inhibit the abnormal clone by increasing the apoptosis of Del (5q) cells (SmPC section 5.1).

The current indication for Revlimid is as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Revlimid is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant (see section 4.2).

Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy.

Revlimid is indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with an isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate.

The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) applied for the following indication: Revlimid is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and/or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.

The recommended indication for approval is: Revlimid is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.

The recommended starting dose of lenalidomide is 25 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of repeated 28- day cycles. Dosing is continued or modified based upon clinical and laboratory findings (SmPC section 4.2).

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new clinical data with the exception of ERA have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

In Phase I environmental risk assessment, the PECSURFACEWATER of lenalidomide has been determined by summing the three separate PECSURFACEWATER values for each indication. The calculated market penetration factor for MM, MDS and MCL are 0.00013, 0.00015 and 0.00003 respectively and their respective PEC SURFACEWATER values are 0.0016 µg/L, 0.0008 µg/L and 0.0004 µg/L.

The total PECSURFACEWATER of lenalidomide is 0.0028 µg/L and thus well below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. A Phase II environmental assessment is not triggered

The partition coefficient (n-octanol/water) for lenalidomide was experimentally determined at several concentrations and pH values. The resulting logKow for lenalidomide was -0.34 (Kow 0.46) and hence below the trigger of 4.5. Therefore, a PBT assessment is not required.

## 2.2.2. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The updated ERA consists of a newly determined PEC SURFACEWATER value which corresponds to the sum of the PEC SURFACEWATER  for all three indications (see section 2.2.1). The resulting value is below the threshold and, therefore, lenalidomide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. This is considered acceptable and the updated ERA does not change the conclusions drawn from ERA submitted with the initial MAA that lenalidomide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.2.3. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

Considering the above data, lenalidomide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Dose response study

No dose-response studies were submitted. The claimed posology scheme (starting dose 25 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of repeated 28-day cycles) is the same as the one already approved in the indication 'multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy (RRMM)'.  The dose of lenalidomide selected for the clinical development program in MCL was based on results of two Phase 1 studies in RRMM (CDC-501-001 and CDC-501-002) that identified a dose of 25 mg as the Phase 2 dose. The activity of lenalidomide at this dose in MCL initially was shown in Studies NHL-003 and NHL-002. Based on these findings, the same dose schedule was selected for use in Study MCL-001 and then in the main Study MCL-002.

## 2.4.2. Main study

## MCL 002 (SPRINT trial)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled Phase 2 study to compare the efficacy and safety of single-agent lenalidomide versus single agent of investigator's choice (IC) in patients with MCL who were refractory to their last regimen or had between 1 and 3 relapses.

## Treatments

Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive lenalidomide monotherapy (Lenalidomide Arm further referred as Len arm) or the single-agent treatment selected by the investigator (investigator's choice) on a by-patient basis during the Screening/Baseline Phase (Control arm). Lenalidomide was administered orally once daily on D1 to D21 in each 28-day cycle. The starting dose of lenalidomide was 25 mg or 10 mg based on renal function. Treatment was to continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients in the Control arm were to receive investigator's choice single agent reference therapy.  Dosing of the investigators choice single agents is provided in Table 1.

The design of the trial is presented in the figure below.

## Figure 1. Trial design-MCL 002

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

a Disease in subjects refractory to their prior regimen or who relapsed once, twice, or three times. Relapsed was defined as subjects with best response to last treatment as CR, CRu, or PR. Refractory was defined as subjects not having achieved a response to last treatment (best response was SD or PD).

b Initial dosing of lenalidomide was based on baseline renal function: 25 mg starting dose for subjects with normal renal function (CrCl ≥ 60 mL/min) and 10 mg starting dose for those with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl &lt; 60 mL/min but ≥ 30 mL/min).

c For subjects on cytarabine, fludarabine, or gemcitabine treatment was capped at 6 cycles. If treatment was completed as planned, this was considered the primary reason for treatment discontinuation in these subjects.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to compare progression free survival (PFS) of lenalidomide monotherapy versus investigators choice single agent in patients with MCL who were refractory to their regimen or had relapsed once, twice or three times.

The secondary objectives were:

- -To determine the Overall Response Rate (ORR) of lenalidomide monotherapy or investigator's choice single agent in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) MCL.
- -To evaluate the safety of lenalidomide monotherapy or investigator's choice single agent in patients with R/R MCL.
- -To determine the Time to Progression (TTP) and Overall Survival (OS) of patients with R/R MCL who had received treatment with lenalidomide or investigator's choice single agent.
- -To investigate the health-related Quality of Life (QoL) of patients treated with lenalidomide or investigator's choice single agent.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was PFS defined as the time from randomization to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause.

The secondary endpoints were analyzed in an exploratory manner and included the following:

- ORR included best response of complete response (CR), CRu, or partial response (PR). Subjects who discontinued before any post-randomization efficacy assessments were considered non-responders.
- Duration of response was measured from the time of initial response (at least PR) until documented tumour progression or death. Tumour Control Rate (TCR) consisted of the rates for CR, CRu, PR, and Stable disease (SD).
- Duration of stable disease: Stable disease was defined as a response less than PR but that was not PD or relapsed disease. Duration of stable disease was calculated from the first SD date reported in the study to documented disease progression or documented response or death, whichever occurred first.
- TTP was defined as the time from randomization until objective tumour progression. Time to progression did not include deaths.
- Time to treatment failure (TTF) was defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including disease progression, treatment toxicity, or death.
- Time to first response (TTFR) was defined as the time from randomization until initial response (CR + CRu + PR) if response had been confirmed.
- Time to best response (TTBR) was defined as the time from randomization until first date of best response (CR + CRu + PR) had been confirmed.
- OS defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause.
- Quality of life was analyzed using the instrument EORTC QLQ-C30 Version 3.0 which is a 30-item scale. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, a global health status/QoL scale, and 6 single items.

## Sample size

Initially, it was calculated that 167 subjects were to be randomized to obtain 150 evaluable subjects, based on the width of the 95% CI around a certain point estimate for ORR that was considered significant clinical activity. After protocol amendment No. 2 (dated 14 December 2009) the primary endpoint was changed to PFS and the sample size was recalculated. For the primary efficacy variable, PFS, an improvement in median PFS from 2.5 months for the control arm to at least 4.25 months for lenalidomide was considered to be clinically relevant. Full information necessary for a one-sided log-rank test with an overall alpha of 0.025, to have 80% power, was to be achieved when approximately 128 patients had progressed or died.

After the third Data monitoring committee (DMC) held on 22 July 2011, the DMC recommended increasing the sample size from 174 (number of patients randomized at the time of the third DMC was held) to 250 patients and conducting the primary analysis 1 year after the last patient was randomized. Subsequently, the sample size changed to 250 patients following DMC recommendation (Protocol Amendment No. 4, dated 27 September 2011).

## Randomisation

Subjects were randomized 2:1 to the lenalidomide or the control arm, and stratified according to:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Time from diagnosis to first dose (&lt; 3 years or ≥3 years)
- Time from end of last prior systemic anti-lymphoma therapy to first dose (&lt; 6 months or ≥ 6 months)
- Prior stem cell transplantation (SCT) (yes or no).

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

Efficacy analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints were performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary and secondary endpoints based on the full analysis set (FAS), Per Protocol Set (PPS), and As Treated (AT) populations.

Intent-to-Treat Population defined as all subjects who had been randomized, independently of whether they received study treatment or not.

Full Analysis Set Population included all randomized subjects who had received at least one single treatment dose with centrally confirmed histology of MCL as well as documented progression at entry.

Per Protocol Set Population included all randomized subjects who had received at least one single treatment dose, had centrally confirmed histology of MCL, as well as documented progression at entry, without any major protocol violation.

As Treated Population defined as all randomized subjects who had received at least 2 cycles of treatment regardless of the treatment arm allocation.

The sample size increase recommended by the DMC was not supported by any planned interim analyses; therefore, adjustment for controlling the α-level was not planned in the original protocol and is described in this section.

The final level was determined using an α-spending function of the O'Brien-Fleming type and a new group sequential test procedure was also to be used to preserve the type I error following the method developed by Cui et al (Cui, 1999), and adapted by Wassmer for time-to-event endpoints (Wassmer, 2006).

At the time of the third DMC, 67 events had been reported of the 128 needed for the final analysis. If one interim analysis had been planned at 52% of the information the upper boundary for superiority would have been based on an α-spending function of the O'Brien-Fleming type with overall α = 0.025, one-tailed.

## Table 2. P-value for Rejecting Null Hypothesis (Superiority)

SAP = statistical analysis plan.

Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis was performed (unadjusted for the stratification variables for all time-to-event endpoints). The median, 25th and 75th percentile time-to-event data were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) unadjusted by strata and in addition, for the primary endpoint, within strata. The numerical difference (and CI of the difference) in the median, 25th, and 75th percentiles between lenalidomide and investigator's choice drug groups were presented for the unstratified analysis.

The groups were compared using the stratified log-rank test in order to assess superiority and the unstratified log-rank test as supportive analysis. A new statistical test was also conducted to take into

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

account the unplanned sample size reassessment recommended by the DMC and implemented after Protocol Amendment No. 4.

Subgroups included the stratification factors (time from diagnosis to first dose, time from end of last prior systemic anti-lymphoma therapy to first dose and prior SCT), demographic factors (sex and age) and relevant baseline disease characteristics (stage, MIPI, tumor burden, bulky disease, Ki 67 index).

The censoring rules for the main analysis are based on the FDA Guidance for Industry for Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics (FDA Guidance, 2007).

Thirty nine (46.4%) of the 84 patients who were randomized to the control arm crossed over to lenalidomide after having progressed on the control arm. At data cut-off, 33 of them had discontinued from crossover treatment, mainly due to disease progression (25 patients). The median time from randomization to crossover was 2.9 months (range: 0.7, 37.8). The disposition of crossover patients is presented in Figure 2.

## Recruitment

The study is currently ongoing with a total of 254 subjects randomized at 67 sites in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and UK. The first subject was randomized on 26 May 2009. The last subject was randomized on 7 March 2013.

## Conduct of the study

The protocol was amended 5 times. The major changes to the conduct of the study are listed below:

- modification of primary endpoint from ORR to PFS,
- sample size increase to 250 patients,
- modification of type of analysis primary efficacy analysis was set 1 year after the last patient was randomized, instead of when 128 deaths or progressions had occurred. Thus, the event-driven analysis (128 events) was switched to a time-fixed analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- control of alpha error type to address the unplanned sample size change.

## PFS Based on investigator's assessment

The results of the PFS analyses based on data from investigators' assessments showed a 37% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for patients in the Len arm compared with those in the Control arm (HR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.86); using the sequential log-rank test, a statistically significant longer PFS in the Len arm than in the Control arm (p = 0.006) was observed.

The stratified analysis indicated a 41% reduction in the risk favouring the Len arm (HR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.85). A statistically significant longer PFS in the Len arm was seen by both the stratified (p = 0.003) and the unstratified (p = 0.004) log-rank tests.

The number of events analysed as per investigator's assessment was 178 compared to 165 in the primary analysis. Of the 178 patients who had progressed or died, 67.1% of patients in the Len arm had PFS events compared with 76.2% in the Control arm (data not shown).

## Sensitivity analyses

When progression or death under a new anti-lymphoma treatment or under crossover lenalidomide was considered as an event, the risk reduction in favour of the Len Arm was maintained (HR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.84).

When death or progression after an extended lost-to-follow-up time (≥ 2 missed assessments) was considered as an event, no patients had been censored according to that situation, so results exactly replicate the primary analysis (HR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.90).

When the earliest date of documented progression determined either by the IRC or the investigator's assessment (instead of only IRC) was considered the date of the event, a greater number of events was collected than in any of the previous analyses, both in the Len Arm (n = 123; 72.4%) and in the Control arm (n = 71; 84.5%) and the risk reduction favouring the Len Arm was 40% (HR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.84) (data not shown).

## Multivariate Analysis Using Cox Regression on Progression-free Survival

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The stratified Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate the HR and associated 95% CIs. Based on centrally reviewed data and after correction for several prognostic factors using this model, a risk reduction in PFS of 62% (HR = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.58; p &lt; 0.001) was observed in the Len Arm.

Beside the treatment effect, the Cox proportional hazards multivariate model of PFS for treatment arms estimated the following prognostic factors significant (p &lt; 0.050): low or normal LDH at baseline, &lt; 3 prior systemic anti lymphoma therapies, time since last rituximab to first dose ≥ 230 days, no bulky disease at baseline, low or normal Ki-67 index (Table 8).

a High tumour burden is defined as at least one lesion that is ≥ 5 cm in diameter or 3 lesions that are ≥ 3 cm in diameter by central review.

Note: Data cutoff date is 07 Mar 2014. A total of 17 subjects did not have data on high or low tumor burden at baseline (CSR MCL-002 Table 14.1.3). Source: Table 1.1.1.

In multivariate logistic regression analyses of progression, high tumour burden was associated with higher risk of progression within 20 weeks (but not after 20 weeks) while lenalidomide treatment was associated with lower risk of progression in both subgroups .

## Subgroup analyses of PFS

A Forest plot of the HRs by subgroups for the primary comparison of PFS by central review (ITT population) between Len arm and Control arm is shown in Figure 4.

High  tumour  burden  was  among  the  baseline  disease  characteristics  with  a  higher  incidence  in  the lenalidomide group than in the control group (47.6% [81/170] versus 33.3% [28/84]).

For OS, a HR of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.42, 1.19; p = 0.196) was observed in the subgroup of low tumour burden at baseline, and a HR of 1.17 (95% CI: 0.66, 2.08; p = 0.583) was seen in the high tumour burden subgroup for lenalidomide compared to control (Figure 6). Caution should be exercised when interpreting the results due to the smaller numbers of subjects at risk in the control group (n = 28) and in the lenalidomide group (n = 81).

## Early deaths

In the ITT population, there was an overall apparent increase in deaths within 20 weeks in the lenalidomide arm 22/170 (13%) versus 6/84 (7%) in the control arm. Patients with high tumour burden at baseline are at increased risk of early death, 16/81 (20%) early deaths in the lenalidomide arm and 2/28 (7%) early deaths in the control arm. Within 52 weeks corresponding figures were 32/81 (39.5%) and 6/28 (21%).

In a multivariate logistic analysis of early deaths (within 20 weeks post randomization) in both treatment arms (n = 28) high tumour burden at baseline was a significant prognostic factor after correction for several risk factors (OR = 0.262; p = 0.007).

## · Duration of stable disease

The KM curves based on central review showed no difference in the estimated duration of SD between treatment arms (p = 0.884, log-rank test); similarly, results obtained in the FAS, PPS, and AT Populations did not show a clear trend in the comparison of SD between arms (data not shown).

## · Time to treatment failure

The TTF was longer in Len arm than in the Control arm (p = 0.046, log-rank test). The improvement in median TTF between the Len arm, 24.4 weeks (5.6 months), and the Control arm, 17.9 weeks (4.1 months), was 6.5 weeks (1.5 months). Similarly, TTF by investigator's assessment is longer in Len arm than in Control arm but still without statistical significance (data not shown).

## · Time to first response (TTFR) and time to best response (TTBR)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Analysis of TTFR by central review shows a rapid increase in the number of responders in the Len arm compared with the Control arm (HR = 3.91, 95% CI 1.95-7.85; p &lt; 0.001).

The median time to first response was 18.7 weeks (4.3 months) in the Len arm and had not been reached for the Control arm at the data cut-off date.

The median TTBR was 26.7 weeks (6.2 months) in the Lenalidomide Arm and had not been reached for the Control Arm at the data cut-off date (data not shown).

## · Quality of life

The QoL assessment was performed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 (a 30-item oncology-specific questionnaire). QoL are assessed at 6 time points: screening, after cycle 2 (C3D1), after cycle 4 (C5D1), after cycle 6 (C7D1), after cycle 8 (C9D1) and time of discontinuation from treatment (TxDC).

A 10-point change in the scoring is considered to be a meaningful change in QoL (Osoba,1998).

EORTC QLQ-30=European Organization forResearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality ofLife Questionnaire Core 30;ITT=intent-to-treat.

Overall, compliance declined over the course of the study, with higher non-compliance rates typically seen among patients in the control arm versus patients in the Len arm.

Among patients in the Len arm at treatment discontinuation, scores trended towards deterioration for the majority of scales, although scores for emotional functioning, pain, nausea/vomiting, insomnia, and financial problems improved slightly among patients in this arm (data not shown).

## MCL 001 study (EMERGE)

Study MCL 001 was a phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to determine the efficacy and safety of single-agent lenalidomide in patients with mantle cell NHL who have relapsed or progressed after treatment with bortezomib or are refractory to bortezomib.

This study was comprised of 3 phases: a pretreatment phase, a treatment phase, and a follow-up phase. During pretreatment phase, potential study patients were screened for protocol eligibility within 28 days of Cycle 1, Day 1 (unless otherwise specified) prior to the start of lenalidomide therapy.

Patients continued participation in the treatment phase until disease progression, development of unacceptable AEs, or voluntary withdrawal. Patients who experienced disease progression or relapsed or who stopped treatment for other reasons entered the follow-up phase.

The follow-up phase of this study will continue until either 70% of the patients have died or a maximum of 4 years from enrollment of the last patient, whichever occurs first. Note that patients were to be followed for the occurrence of SPMs through 5 years after enrollment of the last patient.

Primary efficacy endpoints were the overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR).

The planned sample size was 133 patients. As of the data cut-off date of 20 March 2013, enrollment is complete with 117 (87%) of the 134 treated patients off study treatment and 17 patients (13%) ongoing on treatment. Table 16 summarises the main efficacy results on ITT population.

## NHL 002 study

NHL 002 was a phase 2, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single-agent lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. This trial was conducted in 2 phases: a treatment phase and a follow-up phase.

The  treatment  phase  began  on  Day  1  of  Cycle  1.  Patients  meeting  all  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  were enrolled to receive oral lenalidomide starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1, at a dose of 25 mg once daily to be taken on Days 1 to 21 every 28-day cycle. Treatment continued up to 52 weeks or until disease progression developed, lenalidomide treatment was discontinued for any reason, or the study was terminated.

Primary efficacy endpoint was response rate.

A total of 50 patients were enrolled in the study of which only 15 were MCL.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The pivotal study MCL-002 was an open-label  randomised (2:1) study in which single lenalidomide (n=170) was compared to investigator's pre-randomisation choice of chlorambucil, rituximab, cytarabine, gemcitabine or fludarabine (po/iv) single therapy (n=84). Although the chosen comparators are considered acceptable in the setting of R/R disease in patients not amenable for intensive chemotherapy, it would have been appropriate to include temsirolimus and bortezomib. However, efficacy in patients who had relapsed or progressed following, or were refractory to bortezomib is supported by the results obtained in the single arm MCL-001  study  (n=134),  which  recruited  a  heavily  pre-treated  patient  population  including  previous exposure to bortezomib. Additional supportive data are available from the NHL-003 and NHL-002 studies which included 57 and 15 patients with R/R MCL, respectively.

Current therapies such as ibrutinib or bortezomib may challenge lenalidomide position in the sequence of second or further line of treatment. In order to study the efficacy of lenalidomide use subsequent to ibrutinib treatment, the MAH is currently conducting the non-interventional Study CC-5013-MCL-004 in patients with MCL  who  have  relapsed  or  progressed  after  treatment  with  ibrutinib  or  are  refractory  or  intolerant  to ibrutinib, and who are subsequently treated with lenalidomide monotherapy or a lenalidomide-containing regimen. The CHMP recommended the applicant to submit the results of study CC-5013-MCL-004 post approval.

The patient population enrolled into MCL-002 study is representative of the patient population of R/R MCL encountered  in  general  clinical  practice.  Patients  were  mainly  elderly,  male,  and  had  advanced  disease stage.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The results of the PFS analysis in study MCL-002 showed a statistically significant improvement in median PFS  (HR  =0.61;  95%  CI  0.44-0.84,  p=0.004)  of  14.9  weeks  (3.4  months)  in  patients  treated  with lenalidomide versus those treated with best investigator choice (BIC).

All  secondary  analyses  of  PFS,  including  sensitivity  analyses  showed  significantly  longer  PFS  with lenalidomide compared to BIC, with a consistent HR, thus confirming the robustness of the PFS data in the pivotal study. The effect on PFS was consistent across the investigated subgroups, which are considered relevant for the claimed indication.

During the assessment, the CHMP raised a major objection on the proposed indication to be restricted to RRMCL patients who are not eligible to high dose therapy and/or transplantation as soon as the first relapse happens. Moreover, as advanced stage is a factor associated with adverse/worse prognosis, the potential restriction of the target population to stage III or IV MCL patients was discussed. Allogeneic transplantation is an appropriate option for patients with relapsed or refractory disease who are in remission following second line therapy. In the subset of patients who relapsed after SCT, responses have been observed with lenalidomide, including the achievement of CR. Therefore patients having received prior HDT/SCT in first relapse should not be excluded from subsequent treatment with lenalidomide since they may miss the opportunity to benefit from it. Finally stage as a prognostic factor is not applicable to RRMCL therefore the CHMP agreed with the indication initially proposed by the applicant.

The median OS for single-agent lenalidomide treatment was 27.9 months (2.3 years) compared with 21.2 months (1.8 years) for BIC single-agent treatment however this survival advantage of 6.7 months was not statistically significant (HR =0.89; 95% CI 0.62, 1.28, p=0.519). Moreover, 22 patients in the Lenalidomide arm died during the first 20 weeks after randomization. An analysis on OS by tumour burden at baseline was provided by the applicant showing an increased proportion of early death prior to progression in the high

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tumour burden group in the lenalidomide arm (see discussion on clinical safety). Although a definitive association has not been established in view of the potential confounders and small numbers in these subgroup analyses, lenalidomide is not recommended for the treatment of patients with high tumour burden if alternative treatment options are available (see section 4.4 of the SmPC and benefit-risk balance, unfavourable effects).

Regarding the other secondary endpoints, higher ORR was observed in lenalidomide arm (40.0%) which was statistically  significant  compared  to  the  Control  arm  (10.7%).  A  higher  quality  of  response  was  also observed in the Len arm, with a CR rate of 4.7%, compared to 0.0% in the Control arm (p = 0.043). Tumour control rate was comparable between arms. Responses were also seen earlier in the Len arm of Study MCL 002 compared to the Control arm, with a median time to first response and to best response of 18.7 weeks (4.3 months) and 26.7 weeks (6.2 months), respectively. The median time to first and best response was not reached in the Control arm. The DOR was 6 months longer in the Len arm compared to the Control arm although not statistically significant. Improvement of TTP confirms improvement of PFS. However due to the small number of patients achieving a response, results from the TTP analysis should be interpreted with caution.

Durable  response  was  seen  across  all  four  studies  presented,  which  is  of  major  clinical  importance,  as RRMCL patients continuously relapse and the response rates and duration of response to next-line treatment usually get shorter. Study NHL 003 showed a PFS benefit consistent with that observed in the main study (median PFS of 8.8 and 8.7 months, respectively). In Study NHL 002, median PFS was 5.6 months, however, this study included only a small number of patients with MCL. In study MCL 001, ORR and DOR results have shown  activity  in  bortezomib-exposed  patients;  important,  as  bortezomib  recently  was  authorised  for combination therapy in 1st line disease.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The results of the pivotal MCL-002 trial are considered of clinical relevance. The statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in PFS together support a clinical benefit associated with lenalidomide treatment in the target population.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

The safety analysis included data from the following studies:

- main randomized Study CC-5013-MCL-002 (cut-off date7 March 2014), with 170 subjects randomized into the Lenalidomide Arm and 84 subjects randomized into the Control Arm (investigator's choice);
- Study CC-5013-MCL-001 (cut-off date of 20 March 2013) (n = 134 subjects);
- Study CC-5013-NHL-003 (n = 57 MCL subjects);
- Study CC-5013-NHL-002 (n = 15 MCL subjects).

## Summary of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)

Definition of TEAEs in the safety population:

- Study MCL-002: Any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first treatment of study drug and within 30 days after the last dose of study drug.
- Study MCL-001: Any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first dose of study drug and within 28 days after the last dose of study drug.
- Study NHL-003: Any AE occurring from the time of signature of informed consent through 30 days after the last dose of study drug.
- Study NHL-002: Any AE occurring on study or within 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

A tabular summary of study drug-related TEAEs, per investigator assessment, experienced by ≥ 2% of all subjects in any analysis group, by MedDRA SOC and Preferred Term (PT) is presented in Table 21.

◊ Adverse events reported as serious in mantle cell lymphoma clinical trials

## Adverse Events of special interest

AEs of special interest include infections, cardiac events (cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure and ischemic heart disease), venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism, tumour flare reaction, second primary malignancies, tumour lysis syndrome, thrombocytopenia, bleeding and peripheral neuropathy.

## Infections

In MCL 002, infections were reported in 53.9% of patients in the Len arm thereof about 16% grade 3 or higher. Lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia was the most commonly reported. Two (1.2%) patients in the Len arm had Grade 5 TEAEs of infections. One patients died due to neutropenic sepsis. The second patient (who was confirmed after study start to have CLL/SLL, not MCL) had Grade 5 AEs of septic shock and multiorgan failure, which were not considered related to study drug; the primary cause of death was listed as toxicity/multiorgan failure due to R-HAD chemotherapy that had been started as new anti-lymphoma therapy after lenalidomide treatment was discontinued.

## Cardiac events

In MCL 002, cardiac arrhythmias were reported in 9.6% of patients in the Len arm and 4.8% of patients in the Control arm. Grade 3 to 5 AEs of cardiac arrhythmias were reported in 4.2% of patients in the Len arm and 2.4% of patients in the Control arm, with Grade 5 TEAEs being reported in 3 patients in the Len arm. Three (1.8%) patients in the Len arm had Grade 5 TEAEs of cardiac arrhythmias; no patients in the Control arm had Grade 5 cardiac arrhythmia events. Two patients had Grade 5 TEAEs of cardiac arrest; cause of death was specified as 'other cause' (cardiac arrest and suspected cardiac arrest). None of these Grade 5 AEs was suspected by the investigator to be related to study drug. No patients in the Control arm had Grade 5 cardiac arrhythmia events. The only TEAE that led to treatment discontinuation was atrial fibrillation in 1 patient (1.2%) in the Control arm compared to no patients in the Len arm. Treatment-emergent AEs of cardiac arrhythmias led to dose interruption or reduction in 4 patients (2.4%) in the Len arm and in 1 patient (1.2%) in the Control arm.

In MCL 002, cardiac failure was reported in 5.4% of patients in the Len arm and in 2.4% of patients in the Control arm. The frequencies of Grade 3 to 5 cardiac failure events were similar between the Len arm (3.0%) and the Control arm (2.4%), with Grade 5 TEAEs reported in 1 patient in the Len arm and 2 patients in the Control arm. One (0.6%) patient in the Len arm and 2 (2.4%) patients in the Control arm had Grade 5 cardiac failure events. None of these Grade 5 AEs was suspected by the investigator to be related to study drug.None of the selected TEAEs in the selected AE category of cardiac failure led to treatment discontinuation in either treatment arm, and the only TEAE leading to dose interruption or dose reduction was cardiac failure, in 1 (0.6%) patient in the Len arm. In supportive studies, the frequencies of TEAEs, Grade 3 to 5 TEAEs, and SAEs of cardiac failure were 2.4%, 0.5%, and 0.5%, respectively.

In MCL 002, ischemic heart disease was reported in 4.2% of patients in the Len arm and 0.0% of patients in the Control arm. Grade 3 to 5 ischemic heart disease events were reported in 4 (2.4%) patients in the Len arm, with a Grade 5 TEAE reported in 1 patient. With the exception of the PT of blood creatine phosphokinase increased, all of the Grade 3 to 5 ischemic heart disease events in the Len arm was also SAEs. One (0.6%) patient in the Len arm had a Grade 5 TEAE of acute coronary syndrome. This patient's death was attributed to 'other cause' and theTEAE of acute coronary syndrome was not suspected by the investigator to be related to study drug. None of the TEAEs in the selected AE category of ischemic heart disease led to treatment discontinuation and the only PT leading to dose reduction or interruption was myocardial

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

infarction, in 1 (0.6%) patient in the Len arm. In supportive studies, the frequencies of TEAEs and Grade 3 to 5 TEAEs, of ischemic heart disease were 2.4% and 1.5% respectively.

## Venous Thromboembolism

In MCL 002, venous thrombo-embolic events (VTE) were reported in 7.2% of patients in the Len arm and 1.2% of patients in the Control arm. All events were considered Grade 3 to 4, no Grade 5 was reported. In the Lenalidomide Arm, pulmonary embolism was the most frequently reported VTE (7 subjects, 4.2%), followed by deep vein thrombosis (3 subjects, 1.8%), with none of the events being Grade 5 in severity. Most of these subjects had no prior thromboembolic events or risk factors, and 4 of the 9 subjects with pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis were not receiving thromboembolic prophylaxis prior to the event.

## Arterial Thromboembolism

ATEs were reported in 2.4% of patients in the Len arm and 0.0% of patients in the Control arm. All events were considered Grade 3 to 4 AEs (no Grade 5 AEs reported) and SAEs. None of the ATE events except the ischemic stroke was considered related to study drug and did not lead to study drug discontinuation.

## Tumour flare reaction (TFR)

In MCL 002, TFR was reported in 9.6% of patients in the Len arm and in 0.0% of patients in the Control arm. Of these TFR events in the Len arm, those in 3 (1.8%) patients were classified as Grade 3 to 4 events (no Grade 5 AEs reported) , 1 event was an SAE (0.6%), 1 event resulted in treatment discontinuation, and events in 2 patients (1.2%) led to dose interruption or reduction. All TFR events were considered related to study drug. Of the 16 patients in the Len arm with a TFR event, 11 patients received various therapies during the TFR episode (most frequently corticosteroids, analgesics, and antibacterials) and 13 patients did not have any change to study drug. In the supportive study MCL-001, approximately 10% of subjects experienced TFR; all reports were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and all were assessed as treatment-related. The majority of the events occurred in cycle 1 (SmPC section 4.8).

## Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)

In MCL 002, TLS was reported for one patient in each of the two treatment arms. There were no reports of TLS in study MCL-001 (SmPC section 4.8).

## Second primary malignancies (SPM)

The incidence rates of second primary malignancies in Study MCL-002 are presented in Table 24.

AML = acute myeloid leukemia; B-ALL = B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia; CI = confidence interval; MDS = myelodysplastic syndrome; PY = person-years; SPM = second primary malignancy.

a Person-years are defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the onset date of the first SPM for subjects with an SPM and to the date of last follow-up for subjects without an SPM.

b Subject  was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the skin on his left forehead prior to the first dose of lenalidomide. He had a relapse of this non-melanoma skin cancer in the same location after receiving lenalidomide. Thus, the squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is not considered to be an SPM and is excluded from all analyses of SPMs.

c Subject  had a non-melanoma skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma of skin) that became an invasive solid tumor because it metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. In addition to this invasive solid tumor (metastatic squamous cell carcinoma), this subject had non-melanoma skin cancers (squamous cell carcinoma of skin). This subject is counted only once in the total SPM row.

d Subjectwas diagnosed with a solid tumor SPM (meningioma) and non-melanoma skin cancers (basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of skin). This subject is counted only once in the total SPM row.

## Thrombocytopenia

In MCL-002 study thrombocytopenia was reported in 36.5% of subjects in the Lenalidomide Arm and 39.8% of subject in the Control Arm. Grade 3 to 5 TEAEs of thrombocytopenia were reported in 27.7% of subjects in the Control Arm and in 18.0% of subjects in the Lenalidomide Arm. There were no Grade 5 TEAEs of thrombocytopenia. The frequencies of SAEs of thrombocytopenia were 1.8% in the Lenalidomide Arm and 2.4% in the Control Arm.

The frequency of TEAEs of thrombocytopenia was similar between MCL subjects from the supportive studies (40.8%) and those in the Lenalidomide Arm of the main study (36.5%), with a higher frequency of Grade 3 to 5 AEs reported in the supportive studies (28.6%) than in the main study (18.0%).

## Neutropenia

In MCL patients, lenalidomide is associated with a higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (43.7% in lenalidomide-treated patients compared with 33.7% in patients in the control arm in the Phase II study). Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed in 6.0% of lenalidomide-treated patients compared with 2.4% in patients on control arm (see section 4.8 of the SmPC).

## Bleeding

In MCL-002 study bleeding was reported in 11.4% of subjects in the Lenalidomide Arm and 10.8% of subjects in the Control Arm.  The most common bleeding event in both treatment arms was epistaxis (3.6% in the Lenalidomide Arm, 2.4% in the Control Arm). Grade 3 to 5 bleeding events were reported at the same frequency in both treatment arms (3.6% each arm), with 1 Grade 5 TEAE being reported in the Lenalidomide Arm only. Most Grade 3 to 5 bleeding events occurred in the SOC of gastrointestinal disorders for both treatment arms. One (0.6%) subject in the Lenalidomide Arm had a Grade 5 bleeding event (cerebral haemorrhage) which was not considered related to study drug. No subjects in the Control Arm had Grade 5 bleeding events. All of the Grade 3 to 5 bleeding events reported in the Lenalidomide Arm was SAEs, whereas in the Control Arm the only Grade 3 to 5 bleeding event that was an SAE was abdominal wall hematoma.

The frequency of TEAEs of bleeding was similar among MCL subjects from the supportive studies (14.6%) and those in the Lenalidomide Arm of the main study (11.4%), with similar frequencies of Grade 3 to 5 AEs and SAEs reported in the supportive studies (3.9% and 3.4%, respectively) and in the main study (3.6% and 3.6%, respectively).

## Peripheral Neuropathy

In MCL 002, peripheral neuropathy was reported in 7.8% of patients in the Len arm and 1.2% of patients in the Control arm. Grade 3 to 4 peripheral neuropathy (no Grade 5 AEs reported) was reported in 3 (1.8%) patients in the Len arm and in no patients in the Control arm. These events were not SAEs and did not result in study drug discontinuation.

In supportive studies, the frequency of TEAEs of peripheral neuropathy was higher among MCL patients from the supportive studies (11.2%) than in the Len arm of the main study (7.8%), with a similar frequency of Grade 3 to 5 AEs reported in the supportive studies (1.9%) and the main study (1.8%), while no SAEs of peripheral neuropathy were reported in patients in the supportive studies.

eCRF = electronic case report form; MCL = mantel cell lymphoma; NA = not applicable.

a Each death broadly categorized into progression of MCL as the underlying disease, treatment toxicity, other causes (not related to malignant disease or toxicity), and unknown (not assessable or insufficient data), as selected by the investigator on the eCRF page DEATH.

b One death occurred prior to randomization and is not included in this table .

c Any death occurring on treatment and within 30 days after the last dose of initial treatment in the Lenalidomide or the Control Arm.

d Subject  died due to toxicity from subsequent treatment  [data cutoff date 07 Mar 2015].

e Death occurred after the last treatment dosing date plus 30 days for subjects treated with lenalidomide in the Lenalidomide Arm or with the investigator's choice in the Control Arm (including subjects who later crossed over to lenalidomide).

f Death occurred after the first crossover treatment dosing date and before the last crossover treatment dosing date plus 30 days.

g Death occurred after the last crossover treatment dosing date plus 30 days.

The rate of PD-related deaths within 64 weeks (when half of off-treatment death had occurred), was 75.6% (31/41) in the Lenalidomide Arm and 70.3% (19/27) in the Control Arm.

- Each death broadly categorized into progression of MCL as the umderlying disease, treatment toxicity, other causes (not related to malignant disease or toxicity), and umknown (not assessable or insufficient data), as selected by the investigator on the eCRF page DEATH. Not PD related comprises toxicity, other, and umknowm.

eCRF = electronic case report fonm; Len = lenalidomide; MCL = mantel cell lymphoma; PD )=progressive disease.

Any death occuring on treatment and within 30 days after the last dose in the Lenalidomide or the Control Amm (including crossover).

* Death occiured after the last treatment dosing date plus 30 days for subjects in the Lenalidomide or Control Am (including crossover)

Four-week periods do not strictly coirespond to actual cycle length, as delaying the start of next cycle due to dose intemuption was allowed per protocol.

## Laboratory findings

## Haematology

In MCL 002, the majority of the patients with baseline and post-baseline data had normal, Grade 1 or Grade 2 haematology values at baseline.

More patients in the Control arm exhibited shifts in ALC to a worst post-baseline Grade 3 or 4 than in the Len arm(shifts to Grade 3: 28.0% versus 14.0%; shifts to a worst post-baseline Grade 4 value: 17.1% versus 5.5%). More patients in the Len arm exhibited shifts in ANC to a worst post-baseline Grade 3 value than in the Control arm (24.8% versus 15.7%), shifts to a worst post-baseline Grade 4 value being comparable (21.8% and 20.5%, respectively). There were no notable differences in the pattern of shifts in haemoglobin, platelets, or WBC between the 2 treatment arms.

In supportive trials, the majority of the patients with baseline and post-baseline data had normal, Grade 1 or Grade 2 haematology values at baseline. More patients in the Len arm from the main study exhibited shifts in ANC to a worst post-baseline Grade 4 value compared with the MCL patients from the supportive studies (21.8% versus 12.9%).

## Serum Chemistry

In MCL 002, few patients exhibited shifts in chemistry parameters to a worst post baseline Grade 3 value in either treatment arm. The most common of these shifts pertained to uric acid (14.3% of the patients in the Len arm and 18.5% in the Control arm). Shifts to a worst post baseline Grade 4 value were relatively rare, and included uric acid (8.1% of patients in the Lenalidomide Arm and 9.9% of patients in the Control arm), calcium (3.7% and 2.4%, respectively), glucose (1.3% and 1.2%, respectively), potassium (1.2% in each

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

arm), and sodium (1.2% and 0.0%, respectively). Shifts in chemistry parameters to a worst post baseline value were essentially comparable between the 2 treatment arms.

In supportive trials, except for uric acid, the shifts in chemistry parameters observed in MCL patients from the supportive studies were essentially consistent with those observed in lenalidomide-treated patients from the main study. Shifts in uric acid to a worst post baseline Grade 3 or 4 value, however, were less frequently observed in MCL patients from the supportive studies than in lenalidomide-treated patients from the main study (shifts to a worst post baseline Grade 3: 0.0% versus 14.3%; shifts to a worst post baseline Grade 4: 2.5% versus 8.1%). A larger proportion of lenalidomide-treated patients in the main study had uric acid Grade 3 baseline values compared with MCL patients from the supportive studies (38/161 [23.6%] versus 0/200 [0.0%]).

## Electrocardiograms

In MCL 002, two patients had abnormal, clinically significant ECG results post-baseline at unscheduled visits. One patient in the reported TEAEs of supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure congestive, and angina pectoris and one in the Control arm reported atrial fibrillation. Both had medical history significant for cardiac conditions.

## Renal impairment

There were altogether 34 individuals with moderate renal impairment vs. 132 classified as normal. In 24% of the patients with impaired renal function, Grade 3+ infections were observed in patients vs. 14% of those with normal function.

## Tumour burden

At the preferred term level, the following differences in the reporting of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were observed between treatment arms:

- In  the low tumour burden subgroup: there was a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (37.2% versus 30.6%) and febrile neutropenia (5.1% versus 0.0%) in the lenalidomide group, while in the control group more Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia (16.3% versus 6.4%), lymphopenia (6.1% versus 0.0%), and anemia (10.2% versus 5.1%) were noted.
- In the high tumour burden subgroup: there was a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 anaemia (10.1% versus 3.6%) and pulmonary embolism (6.3% versus 0.0%) in the lenalidomide group, while in the control group more Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (32.1% versus 13.9%), MCL (10.7% versus 0.0%), and lymphopenia (7.1% versus 1.3%) were noted.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The overall safety profile of Revlimid in patients with mantle cell lymphoma is based on data from 254 patients from a Phase II randomized, controlled study MCL-002.  Additionally, ADRs from supportive study MCL-001 have been included in table 3 ''ADRs reported in clinical trials in patients with mantle cell lymphoma treated with lenalidomide

The most frequently observed adverse reactions which occurred more frequently in the lenalidomide arm compared with the control arm in Study MCL-002 were neutropenia (50.9%), anaemia (28.7%), diarrhoea (22.8%), fatigue (21.0%), constipation (17.4%), pyrexia (16.8%), and rash (including dermatitis allergic) (16.2%) (SmPC section 4.8).

The serious adverse reactions observed more frequently in Study MCL-002 (with a difference of at least 2 percentage points) in the lenalidomide arm compared with the control arm were: Neutropenia (3.6%); pulmonary embolism (3.6%) and diarrhoea (3.6%) (SmPC section 4.8). The recommended blood cell count monitoring scheme applicable to MCL has been reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC to be performed every 2 weeks in Cycles 3 and 4, and then at the start of each cycle.

In Study MCL-002, TFR was reported in the lenalidomide arm only (16 subjects, 9.6%) thereof in 3 (1.8%) subjects classified as Grade 3 to 4 events (no Grade 5 AEs reported). One event was an SAE (0.6%), 1 event resulted in treatment discontinuation, and events in 2 subjects (1.2%) led to dose interruption or reduction.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Demographic and baseline characteristic of subjects with and without treatment-emergent TFR were generally similar, although those subjects in the lenalidomide arm with TFR appeared to include a higher percentage of males, slightly younger, and a higher percentage with high tumour burden (62.5% versus 45.7%) and with bulky disease ≥ 7 cm at baseline (43.8% versus 18.5%) than those subjects without TFR (SmPC section 4.4).

Tumour flare reaction was thus generally of mild to moderate severity, and often manageable with concomitant therapy and with no dose change or through dose interruption/reduction only.

Careful monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended. Patients with high MIPI at diagnosis or bulky disease (at least one lesion that is ≥ 7 cm in the longest diameter) at baseline may be at risk of TFR. Tumour flare reaction may mimic progression of disease (PD). Patients in studies MCL-002 and MCL-001 that experienced Grade 1 and 2 TFR were treated with corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or narcotic analgesics for management of TFR symptoms. The decision to take therapeutic measures for TFR should be made after careful clinical assessment of the individual patient (See section 4.4 of the SmPC).

Tumor flare reaction is the only new adverse reaction observed in patients treated for MCL (but has also been seen in patients with CLL) and has been classified as identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. To further investigate and characterize the association of lenalidomide and TFR the applicant will conduct a PASS on RRMCL patients treated with lenalidomide whose objective is to monitor incidence in 'real world' situation (see Risk Management Plan).

In study MCL-002 there was overall an apparent increase in early (within 20 weeks) deaths in the lenalidomide group. During treatment cycle 1, patients with high tumour burden were more likely to be withdrawn from therapy in the lenalidomide group vs. the control group group. The main reason for treatment withdrawal for patients with high tumour burden during treatment cycle 1 in the lenalidomide arm was adverse events. However, in terms of grade 3 and 4 events up to week 20, there was no obvious interaction between tumour burden and adverse events (see benefit-risk balance, unfavourable effects). Patients with high tumour burden should therefore be closely monitored for adverse reactions including signs of tumour flare reaction (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC).

In MCL 002 study, the incidence rate of total second primary malignancies (SPMs), in the lenalidomide arm and control arm are similar. For invasive SPMs, the incidence rate in the lenalidomide arm is inferior to the one of control arm because of solid tumours occurring less frequently in the lenalidomide arm. Therefore, the excess of risk in the lenalidomide arm is driven by the occurrence of non-invasive SPMs. Patients in the lenalidomide arm had a 2.44-fold increased risk (1.88/0.77) of developing a Non Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC) compared to patients in the control arm. Time to onset of SPM is 30 months in lenalidomide arm while it is 6 months in Control arm. The solid tumours involve various fields: hepatic, breast, lung and skin for the lenalidomide arm and colon lung, NSC, renal for the control arm. Risk factors for SPM in the RRMCL population have not been identified. In this respect, AML, B-cell malignancies and NMSC have been included as important potential risks related to the indication/target population in the Risk Management Plan. The applicant committed to provide updated information on SPM in patients with MCL in future PSURs. Specific targeted follow-up questionnaires to study the relation between lenalidomide and SPMs will be implemented (see Risk Management Plan). All these safety items will be reported and assessed at each PSUR evaluation.

In MCL 002, frequencies and incidence rates of venous as well as arterial thromboembolic events were higher in the lenalidomide arm than in the control arm. Most events of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis occurred within the first 5 cycles of treatment. Most of patients with venous VTE had no prior thrombo-embolic events or risk factors; half had received thromboembolic prophylaxis prior to the event. Although incidence of VTEs observed in lenalidomide-treated patients of Study MCL-002 did not exceed the incidence in MM patients (where lenalidomide is used in combination), it is similar to that of MDS (where lenalidomide  is  used  as  single  agent).   As  such,  the  warning  about  the  increased  risk  of  VTE  in  MCL

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

population is covered by the existing wording in SmPC currently applicable to MM and MDS population. The decision  to  take  antithrombotic  prophylactic  measures  in  MCL  indication  should  be  made  after  careful assessment  of  an  individual  patient's  underlying  risk  factors  and  with  the  same  caution  as  in  other indications (MM,  MDS).  Specific  targeted  follow-up questionnaires  to study  the  relation  between lenalidomide and ATE/ VTE will be implemented (see Risk Management Plan). All these safety items will be reported and assessed at each PSUR evaluation.

Among TEAEs reported at a lower frequency (&lt; 10%), the following were also reported more frequently (≥ 5 percentage points) in the lenalidomide arm than in the control arm: pain in extremity, headache, TFR, and vertigo. Sections 4.7 and 4.8 of the SmPC have been updated accordingly.

In MCL 002, infections were reported in 53.9% of patients in the Len arm with 16% grade 3 or higher and lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia being the most commonly reported. There were two deaths.  The risk of infection is classified as an important identified risk for lenalidomide in the current RMP and is adequately reflected in the sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Safety results for patients with RRMCL treated with lenalidomide were in general consistent with the known safety profile of lenalidomide with tumour flare reaction being only new adverse reaction observed in patients treated for MCL. Toxicity was generally manageable with dose reductions and/or interruptions.

To further investigate and characterize the association of lenalidomide and TFR the applicant will conduct a PASS on RRMCL patients treated with lenalidomide whose objective is to monitor incidence in 'real world' situation (see Risk Management Plan).

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

| CONNECT ® MDS/AML Disease Registry Non- interventional: observational Category 3 | The primary objectives of the registry are to describe practice patterns of common first-line treatment regimens (including lenalidomide-based) in the community and academic settings. Additionally, the registry will provide insight into treatment regimens and therapy sequence in clinical practice as they relate to clinical outcomes (response, OS, PFS) in patients with symptomatic MDS. Data regarding SPM are also being collected. | AML and B-cell malignancies NMSC Other SPM | Ongoing                     | Safety updates submitted with future PSURs.                           |

*Category 1 are imposed activities considered key to the benefit risk of the product.

Category 2 are specific obligations

Category 3 are required additional pharmacovigilance activity (to address specific safety concerns or to measure effectiveness of risk minimisation measures)

Specific targeted follow-up questionnaires to study the relation between lenalidomide and TFR/high tumour burden, ATE, VTE and SPMs should be implemented. All these safety items should be reported and assessed at each PSUR evaluation.

The PRAC also considered that the studies in the post-authorisation development plan are sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The primary efficacy endpoint, PFS, was met as a statistically significant improvement in median PFS of 3.4 months was reached in patients treated with lenalidomide versus those treated with investigator's choice of therapy in the Control arm. Results showed a 39% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for patients in the Len arm compared with those in the Control arm (HR =0.61; 95% CI 0.44-0.84, p = 0.004). The robustness of the PFS effect is supported by several sensitivity analyses, the results of which are in line with  the  primary  analysis.  A  consistent  risk  reduction  for  disease  progression  with  lenalidomide  was observed in the analysis of subgroups by number of prior treatment lines, by response to last treatment line (relapsed  versus  refractory),  and  by  number  of  relapses,  suggesting  that  the  treatment  benefit  of lenalidomide was independent of prior treatment lines.

This effect was further substantiated by results in ORR. A higher ORR was observed with lenalidomide which was statistically significant compared to the Control arm (40.0% vs 10.7%). A greater quality of response was also observed in the Len arm, with a CR rate of 4.7%, compared to 0.0% in the Control arm (p = 0.043). Responses were also seen earlier in the Len arm compared to the Control arm, with a median time to first response and to best response of 18.7 weeks (4.3 months) and 26.7 weeks (6.2 months), respectively.

The median OS for single-agent lenalidomide treatment was 27.9 months (2.3 years) compared with 21.2 months (1.8 years) for BIC single-agent treatment.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

A favourable overall survival trend was observed, however OS results of MCL 002 do not support the PFS results since the survival advantage of Len arm over Control arm is not statistically significant. The absence of difference in terms of OS could be attributed to the massive switch from Control arm to Len arm.

The positive effect of lenalidomide treatment on PFS remains consistent, with HRs of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.88) and 0.54 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.90) in subjects with low and high tumour burden at baseline, respectively. In the high burden group, OS curves are crossing. Whilst HR is not optimal in case of crossing curves, it is 1.2 (p=0.6) in the high burden group vs. 0.7 (p=0.20) in the low burden group. Numbers are small, especially in the high burden control group; however the erratic behaviour of the OS curves in the ITT population is explained by what happens in the high burden group.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The most frequently observed adverse reactions which occurred more frequently in the lenalidomide arm compared with the control arm in Study MCL-002 were neutropenia (50.9%), anaemia (28.7%), diarrhoea (22.8%), fatigue (21.0%), constipation (17.4%), pyrexia (16.8%), and rash (including dermatitis allergic) (16.2%).

The serious adverse reactions observed more frequently in Study MCL-002 (with a difference of at least 2 percentage points)  in  the lenalidomide  arm  compared  with  the  control  arm  were:  Neutropenia  (3.6%); pulmonary embolism (3.6%) and diarrhoea (3.6%).

In general, tolerability is considered moderate in severity, but manageable and the only new event refers to tumour flare.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In MCL 002, frequencies and incidence rates of venous as well as arterial thromboembolic events were higher in the lenalidomide arm than in the control arm. Most events of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis occurred within the first 5 cycles of treatment. Most of patients with venous VTE had no prior thromboembolic events or risk factors; half had received thromboembolic prophylaxis prior to the event. Since the incidence of VTEs observed in lenalidomide-treated patients of Study MCL-002 did not exceed the incidence in MM patients (where lenalidomide is used in combination) and it is similar to that of MDS (where lenalidomide is used as single agent), the existing wording in the SmPC satisfactorily addresses this safety concern. In addition, specific targeted follow-up questionnaires to study the relation between lenalidomide and ATE/ VTE will be implemented. All these safety items will be reported and assessed at each PSUR evaluation.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

In study MCL-002 there was an increased proportion of early deaths in the high tumour burden group in the lenalidomide arm. High tumour burden was defined as at least one lesion ≥5 cm in diameter or 3 lesions ≥3 cm (SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). In addition, a high rate of discontinuations in the lenalidomide arm during cycle 1 was observed. In a multivariate analysis high tumour burden but not treatment group was identified as a significant risk factor for early death. However, due to small number of patients, especially after having split the population in sub-groups for post-hoc analyses, data should be interpreted with caution. Although a definitive association has not been established in view of the potential confounders and small numbers in these subgroup analyses, lenalidomide is not recommended for the treatment of patients with high tumour burden if alternative treatment options are available (SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients with high tumour burden should be closely monitored for adverse reactions including signs of tumour flare reaction (see Risk Management  Plan).  Furthermore,  in  order  to  further  investigate  and  characterize  the  association  of lenalidomide and TFR, the applicant will conduct a PASS on RRMCL patients treated with lenalidomide whose objective is to monitor incidence in 'real world' situation (see Risk Management Plan).

Patients in the lenalidomide arm had a 2.44-fold increased risk (1.88/0.77) of developing a Non melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) compared to patients in the control arm. In this respect, AML, B-cell malignancies and NMSC have been included as important potential risks related to the indication/target population of MCL in the Risk Management Plan.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The clinical efficacy results observed for lenalidomide in RRMCL population are considered of a magnitude that is of clinical relevance both in absolute (3.4 months difference in median PFS) and relative terms (HR=0.61), in delaying progression of the disease.

The safety profile of lenalidomide in patients with RRMLC is overall consistent with what is already known in lenalidomide treated patients with MM and MDS with tumour flare being the only new safety signal.

## Benefit-risk balance

The efficacy of lenalidomide in the target population is considered clinically relevant and, in the view of the safety profile, the benefits are considered to outweigh the combined risks and uncertainties. Therefore, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Few alternative therapies are available for RRMCL patients. Because MCL iteratively relapses and relapsed patients may switch from one to another therapy, the availability of new medicinal products in second and further line treatment in RRMCL patients who are not eligible to high dose therapy and/or transplantation is considered of great clinical interest. Nevertheless, single-agent lenalidomide could provide an additional option and address the medical need in this rare disease with limited treatment options.

In patients with high tumour burden, the apparent early disadvantage of lenalidomide in terms of survival must be interpreted  with caution,  keeping  in  mind  that  the  pivotal  trial  used  active  comparators.  As  a consequence, lenalidomide is not recommended for the treatment of patients with high tumor burden if alternative treatment options are available. However, on a case-by-case basis, the activity of lenalidomide may bring some benefit to some patients with high tumour burden who must be closely followed to limit tolerability issues.

Treatment with lenalidomide provided clinical benefit to patients with RRMCL in the form of prolonged PFS with durable complete and partial responses to treatment. The lack of difference in OS is not due to lack of antitumoral efficacy. The overall clinical benefit of the treatment has been demonstrated.

## 4. Recommendations

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Revlimid (lenalidomide) is not similar to Torisel (temsirolimus) or Imbruvica (ibrutinib) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See Appendix 1.

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:
