| II/0033 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of SPC section 4.4 to include a warning of events of renal dysfunction in at- risk patients and to amend the existing text for renal artery stenosis following the CHMP assessment of PSURs. SPC section 4.8 has been updated relating to events of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure during post-marketing experience. The package leafet has been amended accordingly. product | 19/02/2009          | 03/04/2009                               | SPC, PL no                       | For aliskiren, cases of renal dysfunction with relevant occurrence were reported in the postmarketing use (PSUR 1 and PSUR 2). Following evaluation of the available postmarketing data, the CHMP concluded to add a warning to SPC section 4.4 that caution should be exercised when aliskiren is given in the presence of conditions pre- disposing to kidney dysfunction such as hypovolemia (eg. due to blood loss, severe or prolonged diarrhea, prolonged vomiting, etc.), heart disease, liver disease or kidney disease. Acute renal failure, reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, has been reported in at-risk patients receiving aliskiren in post-marketing experience.. In the event that any signs of renal failure occur, aliskiren should be promptly discontinued. Furthermore, SPC section 4.8 was also amended. |

| II/0026 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet Update of SPC section 4.3 \"Contraindications\" and section 4.5 \"Interactions\" following new information from a cyclosporine drug-drug interaction study (SPP100A2106), which was subject to a Follow-Up Measure. Further revisions were introduced to section SPC sections 4.4 \"Warnings and Precautions for use\" and 4.5. The package leaflet has been amended accordingly. In addition, minor corrections have been included in the relevant sections of SPC, labelling and package leaflet with Medicinal product | 24/07/2008          | 28/08/2008                               | SPC, Labelling, PL               | The results of the cyclosporine interaction study in 14 subjects showed that concomitant cyclosporine administration increased AUC 4.5 to 5.5 fold with a lower dose of aliskiren (75 mg) than the authorised strengths (150 and 300mg). Also cyclosporine markedly increased aliskiren t1/2. Hence, there is concern that the increase in AUC would be substantially higher with the approved aliskiren dosage, even exceeding the highest dose tested in humans. An additional concern is that aliskiren might distribute to tissues from which the medicinal product is normally absent in presence of a P-gp inhibitor, or preset at low levels because of the activity of P-gp. Non clinical and clinical data converge to show that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren bioavailability. In addition, literature data show that P-gp mediates tissue uptake of a variety of P-gp substrates and that P-gp inhibitors can markedly increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios.

Therefore, a contraindication for the concomitant administration with cyclosporine, a highly potent P-gp inhibitor, as well as with other potent P g inhibitors (verapamil, quinidine) is considered essential. Moreover, due to the risk for higher increase in tissue exposure than in plasma, caution should be advised during co administration with moderate P-gp inhibitors (ketoconazol, itraconazol, clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone). authorised                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The addition of 300mg aliskiren achieved an average reduction in the urinary albumin to creatinine (UACR) ratio of 12 mg/mmol (from 58 to 46 mg/mmol) compared to placebo. Aliskiren did not induce any significant effect on blood pressure or affect estimated GFR under these conditions. The clinical relevance of a reduction in UACR is not established in the absence of an effect on blood pressure. Furthermore, aliskiren was associated with an increased frequency (4.2% vs. 1.9% for placebo) in serum potassium concentration (? 6 mmol/l). longer |
