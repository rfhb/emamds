The MAH stated that Study CTBM100C2403 an open-label, crossover, interventional Phase IV study to compare  the  ease  of  use  of  tobramycin  inhalation  powder  with  tobramycin  inhalation  solution  and nebulized  colistimethate  for  the  treatment  of  pulmonary  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  in  patients  with cystic fibrosis , is a stand alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The dose was 112 mg tobramycin (4x 28mg capsules), administered twice daily for 28 days followed by 28 days off treatment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

· study CTBM100C2403 an open-label, crossover, interventional Phase IV study to compare the ease  of  use  of  tobramycin  inhalation  powder  with  tobramycin  inhalation  solution  and  nebulized colistimethate for the treatment of pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis.

A total of 60 patients were enrolled of which there were 4 paediatric patients.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study CTBM100C2403 an open-label, crossover, interventional Phase IV study to compare the  ease  of  use  of  tobramycin  inhalation  powder  with  tobramycin  inhalation  solution  and nebulized  colistimethate  for  the  treatment  of  pulmonary Pseudomonas  aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis

## Description

This open-label, crossover, interventional phase IV study was designed to evaluate the ease of use of tobramycin  inhalation  powder  (TIP)  administered  via  the  T-326  inhaler  compared  with  tobramycin inhalation  solution  (TIS)  and  colistimethate  (COLI)  administered  via  nebuliser  in  CF  patients  with pulmonary infection due to P. aeruginosa .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total of 60 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study treatment; there were 4 paediatric patients enrolled, all of whom completed the study.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

## Primary objective

To compare as a primary indicator for ease of use the mean cumulative time required to set up the delivery device (including preparation of the treatment), administer the drug, and clean the delivery device for  TIP  administered  with  the  T-326  Inhaler,  with  the  mean  cumulative  time  to  perform  the same  activities  (including  disinfection  of  the  device,  where  applicable)  for  the  patient's  usual  (prestudy prescribed) inhaled antibiotic treatment for P. aeruginosa .

## Secondary objectives

- To assess the absolute change in the number of P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFU) in sputum after up to a period of 28 days of treatment in each treatment arm.
- To  assess  the  frequency  and  type  of  microbial  contamination  of  the  T-326  Inhaler  used  to administer TIP after lifetime use (7 days of treatment) compared with the contamination of the nebulizer, used for the patient's usual nebulized antibiotic treatment for P. aeruginosa or  for any other nebulized medication (e.g. mucolytics), at baseline (Visit 2) and at each subsequent study visit.
- To assess the overall tolerability and safety of TIP versus tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) and TIP versus colistimethate sodium/colistin sulfate (hereafter referred to as COLI) over both the on-treatment and off-treatment periods of the study by comparison of adverse event (AE) rates, severity, and discontinuations due to AEs.
- To  evaluate  the  change  in  the  minimum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)  of  the  relevant antibiotic for P. aeruginosa after a period of up to 28 days of treatment of TIP versus TIS and TIP versus COLI.
- To  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  TIP  versus  TIS  and  TIP  versus  COLI  in  terms  of  clinical laboratory results and post-inhalational bronchospasm.

## CHMP comment

The objectives seem appropriate to evaluate the ease of use of TIP vs TIS/COLI.

## Study design

This was an open-label, crossover, interventional Phase IV study in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), aged ≥ 6 years. Approximately 60 patients were planned to be enrolled globally. This study consisted of a screening visit (Visit 1), cycle 1 (Visit 2 and Visit 3) and cycle 2 (Visit 4, Visit 5, and Visit 6). Each cycle  consisted  of  a  '28-day  on-treatment'  period  followed  by  a  '28-day  off-treatment'  period.  Each patient  was  assigned  to  1  of  the  3  treatment  arms  (COLI/TIP,  TIS/TIP,  and  TIP/TIP)  with  the  first treatment  cycle  based  on  the  patient's  usual  inhaled  antibiotic  treatment.  All  patients  were  then crossed over to receive TIP with the T-326 Inhaler at cycle 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study population /Sample size

The  study  population  was  comprised  of  males  and  females  aged  6  years  and  older  at  the  time  of screening with a diagnosis of CF, with an FEV1 ≥ 25% and ≤ 90% normal predicted values for age, sex and height based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (Hankinson et al. 1999) values for adults (adjusted appropriately with Wang's corrections for patients younger than 18 years of age (Wang et al. 1993), who had a pulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa within 6 months prior to screening (Visit 1) and confirmed at screening and were being treated with 1 of the 3 inhaled antibiotic treatments for P. aeruginosa (COLI by nebulizer, TIS by nebulizer, or TIP by T-326 Inhaler).

It  was  intended  that  approximately  60  patients  would  be  recruited  globally  and  60  were  actually enrolled.

## Treatments

The following treatments were used in this study:

The TIP drug-device combination product consisted of tobramycin dry powder for inhalation in capsules administered by the T-326 Inhaler. The test product consisted of capsules of TIP at 28 mg dosage strength.  Commercially available  product  was  used  and  was  overlabelled  as  per  local  requirements. Only TIP used in the second cycle of treatment was provided to the patient.

Commercial  nebulized  TIS,  300  mg,  as  prescribed  by  the  treating  physician  was  used.  TIS  was administered using the nebulizer used by the patient for this treatment at the time of entrance into the study.

Commercial nebulized COLI, 1 million or 2 million units, as sodium salt was supplied as vials of sterile lyophilized cake or as vials of powder, depending on the supplier. It was reconstituted in 0.9% sterile sodium chloride, in water for injection, or in 0.45% sodium chloride, depending upon the supplier and country,  and  had  to  be  reconstituted  and  administered  in  accordance  with  national  PI.  COLI  was administered by inhalation using the patient's usual nebulizer for this treatment.

Commercially available TIP was used in this study; therefore, batch number is not applicable.

Each patient was assigned to 1 of the following 3 treatment arms, with the first treatment cycle based on the patient's usual inhaled antibiotic treatment:

## COLI/TIP

- First cycle: nebulized COLI, 1 million or 2 million units twice or thrice per day (or the patient's usual  dose  and  regimen)  for  56  days  (no  off-treatment  period)  or  28  days  ontreatment followed by 28 days off-treatment (cycling regimen), depending on local treatment guidelines.
- Second cycle: TIP, 112 mg (4, 28-mg capsules) twice per day for 28 days followed by 28 days off-treatment.

## TIS/TIP

- First  cycle:  Nebulized  TIS,  300  mg  twice  per  day  for  28  days  followed  by  28  days  offtreatment.
- Second cycle: TIP, 112 mg (4, 28-mg capsules) twice per day for 28 days followed by 28 days off-treatment.

## TIP/TIP

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- First cycle: TIP, 112 mg (4, 28-mg capsules) twice per day for 28 days followed by 28 days off-treatment.
- Second cycle: TIP, 112 mg (4, 28-mg capsules) twice per day for 28 days followed by 28 days off-treatment.

The doses used in this study were the standard doses for this indication per the product labels or were in  line  with  the  proposed  labeling  and/or  CF  guidelines  where  the  treatment  was  under  Health Authority review. The duration of switch-over treatment, a single cycle for '28-day on-treatment' and '28-day off-treatment' periods, reflected the labeling.

Treatment assignment was based on the patient's usual nebulized antibiotic treatment (COLI, TIS, or TIP). At Visit 2, patients were assigned to continue to receive their usual nebulized antibiotic treatment for the first treatment cycle, and all patients were assigned to receive TIP for the second treatment cycle.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Efficacy assessments included the following:

- Microbial contamination of delivery device: P. aeruginosa and other pathogens (semiquantitative culture data: light, moderate or heavy growth)
- P. aeruginosa quantitative culture data (CFU from patients' sputum) or semiquantitative culture data (light, moderate or heavy growth, from patients' deep cough throat swabs)
- Semiquantitative culture data (light, moderate or heavy growth) from patients` specimens for nonP. aeruginosa pathogens
- MIC of selected antibiotics for P. aeruginosa from patients' specimens
- Use of antibiotic treatment for P. aeruginosa other than study treatments

The ease-of-use assessments included the following:

- Time required to administer study treatment, including device set-up/preparation, administration,  and  device  cleaning  (includes  the  time  needed  to  work  hands-on  with  the device during dismantling, cleaning [but not air drying or use of the dishwasher], disinfection activity [where applicable]). This was the primary variable of this study.
- Readiness of use of study treatment: expressed in preparation time which was defined as the time of start to time of completion of delivery device preparation plus the time of start to time of completion of study treatment preparation.
- Patient-reported outcomes (reported by caregivers for minors, as applicable)

## Statistical Methods

For the primary variable, summary statistics was provided for the mean total administration time per cycle  and  by  treatment  arm  and  for  within  patient  differences  in  mean  total  administration  time between treatments (cycle 2 - cycle 1) by treatment arm. In case the recording period starts earlier than 7 days prior the site Visit3/5 all data were used for analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The number of P. aeruginosa (CFU) in sputum, the absolute change after 28 days of treatment, the semiquantitative culture data (light, moderate or heavy growth), and the MIC of the study antibiotic for P. aeruginosa after 28 days of each treatment, were all summarized by arm and treatment.

The frequency and type of microbial contamination of the T-326 Inhaler used to administer TIP after seven  days  of  treatment  compared  with  the  contamination  of  the  nebulizer  used  for  the  nebulized antibiotic treatment or for any other nebulized treatment (e.g. mucolytics) by the patient.

All safety data, including AEs, AEs resulting in withdrawal of treatment, serious adverse events (SAEs) (all coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] version 18.1 terminology), laboratory test results, audiology (where assessed), airway reactivity, and vital signs were summarized descriptively for each treatment and treatment cycle by arm. Safety analysis was based on descriptive statistics  for  patients  who  had  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication.  Rates  of  cough, inhalation-associated  cough,  and  other  post-inhalation  AEs  (including  hemoptysis)  were  summarized by arm and treatment. Discontinuation rates were summarized by arm and treatment.

## Assessor's comment

Only descriptive statistics were used, no hypothesis was tested.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 60 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study treatment; 14 patients entered the TIS/TIP arm, 28 patients entered the COLI/TIP arm, and 18 patients entered the TIP/TIP arm (Table 10-1).

Most patients (51 patients, 85.0%) from all treatment arms completed the study. Nine patients (15%) discontinued the study: 2 patients (14.3%) from the TIS/TIP arm (both withdrew consent), 3 patients (10.7%)  from  the  COLI/TIP  arm  (2  due  to  AEs  and  1  due  to  protocol  deviation),  and  4  patients (22.2%) from the TIP/TIP arm (2 due to AEs and  2 due to protocol deviations).  All  these  patients mentioned  above  except  1  patient  (1006/00006)  discontinued  before  entering  cycle  2.  Patient# 1006/00006 (in the TIP/TIP arm) discontinued from cycle 2 due to AE.

## Baseline data

Demographic characteristics were comparable across the treatment arms (Table 11-2). The mean (SD) age of patients overall  was  27.6  years  (±8.40)  and  the  majority  of  the  patients  (93.3%)  were ≥ 18 years of age. There were 4 paediatric patients enrolled, 2 patients each in the 6 - 12 years and 13 17 years age groups. There were a higher proportion of males than females (65.0% versus 35.0%). All patients were Caucasian.

Demographic characteristics in safety set 1 and safety set 2 were consistent with the full analysis set.

Baseline disease characteristics are summarized in Table 11-3. Patients had a mean FEV1 % predicted that  ranged  from  55.0%  (TIS/TIP  arm)  to  62.6%  (TIP/TIP  arm),  which  corresponds  to  moderate airway  obstruction  (Cystic  Fibrosis  Foundation  Patient  Registry  2013  Annual  Data  Report).  Percent predicted values were recalculated according to Quanjer et al. 2012. The mean P. aeruginosa sputum density (sum of all biotypes) at baseline was slightly higher in the TIS/TIP (7.8 log10 CFU/mL) arm than  in  the  COLI/TIP  (6.9  log10  CFU/mL)  and  TIP/TIP  (6.8  log10  CFU/mL)  arms.  The  majority  of patients  had  pseudomonal isolates  with  tobramycin  MIC ≤ 8 μ g/mL at baseline (41 patients, 68.3% overall, ranging from 57.1% in the TIS/TIP arm to 75.0% in the COLI/TIP arm). Most of the patients did  not  use  long-  or  short-acting  bronchodilators  in  the  TIS/TIP  and  COLI/TIP  arms  at  baseline compared to 55.6% and 61.1% of patients in the TIP/TIP arm, respectively.

Overall,  38  patients  (63.3%)  experienced  pulmonary  exacerbations  prior  to  study  start,  with  the majority  being  observed  in  the  TIS/TIP  and  COLI/TIP  arms  (78.6%  in  each).  Of  these,  26  patients (68.4%)  were  hospitalized  in  the  previous  12  months.  Five  patients  (13.2%)  were  hospitalized  &lt;1 month prior to study start. Relevant medical history and medical conditions were higher in the TIP/TIP and  COLI/TIP  arms  (83.3%  and  82.1%,  respectively)  than  in  the  TIS/TIP  arm  (57.1%).  The  most frequently  reported  medical  history/condition  was  asthma,  reported  by  10%  of  patients  overall.  All other medical conditions were reported in &lt;10% of patients overall.

All  patients  (100%)  received  anti-pseudomonal  antibiotics  at  baseline  (Table  14.1-3.8).  The  most frequently used anti-pseudomonal antibiotics (any route of administration) were COLI (35 patients [all inhaled],  58.3%)  and  tobramycin  (33  patients  [32  inhaled,  1  i.v.],  55.0%).  Overall  31  patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(51.7%) received macrolides  (reasons  listed  mainly  as  prophylaxis)  at  baseline  and  the  percentage was higher in the TIP/TIP (61.1%) arm than in the COLI/TIP (57.1%) and TIS/TIP (28.6%) arms. The most frequently reported macrolide was azithromycin (31 patients, 51.7 %).

## CHMP comment

Baseline  characteristics  were  overall  balanced  between  the  three  treatment  arms.  The  observed differences are not expected to have any influence on the primary objective of the study (ease of use of TIP vs TIS/COLI).

## Efficacy results

The primary objective of this study was to compare the mean total time required to set up the delivery device, administer the drug, and clean the delivery device for TIP administered with the T-326 Inhaler with the mean cumulative time (including disinfection of nebulizers where applicable) to perform the same activities  for  the  patient's  usual  nebulized,  antibiotic  treatment  for P.  aeruginosa .  Analysis  of mean total (cumulative) administration time is presented in Table 11-6.

## CHMP comment

The mean total administration time for TIP is significantly shorter than for TIS/COLI. A considerable number of subjects did not contribute data for this analysis (35% missing for cycle 1, 38% missing for cycle 2), for unknown reasons.

- P. aeruginosa quantitative culture data (CFU from patients' sputum) or semiquantitative culture data (light, moderate or heavy growth, from patients' deep cough throat swabs) (Secondary objective # 1)

At Visit 3, after the end of on-treatment period in cycle 1, the mean log reduction of P. aeruginosa for sum of all biotypes was 1.4 log10 CFU in the TIS/TIP arm, 0.6 log10 CFU in the COLI/TIP arm and 1.7 log10 CFU in the TIP/TIP arm. At Visit 5 (cycle 2), the mean log reduction compared to cycle 1 was slightly less for the TIS/TIP arm and was similar in the other two arms. At Visit 6 (i.e., 28 days after off-treatment period in cycle 2), the recovery of CFUs returned to Visit 4 values or was similar to Visit 4 across the treatment arms.

## CHMP comment

The study was not designed nor powered to compare efficacy of TIP relative to COLI/TIS. The observed change in P. aeruginosa sputum density for TIP/TIP is however in line with data from previous studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Microbial contamination of delivery device: P. aeruginosa and other pathogens (semiquantitative culture data: light, moderate or heavy growth)

Overall 2 patients in the TIS/TIP arm (14%), 9 patients in the COLI/TIP arm (32%) and 1 patient in the TIP/TIP arm (6%) had any contaminated device across the treatment cycles.

In the TIS/TIP arm, the only pathogen observed after using T-326 Inhaler was S. aureus (light growth at cycle 2 [Visit 5] in one device). During cycle 2 (Visit 4) light growth of P. aeruginosa was isolated from the tubing used with a Pari LC Sprint nebulizer.

In the COLI/TIP arm, the majority of the pathogens were isolated from the device used to administer COLI  in  cycle  1.  Most  of  these  were  isolated  only  once.  The  pathogens  isolated  twice  were Acinetobacter lwoffi and Pseudomonas fluorescens (light growth) at Visits 2 and 3, respectively. Three pathogens ( Acinetobacter baumannii , Ochrobactrum anthropic and Sphingomonas paucimobilis ) were isolated with heavy growth.

In the TIP/TIP arm, in cycle 1 (Visit 2, baseline visit) moderate growth of P. aeruginosa was isolated from the mouthpiece used with a Pari eflow Rapid nebulizer. The medication administered through this device was not specified. No contaminated T-326 Inhaler was observed in both cycle 1 and cycle 2.

The emergence of organisms in delivery device cultures at the end of an on-treatment period that were not present at start of the cycle were S. aureus (TIS/TIP arm), and Acinetobacter species unspecified, Chryseobacterium indologenes , Delftia acidovorans , PSFL Pseudomonas fluorescens , Sphingomonas paucimobilis and S. aureus (all COLI/TIP arm).

- Semiquantitative culture data (light, moderate or heavy growth) from patients` specimens for nonP. aeruginosa pathogens

The majority of the pathogens were present in only a small percentage of patients and there was no consistent  trend  of  increase  or  decrease  in  density  for  most  of  the  pathogens  across  the  treatment arms.  Other  than P.  aeruginosa , Staphylococcus  aureus was  the  organism  most  frequently  isolated from sputum/throat swab samples post baseline. In the majority of patients S. aureus was present in the culture obtained at screening visit and persisted throughout the study.

- MIC of selected antibiotics for P. aeruginosa from patients' specimens

In general, the results showed that there was one dilution-fold increase in tobramycin MICs at Visit 5 compared to Visit 3 for the TIS/TIP and COLI/TIP arms. Improvement of MICs was observed at Visit 6. For patients who received TIP in both cycles (TIP/TIP), the MIC50 and MIC90 tobramycin values were stable up to Visit 5 (2 μg/mL and 64 μg/mL, respectively) and further decreased to 1 μg/mL and 32 μg/mL at the end of Visit 6.

- Use of antibiotic treatment for P. aeruginosa other than study treatments

In cycle 1, a total of 5 patients (35.7%) in the TIS/TIP arm, 10 patients (35.7%) in the COLI/TIP arm and 4 patients (22.2%) in the TIP/TIP arm received any new anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. The median duration of use was 14 to 19 days across the treatment arms. After crossover to TIP, in cycle 2, the frequency of new antibiotic usage was reduced from cycle 1 for the TIS/TIP (3 patients, 25.0%) and COLI/TIP (8 patients, 32.0%) arms, and remained similar in the TIP/TIP arm (4 patients, 26.7%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The ease-of-use assessments included the following:

- Readiness of use of study treatment: expressed in preparation time which was defined as the time of start to time of completion of delivery device preparation plus the time of start to time of completion of study treatment preparation.

The time difference in mean device set-up time was significantly shorter in cycle 2 (after crossover to TIP) than in cycle 1 for the COLI/TIP arm (mean time difference, within patient differences cycle 2 cycle 1: -2.6 min, P=0.0003). However, the difference in device set-up time between the treatment cycles remained similar for the TIS/TIP (mean time difference: -0.2, P=0.5065) arm. For the TIP/TIP arm, no significant difference between the cycles were observed.

The mean administration time was 11.7 min in cycle 1 versus 2.5 min in cycle 2 for the TIS/TIP arm, 7.6 min versus 2.2 min for the COLI/TIP arm, and 2.5 min versus 2.1 min for the TIP/TIP arm. The time difference in mean administration time was significantly shorter in cycle 2 than in cycle 1 for all three treatment arms (P=0.0005 (TIS/TIP, P=0.0001 COLI/TIP, P=0.0464 TIP/TIP).

The difference in mean cleaning time was significantly shorter in cycle 2 than in cycle 1 for the TIS/TIP (mean time difference, within patient differences cycle 2 - cycle 1: -5.6 min, P=0.0173) and COLI/TIP (mean time difference, within patient differences cycle 2 - cycle 1: -2.7 min, P&lt;0.0001) arms, but remained similar for the TIP/TIP arm.

The mean disinfection time was 16.1 min in the TIS/TIP arm and 3.6 min in the COLI/TIP arm in cycle 1, and not applicable for TIP/TIP.

- In paediatric patients (&lt;18 years): patient versus caregiver performing the various steps.

Overall five patients, two of which were paediatric  (3007/00001 [9 years], 4003/00002 [13 years]) needed help for any of the categories of device set-up, administration, cleaning and disinfection.

- Patient-reported outcomes (reported by caregivers for minors, as applicable):

The summary of the TSQM questionnaire showed that the median scores were high at cycle 1, Visit 3 and were either sustained or improved at cycle 2, Visit 5 for the majority of domains for all three arms.

## Paediatric summery:

There were 4 paediatric patients enrolled, all of whom completed the study.

There are no efficacy data presented or summarised specifically for these patients in the clinical study report.  Therefore,  the  individual  patient  listings  were  presented.  The  mean  total  (cumulative) administration time for the patient in the TIS/TIP arm was 14.7 minutes for TIS in cycle 1 and 4.6 minutes for TIP in cycle 2, which represented a 10.1 minute decrease in administration time with use of TIP in cycle 2. The mean total (cumulative) administration times in the TIP/TIP arm was 3.6 minutes in cycle 1 and 3.1 minutes in cycle 2 for one patient, and 1.4 minutes in cycle 1 and 2.1 minutes in cycle 2 for the second patient. The mean total administration time for the patient in the COLI/TIP arm was missing.

There  were  reductions  seen  in P.aeruginosa sputum  density  in  these  4  patients  consistent  with  the reductions seen in the overall study population. There were no significant changes in tobramycin MICs with the exception of a sputum isolate of P.aeruginosa biotype dry from one patient, which increased to &gt;512 μ g/mL at the completion visit from 0.5 μ g/mL at baseline. Despite this increase in MIC, this patient had a reduction in P. aeruginosa density noted at the completion visit in their sputum culture.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There  were  also  no  clinically  significant  changes  in  hematology  or  chemistry  parameters  in  these paediatric patients.

In terms of FEV1 % predicted in cycle 1 (Visit 3), at the end of the first on -treatment period for the two patients in the TIP/TIP arm, the mean FEV1 % predicted showed a relative change from baseline of 17.6% for one patient and 1.1% for the second patient. For the patient in the TIS/TIP arm there was a relative change of -5.1%, and for the patient in the COLI/TIP arm there was a relative change of -1.5%. In cycle 2 (Visit 5) at the end of the second on-treatment period to the completion visit for the two patients in the TIP/TIP arm the mean FEV1% predicted showed a relative change of -5.5% for one patient  and  13.9%  for  the  second  patient.  For  the  patient  in  the  TIS/TIP  arm  there  was  a  relative change of -9.1%, and for the patient in the COLI/TIP arm there was a relative change of -16%. A review of the FEV1 historical records for these patients in the 12 months prior to study entry showed that  these  changes  were  consistent  with  previously  reported  values  for  these  patients  with  the exception of the change in FEV1 values demonstrated for the COLI/TIP patient.

## CHMP comment

The  data  from  these  4  paediatric  patients  are  generally  in  line  with  data  reported  for  the  overall population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In cycle 1, the most commonly reported AEs (reported by &gt;2 patients in any arm) by preferred terms were infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (11.1% in the TIP/TIP, 35.7% in the COLI/TIP, and  35.7%  in  the  TIS/TIP  arms),  headache  and  sputum  increased  (each  ranging  from  0%  in  the COLI/TIP to 16.7% in the TIP/TIP arms), nasopharyngitis (0% in the TIS/TIP to 11.1% in the TIP/TIP arms),  and  cough  (7.1%  in  the  COLI/TIP  to  14.3%  in  the  TIS/TIP  arms).  In  cycle  2,  the  most commonly reported AEs by preferred terms were infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (ranging from 6.7% in the TIP/TIP to 28.0% in the COLI/TIP arms), headache and nasopharyngitis (each  0%  in  the  TIS/TIP  and  COLI/TIP  and  20.0%  in  the  TIP/TIP  arms),  and  cough  (0%  in  the COLI/TIP to 13.3% in the TIP/TIP arms).

## AEs possibly related to Tobi Podhaler® according to the investigators' opinion

In  cycle  1,  among  the  AEs  reported,  few  (4  patients)  were  considered  to  be  related  to  the  study treatment. None of the treatment related AEs in cycle 1 was considered to be severe in intensity. In cycle 2, 8 patients (15.4%) reported AEs that were considered to be related to the study treatment. All treatment  related  events  were  reported  in  single  cases  and  majority  of  them  were  either  mild  or moderate in intensity. Out of 8, a total of 3 patients had severe AEs. These were forced expiratory volume decreased and upper respiratory tract infection (patient# 3001/00002), acoustic stimulation tests abnormal and tinnitus (patient# 1006/00006), and cough (patient# 3007/00002).

## Serious Adverse Events

In cycle 1, a total of 3 patients (21.4%) experienced any SAEs in the TIS/TIP arm, 9 patients (32.1%) in the COLI/TIP arm and 3 patients (16.7%) in the TIP/TIP arm. Two of these patients discontinued treatment from the COLI/TIP arm and 1 patient discontinued treatment from TIP/TIP arm. In cycle 2, overall 8 patients (15.4%) reported any SAEs; of whom 1 patient (patient# 1006/00006) discontinued the study treatment.

There were no deaths reported during this study.

## Paediatric safety summery:

- 13-year-old male in the TIP/TIP group. An AE of cough was reported for this patient. The cough was mild for which no action was taken and was not suspected to be related to study drug.
- 13-year-old female in the TIS/TIP group. No AEs were reported for this patient.
- 9-year-old female in the TIP/TIP group. An SAE of infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF was reported for which the patient was hospitalized. The pulmonary exacerbation resolved and was not suspected to be related to study medication.
- 12-year-old female in the COLI/TIP group. There were no AEs listed for this patient.

There were no reports of airway hyperactivity noted for any of these patients.

## CHMP comment

The reported AEs and SAEs are in line with the known safety profile of Tobi Podhaler and the patient population under study. No new safety signals are identified from this small study, neither in adults nor in the 4 paediatric patients enrolled in the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

This open-label, crossover, interventional Phase IV study was designed to compare the ease of use of TIP with TIS and nebulized COLI for the treatment of pulmonary P. aeruginosa in patients with CF. The first treatment cycle was designed to compare the pre-study prescribed inhaled antibiotic treatments in terms of time spent on administration and contamination of the device used in a close to real-world setting.  The  second  cycle  allowed  the  direct  assessment  of  the  'switch  experience'  from  nebulized antibiotics to TIP in terms of patient satisfaction, efficacy, and safety.

A  total  of  60  patients  were  enrolled,  of  which  4  patients  were  paediatric  patients.  All  60  patients received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment  and  51  patients  completed  the  study.  The  baseline demographic characteristics were balanced among the treatment arms.

Overall patients on TIP took significantly less time than patients on COLI or TIS to set up the delivery device, administer the drug, and clean the delivery device. Suppression of P. aeruginosa and stability in FEV1 % predicted was observed. There was some variability demonstrated by the relative change in FEV1% predicted for the 4 paediatric patients, but in 3 of the 4 patients this variability was consistent with  what  was  reported  in  the  year  prior  to  study  entry.  There  were  no  new  or  unexpected  safety findings from the 4 paediatric patients enrolled in this study. The safety results observed in this study were generally consistent with the known established safety profiles of TIP and TIS.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

On the basis of the paediatric results of study CTBM100C2403, there is no change in the benefit-risk profile  of  TOBI  or  TOBI  Podhaler  for  the  existing  indication  worldwide.  The  efficacy  and  safety  data from this study do not warrant an update of the product information of TOBI or TOBI Podhaler at this stage.
