Medicinal Product no longer authorised

1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

In children/adolescents (aged up to 20 years), these studies have indicated an additional 1.4 to 8 cases in 100,000 vaccinated subjects. Available epidemiological data in adults aged over 20 years have indicated approximately 1 additional case per 100,000 vaccinated subjects. These data suggest that the excess risk tends to decline with increasing age at vaccination.

The immune response achieved with boosting at 12 months was comparable to that achieved with boosting at 6 months. This applies to both single and double priming regimens, and cross-protection for heterologous strains. There was no evidence of a waning of the priming effect over the 12 month period. The safety data support the favourable benefit-risk relationship for the regimens studied. The amendments proposed for the SmPC and PL were agreed. |

Given that psychogenic syncope is not a true side effect, it was not considered appropriate to include syncope as an undesirable effect in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

This clinical study is conducted in children aged 3 to 9 years, to evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of three formulations of AS03 adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine, given following a two dose schedule on Days 0 and 21.The MAH is also taking the opportunity of this procedure to update Annex II in order to reflect current information on the Pharmacovigilance System. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data Medicinal | 17/03/2011 Product | 20/04/2011 no longer | Concerning immune response, the D42 HI immune response parameters (SCR, SPR, SCF) did not clearly distinguish any one of the three formulations (Half HA/Half AS03, Full HA/Half AS03, Full HA/Full AS03) tested. However, the administration of a higher HA dose and, especially, the full adult dose, demonstrated advantages in terms of several HI and NA immune parameters. In particular, use of the adult dose gave improved HI responses to the heterologous strain and higher NA GMTs. Concerning safety, the greatest differences between the H5N1 vaccine and control groups in this study were seen when the adult dose was administered. Despite the greater local and general reactogenicity with the adult dose uptake of the second dose was very high and only four subjects did not complete both doses in the entire study. In addition the data do not indicate that higher reactogenicity was associated with SAEs. |

The results were observed when the two doses were given either 21 days apart or 6 months apart. A single dose of A/Vietnam AS03 adjuvanted vaccine followed by a dose of A/Vietnam or A/Indonesia AS03 adjuvanted vaccine at Month 6 elicited haemagglutinin inhibition responses to homologous and heterologous booster strains that met and exceeded the CHMP criteria at Month 6 + 7 days post-boost with further increments at Month 6 + 21 days. Therefore based on immunogenicity and safety data, the product information was updated to reflect that two doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine given 6 months apart give comparable immune responses after the second dose to two doses given 21 days apart. The PL was updated further to a test performed to increase |
