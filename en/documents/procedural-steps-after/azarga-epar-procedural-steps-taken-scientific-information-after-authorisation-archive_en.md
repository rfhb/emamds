The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 27/06/2013 | 26/08/2013 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | To reflect a review based on pooled data from seven clinical trials, post-marketing experience and a literature review carried out by the MAH, which, whilst not identifying new safety concerns, led to a general update of the safety information of Azarga. In summary, the text on possible occurrence of allergic reactions for both active ingredients of Azarga, was strengthened, since systemic absorption of these might occur. For the same reason, the text in relation to class effects for medicines called sulphonamides (one ingredient of Azarga is a sulphonamide) to inform on the risk of metabolic acidosis in patients at risk of renal impairment, and for beta-blockers (one other ingredient of Azarga is a beta blocker) to inform on the risk of muscle weakness was improved. The CHMP considered the proposals for the SmPC and the PL to be acceptable and overall improve the text of the prescribing and patient information. |
