Alipogene tiparvovec is produced using insect cells and recombinant baculovirus technology. 2.2 Qualitative and quantitative composition Each vial of alipogene tiparvovec contains 1 extractable ml of solution, containing 3 x 10 12  genome copies (gc). Each patient-specific pack contains a sufficient amount of vials to dose each patient with 1 x 10 12 LPL S447X  gc/kg bodyweight. Excipient with known effect: This medicinal product contains 47.5 mg sodium per administration at 27 injection sites to 105.6 mg sodium per administration at 60 injection sites. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection. Clear, to slightly opalescent, colourless solution. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

Glybera is indicated for adult patients diagnosed with familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) and suffering from severe or multiple pancreatitis attacks despite dietary fat restrictions . The diagnosis of LPLD has to be confirmed by genetic testing. The indication is restricted to patients with detectable levels of LPL protein (see section 4.4).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Glybera should only be used when the diagnosis of LPLD has been confirmed by an adequate genetic test (see section 5.1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Glybera therapy must be prescribed by and administered under the supervision of a physician with expertise in treating LPLD patients and in gene therapy administration, in full consultation with the patient. During administration of Glybera appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration.

## Posology

The maximum total dose of Glybera for administration is 1 x 10 12  gc/kg body weight.

Glybera is authorised for single treatment only. No data on re-administration of Glybera are available, therefore Glybera should not be re-administered.

From three days prior to and for 12 weeks following Glybera administration an immunosuppressive regimen should be administered: ciclosporin (3 mg/kg/day) and mycophenolate mofetil (2 x 1 g/day) is recommended.

Glybera is administered as a one-time series of intramuscular injections in the legs. The dose per injection site is 1.5 x 10 12 gc, or 0.5 ml of solution for injection. For each injection site, one syringe of 1 ml with clear volume marks of 0.5 ml must be used. Volumes per injection site must not exceed 0.5 ml. Syringes must not be used more than once. The treatment should be monitored by measuring neutralising antibodies and T-Cell response against AAV1 and LPL S447X  and T-Cell response at baseline as well as 6 and 12 months after treatment. To calculate the number of vials, the patient's weight is determined to the nearest whole kg. The patient's weight should be divided by 3, and rounded up to the next higher whole number. This is the number of vials that must be dispensed. To calculate the number of injection sites and the number of syringes, the patient's weight is determined to the nearest whole kg. The patient's weight should be divided by 3, then without rounding up this number multiplied by 2 and rounded up to the next higher whole number. This is the number of injection sites and the total number of syringes (each filled with 0.5ml) required for the patient's treatment. Examples of typical dose schedules based on the body weight of patients are shown in the table below: Medicinal product no longer authorised

In addition, half an hour prior to Glybera injection an intravenous bolus of 1mg/kg of methylprednisolone should be administered (see section 4.4).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Glybera in children and adolescents below 18 years has not been established. No data are available.

## Elderly

There is limited experience in the use of Glybera in elderly subjects. No dose adjustment of Glybera is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

necessary in the elderly population. Dose of immunosuppressant may need to be adjusted.

## Renal impairment or hepatic impairment

There is limited experience in the use of Glybera in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment of Glybera is required.

## Method of administration

Upon intramuscular injection, the patient will receive multiple injections of 0.5 ml (one injection per syringe), distributed over the muscles of both upper and lower legs, under aseptic conditions such as iodine.

Spinal or regional anaesthesia is advised prior to intramuscular administration, due to the number of injections required. In case of contraindication for such procedure deep sedation is advised instead. Glybera should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly (see section 4.4). To ensure intramuscular injection, ultrasound or electrophysiological guidance of injections is advised. The instructions for use, handling and disposal are given in section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications · Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients of Glybera listed in section 6.1. · Immunodeficiency · Patients with increased bleeding risk (such as thrombocytopenia) and muscle disease (such as myositis), must not be treated in view of the large number of intramuscular injections required. · Anti-platelet or other anti-coagulant medicinal products must not be used concomitantly with Glybera at the time of injection and for at least one week before or one day after the injection. · Oral contraceptive use (see section 4.6). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use This medicinal product contains genetically-modified organisms. Local biosafety guidelines applicable for such products should be followed (see section 6.6). Glybera should only be administered to patients with an LPL protein mass of at least 5% of normal. LPL protein mass should be determined by ELISA or equivalent methods. LPL protein mass should be measured in a blood sample from the patient against a control sample from healthy volunteers. Diet Medicinal product no longer authorised

Treatment with Glybera does not eliminate attacks of acute pancreatitis. Patients are advised to continue to follow a low-fat diet and refrain from alcohol consumption.

## Diabetic patients

Limited data are available in diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus is common in patients who have the most severe symptoms of LPLD. The opportunity to treat diabetic patients suffering from LPLD should be carefully considered by the physician.

## Immunosuppressants (see section 5.2)

Immediately prior to initiation of the immunosuppressant regimen and prior to Glybera injection the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patient must be checked for symptoms of active infectious disease of any nature, and in case of such infection the start of treatment must be postponed until after the patient has recovered.

## Thromboembolic events

LPLD involves a state of hyperviscosity/hypercoagulability. Spinal anaesthesia and multiple intramuscular injections may further increase the risk of (thrombo) embolic events at and shortly after administration of Glybera. Assessment of each individual subject's risk profile prior to Glybera administration is advised. Follow applicable local or international guidelines for prophylaxis (See also section 4.5).

## Cell and tissue donation

Women of childbearing potential must be advised to use reliable barrier contraception methods in accordance with the guidelines for immunosuppressants for a minimum of 12 months from the start of therapy (9 months following cessation of immunosuppressants). Therefore, use of barrier contraception methods for at least 12 months following Glybera administration is recommended.

Treated patients should not donate blood, organs, tissues and cells for transplantation. This information is also provided in the Glybera Patient's Alert Card. Serum creatine kinase Recipients of Glybera may display a rise in serum creatine kinase activity that becomes evident about 2 weeks after administration, peaks at around 8 weeks and then returns to baseline by week 26. One patient developed myoglobinuria in association with raised serum creatine kinase activity. Muscle biopsies obtained up to 52 weeks after administration of Glybera show an infiltrate of lymphocytes and macrophages. The long term consequences of this cellular infiltration are not known. Sodium content and potassium content This medicinal product contains 47.5 mg sodium per administration at 27 injection sites to 105.6 mg sodium per administration at 60 injection sites. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. The product contains less than 1 mmol (39 mg) potassium per administration of 27-60 injection sites ; i.e. essentially potassium-free. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies other than preclinical and clinical studies with mycophenolate mofetil and ciclosporin have been performed. Anti-platelet or other anti-coagulant medicinal products must not be used concomitantly with Glybera at the time of injection. Correction of bleeding parameters should be instituted prior to Glybera administration. Anti-platelet or other anti-coagulant medicinal products must not be taken for at least one week before the leg injections or one day after the injection (see section 4.3). Oral contraceptive use is contraindicated in LPLD patients (see section 4.3) as this may exacerbate the underlying disease. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Contraception in males and females Medicinal product no longer authorised

Oral contraceptive use is contraindicated in LPLD patients (see section 4.3) as this may exacerbate the underlying disease.

Male patients, including vasectomised males, are advised to practise barrier contraception methods for at least 12 months following Glybera administration.

## Pregnancy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Very limited data on pregnancies exposed to Glybera is available. Animal studies do not indicate any harmful effects on pregnancy or embryonal/foetal development from Glybera (see section 5.3). Glybera should not be administered to pregnant women unless the possible benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risk to the foetus.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether Glybera is excreted in human milk. Glybera should not be administered to women who are breast-feeding as long as breastfeeding is ongoing.

## Fertility

No clinical data on the effect of Glybera on fertility are available. Effects on male and female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies.

4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Glybera has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines¸ dizziness was commonly observed after Glybera administration (see section 4.8). Patients experiencing dizziness are advised to not drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The most commonly reported adverse reaction is pain in extremity occurring in approximately one third of patients.  One patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism 7 weeks after therapy. Given the small patient population and size of the cohorts, captured adverse reactions and serious adverse reactions do not provide a complete perspective on the nature and frequency of these events. Tabulated list of adverse reactions Adverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency. Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Immunogenicity

An immune response was seen despite the use of immunosuppressants.

<!-- image -->

In clinical trials with Glybera, antibodies against the adeno-associated virus (AAV) protein shell were present prior to treatment, in 18 out of 27 subjects; anti-AAV antibodies appeared or increased after Glybera administration, in all of the subjects. The clinical relevance of the antibody response is unknown (see section 4.2 on re-administration). No neutralising assay was used. T-cell responses against AAV were detected in approximately half of the subjects post therapy only. No T-cell response to LPL was detected in any subject. With the exception of a case of fever (39.9 °C) in study CT-AMT-011-01 which reversed within a day, no Glybera or immunosuppression related serious adverse events occurred. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose Pre-clinical studies with doses ten times the recommended dose (1 x 10 13 gc/kg) did not lead to any general systemic untoward signs or symptoms. Symptomatic and supportive treatment, as deemed necessary by the treating physician, is advised in case of overdose. In the event two doses are administered by mistake to the identical injection site this might lead to more local reaction such as bruising or sensitivity. Local pain or sensitivity may be managed by symptomatic treatment such as administration of local or systemic pain relievers. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Lipid modifying agents, other lipid modifying agents, ATC code: C10AX10. Mechanism of action Medicinal product no longer authorised

Glybera contains the human LPL gene variant LPL  S447X  in an adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) vector intended to target the muscle. Glybera is injected as a one-time series into the muscle of the lower extremities where it is taken up by myocytes. The elements of the vector were chosen such that expression of the LPL  S447X  gene is promoted, by co-opting the expression machinery of the cell and the myocytes produce the protein product of the transgene LPL  S447X  without the vector being able to reproduce itself.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Lipoprotein lipase is a key 'first step' enzyme in the metabolism of lipoproteins following fat intake with diet. In clinical studies a transient reduction in triglycerides for up to 12 weeks in individual

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients could be observed. Furthermore, Glybera allows expression of the LPL protein in injected muscle which is reflected by the improvement of postprandial chylomicron (CM) metabolism observed in a small subset of patients.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The clinical efficacy and safety of Glybera has been evaluated in three interventional clinical studies with AAV1-LPL S447X  in LPLD subjects.

Two of these clinical trials were preceded by prospective observational studies to assess fasting triglycerides (TG) level and symptoms and signs of LPLD in subjects maintained on a low fat diet. Strict compliance with dietary fat restriction was difficult.

All interventional studies continued into long term follow up studies. The patients in CT-AMT-010-01 have been followed for up to 5 years (n=6) post therapy administration, those in CT-AMT-011-01 for up to 5 years (n=13), and those in CT-AMT-011-02 for up to 1 year (n=3).

Standard genetic analysis (sequencing) was used in the clinical studies of Glybera.  An appropriate CE marked test or full gene sequencing should be used to confirm the diagnosis. Clinical trial CT-AMT-010-01 AAV1-LPL S447X  was administered to 8 LPLD patients in a 12-week, open label dose escalating study (1 x 10 11 gc to 3 x 10 11  gc per kg body weight i.m.). No drug-related serious adverse events occurred and no dose-limiting toxicity was observed. In half of the subjects a T-cell response to the vector was seen. Compared to pre-administration, a transient and variable reduction in median triglyceride levels was recorded for all patients. Clinical trial CT-AMT-011-01 The aim of this open label, dose escalating study was to assess the safety profile and reduction of fasting plasma triglyceride (TG) levels after 12 weeks post Glybera administration in 14 LPLD patients. All patients were controlled on low fat diets in the 12-week main study period. The first 2 patients enrolled received a dose of 3 x 10 11 gc/kg, the next 4 patients received a dose of 3 x 10 11 gc/kg with immunosuppressant regiment (oral ciclosporin and oral mycophenolate mofetil from the day after Glybera administration until Week 12) and the final 8 patients received a dose of 1 x 10 12 gc/kg with immunosuppressant regiment. T-cell responses were seen in roughly half of the patients without clinical sequelae. From the triglyceride data the 1 x 10 12  gc/kg dose appears the most optimal. Clinical trial CT-AMT-011-02 This is an open-label study of alipogene tiparvovec at a fixed dose of 1x10 12  gc/ kg body weight administered by a single series of intramuscular injections. Five eligible subjects were included in the study with all subjects receiving alipogene tiparvovec. Subjects also received a daily oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day cyclosporine and 2 g/day of mycophenolate mofetil starting three days before administration of alipogene tiparvovec through week 12. A single intravenous bolus of methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg bodyweight) was given 30 minutes prior to alipogene tiparvovec administration. One patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism 7 weeks after therapy. A transient reduction of triglycerides for up to 12 weeks in some individual patients has been observed. After this time, triglyceride levels reverted back to baseline. A demonstrable improvement of postprandial CM metabolism was shown in 5/5 patients up to week 14 and in 3/3 patients who were followed up to 52 weeks. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Muscle biopsies taken half a year post administration demonstrated long-term expression of the LPL gene and the presence of biologically active LPL protein.

Clinical trial CT-AMT-11-03 Study CT-AMT-011-03 was a combined retrospective and prospective study of subjects who had taken part in studies CT-AMT-10-01, CT-AMT-11-01, CT-AMT-11-02. In a follow-up period of up to 3 years after treatment, there was a decreasing trend in the incidence and severity of pancreatitis in the 12 patients who had multiple attacks during their life time.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical trial CT-AMT-11-05

Further follow-up of patients who took part in study CT-AMT-11-03 (to a median of 5.8 years after exposure to Glybera) has shown a reduction in hospital stay of 1 day per patient per year when compared to the same length of time prior to exposure.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Glybera in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

This medicinal product has been authorised under 'exceptional circumstances'. This means that due to the rarity of the disease it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product. The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Glybera is expected to be degraded by endogenous protein and DNA catabolic pathways. Non-clinical biodistribution Following intramuscular administration of Glybera to mice, vector DNA was transiently detected in the circulation. Eight days after administration, high levels of vector DNA sequence were detected in injected muscle and the draining lymph nodes. Except for the site of injection, the highest vector DNA copy numbers were found in the liver and blood. The lowest number of copies was found in the brain, lung, heart and non-injected groups of muscle. In gonads and reproductive organs, vector DNA copies were found at low levels. After time, residual vector DNA levels remained high in the injected muscle and inguinal lymph nodes while decreasing steadily in the other organs. The levels of Glybera vector DNA found in gonads were measurable but lower than in other non-target organs. Immunosuppressant co-treatment did not influence the biodistribution pattern neither at low dose nor at high dose in mice. The biodistribution pattern was very similar in the other tested species (cats and rabbits). Clinical pharmacokinetics and shedding Shedding was assessed in the clinical studies by collecting saliva, urine and semen. In CT-AMT-01102 faeces was also collected. After administration of Glybera to the participants, the highest vector DNA concentrations were detected in the serum, with clearance by one to two logs per week. In saliva vector DNA was still detectable up to 12 weeks; in urine up to 10 weeks and in semen up to 26 weeks. All but two patients received immunosuppressant for 12 weeks. There is the theoretical risk that the co-administration of the immunosuppressant regime leads to longer persistence of virus DNA in serum and as well to longer shedding in saliva, urine and semen. High levels of vector DNA were observed up to 12 months after dosing in the target tissue for Glybera, injected leg muscle, but not in non-injected muscle. Pharmacokinetics in special populations e.g. elderly/renal impairment etc. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Glybera is injected directly into the target organ, skeletal muscle. Liver and kidney function, cytochrome P450 polymorphisms and ageing are not expected to influence the clinical efficacy or safety of Glybera.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Upon injection, Glybera was well tolerated in all animal studies performed with no notable clinical signs. In mice local cellular infiltrates and signs of degeneration and regeneration without necrosis, were seen at the clinical dose in the injected muscle upon histopathological examination. These effects were dose-dependent but showed regression with time. As expected, all animals developed antibodies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to the AAV protein shell.

Upon treatment four weeks prior to mating, no maternal, foetal and developmental toxicity was seen in mice. No vector DNA could be detected in the foetuses after treatment of either the females or the males prior to mating.

Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. However in toxicity studies, no increase in tumour was identified. Although there is no fully adequate animal model to address the tumourigenic potential, the available toxicological data do not suggest any concern for tumourigenicity

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Instructions for preparation and handling and disposal

Refer to local biosafety guidelines applicable for handling and disposal of medicinal products containing genetically-modified organisms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Work surfaces and material which have potentially been in contact with Glybera must be decontaminated with appropriate virucidal disinfectants with activity for non-enveloped viruses (such as hypochlorite and chlorine releasers) for at least 10 minutes.

## Preparation of Glybera for administration

After the amount of Glybera to be administered has been calculated (see section 4.2) remove the correct number of single use vials from the freezer to thaw at room temperature (15 o C to 25 o C), approximately 30-45 minutes in advance of syringe filling.

After thawing, each vial should be gently inverted twice to ensure even mixing. Vials should be visually inspected for particulate matter and colour. The clear to slightly opalescent and colourless solution must be free of visible particles. Only clear and colourless solutions without visible particles should be used. If a vial is showing damage, syringes for the injection should not be prepared and the injection procedure should be postponed and rescheduled. The Marketing Authorisation Holder should be informed immediately.

Glybera is delivered in a patient-specific pack and will therefore contain the precise amount of vials per patient, calculated according to the patient's weight. The calculated amount of syringes should be filled from the thawed vials, and they should be labelled and placed in a container protected from light suitable for transportation to the room where the patient will undergo the intramuscular injections. To avoid any injection of particles from the stopper due to two withdrawals, one needle for the withdrawal from the vial (to be left inside the stopper) and a separate needle for each syringe must be used. 7.

What Glybera is and what it is used for Glybera contains alipogene tiparvovec, a gene therapy product that works by delivering a gene into the body to correct a genetic deficiency. It belongs to a group of medicines called lipid modifying agents. Glybera is used to treat a specific inherited condition known as 'lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD)'. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a naturally occurring substance in the body (known as an enzyme) that controls the level of certain fats in the blood. In lipoprotein lipase deficiency, this enzyme is missing due to a genetic defect. People who are affected by this condition have a build up of very high fat levels in their blood (hyperchylomicronemia). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Glybera

## Do not receive Glybera

- -if you are allergic to alipogene tiparvovec or to any of the other ingredients of Glybera (listed in section 6 'Further information').
- -if your immune system does not work properly
- -if you have an increased bleeding risk and or muscle disease

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -if you are taking oral contraceptives

If any of the above applies to you, or if you are unsure of any of the above, please talk to your doctor before you receive Glybera.

## Warnings and precautions

- It is important that you fully understand the benefits and risks associated with the treatment by discussing with your doctor
- It is important that you tell your doctor if you have an active infection of any sort before you take the medicines you will be given to reduce your body's defences (immunosuppressants) and before you receive Glybera. See also section 3, 'How Glybera is used'.

· Glybera is a gene therapy product. It contains genetically modified organisms. After treatment with Glybera do not donate blood, organs, tissues and cells for transplantation to avoid spreading cells that contain your medicine. · Tell your doctor if you are suffering from diabetes. · You should continue to follow a fat-restricted, alcohol-free diet. People diagnosed with lipoprotein lipase deficiency are advised to be careful with their diet, both before and after Glybera therapy; they should restrict their intake of 'normal diet fats' and should not drink alcohol. Additional monitoring tests Small amounts of blood will be drawn before treatment, 6 months and 12 months after treatment to measure how your body's immune (defence) system is responding to the treatment with Glybera. Children and adolescents Glybera is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Other medicines and Glybera Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking the following before you are given Glybera: · A medicine impacting blood coagulation e.g. acetylsalicylic acid (e.g.aspirin), a substance present in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever, as well as medicines used to prevent blood clotting eg anticoagulants such as warfarin, heparin. These medicines should not be taken for at least one week before the leg injections or one day after you have had the injections. Taking these medicines before receiving or at the same time as receiving Glybera, may cause unnecessary bruising or bleeding from the injection sites. · Oral contraceptives (see section 2 'Do not receive Glybera') Glybera with alcohol People diagnosed with lipoprotein lipase deficiency are advised to be careful with their diet, both before and after Glybera therapy; they should not drink alcohol. Pregnancy and breast-feeding If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you might be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using any medicine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Glybera is not usually recommended for use during pregnancy. There is very limited information about the safety of Glybera in pregnant women.

- It is important to tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to get pregnant. Your doctor will weigh up the benefits to you against the risks to your baby of taking Glybera whilst you are pregnant.
- Use appropriate barrier contraception such as condoms to avoid becoming pregnant during treatment and for at least 12 months after treatment. Do not take oral contraceptives as they have the potential to worsen your disease; Use condoms so that as little Glybera as possible may be passed to/from your partner.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- If you do become pregnant during treatment with Glybera, tell your doctor.

It is not known whether Glybera passes into breast milk. Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with Glybera.

Male patients must use condoms for at least 12 months after injection with Glybera.  Using condoms will reduce the amount of Glybera that may be left in the woman's body.

## Driving and using machines

Dizziness was commonly observed after Glybera administration. You should consider this when driving or using machines. Talk to your doctor about this.

It is important that at the time of first Glybera administration, your body's immune (defence) system is not activated. To avoid this, your doctor will also prescribe treatment that will suppress the immune system (known as immunosuppressants), starting 3 days before the day of injection with Glybera and for 12 weeks after. Examples of these immunosuppressants are ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil. In addition methylprednisolone might be administered half an hour prior to the Glybera administration. It is important that you take these medicines according to the instructions given. Do not stop taking these without talking to your doctor.

Important information about some of the ingredients of Glybera Glybera contains sodium and potassium. The amount of sodium and potassium that you may receive depends on the number of injections that you need; your doctor will work this out depending on your weight. You need to take this into consideration if you are on a controlled sodium diet. This medicine contains potassium, less than 1 mmol (39 mg) per administration at 27 injection sites to 60 injection sites, i.e. essentially 'potassium-free'. 3. How Glybera is given to you Glybera therapy will be overseen by a doctor who is specialised in the treatment of patients affected by your condition and will be administered to you by an appropriately qualified and trained doctor or nurse. Glybera will be given to you in a single therapy administration session in a hospital. At this time a series of injections (27 to 60 injections) into the muscles of both upper and lower legs will be given. The dose you will need is dependent on your weight and is calculated by your doctor. Due to the large number of individual injections that you will receive during the Glybera therapy session, you will be given either a regional anaesthetic into the spine (which will numb your legs only), or a more localised anaesthetic before you are given the Glybera injections. Your doctor will talk to you about the anaesthetic and how it will be given. After you have been given Glybera, you may notice that your legs have a yellow colour; this might occur in case iodine was used to clean (sterilise) your legs before you received the medicine. This will fade after a short time. You will need to stay in hospital for a few hours or overnight to make sure that you have not had any side effects from the medicine or the anaesthetic. Glybera should be administered to you in one treatment session only. Re-administration of Glybera after this first treatment session is not recommended. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Please ask your doctor for more information about the exact immunosuppressant medicine you will be taking.

## If you receive more Glybera than you should

As this medicine is given to you by a doctor, it is unlikely that you will be given too much. If you

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

receive two doses in one injection site by mistake this might lead to more local reaction such as bruising or sensitivity. Your doctor will treat this appropriately.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, Glybera can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

Very common (may affects more than 1 in 10 people)

- pain in leg(s) (pain in extremity)

· raised body temperature · tiredness (fatigue) · headache · bruises in the upper and lower leg muscle due to the injections. They only last a short time. · Increased blood level of the muscle enzyme creatine kinase Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) · abdominal pain · nausea · constipation · chills · fever · muscle pain and joint aches, pains and stiffness · difficulty breathing, chest pain on breathing in and palpitations which may be caused by blockage of the main blood vessel  of the lung · burning sensation · high blood pressure · sensation like that of insects crawling on (or under) the skin · water retention · decreased appetite · dizziness · skin rash · muscle spasms · light headedness · hair growth · injection site discomfort, swelling, rash and pain Side effects from your immunosuppressants In addition to being given Glybera, you will be given other medicines called immunosuppressants (see section 3 'How Glybera is used'). It is important that you ask your doctor about the side effects of these other medicines. Your doctor should give you a copy of the patient information leaflet (like this one) for the immunosuppressants you will need to take. Do not stop taking these without talking to your doctor.

## The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

Glybera therapy must be prescribed by and administered under the supervision of a physician with expertise in treating LPLD patients and in gene therapy administration, in full consultation with the patient. During administration of Glybera appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration. Posology The maximum total dose of Glybera for administration is 1 x 10 12  gc/kg body weight. Glybera is authorised for single treatment only. No data on re-administration of Glybera are available, therefore Glybera should not be re-administered. Glybera is administered as a one-time series of intramuscular injections in the legs. The dose per injection site is 1.5 x 10 12 gc, or 0.5 ml of solution for injection.  For each injection site, one syringe of 1 ml with clear volume marks of 0.5 ml must be used. Volumes per injection site must not exceed 0.5ml. Syringes must not be used more than once. The treatment should be monitored by measuring neutralising antibodies and T-Cell response against AAV1 and LPL S447X  at baseline as well as 6 and 12 months after treatment. Glybera should only be used when the diagnosis of LPLD has been confirmed by an adequate genetic test. To calculate the number of vials, the patient's weight is determined to the nearest whole kg. The patient's weight should be divided by 3, and rounded up to the next higher whole number. This is the number of vials that must be dispensed. To calculate the number of injection sites and the number of syringes, the patient's weight is determined to the nearest whole kg. The patient's weight should be divided by 3, then without rounding up this number multiplied by 2 and rounded up to the next higher whole number. This is the number of injection sites and the total number of syringes (each filled with 0.5ml) needed to administer a volume of 0.5ml per injection site for the patient's treatment. Examples of typical dose schedules based on the body weight of patients are shown in the table below: Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

From three days prior to and for 12 weeks following Glybera administration an immunosuppressive regimen should be administered: ciclosporin (3 mg/kg/day) and mycophenolate mofetil (2 x 1 g/day) is recommended.

In addition, half an hour prior to Glybera injection an intravenous bolus of 1mg/kg of methylprednisolone should be administered.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Glybera in children and adolescents below 18 years has not been established. No data are available.

<!-- image -->

After thawing, each vial should be gently inverted twice to ensure even mixing. Vials should be visually inspected for particulate matter and colour. The clear to slightly opalescent and colourless solution must be free of visible particles. Only clear and colourless solutions without visible particles should be used. If a vial is showing damage, syringes for the injection should not be prepared and the injection procedure should be postponed and rescheduled. The Marketing Authorisation Holder should be informed immediately.

Elderly There is limited experience in the use of Glybera in elderly subjects. No dose adjustment of Glybera is necessary in the elderly population. Dose of immunosuppressant may need to be adjusted. Renal impairment or hepatic impairment There is limited experience in the use of Glybera in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment of Glybera is required. Method of administration Upon intramuscular injection, the patient will receive multiple injections of 0.5 ml (one injection per syringe), distributed over the muscles of both upper and lower legs, under aseptic conditions such as iodine. Spinal or regional anaesthesia is advised prior to intramuscular administration, due to the number of injections required. In case of contraindication for such procedure deep sedation is advised instead. Glybera should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. To ensure intramuscular injection, ultrasound or electrophysiologic guidance of injections is advised. Instructions for use, handling and disposal Refer to local biosafety guidelines applicable for handling and disposal of medicinal products containing genetically-modified organisms. Work surfaces and material which have potentially been in contact with Glybera must be decontaminated with appropriate virucidal disinfectants with activity for non-enveloped viruses (such as hypochlorite and chlorine releasers) for at least 10 minutes. Preparation of Glybera for administration After the amount of Glybera to be administered has been calculated (see section posology)  remove the correct number of single use vials from the freezer to thaw at room temperature (15 o C to 25 o C), approximately 30-45 minutes in advance of syringe filling. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Glybera is delivered in a patient-specific pack and will therefore contain the precise amount of vials per patient, calculated according to the patient's weight.

The calculated amount of syringes should be filled from the thawed vials, and they should be labelled and placed in a container protected from light suitable for transportation to the room where the patient

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

will undergo the intramuscular injections.

To avoid any injection of particles from the stopper due to two withdrawals, one needle for the withdrawal from the vial (to be left inside the stopper) and a separate needle for each syringe must be used.
