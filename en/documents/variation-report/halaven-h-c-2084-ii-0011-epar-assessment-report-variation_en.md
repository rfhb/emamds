## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Halaven (eribulin mesilate) is a non-taxane, microtubule dynamics inhibitor belonging to the halichondrin class of antineoplastic agents. It is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have progressed after at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced disease, and administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 21 days.

The scope of this type II variation is to extend the indication from the current 3rd line treatment to 2nd line treatment of advanced/metastatic breast cancer.

The proposed indication is based on a subset of the population of the pivotal Study 301, which was a 1:1 randomised open-label study comparing the efficacy and safety of eribulin and capecitabine monotherapy in the first - third line setting. Fifty percent of the eribulin-treated patients in Study 301 were treated in the 2nd line, which represents the new indication sought. 15% of patients were HER2 positive; concomitant HER2-targeted therapy was not allowed during study.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The studies included in the current application were specifically selected for presentation because they provide plausible mechanistic explanations for the clinical finding that eribulin has greater effects on overall survival compared to progression-free survival endpoints in metastatic breast cancer. These nonclinical pharmacology studies support the concept that eribulin has additional, previously unrecognized antitumor mechanisms of action that go beyond its previously established direct cytotoxic effects on tumour cells due to its known antimitotic activities.

In vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in order to examine effects of eribulin mesilate on: a) tumour vascular function and vascular remodelling, b) migration and invasiveness capacity of cancer cells, and c) epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related pathways in both cancer cells and their host tissue counterparts within the tumour microenvironment. The results of these studies are summarised in the following table:

The MAH propose that these new data point to an interesting new biology associated with eribulin mesilate treatment that goes well beyond aspects that might be expected simply on the basis of classical antimitotic, antiproliferative effects against cancer cells. The studies point to significant effects of eribulin mesilate on tumour cell biology and tumour host interactions that could provide a plausible and scientific basis for an increase in overall survival despite continued presence, or even growth, of tumours and metastasis. Thus, these findings suggest that eribulin mesilate, in addition to having primary anticancer effects associated with classical cytotoxicity, also renders residual tumours less aggressive and less likely to metastasize. These results support the concept that after eribulin mesilate treatment, residual tumours become less life-threatening and 'easier to live with' in contrast to the effects of fluoropyrimidines (e.g., capecitabine), and provide a reasonable mechanistic explanation for the trend towards increased overall survival in eribulin-mesilate-treated subjects with metastatic breast cancer when compared to capecitabine treatment, even in the absence of an increase in progression-free survival.

## 2.2.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

New environmental risk assessment has been performed in support of the new proposed indication. The Applicant has experimentally established log Kow to 2.25. This is below the threshold of 4.5 and an assessment for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) is not required.

## 2.2.3. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An attempt is made to address the pharmacology of eribulin in order to get further understanding on the clinical picture. The ideal situation is to generate such data in advance and use these data to define the most optimal clinical use of the product. It may however also be possible to use nonclinical data to support clinical data in cases like this one, where the clinical picture is unclear and the outcome of different endpoints are not fully consistent. For this purpose it is however of importance to generate data which may help in translating in vitro and/or animal data into the clinical situation. Such translation could include relevant pharmacodynamic biomarkers identified in the animal studies and then studied in clinical material. Such data are considered essential given the fact that animal xenograft studies are known not to share all aspects of the clinical therapeutic situation.

The presented data are interesting and indicate a plausible biological mechanism for some part of the difference between overall survival and progression-free survival observed in Study 301 which could be of clinical importance. However, the interpretation of data is complicated by the fact that in several of the situations where eribulin treatment has been compared to other agents, there is a pronounced difference in anti-tumour activity with eribulin being clearly superior. This means that the quantitative and/or qualitative differences seen on the studied biological markers could be just a consequence of the difference in anti-tumour activity.

In the ERA submitted, the Applicant has experimentally established log Kow to 2.25. This is below the threshold of 4.5 and an assessment for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) is not required.

## 2.2.4. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

While the non-clinical data are interesting, they do not allow extrapolation to the clinical situation. However, they indicate a plausible biological mechanism for some part of the difference between overall survival and progression-free survival observed in Study 301.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Clinical pharmacology

Included in the current submission is an updated Population Pharmacokinetic (PPK) Analysis, based on pharmacokinetic (PK) data from previous studies as well as from the new Phase 3 Study 301 and a new PK/PD analysis of the relationship between eribulin plasma exposure and different efficacy or safety measures, based on data from Study 301 only. The MAH does not suggest any changes to the SmPC or other claims based on this analysis. In addition, in response to the CHMP request, the MAH performed a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling (PBPK) and simulation exercise to predict the effect of eribulin on a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2.1. Population pharmacokinetic model

A PPK analysis was previously conducted based on data from seven Phase 1 studies (E7389-A001-101, E7389-A001-102, E7389-E044-103, E7389-J081-105, E7389-E044-108, E7389-E044-109, and E7389E044-110) and one Phase 2 study (E7389-G000-211). This analysis was discussed during the original MAA for Halaven. The analysis has now been updated to include also data from the new Phase 3 study (E7389-G000-301).

The objectives of the population PK analysis were to describe the PK profile of eribulin in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes and to identify covariates that explain between subject variability in eribulin PK.

Based on the previously conducted PPK analysis, a three-compartment PK model with linear elimination from the central compartment for log-transformed eribulin plasma concentration data was the starting point for the updated model.

The association between subject covariates and PK parameters was evaluated in a stepwise fashion:

- -Individual Bayes posthoc pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were generated from the base model. The difference of individual estimates from the corresponding population value (η) was plotted versus the covariates to identify potential relationships.
- -η-shrinkage was calculated and reported for IIV parameters estimated by the model [20]. A parameter with shrinkage greater than 30% was excluded from the covariate analysis.
- -Covariates identified as being important were first assessed in the basic model by univariate addition and ranked in descending order according to the change in objective function value (OFV). All significant variables were then tested in a full model, and a subsequent backwards deletion was carried out at the 0.1% significance level where the relative influence of each covariate on the model was re-evaluated by deleting it from the full model on an individual basis.

## Base Model

The PK of eribulin was best described by a three compartment model with linear elimination from the central compartment and parameterized for CL, V1, Q2, V2, Q3 and V3. An allometric model for body size effects on all of the parameters was also implemented. The use of an allometric model with body weight was found to be superior to using body surface area (BSA) effect on each of the parameters.

The estimates of PK parameters for the base model were close to those estimated from the previous analysis. For clearance (CL) IIV was estimated to be 59.3%, and 38.1% for central volume of distribution (V1). Residual variability was described by a proportional error model and the CV% was estimated to be 24.1%. The parameter estimates, precision of the estimate and 95% confidence interval for the base PK model are presented in

## Co-variate model

In the univariate analysis, significant effects were seen for ALB, ALP, BILI and CLCR on CL, and these covariates were subsequently simultaneously added to the base PK model. Multivariate analysis with backward deletion resulted in a final PK model with significant effects of ALB, ALP and BILI on CL. Compared to the base PK model, the addition of the three significant covariates explained IIV on CL by 7.3 % and residual variability by 0.1 %.

The final population PK model for eribulin was a three compartment model with linear elimination from the central compartment parameterized for CL, V1, Q2, V2, Q3 and V3. IIV was estimated on all parameters except V2. A proportional error model was used for estimation of residual variability. The parameter estimates, precision of the estimate and 95% confidence interval for the final PK model are presented in

Eribulin CL was identified to increase with increasing albumin (ALB) levels and decline with increasing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin (BILI). Similar effects of ALB and BILI were observed in the previous population PK analysis. IIV in the model parameters was moderate ranging between 36.6% for V3 and 52.0% for CL. IIV was well estimated with good precision for most parameters (%RSE ≤25.7%), however for Q2 the estimate of IIV was less precise (36.0%), but improved from the base model. The residual variability in eribulin concentrations was low (CV 24.0%).

In order to evaluate the predictive performance of the final PK model for eribulin, simulations were performed. Using parameters from the final PK model, eribulin concentrations were simulated (n = 500) following 1.4 mg/m 2  dosing on Days 1, 8 and 15 (where applicable) on each 21-days treatment cycle. The population median BSA of 1.74 m 2  was used to determine the total dose. The mean and 5th and 95th percentiles (90% PI) of these simulated concentrations were calculated and plotted with observed eribulin concentration data for dosing on Days 1, 8 and 15 (as an example, Day 15 data is shown in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Figure 1 . More than 90% of the observed eribulin concentrations for dosing on Day 1, 8 and 15 are within the 90% prediction intervals. Hence, the MAH suggests the eribulin concentration time course has been reasonably well defined by the final PK model with good predictive performance. The final PK model was also evaluated using bootstrap method (1000 replicates). The confidence intervals were generally narrow and the median values of the distribution of bootstrapped parameter values were also consistent with the original parameter estimates, for both PK structural model and covariate parameters.

## 2.3.2.2. PK/PD Modelling

The MAH has performed a new PK/PD analysis of the relationship between eribulin plasma exposure and different efficacy or safety measures, based on data from Study 301 only. The MAH does not suggest any changes to the SmPC or other claims based on this analysis.

## 2.3.2.2.1. Methods

The new population PK/PD analysis was based on data from Study 301 alone, which included 9728 observations from 535 subjects.

The objectives of the population PK/PD analysis for efficacy were to

- -Describe the relationship between eribulin exposure and longitudinal tumour size measurements in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes
- -Identify covariates that affect eribulin exposure and longitudinal tumour size relationship

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -Develop a model that relates changes in tumour size to overall survival (OS) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes

The objectives of the population PK/PD analysis for safety were to

- -Describe the relationship between neutrophil count (ANC) and eribulin concentrations in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes
- -Investigate influence of patient characteristics on the development of neutropenia

In addition, exploratory PK/PD graphical analysis was performed to explore possible relationships between eribulin exposure and other measures of efficacy and safety.

## 2.3.2.2.2. Results

## Tumour Growth Inhibition

The tumour-growth inhibition model included tumour growth rate (per week); tumour size reduction rate due to eribulin (per exposure per week); a resistance function; observed tumour size at baseline; and eribulin exposure (individual eribulin AUC at the time of the assessment, calculated based on dose at time of assessment and individual clearance as predicted by the population PK model). The effect of the different covariates (demographic, disease-related, previous treatment etc) was investigated one by one in a stepwise fashion as described for the PPK analysis above.

Figure 2 shows change of tumour size from baseline vs eribulin exposure (AUC) at the time of tumour measurement for those subjects in whom PK samples were collected.

Figure 2: Change in Tumour Size from Baseline vs. Eribulin AUC at Time of Assessment

<!-- image -->

There appeared to be a slight trend towards increasing effect on tumour size with increasing eribulin exposure.

No significant co-variate could be identified.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Time-to-event analysis for Overall Survival

OS data was explored using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. The exposure parameter used was average eribulin AUC during the study and was calculated based on the average individual dose during the study and individual PPK predicted clearance. Kaplan-Meier plots for the effect of eribulin exposure on OS (assessed in subjects with PK exposure and survival data only) are presented in the figure below.

Figure  3.  Kaplan-Meier  Plots  for  OS  for  Eribulin  Arm  in  Subjects  with  Quartiles  of  Eribulin  Exposure (N=163, Eribulin Arm Subjects with PK Samples)

<!-- image -->

Cox regression analysis showed that eribulin exposure was a significant predictor of OS, however, Kaplan-Meier plots for OS by quartile of eribulin exposure showed no significant relationship.

Subsequent OS analysis for other possible predictors indicated that the probability of longer survival increases with a decrease in tumour size at week 6. Since decrease in tumour size appeared to be related to eribulin exposure (see above), the MAH suggests that this indicates an indirect eribulin exposure relationship with OS.

## Eribulin/Neutropenia

The relationship between eribulin concentrations and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was described using a semi-physiological PK/PD model for haematological toxicity. Eribulin concentration at the time of ANC assessment was predicted using the final population PK model. The effect of different covariates was assessed as described above. Due to the very long run time when using FOCE, the FO estimation method was used. The effect of different co-variates was investigated one by one in a stepwise fashion. The parameter estimates for the base neutropenia PK/PD model are presented in Table 5.

Parameters were estimated with good precision with %RSE less than 4%. Diagnostic plots for the base PK/PD model (indicated that the model adequately described the observed neutrophil levels following eribulin administration.

Multivariate analysis with backward deletion resulted in the following significant covariates:

- -NEUTM, ALP and bilirubin (BILI) on neutrophil maturation time (MTT)
- -Weight on the feed-back parameter for ANC (Gamma)
- -NEUTM and ALP on the eribulin effect on ANC (SLOPE)

The diagnostic plots for the final model indicated that the PK/PD model adequately described ANC data with no systematic bias in the predictions.

## 2.3.2.3. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modelling (PBPK)

Eribulin has previously been shown to inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro, but there is no data on the effect of eribulin on CYP3A4 substrates in vivo. To explore the potential for a clinical drug-drug interaction between eribulin and midazolam, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was built using a commercially available program. The parameters used to build the model were generated from both in vitro and in vivo experiments (bottom-up plus top-down). Some of the parameters were predicted by in silico methods. The model was used to simulate the effect of 1.4 mg/m2 eribulin mesilate disposition on exposure of co-administered midazolam, a model CYP3A4 substrate. In an additional simulation, a supra-therapeutic 3.0 mg/m2 dose of eribulin mesylate was used as a 'worst case' scenario. Simulations were conducted for 10 groups of 10 patients for a total of 100 patients for each eribulin dose (for details, refer to the Response Assessment Report).

The results of the simulation are presented in the table below.

AUCRatio: ratio between the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of midazolam in the absence and presence of eribulin.

AUC = area under the curve, CI = confdence interval, Max = maximum, Min = minimum

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The geometric mean AUC ratio for midazolam 2 mg PO with and without eribulin mesilate 1.4 mg/m2 was roughly 1.01. The geometric mean AUC ratio after the supra-therapeutic 3.0 mg/m2 eribulin mesilate dose was roughly 1.03.

Sensitivity analysis for the effect of different CYP3A4 Ki values of eribulin on the predicted AUC ratio was performed. The result of this analysis indicates that the interaction risk between midazolam and eribulin is negligible (less than 15% increase in midazolam exposure) even at Ki values 10-fold lower than the ones determined from the in vitro inhibition studies.

Thus, this simulation study indicates that eribulin is not a clinically relevant inhibitor of CYP3A4.

Sensitivity analyses have been performed with simulations using e.g. an increased dose (increased exposure) of eribulin, by changing Ki, and by decreasing Ki to reflect a higher liver concentration of eribulin (the latter analysis was made by the assessor). With a higher liver concentration, as indicated from data on the ratio between blood and liver concentration in the rat, the predicted AUC ratio for midazolam with/without eribulin was 1.27, i.e. slightly above the 1.25 limit normally used to exclude a significant interaction.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

With the current variation, the MAH has provided an updated PPK model and a PK/PD analysis, but proposes no new claims or SmPC changes based on these analyses, which is considered appropriate.

Inclusion of data from the new phase III study 301 in the PPK model did not add information or change previous conclusions on eribulin pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetic data from Japanese patients is limited, but the PPK analysis indicated no obvious difference in exposure between Japanese and other races that could explain the observed increased frequency of neutropenia in Japanese patients.

The PK/PD analyses indicated a relationship between eribulin exposure and tumour size as well as between eribulin exposure and neutrophil count. The identified co-variates for neutropenia were, however, not predictive of the risk of developing grade 3/4 neutropenia. Early identification of patients at high risk for grade 3/4 neutropenia using the PK/PD model and covariate values is thereby not possible. The PK/PD analyses have no major implications for approval of the new indication.

The recommendations for drug-drug interactions given in the SmPC are updated with this application. Eribulin is eliminated primarily via biliary excretion of unchanged compound into faeces, but the transporters involved have not yet been identified. The current SmPC contains relatively wide warnings that concomitant use of transporter inhibitors is not recommended. The MAH is in the process of identifying the transporters involved in eribulin elimination and performing a new in vitro induction study in accordance with the recommendations in the new CHMP Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions and relevant revisions through an on-going procedure EMEA/H/C/002084/II/0014 are under evaluation by the CHMP. These changes are important also in view of the expansion of the target population.

Eribulin showed inhibition of CYP3A4 in vitro, but whether it is a clinically relevant inhibitor of CYP3A4 is not known. The MAH therefore made simulations using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, in order to predict the effect of eribulin on the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate midazolam. The PBPK modelling approach is generally agreed, and overall the PBPK model predicts reasonably well eribulin pharmacokinetics. Relevant sensitivity analyses were performed. The results of the simulations indicated that although the risk for an effect of eribulin on a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate cannot be completely excluded, eribulin would be at most considered a mild CYP3A4 inhibitor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The PBPK model prediction is considered sufficient to be used as a basis to update the SmPC recommendation, and a clinical interaction study with midazolam will not be considered necessary. In the SmPC, a warning of caution at concomitant administration of drugs that are sensitive CYP3A4 substrates and that have a narrow therapeutic index has been included.

## 2.3.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The updated PPK model, with addition of data from Study 301, and a new PK/PD model including data from study does not alter the conclusion drawn on eribulin pharmacokinetics as compared with the previous PPK model, included in the original MAA. Results of the PK/PD modelling do not have implications for the benefit/risk assessment of the currently applied indication.

## Study participants

## Eligibility criteria

Breast cancer subjects who had received up to three prior chemotherapy regimens, and no more than two prior regimens for advanced and/or metastatic disease. The chemotherapy regimens must have included an anthracycline and a taxane, either in the (neo) adjuvant setting or for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Subjects enrolled into the study had documented evidence of disease progression during or after their most recent anticancer therapy.

In addition, subjects with known human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) overexpressing tumours could have been previously treated with trastuzumab in study centres where this treatment was available, and subjects with known oestrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive disease may have been treated with hormonal therapy, but not required per protocol. Subjects for whom HER2/neu status, oestrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR) status were unknown were also accepted into the study.

The difference in inclusion criteria compared with the already approved indication is the required number of prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced disease: 0 in this study compared with 2 in the registration Study 305.

The full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is given below.

*: Any single-agent therapy, and any combination of cytotoxic, hormonal, biological targeted agents, and/or humanized antibodies, scheduled to be administered as a preplanned treatment, given concomitantly, sequentially, or both, was considered one regimen. Planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy (to debulk the tumour prior to surgical intervention) plus postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was also considered one regimen. If, due to toxicity, the dosing of one or more of the components had to be reduced, or one or more of the components of the regimen was to be omitted, or one of the components was to be replaced with another similar drug, the changed version of the original regimen was not considered a new regimen. However, if a new component dissimilar to any of the original components was added to the regimen, the new combination was considered a new regimen.Prior hormonal therapy, biological therapy (e.g., trastuzumab, bevacizumab), or immunotherapy was not to be counted as one of the prior chemotherapy regimens allowed. However, hormonal therapy was discontinued 1 week before administration of study treatment, and biological therapy was discontinued 2 weeks before study treatment administration. If the treatment was interrupted for surgery or radiotherapy and then continued with an unchanged schedule and components, that treatment was considered as one regimen despite the interruption.

## Treatments

Subjects were randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either the test drug eribulin as an intravenous (IV) infusion of 1.4 mg/m 2  over 2-5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days; or the comparator drug capecitabine as an oral administration of 2500 mg/m 2 /day administered twice daily in two equal doses on Days 1 to 14 in each 21-day cycle.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects continued on treatment until unacceptable toxicity, progression of disease, or until in the opinion of the investigator, discontinuation of therapy was in the best interest of the subject or the subject withdrew consent. Subjects who demonstrated clinical benefit were allowed to continue treatment for as long as clinical benefit was sustained.

## Objectives

Primary: To compare the efficacy of eribulin versus capecitabine monotherapy in terms of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

Secondary: Quality of life (QoL), objective tumour response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival, tumour-related symptom assessments, safety, investigation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) relationships in a population PK study following administration of eribulin in approximately 200 subjects.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoints

## Overall Survival

Overall survival was measured from the date of randomization until date of death from any cause or the last date the subject was known to be alive.

## Progression-Free Survival

Progression-Free Survival was measured from the date of randomization to the date of recorded progression of the disease or the death of the subject from any cause, whichever occurred first.

Tumour response data utilized in the main analysis of PFS was obtained from an independent review of the imaging scans.

## Secondary endpoints

- Quality of Life measured using the EORTC questionnaire (QLQ-C30 BR23)
- Objective tumour response rate as measured using RECIST
- Duration of response
- One-, two-, and three-year survival
- Tumour related symptom assessments measured by pain intensity, using a VAS, and analgesic consumption.
- Safety parameters (adverse events, laboratory parameters, concomitant medication, and study drug exposure)
- Population PK in the eribulin group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Efficacy assessments

Baseline tumour assessments, consisting of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of areas of suspected disease, as well as photographs of skin lesions, were performed within 28 days prior to starting study treatment and every second cycle (starting at Cycle 2) for the first 12 cycles, then every third cycle (starting at Cycle 15) between Days 15 and 21, or sooner if there was evidence of disease progression. Tumour response was to be confirmed by a second examination (using CT/MRI scans and/or photography, and bone scans) performed no less than four weeks after first observation of response.

## Quality of Life assessments

Subjects assessment of QoL was evaluated using the EORTC questionnaire (QLQ-C30, plus breast module BR23) at Baseline and at 6 weeks, 3 months, and then at 6-month intervals after the start of study treatment. Tumour-related symptom assessments, based on the change from Baseline in pain intensity, were recorded by the subject at Baseline (within 7 days of Day 1 Cycle 1) and weekly during the study using a VAS, and consumption of analgesic medications were recorded at Baseline and throughout the study. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was assessed at Baseline, Day 1 of every cycle, and at Study Termination.

## Sample size

A total of 1100 subjects (550 subjects per group) were planned for enrolment into the study.

Subjects were randomized to treatment with either E7389 or capecitabine in a ratio of 1:1. Randomization was prestratified based on the geographic region and HER-2/neu status. To avoid a centre effect, any one centre could enrol a maximum of only 5% of the total study population (i.e., 55 subjects).

The sample size calculation was based on a superiority test for comparing overall survival between the two groups treated with E7389 or capecitabine. When the total number of events (deaths) observed was 905, an overall 0.04 level two-sided log rank test had approximately 90% power to detect a difference between the two survival curves if the alternative hypothesis hazard ratio was 0.80 (a 3month increase in median survival over the 12-month median survival of capecitabine). To account for censoring in the study, a total of 1100 randomized subjects was planned.

## Randomisation

Subjects were pre-stratified based on geographic region and HER-2/neu status (positive, negative, or unknown), and then randomised to one of the two treatment groups within each stratum in a 1:1 ratio to either E7389 or capecitabine.

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study. However, the Eisai study statistical team was blinded to dosing data and treatment group assignment until database lock to avoid potential bias. Independent statisticians conducted the interim analyses and assisted with queries.

## Statistical methods

The study was to be declared positive after achievement of any of the following outcomes for OS:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. First interim analysis after 453 deaths: OS of eribulin was statistically significantly better compared to capecitabine (P ≤ 0.002).
2. Second interim analysis after 603 deaths: OS of eribulin was statistically significantly better compared to capecitabine (P ≤ 0.0081).
3. Final analysis after 905 deaths: OS of eribulin was statistically significantly better compared to capecitabine (P ≤ 0.0372).
4. Final analysis after 905 deaths: OS hazard ratio (eribulin/capecitabine) was &lt; 1 and PFS of eribulin was statistically significantly better compared to capecitabine (P ≤ 0.01).

Decisions were based on two-sided, stratified log-rank tests with HER2/neu status 1  and geographic region as strata. The overall significance level alpha of 0.05 was adjusted for the two primary endpoints: 0.04 was used for testing OS, and 0.01 was used for testing PFS.

OS was measured from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. Subjects who were lost to follow-up or who were alive at the date of data cut-off were censored. To maintain an overall level of 0.04, alpha spending for sequential analyses of OS was based on the Lan-DeMets implementation of the O'Brien-Fleming spending function. The P value boundaries of 0.002, 0.0081, and 0.0372 are examples when the observed number of deaths at the times of interim analyses (453, 603, and 905 deaths, respectively).

Hypotheses tested included:

Ha: S(eribulin) = S(capecitabine)

Ha: S(eribulin) ≠ S(capecitabine)

where S is the survival distribution of OS.

PFS was compared between the two treatment groups using a two-sided 0.01 level stratified log-rank test. Hazard ratio (eribulin/capecitabine) was provided together with the two-sided 95% CI using stratified Cox regression model with treatment as a factor and HER2/neu status and geographic region as strata according to IVRS data. Median and 95% CI were provided using Kaplan-Meier estimate and Greenwood formula for each treatment group. PFS was plotted using Kaplan-Meier estimate. 6- and 12-month PFS rates were provided using Kaplan-Meier method together with 95% CI.

Additional exploratory Cox regression analysis was performed adjusting for the covariates. In addition to the censoring rules the Independent Review Charter described the rules for handling certain missing data.

The censoring rules for the primary analysis of PFS were according to FDA guidance in 2007.

Sensitivity analysis #1: PFS endpoint was analysed according to EMEA guideline on the methodological considerations for using PFS as primary endpoint in confirmatory trials for registration. This included that progression/death events were counted as events and not censored even in cases where they occurred after discontinuation (for other than progressive disease), after start of new anticancer treatment, or after two or more missed tumour assessments.

Sensitivity analysis #2: PFS endpoint was determined and analyzed using the investigator's disease assessments and also considered symptomatic progression as an event.

1  There were 70 (6.35%) subjects whose HER2/neu status was incorrectly entered into the IVRS database at time of randomization as determined by source document verification leading to the final, locked clinical database. Given this discordance, according to the SAP, the log-rank test stratified by geographic region and verified HER2/neu status in the clinical database was used.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Objective Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the number of subjects with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of subjects in the analysis population. The response rate was based on the independent review of disease assessments and investigator's assessments. Subjects with unknown or missing response were treated as nonresponders, i.e., they were included in the denominator when calculating percentages. Response rate was compared between the two groups using the Cochran-Mantel- Haenszel test with adjustment of stratification factors geographic region and HER2/neu status. If the test was not feasible or unreliable due to the large number of strata relative to the number of responders, Fisher's exact test was used. Response rate was summarized by treatment group with the 95% CI using Clopper-Pearson method.

Tumour response was evaluated according to the modified RECIST guidelines. The response assessment categories were CR, PR, Stable Disease (SD), Progressive Disease (PD), and Not Evaluable (NE). The best overall response was the best response achieved during the study. CRs and PRs were to be confirmed by a repeat assessment of response (CR or PR) separated by at least 4 weeks (28 days). In the case of SD, post-treatment measurement must have met the SD criteria at least once after the first drug administration at a minimum interval of 5 weeks (35 days). CR or PR assessed a minimum of 5 weeks (35 days) after start of treatment with a subsequent PD will be considered SD for the best response. However, CR or PR assessed less than 5 weeks (35 days) from start of treatment with a subsequent PD was considered PD for the best response.

Tumour response was independently reviewed by the imaging company, Radpharm, Inc. Best overall response for the investigators' assessments was derived programmatically based on the response assessments at each visit.

Duration of Response (DoR) (days) = Date of progression/ death/ censoring - Date of first documented CR or PR +1.

The primary QoL analysis will focus on the global health status/QoL (questions 29 and 30) at week 6. The difference in global health status/QoL scores at week six between the treatment arms will be compared using a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test.

## Recruitment

Start date 01 Apr 2006. At the date of data cut-off (12 Mar 2012), 10 subjects (5 subjects [0.9%] each in the eribulin and capecitabine groups) were still on treatment. The trial was performed at 210 sites across six geographic regions.

## Conduct of the study

## Protocol amendments

The original protocol was issued on 17 November 2005. Seven amendments were made to the protocol and a final protocol was issued on 03 March 2009.

The main changes (according to assessor) are shown below:

Amendment 01, 14 Dec 2005

- PFS was changed from a secondary objective to a primary objective.

Amendment 02, 02 Mar 2006:

- Trastuzumab was not available at all study centres; therefore, the requirement for previous exposure to trastuzumab was modified to allow subjects to participate in the study without previous exposure to trastuzumab.
- As PFS was made a primary endpoint, independent review of scans were to be performed.

Amendment 04, 05 Dec 2006:

- Eligibility criteria regarding prior chemotherapy were changed to include a more complete representation of the breast cancer population: 'Patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have received one or two prior chemotherapy regimens' was changed to: '…who have received up to three prior chemotherapy regimens, and no more than two prior regimens for advanced disease.'

Amendment 06, 06 Mar 2008:

- Allowed investigator more discretion for dose reductions of capecitabine on the first instance of Grade 2 toxicity, reflecting current medical practices. The following footnote was added to dose modification table for capecitabine: 'At the investigator's discretion and if it is in the best interest of the patient the dose of capecitabine may be reduced upon the first instance of Grade 2 toxicity for the following adverse events: hand-and-foot syndrome, hyperbilirubinemia, stomatitis, or diarrhea, nausea or vomiting that is not controlled by appropriate supportive medication.'

## · Protocol violations

The most common violations were violations of inclusion criterion #2 and exclusion criterion #1 (7 subjects each) that required subjects to have received up to three prior chemotherapy regimens and no more than two prior regimens for advanced and/or metastatic disease.

Note: Refiractory is defined as disease progression within 60 days after administration of the last dose of a taxane or anthracyclines. Not all subjects had both a baseline and study termination value for duration of last chemotherapy or time from last chemotherapy to first dose of study dnug and are therefore not included in the total number of subjects for those parameters. ITT = intent-to-treat, Min = minimum, Max = maximum, SD = standard deviation.

a: Includes prior neo-adjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic disease regimens.

Note: Subjects with two or more medications within a class level and dnug name are counted only once within that class level and drug name. Concomitant medications include medications that either (1) started before the first dose of study drug and were continuing at the time of the first dose of study drug, or (2) started on or after the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

- a:Subjects who experienced disease progression were administered capecitabine as a poststudy chemotherapy, after study dug was stopped. If capecitabine was started within 30 days of last dose, it is shown here.

Source: Study 301 CSR, Table 14.

Because concomitant medications were reported until 30 days after the last dose of study drug, capecitabine is listed as a concomitant medication for 144 subjects. However, these subjects experienced disease progression during the study and discontinued study drug before post-progression administration capecitabine was started. These appear under concomitant medications due to the definition in the protocol but in fact, represent post-progression chemotherapy.

## Definitions of Analysis Sets:

Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population: The Intent-to-Treat Population consists of all subjects who are randomized. This will be the primary analysis population for all efficacy data.

Per Protocol (PP) Population: The Per Protocol population consists of subjects who were randomized and received study drug for at least one full cycle and had no major protocol violations. This analysis population was used for exploratory analyses for all efficacy endpoints.

Safety Population: The Safety population consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment.

Analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were performed on the ITT and PP populations. Safety analyses were performed only on the Safety population.

## Adjusted OS (ITT) analysis:

An additional analysis was performed adjusted for number of prior chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced of metastatic disease (0 / ≥ 1) and time to progression after last chemotherapy (≤ 6 months / &gt;6 months). The resulting HR was 0.897 (95% CI: 0.786, 1.024).

## PP population

The difference between study arms was smaller in the per protocol population, but still numerically better for eribulin compared with capecitabine, HR: 0.91 (95% CI: 0.794, 1.045). Difference in median OS: 28 days, p= 0.2. Adjusted analysis (as for ITT above), HR: 0.93 (0.809, 1.065).

The MAH considers that the difference in IRC vs. investigator review in the median DoR for the capecitabine group may have been influenced by informative censoring in this relatively small number of subjects. In addition, five subjects in the capecitabine group had particularly long DoR contributing to a 3rd quartile of 703 days (95% CI = 483, 1223) compared with the 3rd quartile for the eribulin group of 330 days (95% CI = 273, 491) as assessed by IRC. Three of these five subjects were ongoing without disease progression at the time of data cut off, one subject had progressive disease assessed by IRC on the same date as the investigator, and one subject withdrew consent prior to IRC review. In addition, responders are not a randomized group and, therefore, direct comparison of duration cannot be made between groups.

## Secondary endpoint - Quality of Life

The MAH stated that subjects in the eribulin treatment group had a better QoL in parameters linked to gastrointestinal effects, while subjects in the capecitabine group had a better QoL in parameters related to hair loss. Mean scores for nausea and vomiting at baseline were 10.0 and 10.1, respectively, and improved in the eribulin group by a mean of -1.01 and deteriorated in the capecitabine group by a mean of +2.79. The change from baseline in mean scores for diarrhoea were -0.10 for subjects in the eribulin group (improvement) and +4.46 for subjects in the capecitabine group (deterioration). The change from baseline in mean scores for systemic therapy side effects, which includes 'upset by hair loss,' were +3.71 for subjects in the eribulin group (deterioration) and -1.13 for subjects in the capecitabine group (improvement). Symptoms of hand and foot syndrome were not assessed by the QoL questionnaire. Mean pain scores decreased (improved) in both treatment groups.

According to the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) the primary QoL analysis would focus on the global health status/QoL) at week 6:

Results for QLQ-C30 symptoms scales and BR23 module based on weighted generalized estimating equations where the weights are predicted probabilities for survival at 12 months with controls for age, race, no. of organs, lines of chemotherapy, HER2/neu status(ICH), ECOG, no. of hormonal therapies, no. of therapies in neoadjuvant setting and visceral disease. An exchangeable correlation matrix was specified.

Positive values favour eribulin in Functional scales and negative values favour eribulin in Symptom scales.

## Secondary endpoint - Tumour-related symptom assessments (VAS pain scores)

Overall, most subjects reported decreases from Baseline in VAS pain scores during the trial, with similar decreases in each treatment group at each study visit. However, at Study Termination, the mean decreases from Baseline in VAS pain scores for subjects in the eribulin group was 3.7 (n=431 subjects) and current mean pain score 16.3, while subjects in the capecitabine group reported no overall change from Baseline to Study Termination in VAS pain scores: + 0.4 (n=407) with current mean pain score 18.9. The mean pain scores were similar at baseline; 20.9 (n= 532) and 20.6 (n=531) in the eribulin and capecitabine arms, respectively. The VAS results are not independent of the analgesic use.

## Secondary endpoint - Consumption of analgesics during the study

The overall analgesic use was 53.9% vs. 46.3% for eribulin and capecitabine, respectively, with paracetamol use at 27.2% and 20.5%, respectively. In a separate analysis, opioid use rates were 40.8% vs.35.9%, respectively.

## Secondary endpoint - ECOG performance status

Most subjects in both treatment groups had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Score (ECOG) score of 0 or 1 at baseline and study termination. One subject in the E7389 group and four subjects in the capecitabine group had a shift from 0 at baseline to 3 at study termination and one subject in the capecitabine group had a shift from 0 at baseline to 4 at study termination. Similar results were observed for the PP population.

## Ancillary analyses

## OS and PFS - adjusted analyses

Oestrogen receptor and triple-negative status are well known prognostic factors for outcome in breast cancer. An imbalance was observed for these two receptors' status between the two treatment groups in Study 301. Therefore, post-hoc OS and PFS analyses adjusted for these factors were performed:

* Anthracyclines and taxanes both received as (neo)adjuvant therapy, or at least one of them received as treatment for metastatic disease.

Hazard ratio was estimated using Cox regression model stratified by geographic region, HER2 status, and the corresponding baseline status. P value is based on stratified log-rank test with the same stratification factors as the Cox regression model. CI = confidence interval.

## Post-hoc multi-adjusted OS analysis

At the request of the CHMP, a post-hoc analysis of OS and PFS was performed, adjusted for HER2/neu status (positive/negative/unknown), age (&lt;65 vs. ≥65 years old), visceral disease (yes/no), ECOG performance status (0/≥1), ER status (positive/negative/unknown), PgR status (positive/negative/unknown), triple-negative status (yes/no), tumour grade (1-2 vs. 3-4 vs. missing), number of prior chemotherapy regimens (0-1 vs. ≥2), duration of last prior therapy, time since last prior therapy, time since original diagnosis, and geographic region (North America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, South Africa, Asia).  The HR (95%CI) for OS-, PFS-(investigator), and PFS- (IRC)-adjusted analyses are 0.94 (0.82, 1.07), 1.01 (0.89, 1.16), and 1.11 (0.95, 1.28), respectively.

## PFS subgroup analyses

The PFS sub-group analyses of receptor status (Figure 10) showed no relevant differences between study arms, except a trend of better outcome for eribulin vs. capecitabine in the triple-negative subgroup; and a trend of better outcome in the capecitabine compared with the eribulin arm in the HER2-positive subgroup.

The PFS sub-group analyses of demographics showed a HR of 1.1 in favour of capecitabine in the Eastern Europe subgroup, which is the largest geographic region subgroup (n=612 of 1102; 56% of ITT) (Figure 11). This is in contrast with the OS subgroup analysis (Figure 7) with a HR of 0.94.

With regard to disease status, patients with non-visceral disease only (n= 142; 13% of the ITT) had a better HR point estimate of 0.83 (almost the only disease characteristic, apart from the receptor statuses, with a PFS HR below 1.0).

It is also noted that the subgroup with 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease (sought indication) had a PFS HR consistent with the overall results, i.e. HR 1.029 (95% CI: 0.838, 1.263), and 2 days' difference in median PFS favouring capecitabine.

HER2 subgroup analyses across studies

Pooled data for the HER2 subgroups of Studies 305 and 301 were provided.

HER2 negative subgroups of Studies 305 and 301:

OS* HR: 0.841 (0.743, 0.952)

PFS HR: 0.839 (0.741, 0.949)

HER2 positive subgroups of Studies 305 and 301:

OS* HR: 0.815 (0.624, 1.063)

PFS HR: 1.022 (0.780, 1.339)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

*: Stratified by geographic region, prior capecitabine use, and Study.

## OS - PFS discordance

The discordance between OS and PFS results was identified as a problem with regard to the acceptance of the data, since for a cytotoxic substance a difference in OS would normally be expected to be accompanied by a difference in PFS. Analyses were presented to address this issue, shown below.

## PFS censoring

## PFS censoring reasons

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patterns of PFS censoring reasons were analysed. No difference was observed across treatment arms for investigator-based data. However, for independent review, 4% more subjects in the capecitabine group were censored overall (34.4% vs. 30.5%), and 6% more subjects in the capecitabine group had informative censoring (defined as 'subjects who had PD/clinical PD in investigator data but PD not observed per IRC', 26.3% vs. 20.6%).The increase of censoring in the capecitabine group may have resulted in a slight overestimation of PFS according to a simulation study. Further analyses showed consistency in the radiological evaluation of PFS between treatment arms (including analyses of PFS adjusted by baseline characteristics, PFS sensitivity, tumour assessment frequency, and baseline tumour burden, as assessed by the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, by investigator and independent review).

New anti-cancer therapy was the cause for censoring in 104 (18.8%) of eribulin-treated patients and 112 (20.4%) of capecitabine-treated patients according to IRC /ITT (Table 28).

PFS censoring patterns were overall similar and did not offer an immediate explanation for the different results of the PFS and OS results.

## Eastern Europe

The difference (4% overall) in proportion of patients for whom death was censored (due to new anticancer treatment or missed visits) was driven by data from Eastern EU sites (with 6.6% difference, Table T\\_ad\\_OSPFS\\_2.2.1). Also in the analysis of informative censoring, the difference in censored deaths is driven by Eastern EU.

## EMA sensitivity analysis

A sensitivity analysis was pre-planned according to the EMA guideline on PFS, where PD/death events were NOT censored when they occurred after start of new anticancer treatment or after two or more missed tumour assessments.  With HR 1.1 the results do not offer an explanation to the OS-PFS discordance.

Another requested sensitivity analysis where new anticancer therapy was counted as progression indicated no bias by potential differences in the causes for start of new therapy in the PFS analysis.

## PFS censoring times

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH explored PFS censoring times by IRC and INV in order to investigate if differential censoring times in the eribulin and capecitabine arms could help explain the discordance in OS and PFS results. In the IRC analysis, patients in the capecitabine arm are censored earlier than in the eribulin arm, while time to censoring is the same for INV analysis. This can potentially be due to informative censoring where capecitabine has 6% more informative censoring than the eribulin arm.

When only censored patients are analysed, very similar time to censoring are seen for the two arms for IRC (87 vs. 86 days) and investigator (117 vs. 110 days) assessments. The observed differential pattern of time to censoring along with informative censoring could help explain the PFS results based on IRC analysis; however, given that there is no differential pattern observed for investigator assessment, this does not help to explain the discordance in OS and PFS results in general.

More patients in Study 301 had progression due to enlargement of pre-existing lesions in the eribulin group (27% vs. 24%, eribulin vs. capecitabine, respectively) while more subjects had progression due to new metastasis in the capecitabine group (49% vs. 52%, eribulin vs. capecitabine, respectively).

When all new metastases at any time point during the study, regardless of PFS censoring, where analysed, 5.2%more of the capecitabine-treated patients (57.7%) compared with eribulin-treated patients (52.2%) was observed with a new metastasis during study, according to investigator assessments (Table 29).

The baseline distributions of metastasis sites were overall similar, except for liver metastases which occurred in 5% higher frequency in the capecitabine arm (

The use of INV data is motivated by the presence of 20% informative censoring in the corresponding IRC data. Similar distributions were seen in IRC data (Study 301 CSR, Table T\\_ad\\_OSPFS\\_4.6.4.2.).

Additionally, the MAH observed that subjects who had progression due to a new metastasis were at a higher risk for death (HR=2.12; 95% CI = 1.84, 2.43; P &lt;0.0001) than were those who had progression with no new metastasis.  When time to progression by new metastasis (termed 'new metastasis-free survival' [nMFS]) was examined as a separate parameter, there was a trend in nMFS in favour of eribulin (HR=0.897 with a median difference of 0.6 months; based on investigator review) compared with the capecitabine arm, and the HR was similar to that of the OS trend. These results could be intuitively expected. However, analyses performed on 'new metastasis-free survival' for eribulin vs. capecitabine are 'biased' with regard to metastasis sites (capecitabine had more CNS, lung, and 'various parenchymal' metastases; eribulin had more lymph node and chest wall sites. These different metastasis sites could be expected to have different prognosis. Furthermore, since the difference in new metastasis as PD between arms was relatively small (5.2% more frequent in the capecitabine arm according to INV; no difference between arms according to IRC) this difference in frequency alone appears unlikely to explain the difference seen in OS. Therefore, these analyses are not further explored. Furthermore, the questions of PD as new metastasis or progression of existing lesion, as well as site of new lesion, are matters of competing risks, why the interpretation of data is complicated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Similar analyses were undertaken in study 305, a study with more heavily pretreated patients, comparing eribulin with treatment of physicians' choice (2:1 randomisation). In the ITT population, no difference in pattern of progression was observed. In patients assigned to capecitabine prior to randomisation, however, new lesions constituted the first event of progression in 42% vs 36%, eribulin vs. capecitabine, but numbers of patients were small, 77 vs. 45 . With respect to site of metastases, the pattern did not favour the eribulin arm.

## Preclinical support

In vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic studies indicated that eribulin may have additional effects on tumour vascular function and vascular remodelling, migration and invasiveness capacity of cancer cells, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related pathways, that could offer a plausible mechanistic rationale for a post-progression effect of eribulin compared with capecitabine (

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 1 ).

## Effect of post-study therapy

The impact of post study-medication chemotherapy was investigated to determine whether this could account for the trend towards improved survival observed with eribulin (Table 35).

70% of the patients randomised to eribulin received post-study anticancer therapy, 40% received capecitabine, 30% received other anticancer therapies.

## Supportive studies

The two supportive phase-2 studies in this application (Study 221 and Study 224) are supportive with regard to safety. They were performed in Japan.

The MAH states that the pivotal Study 301 is the sole efficacy trial in support of this type II variation. However, efficacy was a primary objective of Study 221; a brief summary of efficacy results is therefore given below.

## Study 221

(Protocol number: E7389-J081-221), n= 84 (81 treated)

'Phase II Clinical Study of E7389 for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer'

This was a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, uncontrolled, multi-centre study in patients with advanced or relapsed breast cancer who had received up to three prior therapies for advanced or relapsed breast cancer, including an anthracycline and a taxane. Subjects also had to have a life expectancy of 3 months or longer, have adequate renal, liver, and bone marrow function, and no clinically significant therapy-related toxicity at study entry. Eribulin mesilate 1.4 mg/m 2 was administered as an i.v. bolus over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle.

## Study 224

(Protocol number: E7389-J081-224), n= 6 (6 treated)

'A Phase 2 Extension Study of E7389 in Patients with Advanced or Relapsed Breast Cancer'

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This was an extension of Study 221. Safety and efficacy data are included in the results of Study 221.

## Study 221 efficacy results:

Of the 80 subjects in the Full analysis set (FAS), 17 subjects were assessed as objective response cases (PR in all subjects) by Assessment Committee (independent review) and objective response rate (ORR), one of the primary endpoints of this study, was 21.3% (95% confidence interval: 12.9 31.8%). In FAS, 47 subjects were assessed as disease control (CR+PR+SD) by the independent review and disease control rate was 58.8% (95% confidence interval: 47.2 - 69.6%) and 22 subjects were assessed as clinical benefit (CR + PR +SD of at least 6 months) and clinical benefit rate was 27.5% (95% confidence interval: 18.1 - 38.6%). For objective response rates by the independent review, the mode of the posterior distribution calculated using Jeffreys non-informative prior distribution [Beta distribution Be (0.5, 0.5)] by Bayesian approach was 20.9%, the predictive posterior probabilities that true objective response rates were lower than 10%, 15% and 20% were 0.1%, 6.4% and 38.0% respectively, and 95% equal tail credible interval and 95% highest posterior density credible interval of true objective response rates were 13.4 - 31.1% and 13.0 - 30.6% respectively. The median (95% confidence interval) of duration of overall response by the independent review was 119.0 days (85.0 148.0 days). The median (95% confidence interval) of progression-free survival by the independent review was 112 days (61.0 - 133.0 days), and progression-free survival rates at Month 3, 6, 9 and 12 were 54.2%, 20.1%, 10.1% and 6.7% respectively. Though number of subjects with event (death) was 41 in 80 subjects (51.3%) being small, median (95% confidence interval) of overall survival was 331.0 days (234.0 days - uncalculable), and 6-month and 12-month survival rates were 72.3% and 45.4% respectively. Since the analytical results of the primary and secondary endpoints showed no large differences between FAS and PPS, the selection of analysis sets appeared to have only slight influence on the conclusion concerning the efficacy of eribulin in this study. Subgroup analyses, stratifying FAS by age, tissue types, number of prior chemotherapy regimens, with or without administration of capecitabine and vinorelbine in prior chemotherapy, number of prior chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, presence or absence of relapse, presence or absence of primary lesion or metastatic lesion, presence or absence of drug refractory, HER2/neu expression status, and sensitivity to hormones (ER and PgR), were performed, so that no factor appeared to clearly influence the evaluation of efficacy in this study.

It is concluded that the PFS of approximately 3.7 months (112 days) in Study 221 is consistent with the PFS of registration Study 305 (3.6 months) and the current pivotal Study 301 (4.1/4.2 months).

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The sought indication differs from the already approved indication with regard to the required number of prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced disease: one compared with two. This would move the indication up to 2 nd  line therapy for metastatic/advanced disease compared with the present indication in the 3 rd line setting.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Study 301 was an open-label 1:1 randomised phase III trial performed in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had received up to 3 prior chemotherapy regimens, and no more than two prior regimens for advanced and/or metastatic disease. This includes 1 st -2 nd line metastatic treatment. The chemotherapy regimens must have included an anthracycline and a taxane, and there must be documented evidence of disease progression during or after their most recent anticancer therapy. Efficacy in patients with active brain or subdural metastases, or with meningeal carcinomatosis has not been evaluated. It is noted that the inclusion requirement to end biological treatment 2 weeks before start of study treatment is not in line with current clinical practice, according to which anti-HER2 therapy should be continued, and would likely not be accepted if the study was initiated today. In this study HER2 positive status was 15% and balanced across arms.

OS and PFS were the two primary endpoints. The overall significance level alpha was 0.05, with 0.04 used on OS, and 0.01 on PFS.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

## Baseline characteristics

In total 280/554 (50.54%) of the patients in the eribulin arm were treated in the 2nd-line for metastatic/advanced disease, which represents the new indication sought. Another 116 (20.9%) were treated in the 1st line, thus 396/554 (71.5%) of the patients in the eribulin arm were treated in earlier stages of the disease than the already approved 3rd line indication.

Overall, there were no major imbalances in baseline patient, disease, or tumour characteristics.

Time since original diagnosis was somewhat higher in the eribulin arm (36 months vs. 31 months). HER2 positivity was approximately 15% in both study arms. Oestrogen receptor (ER) and hormone receptor (HR) positivity were somewhat lower (approximately 4%), and triple negativity slightly higher (2.6%) in the eribulin arm compared with the capecitabine arm. The direction of the imbalance for all these prognostic factors could in theory favour the capecitabine arm. However, with regard to disease sites, the capecitabine group had 5% more liver metastasis, and 4% less patients with only 1 organ involved.

There were no major imbalances in the prior anticancer therapies. While the use of prior anti-HER2 therapy in the form of trastuzumab was balanced across study arms (approximately 10% in both), there was an imbalance in the proportion of HER2-positive patients having received prior trastuzumab; 67% in the eribulin arm compared to 59% in the capecitabine arm. This could in theory result in a better response to post-study trastuzumab in the capecitabine arm compared with the eribulin arm, and could thus potentially favour capecitabine in the OS comparison. However, due to the small numbers (the difference between arms representing 1.6% of the ITT) it is not likely to have impacted the overall study results.

Thus, the imbalances seen in baseline characteristics were small, and would mostly be expected to affect the results in favour of capecitabine, if at all. While, in theory, this could explain why a smaller difference than 'expected' between arms is seen in PFS, it does not offer an explanation for the differential effects seen in OS vs. PFS. Baseline factors would be expected to affect both outcome measures.

## Efficacy results

None of the primary objectives were met. Overall survival (OS) showed a statistically non-significant trend of better outcome for eribulin- compared with capecitabine-treated patients, with a median difference of 1.4 months. For progression-free survival (PFS) there was no difference between arms. This discordance between OS and PFS results was identified as a main issue for the efficacy assessment. However, the OS Kaplan-Meier curves separated at an early time point, and remained separated over time, with median OS at 15.9 months vs. 14.5 months in the in the eribulin and capecitabine arms, respectively, with overlapping 95% CIs and p= 0.0560. The pre-specified p-value to conclude a positive study at this final OS analysis was p&lt;0.0372. I.e. this cannot be considered borderline statistical significance. The numerical difference in medians was thus 1.4 months (44 days), HR was 0.879 (95% CI: 0.770, 1.003). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were also numerically higher in the eribulin arm, and statistically significantly higher for 1-year survival rate.

The PFS analyses according to independent review (IRC) and investigator assessments (INV) generated very similar results, with a difference in median PFS of +/- 2-3 days, and HRs 1.079 (95% CI: 0.932, 1.250) and 0.977 (95% CI: 0.857, 1.114), respectively. While the differences between IRC and INV results are small, the difference in uncertainty, as described by the 95% confidence intervals, could be an issue for the B/R balance. Based on the upper 95% confidence limits of the HRs, there is a 2.5% chance/risk that eribulin is up to 11% poorer than capecitabine with regard to PFS according to INV, and up to 25% according to IRC. Overall, there was a 74% concordance between investigator and independent review in detecting patients with or without PD, and no bias in progression date was detected. As no important bias has been identified in the investigator assessments of PFS overall, investigator-based data for PFS is accepted as basis for this discussion.

There were no statistically significant differences in ORRs and CBRs between arms. Numerically slightly higher rates were observed for capecitabine.

The global QoL scores showed no meaningful changes during study, or differences between eribulin and capecitabine. The QoL scores for the separate items are reflective of the ADR profiles, with worse scores for eribulin with regard to systemic therapy effects and hair loss, and worse scores for capecitabine with regard to gastrointestinal ADRs. The QoL data therefore does not impact the B/R balance.

The use of analgesics was slightly higher in the eribulin arm, which could explain a slightly better VAS pain score in this study arm.

ECOG performance status (PS) scores displayed a similar pattern across arms during study. The vast majority of patients remained in PS 0-1 during study, potentially reflecting both effect and tolerability of both treatments.

## Subgroup and adjusted analyses

## Sought indication

The subgroup with 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease, which corresponds to the sought indication, had a HR consistent with the overall results, i.e. OS HR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.698, 1.010), and 49 days' (approximately 1.6 month) median difference in OS favouring eribulin. For PFS the results in this subgroup were also consistent with the overall PFS results, i.e. HR 1.029 (95% CI: 0.838, 1.263), and 2 days' difference in median PFS favouring capecitabine.

## Demographic subgroups

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

OS subgroup analyses showed no major differences between demographic subgroups. The geographic region subgroup Latin America showed a statistically significant better HR for eribulin vs. capecitabine. No other demographic subgroups achieved statistical significance. Western Europe (n= 157, 14% of ITT) and Eastern Europe (n= 612; 55% of ITT) had similar HR point estimates, 0.92 and 0.94, respectively (both n.s.). The combined geographic region north America/Western Europe/Australia (n= 244; 22% of ITT) had a HR point estimate of 0.84, with the small group from North America as the driver of the more favourable HR.

The PFS sub-group analyses of demographics showed a nominally significant HR of 1.27 in favour of capecitabine in the Eastern Europe subgroup, which is the largest geographic region subgroup representing 55.5% of the ITT. This is in contrast with the OS subgroup analysis with a non-significant HR of 0.94.

Comparing Eastern Europe with the rest of the world, it was observed that, irrespective of therapy, more TEAE and serious TEAE in general were reported in the rest of the world. This was the case also for grade 3 palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia, capecitabine 23% vs. 8%. Furthermore, and in the rest of the world, TEAE led to more discontinuations of capecitabine prior to progression (14% vs. 8%) and dose reductions (42% vs. 24%). In this context it should be remembered that the study dose of capecitabine was 2500 mg/m 2 /day, i.e. the licensed dose, a dose considered too high from a tolerability perspective by leading breast cancer experts, at least in the West.

## Receptor subgroups and adjusted analyses

The direction of the imbalance for all prognostic factors except performance status (see Disease characteristics) could in theory favour the capecitabine arm. Post-hoc OS analyses adjusted for baseline receptor status were performed. When OS was adjusted post-hoc by oestrogen receptor and triple-negative receptor status, (each factor alone as well as and in combination), improvements in OS for eribulin compared with capecitabine was observed, reaching nominal statistical significance (with p&lt; 0.0372 significance limit). Nominally statistically significant results were also reached for the composite factor Hormone receptor status. The hazard ratios for PFS also showed a numerical improvement after adjustment for the status of these receptors (Table 21). This indicates that the relatively small baseline imbalances in ER and triple-negative receptor status may have affected the study results to some degree.

A large number of other disease or pre-treatment characteristics did not appear to explain the difference in OS between study arms seen in the primary OS analysis, since HRs remained stable around 0.85 - 0.89 when adjusted for these as single variables (Table 22).

However, multi-adjusted post-hoc analyses adjusted for a large number of baseline factors of potential prognostic impact resulted in OS HR 0.94 (95%CI: 0.82, 1.07), PFS (investigator) HR 1.01 (0.89, 1.16), and PFS (IRC) HR 1.11 (0.95, 1.28), respectively. Thus, PFS HRs were virtually unchanged, while OS results deteriorated, indicating that the OS results are less robust than the PFS results.

In subgroup analysis by receptor status, a larger relative OS treatment effect of eribulin compared with capecitabine was seen in the ER negative, hormone receptor (HR) negative and HER2 negative prespecified subgroups, compared to their complementary receptor positive subgroups, and most of all in the combined triple-negative subgroup of patients: OS HR 0.70 (95% CI: 0.545; 0.91) vs. 0.93 (n.s) in the complementary set). The PFS subgroup analyses showed similar trends of a relatively better outcome for eribulin vs. capecitabine in the triple-negative subgroup and in the HER2-negative subgroup.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, opposite trends were observed in the updated OS subgroup analysis of the registration Study 305, with better HR point estimates for ER positive, PgR positive and HER2 positive subgroups, compared with their negative counterparts, and better OS HR estimates for the non-triple negative subgroup compared with the triple-negative; 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63; 0.95) vs. 0.89 (95% CI 0.60; 1.32, Figure 6). For PFS, the updated HRs for Study 305, provided in responses to questions, were very similar in triple negative vs. the complementary set, 0.79 vs. 0.78.

The conflicting findings between Study 301 and Study 305 with regard to receptor subgroups weaken the observations made in study 301. Furthermore, pooled data (although questionable from a methodological point of view) for studies 305 and 301 indicated similar effects for HER2-positive and negative patients, with pooled OS HR 0.82 (95% CI: 0.62; 1.06) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74; 0.95), respectively; and pooled PFS HR 1.02 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.34) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.95), respectively. Based on the data from both phase 3 trials in breast cancer, Studies 305 and 301, it is concluded that no relevant difference in efficacy has been shown between the HER2 positive and negative patient subgroups, or between triple negative vs. non- triple negative subgroups.

With regard to disease status factors, patients with non-visceral-only disease (n= 142; 13% of the ITT) were clearly distinguished from the other sub-groups with a statistically significant OS HR at 0.51 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.795). Again the reverse finding was seen in Study 305.

## OS - PFS discordance

Explanations for the discrepancy between OS and PFS results were sought.

## PFS

The MAH provided analyses of progression of existing lesions or new lesions by IRC and INV. Due to a large proportion of informative censoring in the IRC data and as no important bias has been observed, the use of INV data are accepted in the analysis of censoring patterns.

It was also found that the sites of new metastases differed, but this pattern was not replicated in study 305.

The MAH has presented pre-clinical data suggesting that eribulin treatment may induce a phenotypic change to a more differentiated and less aggressive state, and changes in tumour vasculature making the tumours more accessible to post-progression therapy, thereby presenting plausible biological mechanisms that could to some degree offer theoretical explanations for these findings.

The reason for PFS censoring was new anti-cancer therapy in approximately 20% of patients in both study arms by IRC /ITT. No bias by potential differences in the causes for start of new therapy in the PFS analysis was identified.

The divergent results in Eastern Europe with regard to OS (HR 0.94) and PFS OS (HR 1.27), the contrasting PFS results compared with other geographic subgroups, as well as the more frequent censoring of death in the capecitabine arm driven by the Eastern European region was further investigated. Data indicated that differential informative censoring and imbalances in triple negative status may have contributed to the diverging PFS results seen in Eastern Europe compared with other regions. In addition, the large proportion of patients with unknown HER2 positive status could include an imbalance of the actual HER2 status, if analysed, of potential impact on PFS. However, baseline prognostic factors would also be expected to affect OS. Furthermore, since differential informative censoring was observed also for investigator-based PFS, it cannot explain the PFS-OS discordance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH explored PFS censoring times by IRC and INV. In the IRC analysis, patients in the capecitabine arm are censored earlier than in the eribulin arm, while time to censoring is the same for INV analysis. The observed differential pattern of time to censoring along with informative censoring could help explain the PFS results based on IRC analysis; however, given that there is no differential pattern observed for investigator assessment, this does not help to explain the discordance in OS and PFS results in general.

PFS2 data were not available and the substitute analysis performed by the MAH did not add any new information.

## OS

The analysis of post- study therapy as cause for the difference seen in OS between study arms, favouring eribulin, such as the impact of any post- study anti-cancer therapy (yes/no), the impact of post- study capecitabine use, and of anti-HER2 use, could not explain the difference in OS.

The qualitative difference in metastatic sites and their different prognosis post-progression could potentially offer an explanation for a smaller part of the PFS-OS discrepancy (see above).

## Supportive studies

The PFS of approximately 3.7 months (112 days) in Study 221 is consistent with the PFS of registration Study 305 (3.6 months) and the current pivotal Study 301 (4.1/4.2 months).

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The study objective was not met, since superiority of eribulin over capecitabine was not demonstrated in the studied disease setting, which includes the sought indication 2nd line metastatic therapy. There is a trend, however, of numerically better OS in the eribulin arm potentially suggesting that eribulin is not inferior to capecitabine in this disease setting. For PFS, no clinically relevant or statistically significant differences between arms were seen.

Based on the investigator assessments of PFS the HR at 0.98 and the narrow 95% confidence interval (0.86, 1.11), it is considered that a clinically relevant difference can be excluded.

The discrepancy between OS and PFS data are problematic since potentially suggesting that factors other than the study treatments might be affecting the results. The MAH has provided a large number of analyses investigating this issue, however there was no clear explanation of this discrepancy.

There was a qualitative difference between study arms in the type of new metastasis in those 55% of patients (by INV) who had new lesion as progression event, where the prognosis is expected to be worse for those metastasis sites more frequently seen for capecitabine. However, at this stage it is not known if this difference in metastasis location is a mere chance finding, or if it represents a true difference in effect.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## 2.5.1. Introduction

- Safety analysis populations

The safety assessment is based on a total of 1503 patients treated in seven phase 2-3 trials in metastatic/advanced breast cancer (Table 32). This pooled safety population will be referred to as the Breast Cancer Population (BCP).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the studies included in the BCP, studies 305, 201 and 211 were assessed at initial market approval; the neuropathy study 209 comparing eribulin and ixabepilone was assessed in FUM 015; while the pooled data from studies 221 and 224 are assessed for the first time within the present application, together with the pivotal study 301. A description of the studies is given in Table 33 below.

## Safety assessments and definitions

- Study 301 safety assessments

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety assessments included monitoring the incidence and severity of AEs, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs measurements, physical examination findings, electrocardiogram (ECG) readings, and concomitant medication use. Abnormal ECG (QTc) results, if not otherwise considered part of a clinical symptom that was being reported as an AE, were considered an AE if the QTc interval was &gt;450 msec and there was an increase of &gt;60 msec from Baseline. Also, any ECG abnormality that the investigator considered an AE was reported as such.

- Definition of TEAE in Study 301

'A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as an AE that emerged during treatment, having been absent at pre-treatment (baseline) or re-emerged during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or worsened in severity during treatment relative to the pre-treatment state, when the AE was continuous.

Only those AEs that were treatment-emergent were included in summary tables. All AEs, treatmentemergent or otherwise, were presented in subject data listings. Adverse events were regarded as TEAEs if they started on or after the date and time of administration of the first dose of study drug until 30 days after last dose or if they were present prior to the administration of the first dose of study drug and increased in severity during the study.'

It is found acceptable to focus on the TEAE as all AE emerging within 30 days after last dose is included taking into consideration that the terminal half-life is approximately 40 h.

- Adverse Events of Special Interest

Asthenia and fatigue (combined), arthralgia and myalgia (combined), alopecia, neutropenia, and peripheral neuropathy were identified as special adverse events of interest (AEIs).

These are presented in the overall AE tables by MedDRA SOC and preferred term.

Two definitions were used to determine the incidence of peripheral neuropathy. The first definition ('narrow SMQ analysis') included the following combined terms contained in the SMQ for neuropathy: neuropathy peripheral, peripheral motor neuropathy, polyneuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy, peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, demyelinating polyneuropathy, and paraesthesia. The second definition ('broad SMQ analysis') included the list of preferred terms contained in the narrow SMQ for neuropathy as well as the following additional preferred terms: neuropathy, hyperesthesia, painful response to normal stimuli, pallanaesthesia and allodynia. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy based on the two SMQ definitions (narrow and broad) is included in the AE tables.

## Patient exposure

The exposure was overall very consistent across eribulin studies 301 and 305, and the pooled phase 2/3 BCP. Study 301 had 1 cycle higher median number of cycles and 1 week longer duration of exposure than Study 305, compatible with the somewhat earlier disease setting. (The median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 2 in Study 301 compared with 4 in Study 305). Median dose intensity, relative dose intensity and cumulative dose were very similar between the two studies, however, and only cumulative dose was slightly lower in the BCP (Table 34).

Similarly, the dose modification patterns were very consistent across the eribulin safety populations, with the proportions having any dose modification at around 50% in all three populations, time to first dose reduction and dose delay around 15-16 weeks in all three populations, and dose omissions (day 8 dose) around 10% in all populations (

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 35).

These similarities in exposure and dose modification patterns across studies are consistent with overall similar efficacy and safety findings.

MedDRA version 14.1.

For each row category, a subject with more than one TEAE in that category is counted only once.

CRF = case report formr; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; SMQ = standard MedDRA query; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event.

a: Includes TEAEs considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study dnug or TEAEs with missing causality.

b: Includes deaths.

- Information obtained from the Adverse Event page of the CRF, and includes subjects who had an ongoing AE at the time of death, and does not reflect the primary reason for death (i.e., disease progression, toxicity, or \"other\") from the Death page of the CRF.

Note: MedDRA version 14.1.

For each TEAE, a subject who had more than one episode is counted only once using the event with the highest CTC grade.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the preferred term 'febrile neutropenia,' severity was converted into CTC grades as follows: mild or moderate = Grade 3, severe = Grade 4, fatal = Grade 5.

For the preferred term 'alopecia,' severity was converted into CTC grades as follows: mild or moderate = Grade 1, severe = Grade 2.

The table is based on the grade 3-4 frequencies in the Phase2/3 population. TEAEs with a frequency &lt; 1% in this population but higher in Studies 301 or 305 are not shown, e.g. diarrhoea. (0.8% in Phase 2/3, 1.1% in Study301). a: Term included for completeness even though incidence in Phase 2/3 breast cancer trials was &lt;1%. Source: SCS, Table 15.

Note: Subjects with two or more adverse events in the same with the same preferred term are counted only once for that preferred term. Adverse Event terms were coded using Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) version 14.1. Adverse events were graded using CTCAE version 3.0 per protocol. Treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) include TEAEs that were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study drug or TEAEs with a missing causality.

a:  Percentage is based on patients with Grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy (PN).

b:  Improvement was defined as a decrease by one grade or more. Time to improvement was calculated from start of worst PN to start of PN with improvement. Grade 0 means PN stopped.

c:  If PN was not resolved, time to resolution was censored at the earliest date of death, last dose + 30 days, last known alive date, or start of another anticancer therapy.

## QT prolongation

There were no events of torsades de pointes reported for eribulin-treated subjects in the Phase 2/3 breast cancer trials. However, QT prolongation was reported as a non-serious TEAE in two eribulintreated subjects in Study 301. Both had hypokalemia as potential contributing factors. Two capecitabine-treated subjects also had QT prolongation. None led to treatment discontinuation. (SCS, p. 102, Response Q26)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition there were 5 of the eribulin-treated patients (0.9% of Study 301 safety population) who had &gt; 60 ms prolongation of QTc from baseline and in two of these patients, values over 500 ms were reported according to QTcB, one of the two also reached 500 ms by QTcF. In one of these 5 cases hypokalemia was reported (in combination with infection and brain metastases), in another vomiting (potential cause of electrolyte imbalance), in a third no electrolyte imbalance was present.

Individual case reports were scrutinised and a more detailed tabulation of QT events was considered inconspicuous (see below). Thus there are no outstanding concerns from this perspective.

## Deaths

## BCP

Overall, 67 eribulin-treated subjects (4.5%) in the Phase 2/3 breast cancer trials had a TEAE associated with an outcome of death. That is, these TEAEs were ongoing at the time of the death and may not have been the primary cause of death. The only TEAEs associated with an outcome of death in more than two subjects were neoplasm malignant (n=10, 0.7%), dyspnoea (9, 0.6%), respiratory failure (8, 0.5%), metastases to meninges (3, 0.2%), disease progression (3, 0.2%), and sepsis (3, 0.2%).

## Study 301

In Study 301, 26 of the 544 subjects (4.8%) in the eribulin group and 36 of the 546 subjects (6.6%) in the capecitabine group died during the treatment period or within 30 days of last dose of study treatment.

## Eribulin arm

Nine deaths in the eribulin group were associated with an AE (1.7%). Fifteen deaths (2.8%) were attributed to disease progression. For two subjects (0.4%) the primary cause of death was listed as 'unknown.'

In the in the eribulin group, there were 11 TEAEs reported with an outcome of death, 5 (possibly) related (R) and 6 not related (N). In two cases the investigator's final judgement on cause of death was another than the reported TEAE ('unknown' and 'disease progression', respectively, shown with arrows in the summary below):

2 Sepsis (1 R, 1 N), 1 Renal failure (R), 2 Respiratory failure (2 N), 1 Dyspnoea (N), 1 Stroke (N), 1 Toxic hepatitis (R), 1 Multiple organ failure (N), 1 pericardial effusion (R) -&gt; Disease progression,1 Sudden death (R) -&gt; Unknown.

## Capecitabine arm

In the capecitabine group, 13 deaths were associated with an AE (2.4%), 22 (4.0%) were due to disease progression. For 1 subject (0.2%), the primary cause of death was listed as 'unknown.'

In the in the capecitabine group, there were 14 TEAEs reported with an outcome of death, 4 (possibly) related (R) and 10 not related (N). In one case, the investigator's final judgement on cause of death was 'unknown'.

1 Hypercalcaemia (N), 1 Cardiac and respiratory arrest (N), 1 Respiratory failure (N), 1 Pneumonia (R), 1 Intracranial hypertension (N), 1 Haemorrhagic shock (N), 1 Cardiogenic shock(R), 1 Respiratory distress (N) -&gt; Unknown, 1 Sepsis (R), 1 Pancytopenia (R), 1 Sudden death (N), 1 Cerebellar infarction (N), 1 Multiple organ failure (N), 1 Stroke (N).

TEAES with fatal outcome in Study 301 of particular interest (CSR, Table 14.3.2.1.2.1):

- Toxic hepatitis: 1 in the eribulin arm - 0 in the capecitabine arm.
- Pancytopenia: 0 in the eribulin arm - 1 in the capecitabine arm.
- Cardiac disorders SOC (all terms): 2 (0.4%) in the eribulin arm - 4 (0.7%) in the capecitabine arm
- 'Infections…' SOC (all terms): 2 (0.4) (=2 sepsis) in the eribulin arm - 2 (0.4) (= sepsis; pneumonia) in the capecitabine arm
- Nervous system disorders SOC (all terms): 1 (0.2) in the eribulin arm - 6 (1.1) in the capecitabine arm.

## Treatment-related deaths

There was no difference between Studies 301 and 305 in the overall incidence of deaths due to TEAEs reported as treatment related (n=5 [0.9%] vs. 5 [1.0%] for Studies 301 and 305, respectively). In Study 301, the five deaths reported as related to eribulin by the investigator included pericardial effusion, sudden death, hepatic toxicity, sepsis, and renal failure. In Study 305, the five deaths reported as related to eribulin included dyspnoea, febrile neutropenia, bronchopneumonia, and lung infection.

In the capecitabine group in Study 301, four deaths (0.7%) were considered to be treatment related by the investigator, and included pneumonia, cardiogenic shock, sepsis, and pancytopenia in one subject each. (SCS p. 77)

d: Four subjects discontinued due to an AE, although the AE leading to discontinuation was recorded more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

Source: Study 301 CSR, Table 7.

Note: According to footnote of CSR, Table 7 (Table 52), four subjects discontinued due to an AE, although the AE leading to discontinuation was recorded more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug. When counting these 4 cases, the cause for discontinuation from Study 301 was an adverse event in 8.1% of the eribulin-treated patients and 10.8% of the capecitabine-treated patients. In the CSR table 40 (

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 54 ), however, these patients do not seem to be included, and the resultant frequencies are 7.9% vs. 10.4%, congruent with SCS table 26 (

## Haematology

Shifts from CTC toxicity grade 0-1 at Baseline to grade 3-4 during treatment were most frequently recorded for Absolute neutrophil count (ANC). In the BCP, 60% of eribulin-treated subjects had a shift in ANC value from grade 0-1 at Baseline to Grade 3-4 sometime during treatment, compared to 58% of eribulin-treated subjects in Study 301 and 56% in Study 305. Overall, the frequencies of shifts in haematology laboratory tests in Study 301 were consistent with the previously known safety profile (or slightly improved). As before, haemoglobin and platelets rarely reached toxicity grade 3 or 4 (Table 55).

Percentages are based on the total number of subjects with non-missing lab measurements in each cycle for each integrated analysis set.

CTC grade is based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). CTC Grade 0 = Within normal range or abnormal in a direction in which CTC grade is not defined.

a: Assessed through Cycle 65.

b: Assessed through Cycle 23.

## Liver function tests

Although not noted as clinically significant, increases from baseline in ALT and AST assessed as CTCAE Grade 2 were frequently observed during the early treatment cycles (Cycles 1 and 2). No concurrent change from baseline was observed for total bilirubin, LDH, or alkaline phosphatase for subjects in the eribulin group.

Liver toxicity grade ≥ 3was reported as a TEAE 1.1% of eribulin-treated patients in Study 301. While 3 patients fulfilled the laboratory criteria for Hy's, none of them fulfilled the clinical criteria of absence of other plausible explanation, in these cases in the form of progressing liver metastases or cholestasis.

In the eribulin arm of Study 301, 104 (21%) of the 502 patients with baseline ALT grade 0 or 1 had shifts to grade 2 or 3 post baseline, compared with 51 (10%) of 500 patients in the capecitabine arm. On the other hand, more patients in the capecitabine arm (n=119, all of whom had baseline grade 0-1 bilirubin) had bilirubin elevation to grade 2 (Hy's law cut-off), compared with 26 patients (also all with baseline grade 0-1) in the eribulin arm.

## Grade 3 ALT elevation

Of the 37 eribulin-treated patients in Study 301 who had ALT elevation grade 3, most hade elevation to maximum 5-6 x upper limit of normal (ULN). Three patients had elevation to 7 x ULN, one each to 8, 10 and 12 x ULN, respectively, and two to 16 x ULN. A majority of these patients had their highest ALT elevation in cycles 1 (n=14) and 2 (n=9). Liver metastases were present in 22 of the 37 cases, no liver metastases in 13, and for 2 of the patients no clinical data were provided. Of the 13 patients without liver metastases, all but one had elevated LFTs reported from baseline. Liver toxicity was reported in 5 of the 37 cases; all five had some baseline elevation of LFTs, three had liver metastasis and a fourth had a history of cholecystitis. Thus, due to the presence of confounding factors in virtually all cases, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the relationship between eribulin and these grade 3 ALT elevations.

The pattern of frequent early ALT increases of little or no clinical consequence returning to normal in later cycles is acknowledged. This is sometimes referred to as 'tolerance' and in the absence of bilirubin elevations is believed to have little or no potential for serious toxicity (The Clinical White Paper on DILI).

## Safety in special populations

## Age

In the Phase 2/3 breast cancer trials, 209 eribulin-treated subjects were &gt;65 to 75 years of age and 24 subjects were &gt;75 years of age. In the Phase 2/3 breast cancer trials, there were no notable differences in the overall AE profile of eribulin by age group.

Among eribulin-treated subjects in the Phase 2/3 breast cancer trials, there appeared to be no effect of age on any treatment-emergent abnormal hematology or chemistry laboratory values or on the incidence of Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities at Baseline and during treatment. (SCS p 124,126).

## Race

No firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the safety of eribulin by racial category, given the small number of black and Asian subjects in the Safety population.

Japanese subjects enrolled in Study 221/224 had a very high rate of Grade 3-4 neutropenia (Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 70.4% of subjects), not consistent with the results for any other trial in this submission. The MAH has found no biological basis for the high incidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia in Study 221/224. The data in non-Japanese Asian patients are between Japanese and Western data, although the number of such patients is presently small.

Interim results of a post-marketing surveillance study in Japanese patients with MBC, based on 836 of in total 968 patients, shows an incidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia (486 patients [58.1%]) and febrile neutropenia (56 patients [6.7%]) comparable to that observed in non-Japanese patients. This suggests that the finding in Study 221/224 may not be representative of the clinical reality.

## Baseline Body Surface Area (BSA)

The overall AE profile of eribulin is presented for the Safety populations by BSA (&lt;1.50, 1.50-&lt;1.70, 1.70-2.0, &gt;2.0-2.2, &gt;2.2 m 2 ). Among eribulin-treated subjects in the Phase 2/3 breast cancer trials, there was no notable pattern in the overall TEAE incidence with increasing BSA. There did appear to be higher incidences of hematologic TEAEs in subjects with lower BSA (total, severe and related TEAEs). This finding appears to be driven by the fact that 59 of the 81 subjects in the Japanese Studies 221/224 were included in the lowest BSA category. Japanese subjects enrolled in Study 221/224 had a very high rate of Grade 3-4 neutropenia (Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 70.4% of subjects), not consistent with the results for any other trial in this submission. When subjects enrolled in Studies 221/224 were removed from the analysis, there did not appear to be differences in overall AE profile across BSA categories. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn, given the small number of subjects in some of the categories.

In conclusion, when the Japanese subjects in Study 221/224 (with the unusually high rate of Grade 34 neutropenia) were removed from the analysis, Baseline Body Surface Area (BSA) did not affect TEAE frequencies.

## Liver impairment

Hepatic impairment increases exposure to eribulin. According to population PK analyses, decreased clearance is associated with decreased albumin, increased bilirubin, and increased alkaline phosphatase. Compared with subjects with normal hepatic function, exposure to eribulin increased 1.75-fold and 2.79 fold in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, there was an increase in the incidence of severe and serious TEAEs with increasing baseline total bilirubin, ALT, and AST levels. There appeared to be a trend towards a higher incidence of total TEAEs, severe TEAEs (Grade ≥ 3), serious TEAEs and deaths due to a TEAE in subjects with a low baseline albumin level. In general, the overall AE profile of eribulin in subjects with hepatic impairment at Baseline was similar to those without hepatic impairment except that subjects with hepatic impairment at Baseline had a slightly higher incidence of deaths (7.4% vs. 4.1%).

There was an approximately 8% increase in peripheral neuropathy (by narrow and broad SMQ) for events of any grade, and around 6% increase in grade 3-4 events, in patients with ALT or AST elevation to &gt; 3 x ULN, or Bilirubin elevation to &gt; 1.5 X ULN (Table 57).

## Renal Impairment

Eribulin is minimally excreted via the kidney. Population PK analyses showed that renal impairment (CrCl) is not expected to significantly influence eribulin exposure. There were no patients with severe renal impairment included in the analysis.  An ongoing study, E7389-A001-106, is being conducted to characterize the PK of eribulin in patients with moderate and severe renal dysfunction.

In the Phase 2/3 trials, renal failure was reported for four eribulin-treated subjects (0.3%) and renal failure acute was reported for three subjects (0.2%).

In general, eribulin-treated subjects with renal impairment had a similar safety profile compared with subjects with normal renal function.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

## Drug-drug interactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No new data were submitted. However, given that eribulin showed inhibition of CYP3A4 in vitro , a PBPK modelling exercise has been performed to predict the effect on CYP3A4 substrates in vivo , which is discussed under Clinical Pharmacology above.

## Drug-disease interactions

Subjects with diabetes are at risk for the development of peripheral neuropathy. Subgroup analysis of adverse reactions in eribulin-treated subjects with and without diabetes showed that diabetic subjects did not experience a significantly higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy per broad SMQ (39.8% vs. 34.9% in subjects with and without diabetes, respectively.

## Post marketing experience

The post-marketing safety is handled in PSURs.

Gastro-intestinal perforation and disseminated intravascular coagulation have recently been added to the RMP as an Important potential risk and an Important identified risk, respectively.

Pancreatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation have been added to the SmPC as a rare event on the basis of spontaneous reports received, for which a relationship to eribulin therapy could not be excluded.

## 2.5.2. Discussion on clinical safety

## Safety populations and Exposure

The safety assessment is based on in total 1503 patients treated in phase 2-3 trials in metastatic/advanced breast cancer. This pooled safety population will be referred to as the Breast Cancer Population (BCP). Of the studies included in the BCP, studies 305, 201 and 211 were assessed at initial market approval; the neuropathy study 209 comparing eribulin and ixabepilone was assessed in FUM 015; the pooled data from studies 221 and 224 are assessed for the first time within the present application, together with the pivotal study 301 (number of eribulin-treated = 544).

The exposure was very similar in the eribulin and capecitabine arms of Study 301. This included e.g. mean and median duration of treatment (169 and 125 days, respectively, for eribulin compared with 173 and 119 days for capecitabine); and a relative dose intensity of 92% and 90%, respectively for eribulin and capecitabine.

## Adverse events

The safety profile of eribulin is improved in the present disease setting, which includes 1 st  (21%) and 2 nd  line (51%) metastatic treatment, compared with the previously known safety profile based on later lines of therapy. Since Studies 305 and 301 were performed largely during the same time period, this difference in safety profile is not likely to be primarily an effect of improved management of patients following an increased experience of the drug, but appears to be chiefly explained by the earlier disease setting in Study 301.

Thus, three treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of special interest, i.e. asthenia/fatigue, peripheral neuropathy and arthralgia/myalgia; were clearly less frequent (7-17% lower) in this disease setting compared with the previously known safety profile (BCP), indicating that patients in earlier disease settings tolerate eribulin treatment better. However, the incidence of peripheral neuropathy is still high, around 21-27% and is considered an important safety problem, particularly since data from Study 209 (assessed in FUM 015) were not informative with regard to resolution of neuropathy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study 301, 8%/10% of patients had peripheral neuropathy by narrow/broad SMQ respectively, that had not resolved within 30 days of last dose. An additional 4% died or started new anti-cancer therapy within 30 days of last dose before neuropathy resolved.  The worst case thus appears to be up to 12% or 14% (by narrow SMQ and broad SMQ, respectively) of eribulin-treated patients in this setting experiencing peripheral neuropathy not resolving within 30 days after last treatment. Peripheral neuropathy is an important identified risk in the RMP.

In this disease setting the safety profiles of eribulin and capecitabine, as described by frequencies of TEAE of any grade, are overall quite comparable (including asthenia /fatigue), with the exception of neutropenia/leukopenia, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhoea/vomiting, alopecia and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE).

## Severe (grade 3-4) adverse events

While overall lower frequencies of TEAEs of any grade were seen for eribulin-treated patients in Study 301 compared with previous studies, the frequencies of grade 3-4 (severe) TEAEs were more consistent compared with the previously known safety profile, although also in this regard lower frequencies were seen in some SOCs.

The differences between eribulin and capecitabine with regard to grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were in line with the known differences in their respective safety profiles, i.e. higher frequencies were seen for eribulin with regard to myelosuppression (46% vs. 5%, % for eribulin vs. capecitabine, respectively) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (3.3% vs. 0.5). In addition, hepatotoxicity grade ≥ 3 was more common with eribulin (1.1% vs. 0.4%), as was ALT increased (3.3 vs. 0.5%), while AST was similar (1.5 vs. 1.1%).

Capecitabine had higher frequencies of grade ≥ 3 diarrhoea (5.3 vs. 1.1%) and PPE (14.5% vs. 0%), as expected. It is noted that the incidence of grade ≥ 3 asthenia and fatigue were similar across arms, and that the difference in grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia was perhaps lower than expected (2.0% vs. 0.9% for eribulin vs. capecitabine, respectively), considering the very large differences in neutropenia.

Based on Broad SMQ, 116 patients (7.7%) in the Phase 2/3 breast cancer population experienced grade 3-4 peripheral neuropathy. 74 of these improved to grade 2 or lower, leaving 42 patients (2.8% of 1503) with remaining grade 3-4 neuropathy.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

The Serious adverse event (SAE) profiles are consistent with the overall safety profiles of the two study drugs in Study 301, with approximately 3% more haematological SAEs in the eribulin group, but 3-2% more gastrointestinal, and nutrition-related (e.g. dehydration) SAEs in the capecitabine arm. It is noted that infections, cardiac disorders and asthenia/fatigue SAEs were similar across arms, numerically slightly more in the capecitabine arm. Two cases of toxic hepatitis SAEs were observed in the eribulin arm.

In Study 301, 26 of the 544 subjects (4.8%) in the eribulin group and 36 of the 546 subjects (6.6%) in the capecitabine group died during the treatment period or within 30 days of last dose of study treatment. In the eribulin arm, 9 deaths were associated with a TEAE (1.7 %), 2 had unknown cause of death, and 15 were attributed to disease progression. In the capecitabine arm, 13 deaths were associated with a TEAE (2.4%), 1 had unknown cause, and 22 were reported as due to disease progression.

Despite the differences in myelosuppressive potential, a TEAE with outcome of death (considered treatment-related) due to pancytopenia was observed in the capecitabine arm, and none in the eribulin arm; and the number of patients with fatal infections was the same in both arms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cardiac disorder TEAEs and Nervous system disorders TEAEs with outcome of death were more common in the capecitabine arm compared with the eribulin arm of Study 301.

Overall, there were no apparent qualitative differences in the TEAEs associated with death, apart perhaps from a case of toxic hepatitis in the eribulin arm.

## AEs causing discontinuation

As seen for other entities of AEs, the frequencies of eribulin-treated patients discontinuing due to AEs generally as well as due to specific AEs are lower in study 301 compared with the previously known safety profile. Similarly, the small differences seen with regard to AEs causing discontinuation between the two treatment arms of Study 301 were in line with the safety profiles of eribulin and capecitabine, respectively. Four hepatobiliary events lead to discontinuation in the eribulin arm, 2 of which were noted as toxicity.

## Laboratory abnormalities

- Myelosuppression

Shifts from CTC toxicity grade 0-1 at Baseline to grade 3-4 during treatment were most frequently recorded for Absolute neutrophil count (ANC). In the BCP, 60% of eribulin-treated subjects had a shift in ANC value from grade 0-1 at Baseline to Grade 3-4 sometime during treatment, compared to 58% of eribulin-treated subjects in Study 301 and 56% in Study 305. Overall, the frequencies of shifts in haematology laboratory tests in Study 301 were consistent with the previously known safety profile (or slightly improved). As before, haemoglobin and platelets rarely reached toxicity grade 3 or 4.

- Liver function tests

Out of 502 patients in the eribulin arm with baseline ALT grade 0 or 1, 104 (21%) had ALT shifts to grade 2 or 3 post baseline, and 37 (7%) had elevations to grade 3 (5-20 x ULN). A majority of these patients had their highest ALT elevation in cycles 1 and 2. Due to the presence of confounding factors (liver metastases, baseline elevated LFTs and/or cholestasis) in virtually all cases, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the relationship between eribulin and these grade 3 ALT elevations.

Liver toxicity grade ≥ 3was reported as a TEAE 1.1% of eribulin-treated patients in Study 301. While 3 patients fulfilled the laboratory criteria for Hy ' s, none of them fulfilled the clinical criteria of absence of other plausible explanation; in these cases in the form of progressing liver metastases or cholestasis.

The pattern of frequent early ALT increases considered of little or no clinical consequence and returning to normal in later cycles is acknowledged. This is sometimes referred to as 'tolerance' and in the absence of bilirubin elevations is believed to have little or no potential for serious toxicity (The Clinical White Paper on DILI).

In the capecitabine arm, a shift to grade 2-4 ALT occurred in 10% of patients with baseline grade 0-1 (n= 500), i.e. clearly less frequently compared with the eribulin arm, while on the other hand treatment-emergent grade 2 bilirubin elevations were much more frequent (25% of patients with baseline grade 0-1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

The safety of eribulin in the pivotal study was not affected by age in an apparent way in the BCP.

Japanese subjects enrolled in Study 221/224 had a very high rate of Grade 3-4 neutropenia (Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 70.4% of subjects), not consistent with the results for any other trial in this submission. The addition of these subjects also affected the analysis of TEAEs by body surface area, otherwise without differences across groups. No biological basis for the high incidence of Grade 3-4 neutropenia in Study 221/224 was found. However, interim results of a post-marketing surveillance study in Japanese patients shows incidences of Grade 3-4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia comparable to that observed in non-Japanese patients, potentially suggesting that the finding in Study 221/224 may not be representative of the clinical reality.

Hepatic impairment increase exposure to eribulin. There was an approximately 8% increase in peripheral neuropathy (by narrow and broad SMQ) for grade 1-2 events, and around 6% increase in grade 3-4 events, in patients with ALT or AST elevation to &gt; 3 x ULN, or Bilirubin elevation to &gt; 1.5 X ULN.

Diabetes is a risk factor for the development of peripheral neuropathy. However There was no increase of neuropathy in diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic patients.

## 2.5.3. Conclusions on clinical safety

In conclusion, the differences seen between eribulin and capecitabine with regard to TEAEs of toxicity grade ≥ 3 are consistent with the known differences in safety profiles and perhaps smaller than expected. It should be kept in mind that the labelled dose of capecitabine was used, which may be higher than optimal for some patients (NCCN).

At end of follow-up, 2.8% of the Phase 2/3 breast cancer population had remaining grade 3-4 neuropathy. Overall, this is not worse than for other tubulin-acting drugs. This was further assessed in Halaven MEA (FUM) 015.2, where the MAH presented data indicating that the peripheral neuropathy caused by eribulin may at least not be worse than that of other frequently used tubulin-acting chemotherapy agents with regard to overall frequency, grade ≥ 3 frequency, and add-on effects on preexisting neuropathy. Furthermore, the MAH will investigate the frequency of resolution and time to resolution in the planned Phase 3 study E7389-A001-303 (ACCRU), including follow-up of neuropathy until death.

## 2.5.4. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

No updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been submitted within this variation procedure.

The MAH states that 'although this submission is for an indication which falls within the meaning of a 'new indication' in Module V, Guideline on Good Pharmacovigilance Practice, there is no significant change in the safety profile of Halaven and a revised Risk Management Plan is therefore not included.

The Summary of Ongoing Safety Concerns from the latest approved version of the RMP (V2.0) is shown below (

| Important missing information | Hepatic Impairment: Eribulin has not been studied in patients with severe impaired hepatic function. Renal impairment: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, renal impairment is not expected to significantly influence eribulin exposure. Eribulin is minimally excreted via the kidney. A renal impairment study has been initiated since the last RMP update at the request of the FDA: E7389-A001-106: An Open-label Phase I study to assess the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of HALAVEN in Subjects With Cancer Who Also Have Impaired Renal Function. It is anticipated that the study will be completed in March 2014. Any new findings will be reported and acted on as applicable. Cardiovascular impairment: Eribulin has not been studied in population with significant cardiovascular impairment and patients with history of congestive heart failure > NYHAGrade II, unstable angina or myocardial infarction within the past six months, or serious cardiac arrhythmia were excluded from the studies. Elderly: The safety of Eribulin (eribulin) in the elderly age group has not been established, although in breast cancer population (studies 201,211 and 305, N=827) 138 patients (16.7%) were ≥ 65 years of age and 17 patients (2.1%) were ≥ 75 years of age. In studies of 1222 patients treated with eribulin across multiple tumor types, 310 patients (25.4%) were ≥ 65 years of age, with 66 patients (5.4%) ≥ 75 years of age. The safety profile of eribulin in elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) was similar to that of patients less than 65 years of age. No dose adjustments are recommended based on the age for elderly patients. Further studies ongoing in indication that will increase safety exposure under monitored circumstances. Male patients: Eribulin has not been studied in male patients with breast cancer but male patients have participated in Eribulin studies for prostate cancer and lung cancer. In clinical trials the adverse event profile of eribulin has been broadly consistent across various tumour types, including breast, prostate and lung cancer, so, while it is not anticipated that the risks from eribulin use in off-label oncology indications would differ significantly from those described previously, it is not possible to comment on tumour types which have not been |

Source: EU RMP version 1.3 with version 2.0 as tracked changes (blue), from RMP procedure RMP018. There are no new important risks identified in the present variation. No new pharmacovigilance activities in addition to those already being performed are considered needed to monitor the safety of the product. Thus, no update of the RMP is required at this point. It is expected, however, that future RMPs will be updated with relevant frequencies of ADRs as appropriate.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.5, 4.8, and 5.1of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template.

No user consultation has been submitted with this variation, which is considered acceptable.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were both primary endpoints; none of them achieved statistically significant differences between study arms. Median OS was 15.9 vs. 14.5 months in the eribulin and capecitabine arms, respectively HR 0.879 (95% CI: 0.770, 1.003). The PFS analyses according to independent review (IRC) and investigator assessments (INV) generated very similar results. The HRs for PFS were 1.079 (95% CI: 0.932, 1.250) and 0.977 (95% CI: 0.857, 1.114), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in objective response rates (ORR) between arms. The global QoL scores showed no meaningful changes during study, or differences between the eribulin and capecitabine arms. The QoL scores for the separate items were reflective of the two agents' respective ADR profiles.

The subgroup with 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease (sought indication) had a HR consistent with the overall results, i.e. OS HR 0.84 (95% CI: 0.698, 1.010), and 49 days' (approximately 1.6 month) median difference in OS favouring eribulin. The PFS results of this subgroup were also consistent with the overall PFS results.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The discrepancy between OS and PFS results are problematic since potentially suggesting that factors other than the study treatments could be affecting the OS results. The MAH has provided a large number of analyses investigating this issue. No factor has been identified that would imply overestimation of the treatment effect associated with eribulin (see discussion on clinical efficacy).

Information on the efficacy of the combination of eribulin and HER2-targeted therapy is currently not included in the SmPC, since no such data have been submitted.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The overall safety profile of eribulin was better in the present disease setting, which includes 1st (21%) and 2nd line (51%) metastatic treatment, compared with the previously known safety profile based on later lines of therapy. However, the incidence of peripheral neuropathy was still high, around 21-27%and is considered as an identified risk in the RMP.

Furthermore, in this disease setting the safety profiles of eribulin and capecitabine, as described by frequencies of TEAE of any grade, were overall quite comparable (including asthenia /fatigue), with the expected exceptions of neutropenia/leukopenia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia (more frequent for eribulin); and diarrhoea/vomiting and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE) (more frequent for capecitabine).

Grade ≥ 3 ( ' severe ' ) TEAEs frequencies were also mostly similar across study arms. Higher frequencies were seen for eribulin with regard to myelosuppression (46% vs. 5%, % for eribulin vs. capecitabine, respectively) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (3.3% vs. 0.5). In addition, hepatotoxicity grade ≥ 3 was more common with eribulin (1.1% vs. 0.4%). Capecitabine had higher frequencies of grade ≥ 3 diarrhoea (5.3 vs. 1.1%) and PPE (14.5% vs. 0%), as expected. It is noted that the incidence of grade ≥ 3 asthenia and fatigue were similar across arms, and that the difference in grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia was perhaps lower than expected (2.0% vs. 0.9% for eribulin vs. capecitabine, respectively), considering the very large differences in neutropenia. Thus, the differences seen between eribulin and capecitabine with regard to TEAEs of toxicity grade ≥ 3 are consistent with the known differences in safety profiles and perhaps smaller than expected.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

There remains a clear lack of information concerning long-term persistence and resolution of eribulininduced peripheral neuropathy. In Study 301, the worst case scenario appears to include up to 12% or 14% of eribulin-treated patients in this setting experiencing peripheral neuropathy (by narrow and broad SMQ, respectively) that did not resolve within 30 days after last treatment. Based on the phase 2/3 breast cancer population, 7.7% of patients experienced grade 3-4 peripheral neuropathy (by broad SMQ), and in 2.8% grade 3-4 neuropathy did not improve. The long-term resolution of peripheral neuropathy will be further addressed in a planned phase 3 study (E7389-A001-303, ACCRU) which has been included in the version of the RMP being assessed in the context of PSUV0018.

Information on the safety of the combination of eribulin and HER2-targeted therapy is currently not included in the SmPC, since no such data have been submitted.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Based on the presented data no statistically significant difference in efficacy has been shown for eribulin compared with capecitabine. Given the investigator-based PFS HR at 0.98 with a narrow 95% confidence interval (0.86, 1.11), a clinically relevant difference can be excluded.

The main ADRs affecting large proportions of eribulin-treated patients are neutropenia and neuropathy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Neutropenia is not necessarily considered a major clinical problem, however, since routinely manageable with G-CSF. Peripheral neuropathy, on the other hand, if advanced is a debilitating condition affecting the daily life of patients. With earlier lines of therapy, the importance of persisting peripheral neuropathy after discontinuation of eribulin therapy naturally increases. Based on available data it appears that less than 3% have persisting grade 3-4 peripheral neuropathy, which is not considered unacceptable given the benefits.

## Benefit-risk balance

Superiority was not demonstrated, and non-inferiority was not planned for. However, a clinically relevant difference in OS and PFS can be excluded.

There is a clear value in having two treatment options with different safety profiles, but similar tolerability. Taken together, the B/R for eribulin in the sought indication is positive.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

A clinically relevant difference in terms of efficacy, however, between eribulin and capecitabine can be excluded based on a PFS HR 0.98 and narrow confidence intervals. Estimations, for the purpose of this discussion, based on the upper 95% confidence limits of the HR and the median PFS of the capecitabine arm suggests a small risk of eribulin having up to 2 weeks poorer PFS compared with capecitabine, based on investigator assessment. PFS differences of around 1-1.5 months are generally not considered to be of clinical relevance in the context of approval of oncology products; in line with this, the present uncertainty is accepted.
