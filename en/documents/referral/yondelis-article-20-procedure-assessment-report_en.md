## 1. Information on the procedure

Yondelis is an anti-cancer medicinal product with two indications:

1. treatment of patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma , after failure of anthracyclines and ifosfamide, or who are unsuited to receive these agents;

2. in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), Yondelis is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer .

After the indication in ovarian cancer was authorised in the EU, trial OVC-3006 was started. It was a randomised, open-label, multicentre phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of trabectedin in combination with PLD in patients with advanced, relapsed ovarian cancer who had received two previous lines of platinum-based chemotherapy, compared to PLD alone and with overall survival (OS) as primary endpoint.

Following a review of results of a second interim analysis for futility, the Independent data Monitoring Committee recommended discontinuation of the study due to lack of survival superiority in the trabectedin in combination with PLD arm over PLD alone arm. The study failed to achieve both the primary endpoint of OS and the secondary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS).

On 21 February 2020 the European Commission therefore triggered a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and requested the CHMP to assess study 3006 and its impact on the benefit-risk balance of Yondelis and to issue a recommendation on whether the relevant marketing authorisations should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Yondelis (trabectedin) is a tris tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid originally isolated from the marine ascidian Ecteinascidia turbinata. It exerts its action by binding to the N2 position of guanine in the minor groove of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), unlike other DNA-binding agents that bind to the major groove. In contrast to other DNA-binding cytotoxic agents, which are either equally or more effective in cells containing defects of the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, trabectedin is more effective in cells with an intact NER pathway. Additionally, trabectedin has been proposed to have unique modulatory effects on the tumours microenvironment that has been attributed to its effect on tumour-associated macrophages and histiocytes.

The marketing authorisation for Yondelis was first issued on 17 September 2007 for the soft tissue sarcoma indication. The ovarian cancer indication was authorised in 2009 based mainly on study OVA301, a randomised, open-label, multicentre phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trabectedin in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in 645 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer. The trial showed superiority of trabectedin with PLD compared to PLD alone in terms of progression-free survival (PFS, primary endpoint): 21% risk reduction for disease progression (HR=0.79, CI: 0.65-0.96, p=0.02)-. Also, overall response rates were higher with trabectedin combined with PLD (27.6% vs. 18.8% with PLD alone). Results for overall survival were compatible with a risk reduction for death with a 95% CI 0.72-1.02, but without significance. On the basis of this study, the following indication was granted: 'Yondelis in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer'.

No additional studies on the ovarian cancer indication were requested of the MAH.

## · Treatments

During the treatment phase, subjects were to receive study drug by IV infusion on

- -Arm A: Day 1 of a 21-day cycle (DOXIL 30 mg/m 2  administered over approximately 90 minutes [q3wk;  90-min],  followed  by trabectedin 1.1  mg/m 2   administered  over  approximately  3h [q3wk; 3-h], via central venous access) Subjects assigned to Arm A were pretreated with 20 mg of  dexamethasone IV, or an equivalent IV corticosteroid, approximately 30 minutes prior to initiation  of  infusion  of  DOXIL  on  Day  1  of  each  treatment  cycle,  to  reduce  the  incidence  of transaminase elevations related to trabectedin
- -Arm B: Day 1 of a 28-day cycle (DOXIL 50 mg/m 2  over approximately 90 minutes per package insert [q4wk; 90-min]).

Treatment was to be continued until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable treatment toxicity, or until 2 cycles after assessment of a complete response (CR).

## · Objectives

## Primary Objective

The primary objective was to compare the OS after treatment with trabectedin+DOXIL combination therapy to that observed after treatment with DOXIL monotherapy for subjects with advanced-relapsed epithelial  ovarian,  primary  peritoneal,  or  fallopian  tube  cancer  who  had  received  2  previous  lines  of platinum-based chemotherapy.

## Secondary Objectives

The secondary objectives were:

- To evaluate PFS.
- To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR).
- To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of trabectedin using a sparse sampling scheme in the trabectedin+DOXIL treatment group.
- To evaluate the safety of the trabectedin+DOXIL combination therapy and DOXIL monotherapy.

## Exploratory Objectives

- To conduct pharmacogenomic evaluations of OS, PFS and other endpoints in subjects with and without mutations in BRCA 1 or BRCA 2.
- To evaluate patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Hypothesis: Trabectedin in combination with DOXIL will improve OS compared with DOXIL monotherapy in the treatment of subjects with platinum-sensitive advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who received 2 previous lines of platinum-based chemotherapy.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoint: OS

The primary efficacy endpoint was OS, defined as the time between randomization and death from any cause. Secondary endpoints were PFS (defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of disease progression or death), and ORR (defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR or partial response [PR]). The analysis of the primary endpoint, OS, was to be conducted after at least 514 events (deaths) were observed or up to the clinical cutoff date.

Secondary endpoints:

- PFS
- ORR
- PK
- Safety

Secondary efficacy endpoints of PFS and ORR were to be assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, Version 1.1). Scheduled assessments of disease status were planned to be performed within 30 days before randomization, every 8 weeks (±5 days) after randomization for the first  4  assessments, and then every 12 weeks (±5 days) thereafter. Disease assessments, including assessments for subjects who discontinued treatment for reasons other than disease progression, were to  be  performed  until  disease  progression  was  radiographically  confirmed,  the  start  of  subsequent anticancer therapy, withdrawal of subject consent, or the clinical cutoff date (18 January 2018). For subjects who discontinued study treatment, documentation of all subsequent anticancer therapy, survival status, and safety evaluations as outlined in the Time and Events Schedule of the protocol (Appendix 1) was required. Survival status was recorded at least every 8 weeks for the first 2 years after the treatment termination visit and approximately every 12 weeks thereafter. Clearly defined primary and secondary outcome measures and, when applicable, any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements (e.g., multiple observations, training of assessors, central/independent reviews).

## · Sample size

It was assumed that OS would follow an exponential distribution with a constant hazard rate. Assuming a median OS of 16 months for the active control group (DOXIL monotherapy), a planned sample size of approximately 670 subjects was expected to provide 80% power to detect a HR of 0.78 (16 months vs. 20.5 months, corresponding to a 28% improvement in median OS) at a 2-tailed significance level of 0.05 and an enrollment duration of approximately 52 months (13 subjects/month enrollment) over a total study duration of 64 months to obtain the required 514 events. The OS endpoint incorporated group sequential  design  by  including  1  interim  analysis  and  1  final  analysis  using  the  O'Brien-Fleming boundaries as implemented by Lan-DeMets α -spending method.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Randomisation

At randomization, subjects were stratified by 4 criteria:

- 1) the time from the last dose of first-line platinum therapy to disease progression (6 months to 12 months vs. &gt;12 months to 24 months vs. &gt;24 months),
- 2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score (0 vs. 1),
- 3) BRCA 1/2 status (mutation vs. no mutation), and
- 4) prior DOXIL therapy (no vs. yes).

Subjects were then randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the trabectedin+DOXIL combination therapy arm (Arm A) or to the DOXIL monotherapy arm (Arm B).

## · Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study.

## · Statistical methods

## Statistical Hypotheses for Trial Objectives

Overall survival was compared between treatment arms using an unstratified one-sided log-rank test. The trabectedin+DOXIL combination therapy was to be declared better than DOXIL monotherapy if the OS was better with a p-value less than or equal to the significance level as specified by the α -spending function. The overall 2-tailed significance level of 0.05 was to be spread over 1 interim efficacy and 1 final OS analyses, when approximately 308 and 514 death events were to be seen. Operating characteristics for these boundaries are presented in the following table.

Table 1 Study 3006 - Stopping Boundaries for Overall Survival (Study ET743-OVC-3006)

## Interim Futility Analysis

A non-binding futility analysis for OS was implemented after observing 33% (170 events) of the total number of required 514 events per request by the IDMC. The study was to be considered futile if the estimated HR from the Cox proportional-hazard model was equal to or greater than 0.95. After the futility analysis at 33% of the total number of OS events, on 26 June 2017, the IDMC requested one more futility analysis at 45% (232 events) of the total number of required 514 death events. The study was to be considered futile if the estimated HR from Cox proportional-hazard model was equal to or greater than 0.93. The second futility analysis was conducted, and the results were reviewed by the IDMC on 15 December 2017, wherein the HR for OS was 0.962, crossing the previously agreed upon threshold for futility of 0.93. The IDMC recommended discontinuing the study due to (1) futility of the primary analysis on OS and (2) excessive risk based on imbalance of adverse events not in favour of Yondelis+PLD.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Interim Efficacy Analysis

The interim efficacy analysis was planned for this study after observing 60% (308 events) of the total number of required (514) events. Following the review of the study data by the IDMC in the second futility analysis, the IDMC recommended discontinuing the study. The planned interim analysis was, therefore, not performed.

## Efficacy

## Primary Endpoint

OS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death. Subjects who die, regardless of the cause of death, were to be considered to have had an event. Subjects who were still being treated, who were lost to follow-up prior to the end of the study, or who had withdrawn consent from the study were to be censored at the last available date where the subject was known to be alive.

Overall survival was compared between both treatment arms by the unstratified, 2-sided, log-rank test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distribution of functions of OS for each treatment arm. The number of events, subjects censored, the estimate of medians and 95% CI for the medians were to be presented. Six-month and 1-year survival rates were to be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Unstratified log-rank test was to be used as the primary analysis for treatment comparison Unstratified Cox proportional hazards model was used to obtain the HR and 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint using the stratified log-rank test were to be performed.

## Secondary Endpoints

Progression-free survival was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of disease progression or death. Subjects who progressed or died were to be considered to have had an event, except if the event occurred after the start of subsequent therapy for ovarian cancer, in which case the subject was to be censored at the time of the last tumour assessment (prior to or on the first day of the first subsequent therapy for ovarian cancer). Subjects who did not progress or die (i.e., lost to follow-up, or receiving treatment without documented disease progression, or started subsequent therapy for ovarian cancer and still alive) were to be censored at the date of the last tumour assessment (prior to or on the first day of the first subsequent therapy for ovarian cancer). Progression-free survival was compared between both treatment arms using the unstratified log-rank test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distribution function of PFS for each treatment arm. The number of events, subjects censored, the estimate of medians and 95% CIs were to be presented. Six-month and 1-year progression-free rates were to be calculated using the KaplanMeier product limit method. The unstratified Cox proportional hazards model was used to obtain the HR and it's 95% CI. Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint using the stratified log-rank test were to be performed.

The best overall response was to be summarized per treatment arm in a frequency table with categories: CR, PR, stable disease, progressive disease (PD), and not evaluable (NE). The response rate was evaluated using the Fisher's exact test.

In case an imbalance in baseline prognostic factors was observed for OS or PFS, especially PFI, a Cox proportional hazards model will also be used to compare the 2 treatment arms. The following baseline information was to include covariates: baseline ECOG (0 vs. 1), PFI (as continuous), BRCA 1/2 status (mutation vs. no mutation), prior DOXIL therapy (no vs. yes), and any imbalanced factors. From the Cox proportional hazards regression, HRs and 95% CIs were to be estimated for treatment and for the prognostic factors.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subgroup analyses were to be carried out to assess if the treatment effect was consistent across clinically relevant subgroups. The planned subgroup analysis included analysis by age (&lt;65, ≥ 65), PFI (6 to 12 months vs. &gt;12 to 24 months vs. &gt;24 months), ECOG performance status score (0 vs. 1), BRCA 1/2 status (mutation vs. no mutation) and prior DOXIL therapy (no vs. yes).

## Symmetry Analysis of Tumour Assessment Schedules

Tumour assessments were to be performed every 8 weeks. Timing of assessments in both treatment groups was to be presented side by side with boxplots.

## 2.2.1.2. Results

## · Participant flow

576 subjects were randomized, 289 subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 287 subjects in the DOXIL arm. Eight subjects did not receive study drug (3 subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 5 subjects in the DOXIL monotherapy arm) due to worsening of health status (5 subjects) or withdrawal of subject consent (3 subjects). The remaining 568 subjects received at least 1 dose of study medication (286 subjects received trabectedin+DOXIL and 282 received DOXIL alone (Table 2).

Disease progression was the most common reason (46.5% of subjects) for the permanent discontinuation of study treatment regardless of treatment arm. Other reasons for the discontinuation of study treatment included AEs (17.4%), withdrawal of consent (15.3%), physician decision (5.8%), CR (2.8%), and death (1.2%). The incidence of discontinuation due to disease progression was lower in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm (39.2%) compared with the DOXIL monotherapy arm (53.9%). Incidences of discontinuation due to AEs and CRs were higher in the in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm (24.1% and 3.8%, respectively) than in the DOXIL monotherapy arm (10.6% and 1.8%, respectively) (Table 3).

27 (9.4%) subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL combination therapy arm and 35 (12.4%) subjects in the DOXIL monotherapy arm discontinued study treatment due to 'Other'; the predominant reason was study termination.

## · Recruitment

Study Period: 04 October 2013 to 18 January 2018

Study Centres: United States (59 sites); Russian Federation (21 sites); Australia (8 sites); Israel (8 sites); United Kingdom (7 sites); China (5 sites); South Africa (4 sites); New Zealand (2 sites); Poland (2 sites); Switzerland (1 sites). Subjects were enrolled at 117 sites.

## · Conduct of the study

## Changes to Planned Analyses

Patient reported outcome analysis were not performed due to the lack of efficacy per the futility.

## Changes in Conduct

There were 6 amendments to the original protocol dated 19 December 2012. The following key changes were identified in each amendment:

- The  first  amendment  (25  March  2013)  clearly  identified  the  selected  subject  population. Specifically, progression of disease had to occur ≥9 months from the first dose in subjects treated with DOXIL-containing regimen as a second-line therapy.
- The second amendment (29 August 2013) extended the use of contraceptives from 3 months to 6 months after the last dose of study drug, changed the creatinine clearance rate from ≥40 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m 2   as  a  part of subject inclusion criteria, and added a prohibition regarding subjects receiving a yellow fever vaccine.
- The third amendment (26 August 2015) added to and revised study inclusion and exclusion criteria  to  allow  greater  flexibility  in  demonstrating  eligibility  based  on  response  to  previous therapy.
- The fourth  amendment (17 December 2015) enhanced cardiac-safety monitoring. Additional LVEF evaluations were scheduled at pre-specified times throughout the treatment period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The fifth amendment (18 March 2016) was initiated to clarify the timing of LVEF assessments for subjects experiencing a significant decline in LVEF including assessments during the followup period.
- The sixth amendment (09 January 2018) was initiated in response to an IDMC recommendation to discontinue the study based on the results of a futility analysis of OS, in which the pre-specified futility threshold was crossed.

Note: Following Protocol Amendment 6, study data collection for adverse events (AEs) (except for serious adverse  events  [SAEs]), laboratory tests, cardiovascular monitoring, vital signs, and  physical examinations were to cease when subjects on study treatment completed the treatment termination visit assessments as specified in the Time and Events Schedule of the protocol  or by 18 January 2018, whichever occurred first. For subjects who continued treatment with single-agent DOXIL, as per the local standard of care, only SAEs were reported to the sponsor.

## Protocol deviations

Forty (13.8%) subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 22 (7.7%) subjects in the DOXIL monotherapy arm had a major protocol deviation. Twelve (2.1%) subjects were not withdrawn from study per protocol specified criteria and 7 (1.2%) subjects each did not meet protocol inclusion or exclusion criteria or received the wrong treatment (including the incorrect rate of infusion or the incorrect dose) (Table 4). Forty-four (7.6%) subjects had 'Other' as the reported protocol deviation, and the deviations were largely related to endpoint assessments.

Three (0.5%) subjects met criteria for protocol violations. In the trabectedin+DOXIL arm, 2 (0.7%) subjects had inclusion criteria violations (i.e., did not meet predefined protocol limits for screening hematologic or liver function test results) and 1 of these subjects also had an exclusion criterion violation (i.e., the subject received an excluded therapy within 3 weeks of the first study treatment). In the DOXIL arm, 1 (0.2%) subject had an inclusion criteria violation (i.e., informed consent was not signed prior to the optional pharmacogenomic blood sample collection) (Table 5).

## · Numbers analysed

All efficacy analyses were based on the All Randomized Analysis set, defined as all subjects who were randomized to study treatment independent of whether they received study drug.

## · Outcomes and estimation

## Primary Efficacy Analysis - Overall Survival

## Unstratified Analysis

The unstratified final analysis of OS was conducted at the 18 January 2018 cut-off. At that time, there were 266 deaths in the study; 134 (46.4%) subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 132 (46.0%) subjects in the DOXIL monotherapy arm. The median OS for the trabectedin+DOXIL arm was 23.82 months and 22.21 months for the DOXIL arm.

The HR was 0.925 (95% CI: 0.727, 1.177; p=0.5236) (Table 9), indicating no significant difference in OS between treatment arms. The Kaplan-Meier curve for OS is presented in Figure 2.

## Stratified Analysis

Table 10 presents an analysis of OS stratified by the time from the last dose of first-line platinum therapy to disease progression, ECOG performance status score, BRCA 1/2 mutation status, and prior DOXIL therapy (the pre-specified stratification factors). The stratification analysis is consistent with the unstratified analysis of OS.

## Symmetry of Tumour Assessments

Tumour assessments for the first 4 evaluations were conducted every 8 weeks after randomization and then every 12 weeks until disease progression, the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, withdrawal of subject consent, or the clinical cut-off date. Figure 14 shows the first 12 tumour assessments. The timing of assessments for both treatment groups was consistent with the schedule specified in the protocol.

## Best Overall Response

CR and PR rates were higher in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm as compared with the DOXIL monotherapy arm. Stable disease and progressive disease occurred at slightly higher rates in the DOXIL arm (36.2% and 19.5%, respectively) compared with the trabectedin+DOXIL arm (30.4% and 13.1%, respectively) (Table 14).

## OS - Subgroup Analyses

Table 15 provides a summary of OS analysed by stratification factors and combinations of stratification factors. A forest plot is also provided in Figure 5. A summary of findings is provided below.

- -Subjects with a BRCA 1/2 mutation who received trabectedin+DOXIL had a 45.8% reduction in the risk of death as compared with subjects who received DOXIL monotherapy (HR=0.542; 95% CI: 0.327, 0.901). The median OS was 34.2 months in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 20.9 months in the DOXIL arm.
- -Subjects with a PFI of 6 months to 12 months who received trabectedin+DOXIL exhibited a trend towards a reduced risk of death as compared with the DOXIL monotherapy arm (30.6% reduction in the risk of death [HR=0.694; 95% CI: 0.476, 1.012]). The median OS was 24.8 months for the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 17.4 months for the DOXIL arm.
- -Subjects with a BRCA 1/2 mutation and a PFI of 6 months to 12 months who received trabectedin+DOXIL had a 62.6% reduction in the risk of death as compared with subjects who received DOXIL monotherapy (HR=0.374; 95% CI: 0.171, 0.819). The median OS was 31.5 months in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 14.9 months in the DOXIL arm.
- -Subjects with a BRCA 1/2 mutation or a PFI of 6 months to 12 months who received trabectedin+DOXIL had a 30.0% reduction in the risk of death as compared with subjects who received DOXIL monotherapy (HR=0.700; 95% CI: 0.504, 0.972). The median OS was 27.0 months in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 19.4 months in the DOXIL arm.

Figure 5 Forest Plot of Overall Survival by Subgroup; All Randomized Subjects (Study ET743-OVC-3006)

Table 16 provides a summary of the multivariate analysis of OS by randomization stratification factors to assess potential prognostic effects. The HR for the treatment effect after adjustment for prespecified potential prognostic factors was 0.949 (95% CI: 0.744, 1.210). Prognostic factors that influenced OS independent of treatment effect were BRCA 1/2 mutation status, ECOG performance status score, and PFI. Survival outcomes showed improvement for subjects with a BRCA 1/2 mutation (versus no mutation), ECOG performance status score of 0 (versus 1), and PFI &gt;12 months (versus 6 to 12 months).

## PFS - Subgroup Analyses

Table 17 provides a summary of PFS analysed by stratification factors and combinations of stratification factors. A forest plot is also provided in Figure 6. A summary of findings is provided below.

- -Subjects with a BRCA 1/2 mutation who received trabectedin+DOXIL had a 27.8% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death as compared with subjects who received DOXIL monotherapy (HR=0.722; 95% CI: 0.484, 1.078). The median PFS was 10.1 months in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 7.6 months in the DOXIL arm.
- -Subjects with a PFI of 6 months to 12 months who received trabectedin+DOXIL had a 28.5% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death as compared with the DOXIL monotherapy arm (HR=0.715; 95% CI: 0.519, 0.986). The median PFS was 7.5 months for the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 5.5 months for the DOXIL arm.
- -Subjects with a BRCA 1/2 mutation and a PFI of 6 months to 12 months who received trabectedin+DOXIL had a 52.8% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death as compared with subjects who received DOXIL monotherapy (HR=0.472; 95% CI: 0.255, 0.875). The median PFS was 10.1 months in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 6.1 months in the DOXIL arm.
- -Subjects with a BRCA 1/2 mutation or a PFI of 6 months to 12 months who received trabectedin+DOXIL had a 22.6% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death as compared with subjects who received DOXIL monotherapy (HR=0.774; 95% CI: 0.588, 1.018). The median PFS was 8.8 months in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 7.1 months in the DOXIL arm.

Table 18 provides a summary of the multivariate analysis of PFS by randomization stratification factors to assess potential prognostic effects. The HR for the treatment effect after adjustment for prespecified potential prognostic factors was 0.927 (95% CI: 0.755, 1.139). Prognostic factors that influenced PFS independent of treatment effect were BRCA 1/2 mutation status and PFI.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.2. Discussion on efficacy

Study 3006 was a phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study that compared the efficacy and safety of trabectedin+DOXIL in women with recurrent ovarian cancer after failure of second-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

The study included women with advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, ECOG 0-1. The primary objective of the study was to compare the OS after treatment with trabectedin+doxorubicin vs doxorubicin monotherapy.  Secondary objectives were PFS, ORR, PK and safety.

The study sponsor assumed that 670 patients would be needed to provide 80% power to show a HR = 0.78 at alpha =5%. Patients were randomized 1:1 using four clinically meaningful stratification factors: 1) the time from the last dose of first-line platinum therapy to disease progression (6 months to 12 months vs. &gt;12 months to 24 months vs. &gt;24 months), 2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status grade (0 vs. 1), 3) BRCA 1/2 status (mutation vs. no mutation), and 4) prior DOXIL therapy (no vs. yes).

Overall, the baseline demographic and disease characteristics are well-balanced. The majority of the patients were white, relatively young women (&lt;65 years), mean age of 60-61. The majority had papillary/serous histology, and locally advanced disease (pelvis and abdomen), and had prior surgery. About 27% of the patients had BRAC 1/2 mutated disease. Only a minority had received prior doxorubicin.

It should be noted that study participants were required to be platinum sensitive (PFI ≥ 6 month s) following their first platinum-containing regimen and have a complete or partial response to a second line platinum-based chemotherapy (without PFI restrictions), meaning that these patients could be either platinumsensitive (PFI ≥ 6 months) or platinu m-resistant (PFI &lt; 6 months) following their second platinum-containing regimen. A post hoc analysis determined that 42% of enrolled subjects were platinum-resistant (PFI &lt; 6 months) following their last platinum-containing regimen.

The study sponsor conducted, at the request of the IDMC, one non-binding unplanned interim futility analyses for OS after 170 events corresponding to 33% of event. The IDMC requested an additional futility analysis at 45% of events. This analysis showed a HR=0.962, which crossed the pre-specified boundary for futility of 0.93. The study was subsequently discontinued. The stratified analysis of OS of all randomized patients showed a HR=0.942 (0.739, 1.202), p=0.9629. PFS showed a HR=0.934 (0.760, 1.146), p=0.3545.

The study had an exploratory endpoint; OS as function of BRCA 1/2 mutation. The results of this analysis showed that OS was statistically significantly prolonged, HR=0.542 (0.327, 0.901), p=0.0165. Furthermore, subgroup analyses showed that patients who had a platinum-free interval (PFI) of 612 months from last dose of first-line therapy had a HR=0.69 (0.48, 1.01). However, considering that the study failed to achieve its primary endpoint and that these were exploratory endpoints not adjusted for multiplicity, no conclusions can be drawn from these findings.

Overall the observed data cannot be used for testing the statistical hypothesis related to the hypothesis in the study protocol (i.e. Yondelis + PLD will improve OS compared with PLD monotherapy in the treatment of subjects with platinum-sensitive advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who received 2 previous lines of platinum-based chemotherapy). Furthermore, the data are deemed to lack the strength and level of evidence that would have been obtained had the study been completed as planned.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In light of the above, data from Study 3006 do not permit to conclude on the effects of Yondelis + PLD in third line platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.

## 2.2.3. Data on safety

Summaries of TEAEs and other safety data are based on 576 subjects (289 in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm  and  287  in  the  DOXIL  arm)  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug  (i.e.,  the  all-treated population).

## 2.2.3.4. Laboratory findings

During the study, 194 (68.3%) subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm and 112 (39.9%) subjects in the DOXIL arm developed Grade 3-4 hematological laboratory values during the study. The most common Grade 3-4 hematological laboratory abnormalities were neutrophil count abnormalities and white blood cell  (WBC)  count  abnormalities.  Across  all  hematologic  parameters  (hemoglobin  levels,  neutrophil counts, platelet counts, and WBC counts) Grade 3-4 abnormalities occurred at higher incidences (&gt;5% difference) in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm compared to the DOXIL monotherapy arm.

More  subjects  in  the  trabectedin+DOXIL  arm  (169  subjects  [59.5%])  reported  with  a  Grade  3-4 chemistry  laboratory  abnormality  compared  with  the  DOXIL  arm  (50  subjects  [17.8%]).  This  was primarily due to an increased number of subjects in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm that were reported with Grade 3 laboratory values for ALT (45.1%) and AST (12.3%). Generally, there was a higher frequency grade shifts to Grade 3 or 4 in the trabectedin+DOXIL arm compared with the DOXIL arm. The most common laboratory tests demonstrating this were neutrophil count, platelet count, ALT, and AST.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on safety

The combination of  trabectidin+doxorubicin  is  already  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. Thus, the safety profile of trabectedin is already well-known, but mainly based on patients in first relapse (study 301). The population studied in study 3006 have 2 relapses and thus is more pre-treated.

Common AEs were related to the GI tract (nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, liver  toxicity,  etc.),  general  disorders  (fatigue,  pyrexia,  asthenia,  etc.),  blood  and  lymphatic  system disorder  (neutropenia,  anaemia,  thrombocytopenia,  leukopenia,  etc.),  skin  reactions  (palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, alopecia, etc.), metabolism and nutrition disorder (decreased appetite), respiratory (dyspnoea, cough, oropharyngeal pain, etc), infections, hypertension.

Approximately 85% of patients in the trabectedin+doxorubicin experienced a Grade 3-4 AE compared to 63.8% in the control arm. The greatest difference is seen in terms of Grade 4 AEs, 44.1% vs. 10.3%. Looking at SOCs a clear difference is seen in 'blood and lymphatic system disorder', 56.6% vs 27.7%, and  'investigations'  (neutropenia,  leukopenia,  thrombocytopenia,  etc.)  51.7%  vs.  10.6%.  Other differences, however, to a lesser extent were also seen in terms of metabolism, respiratory, and vascular Grade 3-4 AEs in favour of the doxorubicin monotherapy arm.

There were significantly fewer Grade 3-4 AEs in terms of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders in the trabectedin+doxorubicin  arm  compared  to  doxorubicin  alone,  3.8%  vs.  14.5%,  which  is  somewhat puzzling, because trabectedin is add-on to doxorubicin.

With regards to deaths, there was a slight increase in 'death within 60 days of initiation of study drug' in the trabectedin+doxorubicin arm, 2.4% vs. 1.4%, and in 'death within 30 days from the last dose', 3.5%  vs.  2.1%.  AEs  leading  to  death  was  10  (3.5%)  vs.  5  (1.8%)  in  favour  of  the  doxorubicin monotherapy arm.

A doubling of SAEs is seen in the trabectedin+doxorubicin arm, 41.3% vs 20.6%. A similar pattern as with Grade 3-4 AEs is also observed.

Patients in the trabectedin+doxorubicin arm discontinued to a higher degree compared with the control arm, 93 (32.5%) vs. 46 (16.3%). The main reason being 'investigations' (ALT/AST increase, etc.) and 'blood and lymphatic disorders' (anaemia, neutropenia, leukopenia).

As expected, dose-reductions had to be made in half of the patients in the trabectedin+doxorubicin arm compared to one third in the control arm, 152 (53.1%) vs. 103 (36.5%). Main reason for dose-reductions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, ALT/AST increase, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, palmar-plantar erythordysaesthesia syndrome, etc.

Overall, the safety profile appears worsened in the third line setting compared to the second line setting based on the observed differences between the combination arm and the control arm in terms of rates of SAEs, Grade 3-4 AEs, AEs leading to dose reductions and AEs leading to discontinuations. This is not unexpected when comparing a combination treatment with monotherapy in more heavily pretreated patients.  Overall  the  safety  profile  of  the  combination  of  trabectedin  and  PLD  in  this  study  appears consistent with the already known safety profile for this combination.

The CHMP noted and endorsed the PRAC request in EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00003001/201909 for the MAH to submit a variation to update section 4.8 of the SmPC with pooled data from the ovarian cancer phase 3 clinical studies.

## 3. Benefit-risk balance

Yondelis in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Yondelis + PLD) is indicated for the treatment of patient relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. Study ET743-OVA-301 (Study 301), a randomised phase 3 study of 672 patients who received either trabectedin (1.1 mg/m 2 ) and PLD (30 mg/m 2 ) every 3 weeks or PLD (50 mg/m 2 ) every 4 weeks, was the basis for this approval. In this study, patients had been previously treated for ovarian carcinoma (80% previously received taxanes) but had only 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and had experienced either recurrence or progression after more than 6 months from the beginning (first dose) of the platinum-based chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. The study included patients with platinum-resistant disease (platinum-free interval from the end of platinum treatment less than 6 months) and patients with platinum-sensitive disease (platinumfree interval from the end of platinum treatment ≥6 months) who were not expected to benefit from or who were ineligible for or who were not willing to receive retreatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was PFS and patients were stratified based on platinum sensitive vs. platinum resistant.

Subsequently Janssen conducted study ET743-OVC-3006 (Study 3006). No EU scientific advice had been sought for study 3006. This study was a phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trabectedin+PLD as a third-line chemotherapy in subjects with advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Study participants were required to be platinum sensitive (PFI ≥ 6 months) following their first platinum -containing regimen and have a complete or partial response to a second line platinum-based chemotherapy (without PFI restrictions) meaning that these patients could be either platinum-sensitive (PFI ≥ 6 months) or platinum -resistant (PFI &lt; 6 months) following their second platinum-containing regimen. Women were allocated randomly 1:1 to Yondelis + PLD or PLD alone with randomization stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs 1), PFI following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (6 to 12 months, &gt;12 to 24 months, &gt;24 months), BRCA1/2 germline status (mutation vs. no mutation), and use of prior PLD (yes vs. no). The primary objective of the study was to compare OS after treatment with Yondelis + PLD vs. PLD monotherapy.  Secondary objectives were PFS, ORR, PK and safety. One nonbinding interim futility analysis for OS was conducted after 170 events corresponding to 33% of the pre-specified number of events required for the final analysis (514 events). Following the data review at this first interim analysis, the IDMC requested an additional futility analysis at 45% of events (232 events); this analysis was not planned in the protocol. It showed a HR=0.96 for OS, which crossed the boundary of 0.93 for futility of the study to show that Yondelis + PLD would improve OS compared with PLD monotherapy. The study was subsequently discontinued after the IDMC concluded to recommend discontinuation of the trial for 2 main reasons: a) futility of the primary analysis (OS) and b) excessive risk based on imbalance of AE not in favour of the experimental regimen arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The observed data cannot be used for testing the statistical hypothesis related to the hypothesis in the study protocol (i.e. Yondelis + PLD will improve OS compared with PLD monotherapy in the treatment of subjects with platinum-sensitive advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who received 2 previous lines of platinum-based chemotherapy), and the observed data are deemed to lack the strength and level of evidence that would have been obtained had the study been completed as planned.

Moreover, differences between the two trials (Study 301 and study 3006) hinder an appropriate comparison of populations and outcomes. The main difference is with regards to the number of prior lines of therapy. Study 301 included patients previously treated with one line of platinum-based chemotherapy, while study 3006 included patients failing a second-line platinum-containing chemotherapy). Furthermore, a post hoc analysis determined that 42% of subjects enrolled in study 3006 were platinum-resistant (PFI &lt; 6 months) following their last platinum-containing regimen while Yondelis is only approved in patients with platinum sensitive disease.

With respect to outcomes for primary endpoints, Study 301 found a difference in terms of median PFS of 1.5 months with Yondelis+PLD, whereas Study 3006 was powered to detect a difference in median OS of 4.5 months.

The MAH argued that post-hoc analyses of Study 3006 showed a trend towards improved PFS combined with a significant improvement in ORR among the subset of patients who were platinumsensitive following their last line of platinum-containing therapy. However, as discussed previously, the study failed to meet its primary objective, to evaluate Yondelis with the assumption that Yondelis + PLD will improve OS compared with PLD monotherapy. Only if study 3006 had been completed as planned and was positive for OS, the submitted ad hoc comparison of study 301 and 3006 (data not shown) might have been considered for the post-hoc defined subgroup of patients in Study 3006 with platinum-sensitive disease after their last line of platinum-containing therapy; however, limitations of comparisons across trials in different patient populations still would have been a high concern.

Even though BRCA and PFI were stratification factors, OS and PFS as a function of BRCA status or of PFI were exploratory endpoints and were not adjusted for multiplicity. As a consequence of the methodological shortcomings, the results for these endpoints and in subgroups defined by these factors are much more likely to be spurious in magnitude and direction and cannot be used for regulatory decision-making.

In light of the above, data from Study 3006 do not permit to conclude on the effects of Yondelis + PLD in third line platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.

With regards to safety, there was a difference between the two treatment arms in study 3006 in terms of number of AEs, severity and seriousness. Approximately 85% of patients in the Yondelis + PLD experienced a Grade 3-4 AE compared to 63.8% in the control arm. The greatest difference is seen in terms of Grade 4 AEs, 44.1% vs. 10.3%. Looking at SOCs a clear difference is seen in 'blood and lymphatic system disorder', 56.6% vs. 27.7%, and 'investigations' (neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, etc.) 51.7% vs. 10.6%. However, there were significantly fewer Grade 3-4 AEs in terms of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders in the Yondelis + PLD arm compared to doxorubicin alone, 3.8% vs. 14.5%, which is somewhat puzzling, because trabectedin is given in study 3006 as add-on treatment to doxorubicin.

There were slightly more deaths in the Yondelis + PLD arm with regards to 'death within 60 days of initiation of study drug' in the Yondelis + PLD arm and in 'death within 30 days from the last dose'. AEs leading to death was 10 (3.5%) vs. 5 (1.8%) in favour of the doxorubicin monotherapy arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients in the Yondelis + PLD arm discontinued treatment to a much higher degree compared with the control arm and as expected dose-reductions had to be made in half of the patients in the Yondelis + PLD arm compared to one third in the control arm.

Overall, the number of SAEs was considerably higher (41.3% in the combination arm vs 20.6% in PLD arm) and a considerable difference in overall rate of Grade 3-4 AEs was observed (85% in the combination arm vs 63.8% in the control arm). This is not unexpected when comparing a combination treatment with monotherapy in patients who have already received several lines of treatment.

The CHMP noted and endorsed the PRAC request in EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00003001/201909 for the MAH to submit a variation to update section 4.8 of the SmPC with pooled data from the ovarian cancer phase 3 clinical studies.

Yondelis has been authorised in combination with PLD based on a positive trial rendering a favourable benefit-risk balance in patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (study 301). The new study 3006 failed to provide evidence against the statistical hypothesis that OS is the same with Yondelis + PLD and PLD. In addition, results of study 3006 also do not provide a level and strength of clinical evidence that would allow to conclude there are no clinically relevant favourable effects of Yondelis + PLD in terms of OS and PFS in third line platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.

The positive benefit-risk balance established for the ovarian cancer indication on the basis of the wellconducted phase III trial 301, showing favourable effects of Yondelis + PLD in terms of PFS in patients with a relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, therefore remains unchanged.

Furthermore, the CHMP recommended that the marketing authorisation of this product should be varied so that section 5.1 of the SmPC reflects the results from Study 3006.

The CHMP noted from responses submitted by the marketing authorisation during this review that there are two ongoing investigator-sponsored studies (NCT03690739 and NCT03164980), in active recruitment phase, which are investigating the use of trabectedin + doxorubicin in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. The MAH is requested to submit the final results of these studies when they become available.

## 4. Amendments to the product information

The CHMP considered that amendments to section 5.1 of the SmPC were necessary to include a summary of the results from study 3006. The agreed amendments are as follows (new text in bold):

The Yondelis+PLD combination in relapsed ovarian cancer also was evaluated in study ET743-OVC-3006, a phase 3 study in which women with ovarian cancer after failure of a second platinum-containing regimen were randomized to Yondelis (1.1 mg/m 2 ) and PLD (30 mg/m 2 ) every 3 weeks or PLD (50 mg/m 2 ) every 4 weeks. Study participants were required to be platinum sensitive (PFI ≥ 6 months) following their first platinum-containing regimen and have a complete or partial response to a second line platinum-based chemotherapy (without PFI restrictions) meaning that these patients could be either platinum-sensitive (PFI ≥ 6 months) or platinum-resistant (PFI &lt; 6 months) following their second platinumcontaining regimen. A post hoc analysis determined that 42% of enrolled subjects were platinum-resistant (PFI &lt; 6 months) following their last platinum-containing regimen.

The primary endpoint of study ET743-OVC-3006 was OS and secondary endpoints included PFS and ORR. The study was sized to enrol approximately 670 patients in order to observe 514 deaths to detect a HR of 0.78 for OS with 80% power given a two-sided significance level of 0.05 spread across two planned analyses on OS, at interim (60% or 308/514 deaths) and final analysis (514 deaths). Two early unscheduled futility analyses were performed at the request of the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). Following the second futility analysis performed at 45% of planned events (232/514 deaths), the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

IDMC recommended discontinuing the study due to (1) futility of the primary analysis on OS and (2) excessive risk based on imbalance of adverse events not in favour of Yondelis+PLD. At early termination of the study, 9% (52/572 treated) of subjects stopped treatment, 45% (260/576 randomized) stopped follow-up, and 54% (310/576 randomized) were censored from OS assessment, precluding reliable estimates of PFS and OS endpoints.

## 5. Grounds for Opinion

Whereas,

- The Committee considered the procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Yondelis;
- The Committee reviewed the clinical study report on study ET743-OVC-3006, a phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trabectedin in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin as a third-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced-relapsed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or Fallopian tube cancer.
- The Committee noted that following a first unplanned interim futility analysis, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) for study 3006 requested an additional futility analysis at 45% of events (232 events). This analysis, which was not planned in the protocol, led to an IDMC recommendation to discontinue the trial for futility of the primary endpoint (OS) and excessive risk based on imbalance of adverse events not in favour of the experimental arm, after which the sponsor prematurely terminated study 3006.
- The Committee further noted that there are differences between study 3006 and study 301 (pivotal study for the authorisation of the ovarian cancer indication) in terms of number of prior lines of therapy, platinum sensitivity status and primary endpoint hampering an appropriate comparison of populations and outcomes. These differences between studies hinder an appropriate comparison of populations and outcomes.
- Overall, the Committee considered that data from the prematurely terminated study 3006 do not provide the level and strength of clinical evidence necessary to conclude on the absence of favourable effects in third line platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients.
- The Committee noted that overall, in study 3006, the safety profile of Yondelis +PLD appears consistent with the known safety profile for this combination. While patients in the Yondelis + PLD arm of the study experienced more adverse events than those in the PLD arm, this is not unexpected when comparing a combination treatment with monotherapy.
- The Committee therefore concluded that the positive benefit-risk balance of Yondelis in the ovarian cancer indication, that was established on the basis of the well-conducted phase III trial 301 showing favourable effects of Yondelis in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with relapsed platinumsensitive ovarian cancer, remains unchanged.
- The Committee recommended that study 3006 be reflected in section 5.1 of the summary of product characteristics.

In view of the above, the Committee considers that the benefit-risk balance of Yondelis remains favourable subject to the agreed amendments to the product information.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Committee, as a consequence, recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations for Yondelis.
