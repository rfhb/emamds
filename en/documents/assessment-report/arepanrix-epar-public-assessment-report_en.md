## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

An influenza pandemic is a global outbreak of influenza disease that occurs when a type A influenza strain to which a high proportion of the world's population is immunologically naïve emerges. In April 2009, a new strain of human influenza A(H1N1)v was identified and characterised. On 11 June 2009 the WHO  declared  Phase  6  of  the influenza pandemic.  The  declaration reflected sustained transmission of the virus from person to person in several WHO regions. WHO and other international agencies are calling the disease pandemic (H1N1)v 2009 .  For the virus the nomenclature influenza A(H1N1)v (where v indicates variant) has been chosen.

Estimates  for  the  attack  rates  associated  with  the  influenza  A(H1N1)v  virus  have  varied  from approximately  10-50  %  in  different  geographical  areas.  The  actual  numbers  of  clinically  apparent infections, cases that require hospitalisation and deaths in the pandemic period is expected to be higher than  in  recent  years  for  seasonal  influenza.  These  estimates  may  change  (upwards  or  downwards) during  the  further  course  of  the  pandemic.  Hospitalisation  and  deaths  have  occurred  in  previously healthy subjects as well as in those with underlying conditions or pregnancy that would predispose them  to  complications  of  influenza.  For  more  information  about  the  known  clinical  features  of  the disease  caused  by  influenza  A(H1N1)v  virus  please  see  the  Risk  Assessment  report  from  ECDC under: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/Documents/0908\\_Influenza\\_AH1N1\\_Risk\\_Assessment.pdf Specific guidance has been developed for the fast track assessment procedure for pandemic influenza vaccines 1 , which can only be used once WHO/EU have officially declared a pandemic. In 2008 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals received a Marketing Authorisation for the mock-up vaccine of Pandemrix (A/VietNam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14(H5N1) strain) in line with the core dossier approach. The approval of pandemic vaccines using this mock-up/core dossier route followed by a strain change is based on a Proof of Principle approach by which safety and immunogenicity data are generated with mock-up vaccines containing subtypes of influenza A to which the majority of the population is naïve. These principles are based on: ¾ The immune responses to a specific mock-up vaccine containing a strain to which subjects within a specific age range were immunologically naïve are expected to predict responses to the  same  vaccine  construct  containing  an  alternative  strain  of  the  same  subtype  or  an alternative subtype of influenza A in a comparable population.

- ¾ The safety data generated with a specific mock-up vaccine in clinical studies are expected to predict the safety profile observed with the same vaccine construct containing an alternative strain  of  the  same  subtype  or  an  alternative  subtype  of  influenza  A  in  a  comparable population.

The mock-up vaccine for Pandemrix is a split virion inactivated influenza vaccine containing antigen from  H5N1  (NIBRG-14),  which  is  a  strain  derived  by  reverse  genetics  from  the  influenza  virus A/Vietnam/1194/2004. On 22 September 2009 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals received a positive EC decision for a variation to change the strain used for manufacture of Pandemrix to A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (A-179A). The strain used has been officially recommended by WHO and CHMP for the manufacture of vaccines during the current pandemic.

Guideline on Dossier Structure and Content for Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Marketing Authorisations Application (CPMP/VEG/4717/03).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This MAA for Arepanrix has been filed in accordance with the Emergency Rolling Review Procedure together with a request for conditional Marketing Authorisation in accordance with Articles 2(2) and 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 and that is applicable to candidate pandemic vaccines for which there is no approved core dossier in place before the pandemic is declared.

Arepanrix is a split virion inactivated influenza vaccine. It is intended that the final formulation will contain antigen equivalent to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like virus 3.75 micrograms haemagglutinin per 0.5 ml dose adjuvanted by AS03. Arepanrix consists of two multidose containers, one multidose vial containing 2.5 mL of antigen suspension and one multidose vial containing 2.5 ml of adjuvant emulsion. Prior administration, the two components should be mixed.

Arepanrix and Pandemrix vaccines are manufactured at different sites by the same MAH. (i.e. SainteFoy, Quebec, Canada for Arepanrix and Dresden, Germany for Pandemrix).

<!-- image -->

The  clinical  data  submitted  to  support  this  MAA  included  two  studies  that  directly  compared  the safety and immunogenicity in adults between Pandemrix (HA manufactured in Dresden; D-Pan) and Arepanrix (HA manufactured in Quebec; Q-Pan) containing either H5N1 (study Q-Pan H5N1-001) or H1N1 (study Q-Pan H1N1-017) antigens. . Post-Marketing data from the use of Arepanrix in Canada provided further data on safety. Submission of further data at specific time points is included in the Specific Obligations agreed for Arepanrix  containing  antigen  from  influenza  A(H1N1)v.  All  data  will  be  reviewed  on  an  ongoing basis. These ongoing and planned studies will provide safety, immunogenicity and effectiveness data for Arepanrix influenza A(H1N1)v vaccine. The Arepanrix SPC summarises the existing clinical data. The Clinical Particulars will be updated as new data are submitted and reviewed. 2.2 Quality aspects The quality section is divided into two parts of which chapter 3.2.1 describes quality characteristics pertaining to the initial version of Arepanrix containing HA derived from A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) and chapter 3.2.2 describes quality characteristics  of  the  new  pandemic  strain  A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (X-179A). 2.2.1  A/Indonesia/05/2005/PR8-IBCDC-RG2 (H5N1) Active  Substance Arepanrix H5N1 is a split inactivated influenza vaccine. The final formulation contains 3.75 µg haemagglutinin (HA) of A/Indonesia/05/2005/PR8-IBCDC-RG2 (H5N1) per 0.5 ml dose adjuvanted by AS03. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  reference virus for Arepanrix (H5N1)  used  in the clinical development  programme  is A/Indonesia/05/2005/PR8-IBCDC-RG2 (H5N1), which was developed by the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) using reverse genetics. The reassortment strain combines the H5 and N1 segments to the  PR8  strain  backbone.    In  addition  the  H5  was  engineered  to  eliminate  the  polybasic  stretch  of amino-acids at the HA cleavage site that is responsible for high virulence of the original strains. The virus is propagated in fertilised hens'eggs.

## Manufacture

The manufacturing process for the monovalent bulks is similar to the manufacturing process for the monovalent  bulks  of  the  seasonal  vaccines  FluLaval  and  Fluviral,  which  are  licensed  in  USA  and Canada (there is no EU licence).  The manufacturing process for the monobulks is in some aspects different to the process reviewed and approved for the Pandemrix/Prepandrix licences (the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

prepandemic and pandemic adjuvanted vaccines produced at the applicant's German site in Dresden). The manufacturing process can be divided into five main parts:

- Propagation of the working seed in fertilised hen's eggs, harvesting and pooling of infected allantoic fluids
- Inactivation of the monovalent virus using UV and formaldehyde/thiomersal
- Concentration and purification of the whole virus bulk
- Splitting of the monovalent with sodium deoxycholate
- Homogenisation and sterile filtration

The production process for monovalent bulks is adequately described.

## Control of Materials

Control of starting materials which are of biological origin (virus seed lots, eggs and raw materials) is acceptable.    The  working  seed  release  package  has  been  provided  and  includes  the  results  of pathogenicity testing in chickens and ferrets and monitoring of plaque formation on chicken embryo fibroblast  cells.    Data  to  confirm  the  sequence  of  HA  and  NA  genome  segment  of  the  A/Indonesia strain to the CDC reference strain have been provided.

## Process validation

Critical  steps  of  the  drug  substance  production  process  have  been  identified  and  are  sufficiently controlled.  Nine  data  sets  from  the  2006,  2007  and  2008  A/Indonesia/5/2005  drug  substance production campaigns were used to illustrate the robustness and consistency of the Quebec H5N1 drug substance manufacturing process.

The capability of the UV/formaldehyde/thiomersal inactivation steps for batches of A/Indonesia/05/2005 virus has been demonstrated.  Ability of the manufacturing process to inactivate avian leucosis virus and mycoplasma inactivation has been demonstrated.

## Characterisation and specifications

The  structure  of  the  inactivated  split  monovalent  bulks  was  studied  by  transmission  electron microscopy and confirmed the predominance of disrupted particles after splitting.

Relevant  impurities  have  been  specified  and  are  controlled.  Release  specifications  for  the  drug substance  include  controls  for  appearance,  HA  content,  neuraminidase  identity,  sterility,  bacterial endotoxins, test for residual infectious viruses, residual sodium deoxycholate, residual formaldehyde and test for fragmentation (not routine) and are in line with PhEur monograph 0158. All analytical methods have been appropriately validated.

The monovalent bulks are filled and stored in 1L, 10L or 20L bags.   Information on the compliance of the construction materials of two different types of  bags is provided and is acceptable.

## Stability

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Data currently support 18 to 24 months stability at 2-8°C for bulks depending on the bag type used for storage.

## Medicinal  Product

The drug product is described in three parts: The drug product containing H5N1 antigen, the AS03 adjuvant  and  the  mixed  AS03  adjuvanted  H5N1  influenza  vaccine  which  is  the  preparation  to  be administered within 24 hours.

## Medicinal  Product (H5N1 vial)

Pharmaceutical Development

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Developmental  changes  implemented  since  the  first  clinical  studies  have  been  stated  and  clinical studies have provided reassurance of product remaining comparable.

## Manufacture of the Product

Manufacture for the antigen component of the drug product is relatively simple and consists of aseptic formulation of the final bulk with the excipients followed by filling into final containers.

An  overage  of  20%  for  the  HA  content  will  be  applied  at  formulation  of  the  commercial  lots. Supporting data and satisfactory justification have been provided.

## The antigen bulk is sterile.  Bioburden is controlled throughout the manufacturing process.

The maximum hold time between formulation and filling is 21 days hold time at 2-8 °C for final bulks.

## Product Specification

Compliance with the product specifications has been shown on a number of batches representatives of the final formulation and commercial scale manufacture.  There are no final products process-related or degradation impurities.

<!-- image -->

Specifications for excipients and analytical procedures are in line with USP or NF. Controls of final bulks (sterility, HA,  total protein, residual ovalbumin,  thiomersal, residual formaldehyde and residual sucrose) and final containers (sterility, bacterial endotoxins, pH, thiomersal, appearance, osmolality and HA) of the antigen vial are acceptable (in line with PhEur). Methods are either in line with PhEur or are validated. Adequate  data  are  provided  to  affirm  the  quality  of  the  container/closure  system.    HA  content, appearance, sterility, thiomersal content and pH are measured as stability-indicating parameters as part of the stability studies.  Stability test methods and specifications are identical to those at release.  A shelf-life of 18 months is currently acceptable until further long-term data are available. Medicinal  Product (AS03 adjuvant vial) AS03 is an oil-in-water emulsion in 3mL multi-dose (10 dose) glass vials.  It is composed of squalene (10.69 milligrams), DLα -tocopherol (11.86 milligrams) and polysorbate 80 (4.86 milligrams). Pharmaceutical Development Developmental changes implemented since the first clinical studies have been stated and non-clinical and clinical studies have provided reassurance of product remaining comparable. Manufacture of the AS03 adjuvant vial Formulation of the AS03 adjuvant consists of the preparation of the bulk  followed by filling into glass vials.    Process  parameters  are  identified.    No  routine  in-process  tests  are  conducted.    Bioburden  is adequately controlled throughout the manufacturing process. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Specifications of the AS03 adjuvant

With the exception of squalene, all excipients are described and controlled in line with the Ph.Eur. Adequate  quality  control  of  squalene  is  performed  by  the  supplier  and  by  GSK  (according  to  an internal GSK monograph which is in line with the Ph.Eur. monograph for squalane).

Emulsion bulk and AS03 final containers are tested at release for Description, Identity and Content of adjuvant  components  (polysorbate  80,  DLα -tocopherol  and  squalene),  pH,  Endotoxin  content, Sterility, Particle size, Polydispersity index and Volume (final containers only).

Tests  for  sterility  and  bacterial  endotoxins  are  performed  in  line  with  the  Ph.Eur.  and  tests  for polysorbate 80, α -tocopherol and squalene are validated.  The method used for particle size analysis and associated system suitability measurements is acceptable.

Stability of the AS03 adjuvant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data  provided  from  the  stability  studies  for  the  bulk  emulsion  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  of  2 years.  For final AS03 container lots a shelf-life of 36 months has been approved.

## Medicinal  Product (mixed H5N1 and AS03 vial)

At the time of vaccine administration, the content of the adjuvant vial is withdrawn from the vial with a syringe and is injected into the antigen vial and shaken.

Data from 'withdrawable' volume studies conducted to support the required overfill for both antigen and  adjuvant  vials  have  been  provided.  Results  from  uniformity  of  dose  studies  demonstrate  that content  of  HA,  squalene,  Polysorbate  80  and  tocopherol  for  each  dose  of  the  10-dose  vial  remains equivalent.

SDS PAGE and Western blot analysis performed show that HA profiles of the adjuvanted formulation are comparable to the non-adjuvanted formulation and remain unchanged after a period of 24 hours at 25°C.  Compatibility between the antigen and adjuvant after 24h at 25°C has been demonstrated by evaluation of appropriate key quality criteria.  Preservative efficacy of thiomersal concentration after mixing the content of the antigen container with AS03 adjuvant has been shown in line with Ph.Eur. 5.1.3. The applicant has shown that there is limited (less than 10%) physico-chemical interaction between the Quebec split virion antigen and the adjuvant system and thus, it is accepted that there is no need for  controlling  antigen/adjuvant  interaction  for  this  product  as  a  release  test.  There  is  sufficient evidence that there is little/no effect of the reconstitution conditions on the essential characteristics of the antigen/adjuvant combination. 2.2.2 Pandemic Strain (A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (X179A) The MAH provided quality data in support of the pandemic strain to ensure that the manufacture of the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  is  appropriately  controlled.  Adequate  release  and  shelf-life specifications have been set. Active  Substance The reference virus described in the current MAA is A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v NYMC X-179A. This  strain  has  been  developed  by  the  NYMC  using  classical  genetic  reassortion.  The  reassortant strain  combines  the  HA,  NA  and  PB1  genes  of  A/California/7/2009  (H1N1)v,  to  the  PR8  strain backbone. Manufacture Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  manufacturing  process  for  A/California/7/2009  (H1N1)v  monovalent  bulks  is  identical  to  the manufacturing  process  for  Arepanrix  A/Indonesia  (H5N1)  monovalent  bulks  (see  paragraph  3.2.1) with  the  exception  of  changes  necessary  to    account  for  a    4-fold  scale  up  introduced  in  the downstream purification, splitting and fill process. Comparability between lots produced using the old process  and the new scaled-up process has been demonstrated.

Information is presented on the source and passage level history of the primary seed virus as well as on the preparation and qualification of the working seed virus lots for the strain.

Unlike for H5N1 A/Indonesia and A/Vietnam, the A(H1N1)v strain has been produced using classical reassortment on eggs rather than being attenuated by reverse genetics.  HA and NA identity for the master and working seeds have been confirmed. The specifications and methods for the master and working seed are in line with that already reviewed for A/Indonesia H5N1.

Eggs  used  for  establishing  seeds  are  SPF.    The  master  seed  prepared  by  GSK  corresponds  to E7/E1/E1.  Commercial H1N1v monobulks have been prepared with this master seed  and also with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

working seeds derived from the master seed with 3 additional passages (i.e. working seed E7/E1/E4). Commercial  production  occurs  with  one  additional  passage  from  the  working  seed.  Adequate supporting data for suitability of the master and working seeds are provided.

The MAH has adequately demonstrated inactivation and data are at least as equivalent to that seen for A/Indonesia H5N1.

## Characterisation and specifications

The SRD method is used to determine the HA content in the bulks and final containers. The SRD method has been satisfactorily re-qualified using intended antigen and antisera. Linearity of the doseresponse has been demonstrated.

Batch analytical data are provided for the two drug substance lots to be used in clinical trials and for three process consistency lots.

## Stability

Data  generated  on  A/H5N1  strains  are  submitted  as  supportive  data  for  the  stability  of  the  drug substance (monovalent bulks). An acceptable confirmatory stability plan for the proposed A/California (H1N1)v strain monovalent bulks has been provided.

List of Excipients: Suspension vial: Thiomersal Sodium chloride (NaCl) Disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4) Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) Potassium chloride (KCl) Water for Injections

Overall,  the  stability  of  the  HA  content  during  the  period  evaluated  is  satisfactory.    The  approved shelf-life for H5N1 monobulks is 18 to 24 months for bulks depending of the storage containers (two types of bags are used).

## Introduction of the pandemic strain - strain change related changes

The  A/California/7/2009  (H1N1)v  final  bulks  and  final  containers  are  respectively  formulated  and filled as for the H5N1 final bulks and final containers of Arepanrix H5N1.

The  same  control  processes  as  for  Arepanrix  H5N1  are  applied  to  the  antigen  component  of  the MAH's H1N1v A/California influenza vaccine adjuvanted with AS03.

Re-qualification data for the SRD method used for analysis of final bulks and final containers have been provided.  QC release data for the H1N1v A/California final bulks and final containers presented conform to the specifications reviewed for the antigen component of Arepanrix H5N1.

The  compatibility  study  between  H1N1v  antigen  and  adjuvant  is  demonstrated,  throughout  the vaccine's in-use shelf life of 24 hours.

No real-time  real-temperature  stability  data  are  available  for  H1N1v  final  containers  at  the  present time. Accelerated stability data for H1N1v A/California final containers stored at 30°C are available for two weeks - the specifications are met and no trend is seen.  A confirmatory long-term stability program is proposed, to cover 60 months storage at 5°C ± 3°. The MAH is proposing an alignment to the  shelf-life  approved  for  the  antigen  component  of  Arepanrix  H5N1  (i.e.  18  months),  since  the vaccine composition is unchanged apart from the vaccine strain.  This is accepted until further longterm data are available for the H1N1v vaccine. Concerning the AS03 adjuvant component the approved shelf-life, based on real-time stability data, is 36 months at 2-8 ° C. After mixing, the vaccine should be used within 24 hours. Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 25°C. Presence of aggregates in the antigen final containers Presence  of  white  aggregates  have  been  observed  in  clinical  and  commercial  lots  of A/California/7/2009 antigen vials. The reason for the occurrence of aggregation is not clear, but is known to be an inherent feature of this type of formulation. It is hypothesized that the physicochemical properties of A/H1N1 California/7/2009 strains and/or handling conditions post filling (e.g. storage and transportation) might contribute to the increased aggregate formation. The aggregates have the same constitution as found in the antigen suspension (i.e. haemagglutinin and proteins).  Different methods were used to ascertain the amount of antigen present in the aggregates. Variable values were observed depending of techniques, thus indicating that aggregates do account for a notable percentage of the final pre-mixed antigen formulation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The level of aggregation can be considered clinically qualified. Data has been presented which provide assurance that the level of aggregation in the clinical batch at the time of the clinical studies contained similar aggregate-HA amounts as three commercial lots manufactured since.

Additional data provided support the view that when mixed with the adjuvant the aggregates present in the  antigen  vial  are  largely  solubilised and  therefore  the  presence  of  aggregates  in  the  antigen  drug product  has  only  a  limited  impact  on  potency  of  the  adjuvanted  vaccine  measured  by  SRD.  The Applicant  has  committed  to  provide  further  data  about  the  kinetics  of  resolubilisation  of  the aggregates.

Overall, the information presented in Modules 2.3 and 3 was considered in accordance with the abovementioned guidelines and therefore acceptable.

## 2.3  Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Preclinical development of Arepanrix was generally in agreement with current guidelines. The antigen is produced in hen's eggs using the same process as that is applied to the applicant's own FluLaval brand of seasonal influenza vaccine approved outside the EU.

The Arepanrix H5N1 (A/Indonesia/5/2005) influenza vaccine construct was tested in the ferret model to evaluate the potential of this vaccine to reduce disease symptoms (body temperature, weight loss, and histopathological changes in the respiratory tract) and viral loads in the upper (pharynx) and lower (lung) respiratory tract of ferrets challenged with homologous (A/Indonesia/5/2005) or heterologous (A/Hongkong/156/97) strains.

<!-- image -->

No new non-clinical studies with A(H1N1)v were submitted for this application. Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) The safety studies included in the dossier were all compliant with GLP. Pharmacology · Primary pharmacodynamics Two  immunogenicity  studies  were  conducted  in  mice  using  H5N1  vaccine  manufactured  at  the Quebec facility, adjuvanted with AS03.  One study used vaccine antigens from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and the second study used vaccine antigens from A/Indonesia/5/2005.  Immunogenicity was greater in the  presence  of  the  adjuvant  by  both  measures  used  (quantification  of  antigen-specific  IgG  in  sera, haemagglutination inhibition tires) and a dose-response relationship was shown between antigen dose and  serum  IgG  concentrations;  however,  there  was  no  evidence  of  a  dose-relationship  using  the functional antibody measure. Vaccine efficacy studies were conducted in ferrets exposed to lethal challenge doses of homologous virus (A/Indonesia/5/2005), or heterologous virus (vaccine prepared from A/Indonesia/5/2005 H5N1 and the challenge virus was A/Hong Kong/156/97 H5N1) and a final experiment where the vaccine was  based  on  H5N1  A/Vietnam/1194/04  and  the  challenge  virus  was  A/Indonesia/05/2005.    All studies  indicated  that  adjuvanted  vaccine  conferred  protection  from  lethal  challenge  with  influenza virus, whereas without adjuvant, or with a half-dose of adjuvant, vaccine efficacy was compromised. Viral  shedding,  lung  viral  load  measures  and  serology  results  were  generally  internally  consistent, although  in  one  experiment  there  was  a  lack  of  concordance  between  the  test  facility  and  the applicant's laboratory results for seroconversion.  The adjuvant used in the study was AS03.  The data also indicated cross-reactivity. Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Secondary pharmacodynamics

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies were not performed. This approach is in accordance with the relevant guidelines, note for guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95) and the guideline on dossier structure and content for pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application, CPMP/VEG/4717/03.

- Safety pharmacology programme

A safety pharmacology study was performed in rats treated by intravenous bolus with 1ml/kg of saline placebo (n = 4) or Quebec-sourced A/Wisconsin/67/05 influenza adjuvanted with AS03 (n = 4). The final concentration of the influenza antigen was 30µg/ml and the AS03 concentration represented the full  human dose. Assuming a 250g rat, a 1ml/kg dose represents an approximately 100-fold excess over the ml/kg exposure of a 50kg human receiving a 0.5 ml intramuscular dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Over 120 minutes after infusion there was a tendency for minute volume to increase in all animals, and a  single  animal  in  the  actively  treated  group  showed  a  transient  inverted  P-wave  on  ECG.  Both occurrences  were  considered  non-specific  and  there  was  no  evidence  of  any  treatment-specific changes in cardiorespiratory performance. Overall, no concerns for human use were raised.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

## No studies were performed

## Pharmacokinetics

Experimental studies to demonstrate absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the active ingredients  in  Arepanrix  have  not  been  performed.  This  is  in  line  with  the  relevant  guidelines CPMP/SWP/465/95 and CPMP/VEG/4717/03.

Toxicology z Single dose toxicity  and  repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) Two  single  dose  and  two  repeat  dose  general  toxicity  studies  were  reported.  Test  material  was Arepanrix  H5N1  vaccine,  adjuvanted  with  AS03.  Apart  from  pro-inflammatory  changes  at  the injection site that are related to the primary mode of action of the AS03 adjuvant, there was no toxicity of note.  These studies used the full human dose given intramuscularly to rabbits in a manner sufficient to support the intended clinical dosing. Results of a further two general toxicity studies were ongoing at the time of the Application review. . One  is  a  toxicity  study  in  rabbits  given  three  intramuscular  injections  of  seasonal  and  pandemic influenza candidate vaccines with full, half and no dose of AS03 adjuvant.  The other is a toxicity study in rabbits given three intramuscular injections of Arepanrix H5N1 vaccine with AS03 at the full human dose.  Neither is considered critical to the approval of Arepanrix given these differences from H1N1v vaccine, however the CHMP considered that the applicant should provide the study results to rule out any unexpected toxicity. z Genotoxicity Genotoxicity of the adjuvant alone was assessed in two in vitro tests (reverse mutation test in bacteria; gene  mutation  in  mouse  cells)  and  one in  vivo test  (micronucleus  test  in  the  rat  after  intravenous administration). The vaccine was not tested. No indication of genotoxicity was evident. z Carcinogenicity Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

No carcinogenicity studies were conducted which is in line with the Note for Guidance on Preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95)

- z Reproduction Toxicity

In a reproductive toxicity study in rats the animals were assigned to four dose groups as in the table below which received either phosphate buffer saline (PBS), AS03 adjuvant or AS03 adjuvanted Arepanrix H5N1 (i.e. Q-H5N1) influenza vaccine.

| Group   | Number   | Test article            | Test article                                    | Dose   |
|---------|----------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Group   | of rats  | 28 days prior to mating | Gestation day 7, 9, 12, 16 and Post-natal day 7 | volume |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| Group 1 (Control)   |   48 | PBS         | PBS                      | 200 μ L   |
|---------------------|------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| Group 2             |   48 | AS03        | AS03 + PBS (1:1)         | 200 μ L   |
| Group 3             |   48 | PBS         | H5N1 (1.5 μ g HA) + AS03 | 200 μ L   |
| Group 4             |   48 | H5N1 + AS03 | H5N1 (1.5 μ g HA) + AS03 | 200 μ L   |

Doses were intramuscular in the rear limbs 28 days prior to cohabitation (with an untreated male) and on gestation days (GD) 7, 9, 12, and 16 and on postnatal day (PND) 7 (littering cohort dams only). Dams were subject to section on day 21, or to deliver normally and assessments in the latter group were carried out to postnatal day 25.  Serological analysis proved vaccine exposure of dams during pregnancy and exposure of foetuses and pups to anti-H5N1 antibodies.  There were no effects on any of the parameters evaluated for the F0 generation  and all dams survived until their scheduled termination.  There were no abnormalities on c-section data or fetal examinations and in the pups followed to postnatal day 25, no toxic effects were observed.

The  reproductive  toxicity  study  did  not  identify  toxicity  associated  with  vaccination  in  pregnancy animals when dosed from day 6 or pregnancy.  This is considered satisfactory proof to support the use of  the  vaccine  in  pregnant  women  in  the  second  or  third  trimester  and  to  support  vaccination  of lactating women.  However, vaccination in early pregnancy, that is, prior and up to implantation of the embryo  has  not  been  directly  studied.    The  applicant  is  conducting  a  study  with  AS03-adjuvanted vaccine to address this specifically. In addition, two supportive studies assessed the effect of both Fluarix and FluLaval influenza vaccines, and both AS03 alone and AS03 with H5N1 antigen produced with Fluarix-process on embryo-fetal and peri- and post-natal development in naïve or pre-immunised rats following intramuscular administration. In the studies conducted with Fluarix and FluLaval seasonal vaccines, there were no findings in the F0 females or F1 offspring that were considered related to treatment. No signs of maternal toxicity were observed during the reproductive and developmental study performed in rats. Likewise, treatment of naïve or pre-immunized female rats with the AS03-adjuvanted Pandemrix H5N1 or the AS03 adjuvant alone on days 6, 8, 11 and 15 of gestation did not adversely affect the embryofoetal development or pre- and post-natal development of the offspring. Treatment with the AS03-adjuvanted Pandemrix H5N1 influenza vaccine prior to pairing did not adversely affect the mating performance or fertility of the females. Overall, no reproductive toxicity effect was observed, neither with antigen prepared according to the FluLaval process (used for Arepanrix), nor with AS03-containing influenza vaccine candidates nor with the AS03-adjuvanted Arepanrix (A/Indonesia/5/2005) influenza vaccine. Overall, testing suggested that the Quebec-manufactured vaccines tested did not adversely affect female fertility or pregnancy and no effect was indicated in the F1 generation.

## · Local tolerance

Local tolerance assessment of AS03 alone and Quebec-manufactured H3N2 antigen (same process as Arepanrix) at a dose containing 15µg of HA (i.e., approximately 20-fold higher than the intended human dose on a body weight basis) combined with a full human dose of AS03 did not show any adverse clinical observation in rabbits. Dermal responses did not differ between controls and experimental groups. There were no adverse observations noted at necropsy. Minimal or mild subacute inflammation of the subcutaneous and/or epimysial tissue was noted in animals receiving the adjuvant, with or without influenza antigen.

There were no microscopic findings specifically associated with the presence of influenza antigen in the test article. In general, a single intramuscular injection of influenza vaccine containing 15µg of HA and a full human dose of AS03 were well tolerated by New Zealand White rabbits.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These results were confirmed in a second study where local tolerance was assessed using AS03 adjuvanted Quebec H5N1 antigen (Arepanrix H5N1). In this study rabbits received one single IM administration of either of three candidate vaccines - two manufactured with Quebec-sourced seasonal antigens (60 μ g HA/dose) adjuvanted or not with AS03 (human half-dose) and one manufactured with the Quebec pandemic H5N1 antigen (30 μ g HA/dose) adjuvanted with AS03 (human dose) or saline control.

Minor inflammation was observed in all vaccine and control groups, which is indicative of an effect of the dose method as opposed to any of the vaccine components. The adjuvanted vaccines were associated with fasciitis, cellulitis, and in males, granulomatous myositis. There was no clear difference in severity of these conditions between the two adjuvanted vaccines.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

No  environmental  risk  assessment  was  included  in  the  application.  According  to  the  guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  ' Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human Use' vaccines due to the nature of their constituents are exempted from the requirement to provide an environmental risk assessment in the application for a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product for human use. 2.4 Clinical aspects This Emergency Rolling Review application dossier was based primarily on clinical studies that evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of AS03-adjuvanted vaccines containing antigens from A/Indonesia/5/2005  (H5N1)  and  some  data  from  a  version  containing  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  (H5N1). Before  filing  this  MAA  the  applicant  also  reported  data  from  a  study  that  directly  compared  AS03adjuvanted  vaccine  containing  antigen  from  the  H1N1  pandemic  strain  manufactured  in  Quebec  (i.e. Arepanrix) or Dresden (i.e. Pandemrix). In  addition,  during  the  emergency  rolling  review  process  the  applicant  provided  results  from  several studies with Pandemrix (D-Pan) H1N1 and these data have also been taken into account. Further  clinical  data  on  the  approved  formulation  of  Arepanrix  A(H1N1)v  are  expected  in  accordance with agreed timelines as outlined in the Letter of Undertaking. GCP The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic  studies  were  not  performed  in  accordance  with  the  note  for  guidance  on  clinical evaluation of new vaccines (CPMP/EWP/463/97) and the Guideline on dossier structure and content for pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application (CPMP/VEG/4717/03).

## Pharmacodynamics

In relation to vaccines, the pharmacodynamic studies consist of assessments of the immune responses. The data on the immunological response to Arepanrix (H5N1) are described and discussed below.

## Clinical efficacy

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Main studies

The two studies with Arepanrix (= 'Q-Pan', i.e. HA manufactured in Quebec and combined at that facility  with  AS03  manufactured at Rixensart) were initially submitted for review are shown in the table  below.    In  both  studies  the  Q-Pan  formulation  studied  contained  antigens  derived  from  the A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain of H5N1.

## Assays

Sera  obtained  from  subjects  enrolled  into  the  Q-Pan  H5N1  studies  were  forwarded  to  GSK, Sächsisches Serumwerk Dresden, Zirkusstraße 40, 01069 Dresden (Germany). Validation reports were provided. In brief, the assays were as follows:

HI - The standardised and validated micromethod uses four HI units of the appropriate antigen and a 0.5% horse erythrocyte suspension. All HI assays were performed in duplicate in the same run along with control sera and each run was judged against acceptance criteria. The validation results of the assay based on the Indonesia strain have been provided. SNA  The  previously  described microneutralisation  assay  was  used.  All  SN  assays  are  run  in triplicate in the same run. The assay variability is controlled by the use of control sera included in each run  and  each  run  is  judged  against  acceptance  criteria.  The  assay  cut-off  is  defined  as  1:28,  which results from pre-dilution of the sera and is the first computable ND50 value. The specificity of the neutralisation assay has been estimated by testing a set of samples from naïve (i.e.  previously  unvaccinated) children  (6 to 9 years) collected before vaccination with the seasonal vaccine.  Out  of  46  subjects,  one  was  slightly  positive.  These  data  are  described  in  the  Validation Report. Based on this result, the specificity of the SNA can be estimated to be 98%. Q-PAN-001 This was a randomised, observer-blind, multi-centre, active-controlled study conducted at 10 sites (7 in the US and 3 in Canada). The primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate the adjuvant activity of AS03 by comparing immune responses to Q-Pan H5N1 3.8 µg HA with AS03 at full [A] and half [B] strengths versus Q-Pan HA 3.8 µg alone. The primary immunogenicity endpoint was the Day  42  HI  antibody  response  to  homologous  virus  in  subjects  receiving  two  doses  of  vaccine Superiority  of  the  adjuvanted  formulation  was  declared  if  the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  confidence interval (CI) on the geometric mean titre (GMT) ratio exceeded 2.0 and the lower bound of the 95% CI on the difference in seroconversion rate (SCR) exceeded 15%.

Formulations, lots and treatment group allocations were as follows:

| Phosphate-buffered saline          |               | DD11A003A   | A          |

The following formulations were used in the different groups:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Group A ('Q000ASO3') -  Quebec manufactured 3,8 µg HA (A/Indonesia/5/05), no Adjuvant

Group B ('Q100AS03') -  Quebec manufactured 3,8 µg HA, full dose Adjuvant

Group C ('Q50AS03')   -  Quebec manufactured 3,8 µg HA, half dose Adjuvant

Group D ('D100AS03') -  Dresden manufactured 3,8 µg HA, full dose Adjuvant

Group E (\"D50AS03\")    -  Dresden manufactured 3,8 µg HA, half dose Adjuvant

Four blood samples were to be drawn at D0, D21, D42 and D182.

Subject  populations were  defined  as  in  previous  studies  with  H5N1  vaccine  (i.e.  total  vaccinated {VC}, according to protocol {ATP} for safety and ATP for immunogenicity).

The  sample  size  was  based  on  the  evaluation  of  superiority  of  Q-Pan  plus  adjuvant  versus  Q-Pan without adjuvant using the SCR and GMT at Day 42, both of which required a statistically significant result.  Each  test  was  to  have α =0.05  (two-sided)  at  a  power  of  95%,  yielding  an  overall  power  of approximately  90%  for  the  simultaneous  tests.  Based  on  the  FDA  draft  guidance  on  pandemic vaccines of March 2006 a 0.3 log10 mean difference (= a 2-fold difference in GMT ratio) for the HI antibody titres and a 15% difference in SCR were to be regarded as meaningful.

It was planned that if the first step of the analysis based on Day 42 data indicated that GMTs fulfilled the ≥ 2-fold  criterion  for  adjuvant  effect  and  Groups  B  and  C  both  demonstrated  a  Day  42  point estimate  for  the  rate  of  vaccine  homologous  HI  reciprocal  titres ≥ 40  of  at  least  76%  then  two additional groups were to be recruited as follows: · Q-Pan A/Indonesia/5/05 containing 1.9 µg of HA with full strength ASO3 on Days 0 and 21 · Q-Pan A/Indonesia/5/05 containing 1.9 µg of HA with half strength AS03 on Days 0 and 21. Data from these additional groups are described under study Q-Pan-010 below. HI up to D42 All 680 subjects (68 at each of the 10 study sites) received at least one dose of study vaccine and 648 were evaluable for immunogenicity. Quebec- versus Dresden-manufactured vaccine For this analysis: o Group B (Q100AS03) and Group C (Q50AS03) were pooled to form the Quebec group o Group D (D100AS03) and Group E (D50AS03) were pooled to form the Dresden group. For the groups to be considered equivalent the 95% confidence interval on the ratio was to be between 0.67 and 1.5. This criterion was met for A/Indonesia/5/05 and A/Vietnam/1194/04 as shown below.

When examined by age (18 - 40 and 41 - 64 years) the criteria for adjuvant effect were fulfilled in both strata  but  the  homologous  virus  SCR  dropped  4%  in  the  younger  age  group  and  12%  in  the  older group when the adjuvant strength was halved. Similarly, the GMT was only slightly affected in the younger age group but there was a 2-fold reduction in GMT in the older age group.

Seroconversion and seroprotection rates (SCRs and SPRs) The lower bound of the 95% CI for SCRs exceeded 40% at Day 42 in the four groups that received adjuvanted Quebec or Dresden antigen.

Due to the low numbers who were seropositive with respect to A/Indonesia before vaccination the SPRs followed the SCRs.

## Geometric mean titres (GMTs) and geometric mean fold rates GMFRs

The difference  in  GMTs  between  adjuvanted  and  unadjuvanted  vaccines  at  Day  42  was  very  large (being 321-480 in the adjuvanted groups and 11 in the non-adjuvanted group. A similar pattern was observed  for  GMTs  for  HI  antibody  to  A/Vietnam/1194/04  although  the  actual  GMTs  were  much lower for the clade 1 Vietnam strain. The GMFRs increased markedly after the second vaccine dose in the adjuvanted antigen groups to reach 93-95 with full strength adjuvant and 64-69 for half-strength adjuvant compared to only 2.1 in the unadjuvanted antigen group.

## HI at D182

At D182 only the groups that had received full-strength adjuvanted vaccine maintained SCRs (based on HI to homologous virus) with lower 95% CI that were ≥ 40%.

There was little difference between D182 SCRs in groups that received full or half-dose adjuvant and these groups had SCRs that were markedly superior to that in the unadjuvanted group. SCRs based on HI antibody to A/Vietnam/1194/04 were notably lower and were from 0% - 11% and 9% at Day 182.

At  D182  the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  percent  of  subjects  achieving  an  HI  antibody reciprocal titre ≥ 40 (SPR) was &lt; 70% in all groups. Actual SPRs were nearly identical to the SCRs. SPRs for  HI  to  A/Vietnam/1194/04  also  did  not  attain  the  70%  target  in  any  treatment  group  and ranged from 1-13%.

The  GMFRs were all  between  4.5  and  5.6  for  the  adjuvanted  groups  compared  to  1.1  in  the  nonadjuvanted  antigen  group.  The  difference  in  GMFR  between  adjuvanted  and  unadjuvanted  vaccine groups at Day 182 was similar to that observed at Day 21.

## NA at D42 and D182 - subset study

Up to 40% of tested subjects per group were seropositive for NA to the vaccine strain before the first dose and up to 80% were seropositive for NA against A/Vietnam/1194/04.

At baseline 12.8% to 23.4% per group had titres ≥ 1:80 for the homologous virus. Among 195 subjects across  the  four  adjuvanted  vaccine  groups  all  but  two  were  seropositive  at  Day  21  and  all  were seropositive  at  Day  42  and  at  D182.  At  D42  all  195  subjects  had  titres ≥ 1:80  and  there  was  little decline in this proportion by Day 182. D42 GMTs were highest in and similar between D-Pan (1497) and Q-Pan (1567) groups with full strength AS03. GMTs were 1242 and 1353 in the half strength AS03 groups and only 184 in the unadjuvanted group. There was less difference in GMTs between the adjuvanted vaccine groups at D182 (between 414 and 456).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After  two  doses  of  vaccine  all  who  were  seronegative  with  respect  to  A/Vietnam  at  baseline demonstrated  a  response  in  the  adjuvanted  treatment  groups.  At  Day  182  the  two  groups  that  had received full strength AS03 vaccines retained the highest response rates relative to baseline. At Day 182 the proportions with titres ≥ 1:80 were still 16 to 20 percentage points higher in the adjuvanted groups.

NA against the drifted clade 2 strains A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 (a clade 2.2 virus) and A/Anhui/1/05 (a clade  2.3  virus)  was  measured  in  sera  obtained  from  recipients  of  Q-Pan  vaccine  containing  full strength AS03. No subject was seropositive to A/Anhui/1/05 at baseline. At D42, 80.3% had NA titres against  A/Anhui  of ≥ 40  and  60.6%  had  titres ≥ 80.  However,  by  D182  only  23.6%  were  still seropositive. In contrast, the baseline seropositivity rate was 35.7% for NA to A/turkey/Turkey/1/05, at which time approximately 25% had titres ≥ 40.  At D42 all subjects were seropositive and 98.6% had titres ≥ 80. In addition, NA persisted such that at D182 60.7% still maintained a response.

## Data from the additional contingent arms

Data were provided up to D42. Data up to Day 182 will be available in February 2010.

As shown below the HI seropositivity rates at Day 0 were 0% - 6% but significant increases occurred in both groups by Day 21 with further increases up to Day 42 to reach SPRs of 84.0% and 95.9% in AS03B  and  AS03A  groups,  respectively.  In  the  older  age  stratum  (41-64  years)  an  absolute  21% reduction  in  SPR  was  observed  with  half  the  adjuvant  dose  (95.8%  for  AS03A  versus  75.0%  for AS03B) with a much smaller difference between adjuvant groups in the younger stratum (92.3% for AS03B versus 96.0% for AS03A). At day 42, GMTs were nearly two-fold higher in the AS03A group (331.6 versus 173.9) and were higher in the younger age stratum.

These results are in line with those already described for the 3.8 μ g H5N1 antigen recipients in Q-Pan001 study report. That is, halving the adjuvant dose had a relatively small effect on immune responses in the younger subjects but there was a more marked difference in the older age stratum. The effect was even more marked when the antigen content was halved. 3. SCR and GMT ratios for anti-IND/05 antibodies (ATP cohort for immunogenicity) Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Q-Pan-010

This  was  the  booster  phase  of Q-Pan-001 in  which  A/turkey/Turkey  vaccine  was  administered  at about 15 months after the initial immunisation series. There were 469 subjects enrolled, representing 69%  of  the  680  that  were  randomised  into  Q-Pan-001.  Subjects  were  randomised  to  receive adjuvanted  or  unadjuvanted  booster  doses  in  a  ratio  of  3:2.  Adjuvanted  vaccine  was  used  to  boost Groups A (primed with unadjuvanted vaccine; bottom in diagram), B1, C1, D1 and E1 (grey shaded boxes from top). Unadjuvanted vaccine was administered to Groups B2, C2, D2 and E2 (unshaded boxes from top).

On Day 0 of study 010 16.3% of subjects primed  with unadjuvanted vaccine (Group A) were still seropositive to A/Indonesia/5/2005 H5N1 compared to 68.6% primed with AS03A (Groups B1, B2, D1  and  D2)  and  63.5%  primed  with  AS03B  (Groups  C1,  C2,  E1  and  E2).  Seropositivity  against A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 H5N1 was observed for 10.2% in Group A, 55% primed with AS03A and 49% primed with AS03B.

The primary objective was to assess whether a single booster dose of H5N1 (A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005) adjuvanted  with  AS03A  (=  full  approved  dose)  is  more  immunogenic  in  subjects  primed  with  two doses  of  a  heterologous  H5N1  vaccine  adjuvanted  with  AS03  (full  dose  [A]  or  half  dose  [B]) compared to subjects primed with unadjuvanted antigen. HI responses to the booster dose were to be compared  against  the  FDA's  Center  for  Biologics  Evaluation  &amp;  Research  (CBER)  criteria  for  HI SCRs and SPRs at 10 days post-dose. Medicinal product no longer authorised

At 10 days post-dose the SCR was 96% in Groups B1 + D1 and 91.5% in Group A, with a difference that did not meet the target of a lower bound of 95% CI ≥ 15%. Thus, an adjuvanted booster dose after priming with an AS03A adjuvanted vaccine was not significantly more immunogenic compared to an adjuvanted booster dose after unadjuvanted priming. The difference in SCR between these groups was larger  for  subjects  who  were  seropositive  at  baseline  than  for  those  were  seronegative  at  baseline (14.3% and 5.4%, respectively) but the lower bound of the 95% CI did not meet the target ≥ 15% in either case. In addition, the difference between groups did not meet the target of a lower bound of 95% CI ≥ 15% for either age stratum.

B1 + D1 = Q-Pan and D-Pan Indo 3.8, AS03a x 2 + Turkey 3.8, AS03

For the adjusted GMT ratio for Groups B1 + D1 / Group A the lower level of the 95% CI was greater than 1 signifying a superior immune but was just less than 2 and thus failed to fulfil the co-primary objective.  Therefore an adjuvanted booster dose after priming with AS03A adjuvanted vaccine was not superior to adjuvanted booster dose after unadjuvanted priming.

The adjusted GMT ratio in Groups B1 + D1 (GMT 1206.6) to Group A (GMT 188.8) for subjects aged 18 to 40 years was 6.39 with a 95% CI of 3.53-11.58, which met the target of a lower limit of 95% CI greater than 2. In contrast, the adjusted GMT ratio in Groups B1 + D1 to Group A for subjects aged 41 to 64 years was 1.50 with a 95% CI of 0.85-2.63, which did not meet the target of a lower limit  of  95% CI greater than 2. Therefore the lack of difference between groups in GMT ratio was driven by the results of the older age stratum. For subjects receiving adjuvanted priming and booster doses (Groups B1 + D1) the SCR was 96.0% (95% CI 91.0-98.7%), which exceeded the CBER guidance target of 40%. The CBER guidance target for SCR was also exceeded both for subjects who were seronegative at baseline and those who were seropositive at baseline as well as in each age stratum. In addition, the SPR for Groups B1 + D1 was 99.2% (95% CI 95.7-100%), which exceeded the CBER guidance target of 70%. The SPR for each age stratum also exceeded the CBER guidance target.

For  subjects  who  received  two  priming  doses  adjuvanted  with  AS03A  (Groups  B1  +  D1)  or adjuvanted  with  AS03B  (Groups  C1  +  E1)  the  post-boost SCRs were  high  for  all  groups  and  the difference in SCR between Groups B1 + D1 and Groups C1 + E1 was only -0.43% (95% CI -5.92 to 5.28%) so it was concluded that there was no difference between responses to the booster according to the amount of adjuvant used for the priming doses.

The difference between AS03A adjuvanted and AS03B adjuvanted groups (B1+D1 versus C1+E1) in terms of SCR to A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 antibody at Day 10 by pre-vaccination status also showed no difference between priming groups. Furthermore the difference in SCR between Groups B1 + D1 and Groups C1 + E1 for subjects aged 18 to 40 years was 1.67% (95% CI -4.65 to 8.90%) while that for subjects aged 41 to 64 years was -1.69% (95% CI -11.42 to 8.96).

The adjusted GMT ratio of Groups B1 + D1 to Groups C1 + E1 was 1.06 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.44). The GMT ratio was 1.04 (95% CI 0.68-1.59) for subjects aged 18 to 40 years and 1.13 (95% CI 0.73-1.75) for subjects aged 41 to 65 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For  subjects  in  Group  A,  Groups  C1  +  E1  and  Groups  B1  +  D1,  the SCRs  at  Day  10 for A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 were 91.5%, 96.5% and 96.0%, respectively. Thus, subjects who received a booster vaccine with AS03A, regardless of whether priming was adjuvanted or unadjuvanted, had high SCRs on Day 10. In contrast, subjects who received a booster vaccine without adjuvant had lower point estimates of SCRs ranging from 64.6 to 72.9% across groups, regardless of priming condition. SCRs for A/Indonesia/5/2005 were very similar to A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 results. With the exception of  subjects  in  Group  A,  there  was  a  trend  for  lower  SCRs  for  the  41  to  64  years  of  age  stratum. However, the SCR 95% CIs overlap for all vaccine groups given the small sample size.

GMTs at Day 10 for subjects in Group A, Groups C1+E1 and Groups B1+D1 were 229.6, 810.5 and 847.3, respectively, with lower values at Day 42 of 155.4, 699.5 and 652.2. For subjects primed and boosted with adjuvanted vaccines, the GMT for subjects aged 41 to 64 years was approximately half of that seen in younger subjects. For subjects who received an unadjuvanted booster there was little difference between the age strata. Older subjects in Group A had GMTs that were nearly double those seen in the younger age stratum.

For Group A, Groups C1 + E1 and Groups B1 + D1, the SCRs at Day 42 for A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 were 87.2%, 95.6% and 96.1%, respectively. Day 42 SCRs for subjects who received a booster dose of unadjuvanted vaccine were lower than for subjects who received a booster dose of adjuvanted vaccine. SCRs  ranged  from  57.0  to  96.4  for  all  groups.  SCRs  for  A/Indonesia/5/2005  were  similar  to A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 results. As with SCRs at Day 10, with the exception of subjects in Group A, there was a trend for lower SCRs for the 41 to 64 years of age group compared with the 18 to 40 years age stratum. For Group A, Groups C1 + E1 and Groups B1 + D1 the SPRs at Day 10 were 93.6% (95% CI 82.598.7%), 100% (95% CI 96.8-100%), and 99.2% (95% CI 95.7-100%), respectively. The SPRs at Day 42 were similar or slightly decreased from Day 10 with values of 87.2% (95% CI 74.3-95.2%), 100% (95% CI 96.8-100%), and 98.4% (95% CI 94.5-99.8%), respectively. SPRs were very similar between the age strata. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Therefore it appeared that subjects who received AS03A or AS03B adjuvanted priming doses and a booster with AS03A adjuvant (Groups B1, C1, D1, and E1) had the most robust immune response at both Days 10 and 42. Also, as expected since both A/Indonesia/5/2005 and A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 are clade 2 viruses, the SPRs and GMTs were comparable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The GMT ratio for the A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 booster responses between subjects in Groups B1 + C1  ( Q-Pan priming  with  AS03A  adjuvant  booster)  and  Groups  D1  +  E1  ( D-Pan with  AS03A adjuvant booster) was 0.99 (95% CI 0.73-1.34). Similar results were observed between Groups B2 + C2  ( Q-Pan priming  with  unadjuvanted  booster)  and  Groups  D2  +  E2  ( D-Pan priming  with unadjuvanted  booster)  with  a  GMT  ratio  of  0.88  (95%  CI  0.61-1.27).  Therefore  the  site  of manufacture of HA did not seem to affect responses to the booster dose.

For Group A, Groups C1 + E1 and Groups B1 + D1, the GMFRs at Day 10 were 37.4, 56.3, and 61.6 and at Day 42 decreased to 25.3, 48.6, and 48.2, respectively. Overall, subjects who received AS03A adjuvanted booster vaccination (Groups A, B1, C1, D1, and E1) had much higher GMFRs than those who received  unadjuvanted  boosters  (Groups  B2,  C2,  D2,  and  E2).  The  GMFRs  for  unadjuvanted booster groups at Day 10 were within a range of 6.9 to 9.6 and at Day 42 were 4.9 to 7.8.

The GMFR for A/Indonesia/5/2005 for Group A was similar to the GMFRs in the other adjuvanted booster  groups  whereas  GMFRs  for  A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005  for  Groups  B1,  C1,  D1  and  E1  were roughly twice that of Group A. As previously seen with SCRs, with the exception of subjects in Group A, there was a trend for lower GMFRs for the 41 to 64 years age stratum compared with the 18 to 40 years age stratum.

## Discussion on Q-Pan-001 and Q-Pan-010

Q-Pan-001 compared Q-Pan and D-Pan containing antigen from the same strain without adjuvant (QPan  only)  or  with  full  or  half  dose  AS03.  The  applicant's  pre-defined  criteria  for  assessing  the comparability  of  immune  responses  at  D42  to  Q-Pan  and  D-Pan  when  each  contained  A/Indonesia were met. The data for individual groups did not indicate any consistent differences between Quebec and Dresden antigen groups whether administered with full or half-strength AS03 adjuvant.

HI seropositivity rates and GMTs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 and their respective 95% confidence intervals  were  near-identical  at  all  time  points  for  Q-Pan  and  D-Pan  with  corresponding  AS03 contents. Seropositivity rates, GMTs, SPRs and SCRs against heterologous virus (A/Vietnam/1194/2004) were slightly higher in the Quebec antigen group post-vaccination but in all cases the 95% CI overlapped.

At  Day  42  and  Day  182  in  Q-Pan-001  the  HI  antibody  to  homologous  virus  (A/Indonesia/5/05) elicited by Q-Pan and D-Pan was reasonably similar to that observed for HI to homologous virus (but in this case A/Vietnam/1194/2004) in the previously reported studies with D-Pan.

The  immunogenicity  of  Dresden  and  Quebec  antigen  when  each  was  formulated  with  AS03  was comparable. On this basis the data generated with D-Pan H5N1 can be considered to support the data available from the Q-Pan H5N1 studies, including the data from the D-Pan H5N1 study in children.

The additional arms of the study showed that 1.9 μ g H5N1 HA antigen with full dose (AS03A) or half dose  (AS03B)  adjuvant  was  sufficient  to  meet  the  three  CHMP  criteria  in  both  age  strata  after  two doses.  However,  as  had  been  shown  previously  with  the  approved  dose  of  HA,  there  were  some advantages for full dose AS03 compared to half dose AS03, especially in the older subjects.

Early  data  on  immune  responses  to  Pandemrix  (D-Pan  H1N1v)  suggest  that  a  single  dose  of  the approved amount of HA and AS03 may be sufficient in healthy adults aged 18-60 years. It cannot be surmised from these data that a single dose of a lower HA content (H1N1)v vaccine with full or half the amount of AS03 could suffice in any age group. Specific data would be needed to support any deviation from the current recommendation in the SPC for Pandemrix (H1N1)v. However, there is a possibility  that  a  single  dose  of  either  of  these  formulations  might  be  sufficient  in  one  or  both  age strata from 18-40 and 41-64 years.

A single booster dose of Q-Pan A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 adjuvanted with AS03A elicited an immune response at Day 10 that exceeded CBER guidance targets for HI SCR and SPR against the booster strain  and  the  priming  strain  in  subjects  who  had  been  primed  with  A/Indonesia/5/2005/AS03A.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Booster responses were comparable between groups that had received Q-Pan or D-Pan-manufactured HA plus AS03 during priming.

A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005/AS03A was not more immunogenic based on the protocol criteria in those who  had  been  primed  with  A/Indonesia/5/2005/AS03A  compared  to  those  who  had  received unadjuvanted  vaccine  in  Q-Pan-001.  The  immunogenicity  of  the  adjuvanted  booster  dose  was  also very similar among recipients of adjuvanted (full or half dose) vaccine for priming. All groups that received adjuvanted booster doses had SCRs in excess of 90% but the post-boost GMTs showed a clear trend to be higher in those who had received adjuvanted vaccine for priming. In addition, those primed  with  full  or  half  dose  AS03  and  boosted  with  AS03  vaccine  had  the  most  robust  immune response at both Days 10 and 42 after the booster dose.

This study did not demonstrate an inhibitory effect on the booster response of unadjuvanted priming as has been noted in some other trials. This may relate to the fact that the booster viral strain used in this study is more closely related to the priming antigen (clade 2.2 vs. 2.1) than has been the case in prior datasets  (clade  2.1  vs.  clade  1).  Additionally,  because  the  preceding  protocol  included  a  two  dose regimen only, there was no opportunity to assess whether adjuvanted or unadjuvanted formulations would be more effective if single dose priming were used.

Q-Pan-002 This  randomised,  observer-blinded  and  placebo-controlled  study  was  conducted  during  2008  at  40 centres in the US (30) and Canada (10). It included a lot to lot consistency study and an assessment of age-specific immune responses. Participants were to be aged 18 to 49 years and in good health or aged &gt; 49 years and in stable health. Subjects in each age stratum were randomly assigned (3:1 ratio) to receive vaccine from one of three lots or placebo. The study vaccine contained 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Indonesia/5/05 H5N1 plus the same AS03 and thiomersal content as already approved for DPan (i.e. before the variation to approve thiomersal-free product). The assignment of treatment was as follows: Medicinal product no longer authorised Table2 Apnis Arms A B C D E

Subjects in Groups A-D were to be stratified by age 18-30 years and 31-49 years. Subjects in Groups G &amp; H were to be stratified by age 64-75 years and &gt;75 years.

Placebo consisted of 0.5 ml of sterile preserved isotonic saline for injection administered intramuscularly (IM).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary immunogenicity objectives were:

- ¾ To  demonstrate  that  HI  antibody  responses  to  Q-Pan  at  D42  met  or  exceeded  the  CBER Guidance targets for SCRs and SPRs when tested separately for subjects aged 18 to 64 years and &gt; 64 years.
- ¾ To demonstrate lot to lot consistency in subjects aged 18 to 49 years. Equivalence was to be tested for each of the 3 pair wise ratios of HI GMTs based on a 2-sided 95% confidence bounds for all the 3 pair wise ratios falling between the limits 0.67 to 1.5.

The target sample size was approximately 4440 healthy adults aged 18 years or older in 8 dose groups (3330 to receive Q-Pan and 1110 placebo). Subjects were sub-randomised to have samples analysed for primary immunogenicity assessments and a subset of D182 sera was to be analysed.

Of 4561 randomised in the study 3072 were aged 18 to 64 years (2304 vaccine and 768 placebo) and 1489 were aged &gt; 64 years (1118 vaccine and 371 placebo). By D182 there had been 218 subjects withdrawn from the study, mainly due to loss to follow-up (58 Q-Pan and 24 placebo with a complete primary vaccination course; 24 and 13 with an incomplete primary vaccination course).

## HI at D42 and D182

Very few subjects were seropositive based on HI before vaccination in either of the age strata. The post-vaccination D42 SCRs were higher in the younger age stratum but the lower 95% CI in subjects in the two age strata who were seronegative at baseline exceeded the CBER requirements. In the QPan group, the D42 SCRs (and the lower 95% CI around these SCRs) exceeded the CHMP criteria in the 18 to 60 years and &gt; 60 years age strata.

Q-Pan  recipients  aged  18-64  years  and  &gt;  64  years  maintained  SCRs  at  D182  that  still  reached  or exceeded the  CBER criteria.  In  each  case  the  lower  95%  CI  exceeded  50%.  In  addition,  the  D182 SCRs in Q-Pan recipients still reached or exceeded the CHMP criteria.

The D42 the SPRs were almost the same as the SCRs and conclusions were generally the same. In contrast, at D182 the SPRs in Q-Pan subjects no longer met the CBER criteria but were &gt; 60% for both age strata and the lower 95% CI exceeded 55%. The SPR among Q-Pan recipients aged 18-60

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

years had fallen to 62.0% and was comparable with the SPR for the older cohort (63.5%). Therefore the rate in the younger cohort no longer met the CHMP criterion. The D42 GMFRs in both age cohorts met the CHMP criteria after vaccination (51.4 and 17.2, compared to 1.0 in the placebo groups) and D182 GMFRs in vaccinated subjects were 7.4 and 7.8.

Despite the difference in strain, the responses in the older cohort in Q-Pan-002 were comparable with those in the D-Pan study 010. The lower immune responses in the older subjects even when baseline data suggested a higher degree of priming most likely reflects immunosenescence.

## Assessment of lot to lot consistency based on HI GMTs

The 95% CI for the GMT ratios at D42 are shown in the next table. In each case these fell within the pre-specified limits and therefore the applicant concluded that lot to lot consistency was demonstrated.

## NA at D42

At baseline, the majority of subjects in the 18 to 64 years age group were seronegative for NA against A/Indonesia/5/05 (72%) and A/Vietnam/1194/04 (60%). At Day 42 all subjects tested in the 18 to 64 years group  were  seropositive  against A/Indonesia/5/05  and  all had  titres ≥ 1:80 while  the seropositivity rate against A/Vietnam/1194/04 was 96.7% and 85.1% had titres ≥ 1:80.

The majority of subjects aged &gt; 64 years were seropositive at baseline for the two viruses there was still  a  demonstrable response to vaccination with &gt;90% reaching titres of at least 1:80 against these viruses by D42.

A  4-fold  rise  in  NA  (vaccine  response)  was  documented  against  A/Indonesia/5/05  in  94%  of vaccinated subjects in the 18 to 64 years group and 78% of older subjects compared to rates against A/Vietnam/1194/04 of 62% and 27%. These differences reflect the fact that response rates to Q-Pan were higher in subgroups that were seronegative before vaccination.

NA GMTs were higher in the elderly for both viruses. For A/Indonesia/5/05 the GMT for the 18 to 64 years age group had increased by 66-fold at D42 while there was a 12-fold increase in the older age group. Increments in GMTs against A/Vietnam/1194/04 were 5-fold and just over 2-fold in respective age groups after two doses of Q-Pan. Again these data reflect baseline status differences by age.

## Discussion on Q-Pan-002

The study demonstrated that Q-Pan containing A/Indonesia/5/05 elicited HI responses to homologous virus  at  D42  that  met  the  CBER  and  CHMP  criteria  in  the  respective  age  groups.  However,  the responses in the younger age stratum were significantly higher than in the older age stratum. The SCR criteria and GMFR criteria were still met at D182 in both age strata while the CBER SPR criteria were not met in either of the age strata and the CHMP criteria were met only in the older age stratum. Lot consistency was demonstrated based on the pre-defined criteria.

Pre-vaccination NA seropositivity rates were higher than pre-vaccination HI seropositivity rates and were  higher  for  A/Vietnam  than  for  A/Indonesia.  Nevertheless,  there  was  a  clear  response  to vaccination in both age strata at D42 with responses documented with respect to vaccine-homologous virus and A/Vietnam.

Q-Pan-009 This  was  an  open-label,  randomised  study  in  Canadian  adults  aged  18-64  years  in  which  Q-Pan A/Indonesia/5/2005 plus AS03 adjuvant (single lots) was administered to equal groups as follows: Group A: One 3.8 µg dose A/Indonesia/5/2005/AS03 on Day 0 and Day 21 Group B: One 3.8 µg dose A/Indonesia/5/2005/AS03 on Day 0 and Day 14 Group C: One 3.8 µg A/Indonesia/5/2005/AS03 on Day 0 and Day 7 Group D: Two 3.8 µg doses A/Indonesia/5/2005/AS03 on Day 0 (one in each arm). The primary objective was to demonstrate that HI responses to H5N1/AS03 at Day 14 after the second dose (after D0 in Group D) met the CBER criteria for SCR and elicited seroprotective titres in at least 50%. The study was stratified by age 18-40 years and 41-64 years. At 14 days post-dose 2 the SCRs were lower when the interval between doses was &lt; 14 days. There was no appreciable difference between groups A and B or between groups C and D. The lower bound of the 98.75% CI for all treatment groups exceeded the CBER guidance targets for SCRs.

SCRs did not differ  greatly  by  age  group  but  were  slightly  higher  for  the  18-40  years  age  stratum within Groups A and B and for the 41-64 age stratum within Groups C and D. SCRs for Groups C and D were lower than those for Groups A and B regardless of age.

At Day 14 post-dose 2 the GMTs were  highest  in  Group  A  followed  by  Group  B  at  640 and  345, respectively. GMTs in Group C and Group D were 77.7 and 67.4, respectively. Subjects in the 18-40 age stratum in Groups A and B had higher GMTs compared to the older age stratum (1180.5 versus 378.7 for Group A and 418.5 versus 294.8 for Group B). Subjects aged 41-64 years in Groups C and D experienced slightly higher GMTs compared to the younger age stratum. Overall, GMTs for Groups C and D were lower than those for Groups A and B, regardless of age.

At 14 days post dose 2 for all treatment groups the SPRs showed no major differences by age group. However, subjects aged 18-40 years in Groups C and D did not meet the target 98.75% CI lower limit of SPR ≥ 50% (47.4% and 49.1%, respectively) whereas the older subjects in these two groups did meet the target. Subjects aged 18-40 years in Groups A and B had slightly higher SPRs than older subjects while subjects aged 41-64 years in Groups C and D had slightly higher SPRs than younger subjects. At 21 days post dose 2 the corresponding SPR values were 95.2%, 92.8%, 81.9% and 77.0% and the lower bound of the 95% CI for SPR exceeded the ≥ 50% target for all treatment groups. SPR values 21 days after the second dose did not differ greatly by age group. Medicinal product no longer authorised Table 28 Antibody

GMT values 21 days after the second dose differed by age group, which was especially apparent for Groups A and B. Trends between age groups were similar to those seen at Day 14 after the second dose. Overall, GMTs for Groups C and D were lower than those for Groups A and B, regardless of age.

Immune responses to drift-variant virus were lower than for vaccine-homologous virus. The GMFR values  were  much  lower  for  the  drift-variant  viruses,  particularly  within  Groups  A  and  B.  Immune responses against A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 were generally higher than against A/Vietnam/1194/2004.

Antibody titres were also compared between baseline, the day of administering dose 2 and the postdose data in groups A, B and C. There was an increase in antibody titres for all virus strains between the first  and  second  vaccinations. The data suggested that a longer interval between vaccinations is associated with a larger increase in HI antibodies, with the largest increases seen for Group A. This indicates that the HI antibody response continues to increase at least 21 days after a single vaccination.

## Discussion on Q-Pan -009

The data demonstrated that a dose interval of at least 14 days should be retained and that there are likely some advantages for 21 days between doses. However, these data on the effects of dose interval on responses to H5N1 vaccine may now be of low relevance to the (H1N1)v vaccine unless additional data suggest that a second dose of pandemic vaccine should be given at least in some age groups.

The additional data supported the current dose recommendations for Arepanrix H5N1 vaccine.

## Q-Pan-011

This  was  an  open-label  non-comparative  study  conducted  at  two  centres  in  Japan  and  with stratification  by age (20-40 and 41-64 years; N=50 per age stratum planned and enrolled). Subjects received two doses of Q-Pan H5N1 containing antigen from A/Indonesia/5/2005 plus AS03. HI was measured against A/Indonesia/5/2005 Clade 2.1, A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 Clade 2.2 and A/Vietnam/1194/2004  Clade  1  and  NA  responses  were  measured  against  A/Indonesia/5/2005  and A/Vietnam/1194/2004.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All  100  subjects  enrolled  were  evaluable  for  safety  and  immunogenicity  at  D42  and  only  one  was eliminated from the Day 182 ATP cohort for persistence. Prior to vaccination, 5/100 subjects were seropositive for HI antibody against A/Indonesia/5/2005, 4/100 for A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 and 6/100 for A/Vietnam/1194/2004. Pre-vaccination GMTs were similar between age strata and were low (all &lt; 6).

Seropositivity rates against each strain increased after the first and second doses in both age strata but were highest (with highest GMTs) for A/Indonesia and lowest for A/Vietnam at D42.

On Day 182, the GMTs against all three  strains  were  lower  versus  Day  42  but  higher  than  values observed at Day 21. In both age strata the GMTs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 were comparable to those  against  A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005  and  higher  than  observed  for  A/Vietnam/1194/2004.  The seropositivity rates and GMTs against vaccine-homologous and drifted strains tended to be higher in the older age cohort.

The  &gt;40%  SCR  threshold  was  exceeded  at  Day  42  in  both  age  strata  for  HI  antibodies  against A/Indonesia/5/2005 and A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 but not for A/ Vietnam/1194/2004. The SCRs were similar between age strata for all three strains tested.

The &gt; 40% SCR threshold was still exceeded on Day 182 for HI antibodies against A/Indonesia/05/2005 and A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005. The threshold was met in both age strata against A/Indonesia/05/2005 but was met only in the older age stratum for A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005. The ≥ 40% threshold for the lower bound of the 95% CI for seroconversion required by CBER was also still

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

met  for  HI  antibodies  against  A/Indonesia/05/2005  in  both  age  strata  but  again  only  the  older  age group still met the criterion against A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005.

The  &gt;70%  SPR  required  by  the  CHMP  for  adults  aged  18-60  years  and  the  CBER  criterion  were exceeded for  HI  antibodies  against  A/Indonesia/5/2005  strain  at  D42  in  both  age  cohorts  but  these thresholds were not met for the other two strains in either age stratum.

At D182 the &gt; 70% SPR threshold was not met against any strain but rates still followed the same pattern  by  strain  as  observed  at  D42.  However,  the  &gt;  70%  SPR  threshold  was  still  met  against A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain in the 41 to 64 years stratum (76.0%) while the CBER criterion was not met.

The  Day  182  SPRs  were  still  considerably  higher  compared  with  those  seen  D21  but  lower  than observed at D42. The SPR values against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were low on Day 182 in both age strata (6.1% for 20-40 years; 24.0% for 41-64 years).

The &gt;2.5 SCF threshold against the A/Indonesia/5/2005 strain was exceeded at D21 (3.0) and reached 28.6  by  D42.  At  D42  the  threshold  was  also  reached  for  A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005  but  not  for A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in either age stratum.

<!-- image -->

At D182 the &gt; 2.5 SCF threshold was still exceeded in both age strata for A/Indonesia/05/2005 and A/turkey/Turkey/01/2005.

Neutralising  antibody  (NA)  seropositivity  rates  against  A/Indonesia/5/2005  at  baseline  were  low (11/100).  By  D42  all  subjects  were  seropositive  in  both  age  strata.  Similarly,  baseline  GMTs  were 14.4 in the 20-40 years and 18.3 in the 41-64 years groups but reached 579.6 and 473.8 by D42. A higher proportion of subjects were already seropositive before vaccination against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 with 70% in the older and 30% in the younger age stratum and GMTs of 61.9 and 24.8, respectively. At D42 the seropositivity rates were 92.0% and 98.0% in respective age groups with GMTs of 106.5 and 154.7.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  D182  GMTs  and  seropositivity  rates  for  both  strains  were  still  high.  The  GMTs  in  each  age stratum were higher for vaccine-homologous virus. GMTs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 had decreased compared to Day 42 in each age stratum (from 579.6 to 240.5 and from 473.8 to 240.1) but GMTs against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  tended  to  increase  in  both  age  strata  (from  106.5  to  173.5  and  from 154.7 to 208.0) suggesting some natural boosting effect during the 5 months between samplings.

The  NA  SCR  against  both  strains  increased  after  the  second  vaccination  and  reached  97.0%  and 47.0% at Day 42, respectively. The D42 SCRs against A/Indonesia/5/2005 were comparable between age strata. The SCR against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 was higher in the younger group but this reflects the baseline differences in NA titres. On Day 182, the SCRs were 93.9% against A/Indonesia/05/2005 and 58.6% against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and again showed an age difference.

<!-- image -->

The proportions with NA titres of at least 1:40 and 1:80 did not change substantially between D42 and D182  against A/Indonesia/05/2005 and  were  comparable  between  age  groups.  However,  the corresponding percentages for NA against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 showed increments at the 1:80 level between D42 and d182, reflecting the observed increases in GMTs. This phenomenon applied in both age strata and the final rates were comparable between age groups.

## Discussion on Q-Pan-011

Overall  it  appears  that  this  study  in  Japanese  subjects  gave  comparable  immunogenicity  and  safety results  to  those  obtained  in  non-Japanese  populations  with  Q-Pan/AS03  vaccine  containing  antigen from A/Indonesia/5/2005.

## Study D-Pan H5N1-009, -022, -023

This open label study in three phases (009, 022 and 023) carried out with Pandemrix ('D-Pan') was divided into three parts as shown below:

|                                                 |                           | Phase C                   |

- 1.Full adult dose HA = 3.8 μg, Half adult dose HA = 1.9 μg HA

In Phase A randomisation was to half the adult dose (1.9 µg of HA) + half the AS03 or to Fluarix In Phase B and Phase C randomisation was to (allocation ratio 3:1) full HA/half AS03 ( Phase B ) or to the adult dose ( Phase C ) with a Fluarix control group.

## Immunogenicity up to D42

## Phase A

The pre-vaccination HI GMTs for A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 were &lt;1:10 and so seropositivity  rates  were  zero.  On  Day  21,  the  GMTs  against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  strain  were slightly  increased  in  the  Half  HA/Half  AS03  group  in  both  age  strata  and  then  increased  markedly after the second dose (540.3 for 6-9 years; 392.7 for 3-5 years). A similar pattern but lower response was seen against A/Indonesia/05/2005 (60.8 for 6-9 years; 53.5 for 3-5 years).

In the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine group

Medicinal product no longer authorised

- ¾ By Day 42 the SCRs and the SPRs against the vaccine strain were 95.9% to 100% while SCRs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 were 71.4% to 74.4 %. The ≥ 70% threshold for the lower bound of the  95%  CI  for  seroprotection  as  defined  in  the  CBER  Guidance  was  only  met  for  HI  against A/Vietnam/1194/2004.
- ¾ On Day 42 the SCFs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were 78.5 and 108.1 while SCFs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain were 10.7 and 12.2.

In the Fluarix group no subject seroconverted for HI  antibody  to  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  or A/Indonesia/05/2005 and no subject was seroprotected.

On Day 42 the NA GMTs against the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the AS03 group had reached 1155.1 in the 6-9 years age stratum and 1044.4 in the 3-5 years age stratum, whereas the increase from baseline in the control group was very small (104.5 for 6-9 years; 158.4 for 3-5 years). The NA seropositivity rates against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the AS03 group increased to 90.7% in the 6-9 years age stratum

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and to 91.7% in the 3-5 years age stratum on Day 21, with non-overlapping CIs (when compared with Day 0). All subjects in the AS03 group were seropositive for NA at D42 while the seropositivity rates in controls for NA against the vaccine strain on Days 21 and 42 were within the same range (78.6% 80.0%).

On Day 42 the NA SCR against the vaccine strain in the Half HA/Half AS03 group had reached 100% in the 6-9 years age stratum and 95.6% in the 3-5 years age stratum. In contrast there was no further increment in SCRs in the control group after a second dose of Fluarix.

## Phase B

The pre-vaccination HI GMTs for antibody against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 were &lt;1:10 in all vaccine groups and age strata except for one subject in the 3-5 years cohort. By Day 42 GMTs for HI against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the AS03 vaccine group were 615.8 for 6-9 years and 678.1 for 3-5 years age groups and reached 64.9 to 73.7 against A/Indonesia but were still below the cut-off value in the control group. Seropositivity rates followed the same pattern as the GMTs.

In the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine group the Day 42 SCRs and SPRs against the vaccine strain reached 97.8% for subjects aged 6-9 years and 97.6% for subjects aged 3-5 years. SCRs and SPRs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 increased to 68.9% and 76.2% in respective age groups. The ≥ 70% threshold for the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  CI  as  defined  in  the  CBER  Guidance  was  met  for  HI  against A/Vietnam/1194/2004. At Day 42 the SCFs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were 123.2 for 6-9 years and 132.3 for 3-5 years. The increments in SCFs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain were relatively modest (13.0 and 14.7).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the Fluarix group no subject seroconverted for HI  antibody  to  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  or A/Indonesia/05/2005 and no subject was seroprotected.

Pre-vaccination  NA  GMTs  were ≥ 1:28  and  were  25.6  to  65.5  while  baseline  seropositivity  rates ranged from 47.1% to 78.6%. On Day 42 GMTs exceeded 1500 in the AS03 group but there was a negligible increase in the control group. The seropositivity rates and seroconversion rates followed the same pattern as the GMTs.

## Phase C

Pre-vaccination GMTs for HI antibody against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 were &lt;1:10 regardless of age stratum or vaccine group and so seropositivity rates were zero. Day 21 HI GMTs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were slightly increased in the AS03 vaccine group in both age strata and by Day 42 they had reached 883.5 for 6-9 years and 956.4 for 3-5 years. HI GMTs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 in the AS03 group were also much higher at D42 (92.5 for 6-9 years; 167.9 for 3-5 years) compared with D21. Corresponding seropositivity rates followed a similar pattern and by D42  all  subjects  in  both  age  strata  were  seropositive  against  A/Vietnam  while  rates  against A/Indonesia/05/2005 had reached 83.7% in the 6-9 years age stratum and 95.5% in the 3-5 years age stratum.

In  the  AS03  vaccine  group  the  Day  42  SCRs  and  SPRs  were  100%  for  both  age  strata  against A/Vietnam and 79.1% to 95.5% against A/Indonesia. The ≥ 70% threshold for the lower bound of the 95%  CI  for  seroprotection  as  defined  in  the  CBER  Guidance  was  met  for  HI  antibody  against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in both age strata and was met against A/Indonesia/05/2005 in the 3-5 year age stratum. On Day 42 the SCFs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were 176.7 and 191.3 compared to 18.5 and 33.6 against A/Indonesia/05/2005.

In the control group no subject seroconverted for HI against either strain and none was seroprotected with the exception of one subject with a response to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 on Day 21 only.

Pre-vaccination NA GMTs were ≥ 1:28 and were generally comparable between the age strata (range 25.6 to 37.3). Despite the low GMTs, the baseline seropositivity rates ranged from 30.8% to 46.7%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

By Day 42 NA GMTs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 increased about 10-fold in the AS03 group in both age strata and all children were seropositive whereas there was no further increase in GMTs in the control group and the seropositivity rates ranged from 61.5% to 87.5%. The seroconversion rates also showed the marked differences between AS03 and control for both age strata.

## Comparison between Phases at D42

There was a trend for higher HI GMTs and SCFs against both strains and a higher NA GMT against the vaccine strain with the formulations tested in Phases C and B compared to Phase A. The immune response  tended  to  be  higher  in  Phase  C  when  compared  with  Phase  B.  When  comparing  the formulation used in Phase C or in Phase B with that used in Phase A the difference between A and C was marked whereas the difference between A and B was much less apparent. There were advantages for C over B for HI and NA GMTs and for HI responses to A/Indonesia.

## Immunogenicity at Month 6

By Month 6 the HI GMTS had fallen but were still at least 6-fold higher  than  the  pre-vaccination GMTs in the groups that had received AS03 vaccines. Against A/Vietnam the seroprotection rates at Month 6 in children who received the adult dose vaccine in Part C of the study were 82.8% for 3-5 year-olds  and  78%  for  6-9  year-olds.  These  rates  compare  with  56%  and  63.6%  in  respective  age groups who received the half/half vaccine in Part A and with 70.2% and 68.9% who received full dose HA and half AS03 in Part B. The 95% CI overlap between Parts A, B and C within each age stratum. The results for the other parameters shown follow a similar pattern.

In the Fluarix groups in each Part of the study there was no difference between the D0 and the Month 6 HI seropositivity rates and GMTs against either A/Vietnam or A/Indonesia in 3-5 year-olds or 6-9 year-olds. Therefore there was no evidence of any augmentation of the HI immune response as a result of intervening natural exposure to cross-reacting antigens between D42 and Month 6.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Against the heterologous A/Indonesia strain 69% of children aged 3 to 5 years who had received the adult dose were seroprotected at Month 6 compared to 6.0% from Part A and 48.9% from Part B of the study. Corresponding rates in children aged 6 to 9 years were 61% versus 4.5% and 26.7%.

However, in the Fluarix group the GMTs increased between D42 and D180. In the younger age group (3-5 years) the increment was small (from 166 to 200) but is none the less remarkable since a drop in GMT would usually have been expected. In the older age group (6-9 years) the increase was by 6-fold (from 75 at D42 to 482 at D180). These results suggest that natural exposure to cross-reacting antigens had occurred in the interim period.

SPR = percentage with antibody titre ≥ 40 1/DIL; SCR = percentage with antibody titre ≥ 40 1/DIL after vaccination for initially seronegative subjects, or ≥ 4-fold the pre-vaccination antibody titre for initially seropositive subjects; SCF = fold increase in GMTs post-vaccination compared with pre-vaccination; PRE = pre-vaccination; PII(M6) = post-vaccination at Month 6 NA against A/Vietnam at Month 6 was reported from Part A of the study (i.e. half adult dose versus Fluarix) and showed that in the AS03 vaccine group the GMTs had dropped to a similar degree in both age strata. As at D42 (GMTs 1026 and 1111) the actual GMTs at D180 were comparable for children aged  3-5  years  and  6-9  years  (776  and  759).  At  Month  6  all  children  who  had  received  the  AS03 vaccine had NA titres of at least 1:80. Medicinal product no longer authorised

As a result the seroconversion rates in the 6-9 year-olds at Month 6 were 95% for the AS03 group and 93% for the Fluarix group. Also, all children aged 6-9 years who received Fluarix had NA titres of at least 1:80 at Month 6, while the corresponding rate in the 3-5 year-olds was 80%.

PII(M6) 14 NA was measured against A/Indonesia/05/2005 at Day 42, Month 6 and Month 12 in children who received half dose HA + half ASO3 (Phase A subjects) or Fluarix (control group). The Day 0 samples were erroneously not tested. These samples will be tested and the results will be submitted as they become available. There was a significant heterologous immune response at each time point and the comparison with the control group indicates that D-Pan H5N1 elicited cross-reactive immunity. There were decreases in GMTs  from  D42  to  Month  6  and  Month  12  but  the  proportions  with  NA  titres  of  at  least  1/80 remained high in both age groups (89.6% at Month 6 and 87.2% at Month 12 in the 3-6 years group and  90.2%  at  Month  6  and  82.9%  at  Month  12  in  the  6-9  years  group.  There  was  a  stark  contrast between NA titres in the D-Pan H5N1 group and the Fluarix control group. Discussion on D-Pan H5N1-009 The CHMP considered that the D42 HI data did not fully discriminate between dose groups, but the Month 6 data indicated a strong advantage for using the full adult dose especially in terms of antibody against the drifted strain. Nevertheless all children in the half adult dose group were later shown to have NA titres of at least 1:80 against A/Vietnam. The NA titres at Month 6 and Month 12 against A/Indonesia were reported later and gave a markedly different picture to that provided by the HI data against this strain up to Month 6. On the basis of these additional NA data, as well as the previous observation that all children who received the half adult dose still had NA titres against A/Vietnam at Month 6, the SPC for Pandemrix (H1N1)v suggests that half the adult dose (i.e. 0.25 ml vaccine) may be sufficient for children aged &lt; 10 years.

There are no data on the use of Q-Pan H5N1 or Arepanrix in children. Study Q-Pan-001 in adults supports  a  conclusion  that  the  data  obtained  from  D-Pan  H5N1-009  in  children  may  provide  an indication of how Q-Pan H5N1 would perform in the same age group. On this basis it is proposed that the  Arepanrix  SPC  carries  the  same  dose  recommendations  as  the  Pandemrix  SPC  for  children. Emerging data with Pandemrix in children, which are expected before data with Arepanrix, should be reflected in both SPCs until such time as Arepanrix-specific data become available from various age groups.

## Study H1N1-017

This is a Phase III, multi-centre, observer-blind, randomised (1:1) study with two parallel groups in approximately  320  healthy  subjects  aged  18-60  years.  Each  group  received  either  Arepanrix  or Pandemrix at Day 0 and Day 21.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  primary  objective  of  the  study  is  to  assess  immunological  equivalence  (in  terms  of  vaccinehomologous  virus  H1N1  HI  antibody  GMTs)  between  Arepanrix  and  Pandemrix  at  D21  based  on limits of two-sided 95% CI for the GMT ratio within the 0.5 - 2.0 interval.

One of the secondary objectives was to assess immunological equivalence in terms of seroconversion rates at D21 based on two-sided 95% CIs for the difference in SCRs falling within the -10% to +10% interval.

The study actually enrolled 167 subjects into each group of which one subject in the Pandemrix group had withdrawn consent up to D21. The mean age of subjects was 40 years and there was an equal split between genders. The history of prior seasonal influenza vaccinations was as follows:

Prior  to  vaccination  43%  in  the  Arepanrix  group  and  38%  in  the  Pandemrix  group  were  HI seropositive with respect to the vaccine strain with GMTs around 10. However, only 11% and 13% per group were already seroprotected. At D21 all subjects were seropositive with overall GMTs of 334 and 386 in respective groups. The second table below shows that the comparison of overall GMTs met the pre-defined criterion for immunological equivalence.

The overall study results also showed that all CHMP criteria were met in both vaccine groups after the first dose with comparable SCRs, SPRs and SCFs although there was a trend to slightly lower rates in the Arepanrix group and the SCFs reflected the slightly lower GMT in the Arepanrix group.

The comparison of SCRs also met the pre-defined criterion for immunological equivalence since the 95% CI fell within (-0.82 and 8.74).

The  D21  GMTs  in  each  group  were  higher  in  the  subsets  already  seropositive  at  baseline  (485 Arepanrix and 448 Pandemrix in the two vaccine groups) compared to those previously seronegative (251  Arepanrix  and  352  Pandemrix).  In  each  case  the  95%  CI  overlapped  despite  the  numerically lower GMT for Arepanrix in the seronegative subset.

Tables were also provided that compared responses by prior vaccination history. As shown below, the rates of pre-vaccination HI seropositivity were higher in each vaccine group in those with a history (&gt; 50% vs. &gt;25%) but GMTs were in the range 7-14. The D21 GMTs were from 303 to 456 but all 95% overlapped and GMTs were lower in those with a vaccine history in each group.

Other features in these tables were SPR of 100% in Arepanrix subjects with no history vs. 95% in those with a history and slightly lower SCRs in those with a history. The SCFs were much lower for those  with  vs.  those  without  a  history  (95%  do  not  overlap)  within  each  vaccine  group  but  the comparisons  between  corresponding  subsets  in  the  Arepanrix  and  Pandemrix  groups  all  gave overlapping 95% CI.

Variation Pandemrix II-28 was based on further information sent from the MAH to the Rapporteur between  November  20 th and  December  2 nd ,  including  the  data  filed  in  the  variation  received  27 th November 2009.

Data generated with Pandemrix (D-Pan, H1N1) in infants, children, adolescents and elderly: Infants and children aged 6-35 months of age: In variation II/025 the MAH of Pandemrix provided an abridged study report describing safety and immunogenicity data following vaccination with one half of the adult dose of Pandemrix (i.e. 1.9 µg HA +AS03B) in 51 children aged 6-35 months. The safety and HI immune response data were reported according  to  the  three  pre-defined  age  strata  with  17  subjects  per  stratum.  These  data  raised  no particular concerns and have already been summarised in the SPC. The CHMP did not feel able ath the time of this variation to recommend the option of a single half adult dose in this age group based only on the HI data available.

The HI data after each half adult dose demonstrated a marked immune response to the second dose in terms of increments in GMTs in each of the three age strata. The limited post-dose 1 NA data from CDC support a conclusion that there is a good response to a first half adult dose but likely leave room for a marked increment in NA also to occur after a second dose. The available data are insufficient to indicate  whether  a  single  half  adult  dose  in  this  age  group  would  be  sufficient  but  this  hypothesis cannot be ruled out.

## Elderly (&gt;60 years)

Another clinical study (H1N1-008) assessed for Pandemrix variation II-23, evaluated immunogenicity in healthy subjects (N=120) aged &gt;60 years (stratified in ranges from 61 to 70, 71 to 80 and &gt; 80 years of age).  The anti-HA antibody responses 21 days after a first dose were as follows:

| anti-HA antibody        | Immune response to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like   | Immune response to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like      | Immune response to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like   | Immune response to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like      | Immune response to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like   | Immune response to A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like     |

The CHMP further considered that the dose recommendations for Arepanrix should match those for Pandemrix except that the introductory sentence in 4.2 and the relevant sections in 5.1 should clarify which data were obtained with Pandemrix , Q-Pan H5N1 or with Arepanrix (H1N1).

Overall discussion on immunogenicity The  applicant  has  conducted  a  full  clinical  development  programme  with  Q-Pan/AS03  vaccine containing H5N1 antigens. There are sufficient data in adults that sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC can reflect the Q-Pan H5N1 data.. While the data from D-Pan H5N1-009 were considered supportive to include dose recommendations for children, the CHMP considered that the available data generated so far with D-Pan H1N1 (Pandemrix) in infants, children, adolescents and elderly should be included in the PI. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  addition,  the  CHMP  highlighted  that  the  baseline  serostatus  of  subjects  in  study  H1N1-017  was comparable with that reported in the Pandemrix H1N1 studies thus far in subjects aged 18-60 years.

The HI data at D21 showed that both vaccines elicited immune responses that met the CHMP criteria regardless  of  baseline  serostatus  and  prior  vaccination  history.  There  was  a  trend  to  lower  HI responses  in  the  Arepanrix  group  but  the  pre-defined  equivalence  criteria  for  GMT  and  SCR comparisons were met overall and in each subgroup by baseline serostatus. These comparisons also met the pre-defined criteria according to seasonal influenza vaccination history with the exception of SCRs in the subjects with such a history.

## Clinical safety

Due to the variability in study designs and populations the safety data are described by study.

## Q-Pan-001 and Q-Pan -002

Overall 2369 subjects aged 18-64 years and another 1087 subjects aged &gt; 64 years received at least one dose of Q-Pan and were eligible for the ATP safety cohort. The numbers of doses evaluated for reactogenicity were 7048 for Q-Pan and 298 for D-Pan in these two studies.

In Q-Pan-001 pain was the most commonly reported solicited local symptom. There was no evidence of  increasing  local  reactogenicity  as  a  function  of  the  second  dose.  Incidences  of  solicited  local symptoms following vaccination with Q-Pan or D-Pan vaccines with full dose AS03 were comparable.

Solicited local symptoms (per dose) in study Q-Pan-001 (Total vaccinated cohort)

Study (schedule) Group H5N1 split Quebec (HA 3.8 μ g) AS03 full H5N1 split Dresden (HA 3.8 μ g) AS03 full In Q-Pan-002 pain was the most commonly reported solicited local symptom in subjects aged &lt; 65 years  both  the  Q-Pan  group  and  the  placebo  group  while  redness  and  swelling  were  much  less common. Local reactogenicity did not worsen after the second dose relative to the first dose. In those aged &gt;64 years pain was again the most commonly reported solicited local symptom in both the Q-Pan group and the placebo group but was reported at slightly lower rates than in younger subjects in this same study. Rates for grade 3 pain were 0.8% with Q-Pan versus 0.3% in the placebo group and were lower than in the younger age group. Redness and swelling were much less common than pain in both treatment  groups  and  only  one  Q-Pan  vaccine  dose  was  followed  by  swelling  &gt;100  mm  with  no medical attention required for any solicited local adverse event. In  Q-Pan-001  muscle  ache  was  the  most  commonly  reported  solicited  general  symptom  and  was reported at much higher rates in the groups receiving adjuvanted vaccine (30.9%-41.6%) but rates of grade 3 muscle aches were 1-4%. Incidences of solicited general symptoms following vaccination with Q-Pan or D-Pan vaccines were similar when formulated with the same adjuvant content. In  Q-Pan-002  subjects  aged  18-64  years  muscle  ache  was  the  most  commonly  reported  solicited general  symptom and was reported at a higher rate for the Q-Pan group (39.3% of doses) than the placebo group (13% of doses). The incidence of grade 3 muscle aches was 2.3% of doses in the Q-Pan group and 1.1% in the placebo group. In those aged &gt; 64 years incidences of general symptoms were lower  than  in  the  younger  age  group.  Muscle  ache  was  again  the  most  common  although  grade  3 muscle ache was reported by 0.6-0.7%. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  Q-Pan-001  at  least  one  unsolicited  AE  was  reported  following  24.5%  of  doses  in  the  group receiving  non-adjuvanted  Q-Pan  vaccine,  27.2%  and  25.1%  in  the  groups  receiving  Q-Pan  vaccine with  full  and  half  dose  AS03,  respectively,  and  30.2%  and  36.3%  in  the  group  receiving  D-Pan vaccine with full and half dose AS03 No adverse event was reported following more than 5% of doses in a treatment group.

Vaccine-related  unsolicited  AEs  were  reported  following  7.1%  of  doses  of  non-adjuvanted  Q-Pan vaccine, 12.6% and 10.0% of doses of Q-Pan vaccine with full and half dose AS03, respectively, and 14.4% and 13.7% of doses of D-Pan vaccine full and half dose AS03, respectively. The only vaccinerelated unsolicited AE reported with an incidence greater than 2.5% in a treatment group was nausea, which was reported following 0.6% to 3.0% per group. The other most commonly reported vaccine-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

related AEs (reported following more than 1% of doses in a treatment group) were lymphadenopathy and headache.

In the younger age cohort of Q-Pan-002 at least one unsolicited AE was reported following 24.5% of doses in the Q-Pan group and 23.4% in the placebo group. No single adverse event was reported with more than 2.5% of doses. Lymphadenopathy occurred following 0.5% of Q-Pan doses and 0.9% of placebo doses. Vaccine-related unsolicited AEs were reported following 10% of Q-Pan vaccine doses and 6.2% of placebo doses. The only vaccine-related unsolicited AEs reported following more than 0.5% of doses in either treatment group were nausea (1.1% Q-Pan and 0.9% placebo), injection site pruritus  (0.9%  and  0.2%),  injection  site  warmth  (0.9%  and  0.1%  of  doses)  and  lymphadenopathy (0.5% and 0.7%).

In the older cohort at least one unsolicited (AE) was reported following 21.8% of Q-Pan doses and 18.1%  of  placebo  doses.  No  adverse  event  was  reported  with  more  than  1.7%  of  doses  in  either treatment group. Vaccine-related unsolicited AEs were reported following 6.9% of doses in the Q-Pan group and 4.5% of doses in the placebo group. Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported following 2.2% of Q-Pan vaccine doses and 2.6% placebo doses. The most commonly reported were back pain (0.2% versus 0.1%), diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting (each 0.1% per group).

No vaccine-related SAEs were reported up to Day 182 in Q-Pan-001. Up to D182 there were 15 SAEs reported  in  six  subjects  of  which  four  in  two  subjects  occurred  before  D42.  As  shown  in  the  table 3/302 (1%) subjects in the Q-Pan group reported a total of 4 SAEs of which two received the full dose vaccine.  In  addition,  3/299  (1%)  vaccinated  with  one  of  the  AS03-adjuvanted  D-Pan  vaccine formulations reported 11 SAEs including two subjects with 3 SAEs in the full dose D-Pan group.

There were no reports of NOCD up to D42 in Q-Pan-001. One subject up to D182 had a breast mass (Q-Pan  with  full  dose  AS03)  that  met  the  criteria  for  a  NOCD  but  was  not  considered  treatmentrelated. Screening of the database for AEs with potential immune-mediated causation up to Day 182 identified reports in &lt;3% of subjects overall, including 2.6% in the non-adjuvanted HA group, 2.0%, and 2.6% in the Q-Pan groups and 2.6% and 1.4% in the D-Pan groups. Many of these events seemed to be due to concurrent conditions or other environmental exposures, and essentially all proved to be transient and did not establish chronicity. In Q-Pan-002 reports of preferred terms listed as AESI/IMDs included 7 events in the Q-Pan group (facial  palsy,  fourth  cranial  nerve  palsy,  erythema  nodosum,  psoriasis  [2  subjects]  and  polymyalgia rheumatica [2 subjects]   and one in the placebo group (ocular myasthenia). None of these symptoms was  considered  vaccine-related  by  the  investigators  and  none  was  an  SAE.  The  3:1  randomisation must be taken into account when considering potential associations with this relatively uncommon set of conditions. Six subjects died in study Q-Pan-002 including one death within D42 from myocardial infarction in a 59-year-old  male  at  17  days  following  one  dose  of  Q-Pan.  The  other  five  deaths  (3  in  the  Q-Pan group) occurred between Day 42 and Day 182 of which three had received Q-Pan. All events were considered by the investigator to be not related to vaccination. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In Q-Pan-002 up to D42 in the age stratum 18-64 years, 8 subjects (0.3%) who received Q-Pan and one  subject  (0.1%)  in  the  placebo  group  reported  one  SAE  each.  In  the  age  stratum  &gt;64  years,  10 SAEs were reported by 8 subjects (0.7%) in the Q-Pan group and 2 subjects (0.5%) reported each one SAE in the placebo group. Up to D182 67/88 subjects that reported at least one SAE received Q-Pan (24 subjects aged 18-64 years and 43 subjects aged &gt;64 years). None of the SAEs was assessed as related to vaccination by the investigator.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No subjects dropped out due to a serious or a non-serious AE through Day 182 in Q-Pan-001. In QPan-002 up to D182 there were 14 subjects with serious (9; 4 Q-Pan and 5 placebo group) or nonserious AEs that led to premature discontinuation. One additional subject recorded as lost to follow-up in the Q-Pan group experienced a fatal SAE that was reported at later stage. None of the SAEs leading to  discontinuation  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  vaccination.  Five  subjects experienced non-serious AEs leading to discontinuation through D182 (3 subjects [0.1%] in the Q-Pan vaccine group and 2 subjects [0.2%] in the placebo group).

## Q-Pan 010

In  the  booster  phase  of  Q-Pan-001  the  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  any  symptom  (solicited  or unsolicited,  local  or  general)  was  approximately  twice  as  high  in  the  treatment  groups  receiving adjuvanted  booster  vaccine  (Groups  A,  B1,  C1,  D1  and  E1)  in  comparison  to  groups  receiving unadjuvanted  booster  vaccine  (Groups  B2,  C2,  D2  and  E2).  In  particular,  the  incidence  of  local symptoms reported was much higher for adjuvanted booster vaccine recipients.

The overall incidence of Grade 3 symptoms ranged from 0 to 13.6%. A larger percentage of subjects in the adjuvanted booster groups experienced Grade 3 general and local symptoms compared with the unadjuvanted booster groups but only in the isolated case of group E1 was this difference substantial. Grade 3 local symptoms occurred in three subjects, all of whom received adjuvanted booster vaccine. In  Group  E1  there  was  a  variety  of  Grade  3  solicited  general  symptoms,  none  of  which  required medical attention. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Pain at the injection site was reported by 79-88% in the adjuvanted booster vaccine groups and 1428% in the  unadjuvanted  booster  vaccine  groups.  Only  three  subjects  reported  Grade  3  pain  while Grade  2  pain  was  reported  by  104  subjects,  most  of  whom  had  received  adjuvanted  booster vaccination.  Redness  and  swelling  were  much  less  common  than  pain  in  all  treatment  groups.  One subject  in  Group  D2,  who  received  an  unadjuvanted  booster,  reported  swelling.  No  other  cases  of swelling  and  no  cases  of  redness  were  reported  in  the  unadjuvanted  booster  vaccine  groups.  Large areas  of  redness  or  swelling  (&gt;  100  mm)  were  not  reported  by  any  subject  and  no  subject  sought medical attention for any solicited local AE.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There was a slightly higher frequency of solicited general symptoms and Grade 3 symptoms for all groups with adjuvanted booster vaccine but there was no marked difference by age stratum. Muscle ache was the most commonly reported solicited general symptom overall and was reported at a higher rate for recipients of adjuvanted booster vaccine. The overall incidence of muscle ache was from 735% per group but only 0-7% per group reported severe muscle ache (Grade 3). Headache, fatigue and joint  pain  were  very  common  with  15.5-25.3%  of  all  subjects  reporting  these  events  and  with generally  greater  incidence  rates  reported  among  the  adjuvanted  booster  vaccine  groups.  Grade  3 fatigue,  headache  or  joint  pain  was  reported  by  0-8.6%  per  group  with  highest  rates  among  the adjuvanted booster vaccine recipients.

Shivering, sweating and temperature elevation were reported by &lt; 10% across all treatment groups. The incidence of temperature elevation was low, with 0-7% per group reporting this symptom. Severe shivering, sweating and elevated temperature were reported by 0-3.4% per group. Oral temperature ≥ 38.5º C occurred in one subject in Group D1.

There was a specific physical examination to assess the bilateral axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes  at  all  study  visits.  Lymph  node  pain  was  reported  in  one  subject  in  Group  D1  and lymphadenopathy was reported by four subjects (two in Group D1 and one in each of Groups B1 and E2). These AEs were deemed to be treatment-related by the investigators. None was severe (Grade 3) and none resulted in medically-attended visits. At least one unsolicited AE was reported by 150 subjects with a higher rate in those who received adjuvant  vaccine  for  priming  and  boosting.  The  most  commonly  reported  events  for  subjects  in  all treatment  groups  were  headache,  nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  oropharyngeal pain, nausea, cough, diarrhoea and bronchitis, none of which showed a clear trend between groups or association with adjuvant. Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported by 2.4 - 7.3% per group. Vaccinerelated unsolicited AEs were reported by 2.5 -13.3% per group. Of these, diarrhoea, lymphadenopathy, injection site warmth, pain in extremity and headache were reported by a slightly higher proportion who received an adjuvanted booster. Two SAEs of acute appendicitis and thyroid cancer were reported but both events were considered by the investigators to be unrelated to study vaccine. No subjects died during the study through Day 42 and no subjects experienced an AE or SAE that led to premature discontinuation. Q-Pan 009 The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  any  symptom  (solicited  or  unsolicited,  local  or  general)  was similar  among  all  treatment  groups  in  this  study.  The  overall  incidence  of  symptoms  was  similar among all groups for both doses, although the proportion of subjects reporting either local or general symptoms declined modestly after the second dose relative to the first in all treatment groups. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The overall per subject incidence of Grade 3 symptoms in Groups A, B, C, and D was 9.0%, 17.9%, 16.7%  and  6.4%  of  subjects,  respectively.  A  larger  percentage  of  subjects  in  Groups  A  and  B experienced Grade 3 symptoms (any symptom) after dose 2 than after dose 1. This trend was also seen for general symptoms.

Pain  was  the  most  commonly  reported  solicited  local  symptom  in  all  treatment  groups  and  was reported at similar rates for all groups (around 80%). Redness and swelling were much less common than  pain  in  all  treatment  groups  and  large  areas  of  redness  or  swelling  were  very  infrequent.  No subjects reported redness or swelling &gt; 100 mm in any treatment group while five reported redness &gt; 50 mm and eight reported swelling &gt; 50 mm.

Muscle ache was the most commonly reported solicited general symptom overall (51-64.5%) while severe muscle ache (Grade 3) occurred in &lt; 8% per group. Fatigue, headache and joint pain were fairly common,  with  rates  of  14.3-39.0%  per  subject  and  with  similar  incidences  reported  among  the different  treatment  groups  but  Grade  3  events  were  reported  in  1.3-5.3%.  The  remaining  solicited general  symptoms  (shivering,  sweating,  and  temperature  elevation)  were  reported  by  &lt;  20%  of subjects overall across all treatment groups. Temperatures ≥ 39º C were reported by 2.6% of subjects in Group B and by no subjects in all other treatment groups. At least one unsolicited AE was reported by 139 subjects overall but no AE was reported by more than 6.4%  of  subjects  in  a  treatment  group.  The  most  commonly  reported  events  for  subjects  in  all treatment  groups  were  lymphadenopathy,  nasopharyngitis,  oropharyngeal  pain,  nausea,  diarrhoea, injection site warmth and oedema peripheral, none of which showed a clear trend between groups or association with the duration between vaccinations. No subject experienced an AE that led to premature discontinuation from the study. There were six SAEs  reported  by  three  subjects  up  to  Day  51  but  all  were  considered  by  the  investigators  to  be unrelated to study vaccine and were non-fatal.

In these Japanese subjects the overall incidence of symptoms was high and comparable between age strata  and  all  subjects  reported  at  least  one  symptom.  Grade  3  local  and  general  symptoms  were reported  with  low  frequencies  ( ≤ 16%).  Subjects  from  the  20-40  years  age  stratum  reported  more Grade 3 general symptoms (10%, 5 subjects) compared to the older stratum but there was no clear difference between age strata in terms of Grade 3 local symptoms including those considered to be related to vaccination.

Local symptoms, predominantly driven by the incidence of injection site pain, were reported with high and similar frequencies in both age strata. Grade 3 local solicited symptoms were reported with low frequencies with Grade 3 pain at injection site reported in only one subject in the 20-40 years stratum. The overall per dose frequencies in both age strata ranged from 2% to 3% in the 20-40 years stratum and the 41-64 years stratum for redness and swelling/induration, respectively. In general, there was no increase in the incidence of local solicited symptoms of any type or grade between Dose 1 and Dose 2. There were no differences were observed in terms of reported frequency of joint pain and shivering between  the  age  strata.  In  contrast,  trends  for  higher  frequencies  were  observed  for  the  following solicited  general  symptoms  in  the  20-40  years  stratum:  fatigue,  headache,  muscle  aches,  shivering, increased sweating and fever. The reported frequencies of Grade 3 general symptoms were very low. Fatigue was the most frequently reported general symptom at 71% overall, 78% in the 20-40 years and 64% in the 41-64 years groups. Grade 3 and grade 3-related fatigue was reported only in the 20-40 years  stratum  (3  subjects,  6%).  Muscle  aches  was  the  second  most  frequently  reported  general symptom at 70% overall, 72% in the 20-40 years stratum and 68% in the 41-64 years stratum. Grade 3 muscle aches were reported only by one subject in the 20-40 years stratum. Medicinal product no longer authorised &gt;20mm

Headache was reported by 51.0% overall, 60% in the 20-40 years stratum and 42% in the 41-64 years stratum. There were no Grade 3 reports. Joint pain was reported by 32% and 36% per stratum with one Grade 3 report from a subject in the 20-40 years stratum.  Fever of any grade ( ≥ 38°C) was reported by 12% in the 20-40 years stratum compared to 10% of subjects in the 41-64 years stratum. Grade 3 and Grade 3-related fever was reported by one subject in the 20-40 years stratum with no reports of Grade 4 fever.

Unsolicited adverse events were reported by 51 subjects, including injection site pruritus, injection site warmth  and  nasopharyngitis.  Three  subjects  in  the  younger  cohort  reported  at  least  one  Grade  3 unsolicited adverse event (joint sprain, urticaria and asthma) and 28 reported at least one unsolicited adverse event which was causally related to vaccination (including the case of urticaria).

AEs prompting medically-attended visits were reported by 16 subjects. Of these, 13 subjects were in the 20-40 years stratum. However, no specific clinical pattern could be identified.

One female subject (aged 31 years) reported Grade 3 urticaria (worsening) one day after the second vaccination.  Urticaria  was  part  of  the  medical  history  of  the  subject  but  the  AE  was  deemed  to  be causally related to vaccination and occurred after a first episode of urticaria worsening (Grade 1) that appeared  two  days  after  the  first  injection.  The  first  episode  was  also  considered  to  be  related,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

although it did not result in a visit to a healthcare provider. Treatment after the first episode consisted of  oral  antihistamines.  Oral  betamethasone  and  intravenous  Neo-Minophagen  C  and  hydrocortisone were used for the second episode. Both episodes fully resolved after 8 days (first episode) and 9 days (second episode).

There were no SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs or pregnancies reported up to D182. The additional unsolicited AEs in the Annex report did not change the safety profile demonstrated up to D42.

## Phase A

In the 6-9 years age stratum, the overall incidence of AEs by subject was 96.1% in the AS03 group and  88.9%  in  the  control  group.  The  incidences  of  general  symptoms  were  comparable  between vaccine groups but local symptoms occurred more often in the AS03 group. There was no increased reactogenicity in either vaccine group after the second dose compared with the first dose.

In  the 3-5  years age  stratum,  AE  rates  were  generally  lower  than  in  older  children.  Incidences  of general symptoms per subject were comparable between vaccine groups but rates of local symptoms per subject were higher in the AS03 group. There was no increased reactogenicity in either vaccine group after the second dose compared with the first dose.

The incidence of grade 3 AEs was generally low with no difference between the vaccine groups in older children but with rates of 13.7% versus zero in children aged 3-5 years.

In the 6-9 year-olds the rates of pain were 61% for Fluarix and 76.5% for AS03 vaccine after the first dose (none and 5.9% with Grade 3) but were comparable after the second dose (none and 4% with Grade 3). In the 3-5 year-olds the rates of pain were higher with AS03 vaccine after both doses.

No deaths or other SAEs were reported and there were no AEs leading to withdrawal during this study phase.

Rates of solicited general symptoms per subject were not markedly different between vaccine groups in the 6-9 years age stratum. The rate of any fever (&gt; 37.5°C) after dose 1 of AS03 vaccine was 5.9% but no subject had Grade 3 fever (&gt; 39°C) and no subject in the Fluarix group had any fever. The rates for any fever after the second dose were 16.7% for Fluarix and 10.2% for AS03 vaccine while rates for Grade 3 fever were 5.6% and zero. The per-dose rates for any antipyretic use were 8% in both vaccine groups with per subject rates of 17% and 14% in respective groups. In the 3-5 years age stratum rates of solicited general symptoms per subject were higher than in the control group. The rate of any fever after dose 1 of AS03 vaccine was 9.8% but 3.9% had Grade 3 fever (&gt; 39°C). The corresponding rates after the second dose were 6% and zero. No subjects in the Fluarix group had fever after either dose. The per-dose rates of taking any antipyretic were 9% for Fluarix and 19% for AS03 vaccine, with per subject rates of 17% and 35%. Unsolicited  AEs  reported  up  to  51  days  after  the  first  vaccination  showed  no  particular  signal  or clinical pattern in any vaccine group.

## Phase B

In  both  age  strata  the  overall  incidence  incidences  of  AEs  and  rates  of  local  and  general  AEs  by subject  were  higher  in  the  AS03  vaccine  group  than  in  the  control  group.  There  was  no  increased reactogenicity  in  either  vaccine  group  after  the  second  vaccination  when  compared  with  the  first vaccination. There were more Grade 3 AEs in subjects aged 6-9 years in the AS03 group (8.2%) when compared with the control group (0.0%). Similarly, the incidence of Grade 3 AEs in subjects aged 3-5 years was higher in the AS03 group (11.8%) when compared with the control group (5.9%), mainly driven by a higher incidence of Grade 3 local symptoms.

The incidence of AEs with causal relationship to the vaccination in the subjects aged 6-9 years was 75.5% in the AS03 vaccine group compared with 58.8% in the control subjects. Also, among subjects aged 3-5 years the incidence of AEs assessed as causally related to the vaccination was 70.6% in the AS03 vaccine group and 35.3% in the control group.

In  both  age  strata  the  incidences  of  unsolicited  AEs  were  comparable  but  higher  in  the  younger subjects. Grade 3 AEs and AEs assessed as causally related to the vaccination were infrequent. One subject in the Full HA/ ½ AS03 group experienced an AE leading to premature discontinuation. Please see the separate AR on possible auto-immune diseases in vaccinees. There were no SAEs in Phase B during the study conduct up to Day 51.

In the 6-9 years age stratum the incidences per subject of solicited general symptoms were generally higher in the AS03 vaccine group but rates for Grade 3 symptoms were low. The rates of any fever (&gt; 37.5°C) after dose 1 were zero for Fluarix and 2% for AS03 vaccine and no subject had Grade 3 fever (&gt;  39°C).  The  corresponding  rates  after  the  second  dose  were  zero  and  6.4%  for  any  fever  in respective vaccine groups and zero and 2.1% had Grade 3 fever. The per dose rates for any antipyretic use  were  9%  and  12%  in  respective  vaccine  groups  with  per  subject  rates  of  18%  and  22%  in respective groups. In  the 3-5 years age  stratum,  solicited  general  symptoms occurred more often in the AS03 vaccine group than in the control group. The rates of any fever (&gt; 37.5°C) after dose 1 were 11.8% for Fluarix and 7.8% for AS03 vaccine and no subject had Grade 3 fever (&gt; 39°C). The corresponding rates after the second dose were 5.9% and 14.3% for any fever and 5.9% and zero had Grade 3 fever. Within this period  the  per  dose  rates  of  taking  any  antipyretic  (regardless  of  the  reason  for  use)  were  18%  for Fluarix and 17% for AS03 vaccine, with per subject rates of 29% and 30%.

## Phase C

In the both age strata the incidences of local and general AEs were higher in the AS03 group. The incidence of Grade 3 AEs in subjects aged 6-9 years was higher in the AS03 group (18.4%) when compared with the control group (5.6%). The incidence of Grade 3 AEs in subjects aged 3-5 years was also higher in the AS03 group (22.4%) when compared with the control group (0.0%) but did not seem to be driven by the incidence of local Grade 3 symptoms.

The incidence of AEs with causal relationship to the vaccination in the subjects aged 6-9 years was 93.9% in the AS03 vaccine group and 94.4% in the control group compared to 79.6% and 41.2% in respective groups in the younger age cohort.

Pain was the predominant solicited local symptom in both age strata and vaccine groups. Rates of pain were not higher after the second dose in either age stratum. Redness and swelling were also reported with a higher incidence in the AS03 group irrespective of age stratum. In the 3-5 years age stratum there was a trend for a higher incidence of induration, redness and  pain  upon  re-vaccination  but  this  was  not  observed  in  the  6-9  years  age  stratum  and  was  not observed  in  either  stratum  with  the  control  vaccine.  The  majority  of  these  events  were  Grade  1  in intensity, and there were few isolated Grade 3 cases in the AS03 group (none in the control group). Among 6-9 year-olds  rates  of  general  solicited  symptoms  were  higher  with  AS03  vaccine  and  the incidence of fever, headache, myalgia, shivering and sweating tended to be higher after Dose 2. Rates of  fever  after  dose  1  were  zero  in  the  Fluarix  group  and  12.2%  in  the  AS03  group  (1/6  of  these subjects  [2%  overall]  had  Grade  3  fever).  After  the  second  dose  rates  for  any  fever  were  zero  and 32.7% in respective vaccine groups (6/16 of these subjects [12% overall] had Grade 3 fever). These numbers give rates for fever overall/dose of zero for Fluarix and 22.4% for AS03 vaccine (7/22 of these doses [7% overall] being associated with Grade 3 fever). The per dose rates for any antipyretic use  were  14%  and  43%  in  respective  vaccine  groups  with  per  subject  rates  of  22%  and  65%  in respective groups.

In the 3-5 years age stratum solicited general symptoms predominated in the AS03 group (range 8.2% - 36.7%) when compared with the control group (range 0.0% - 5.9%). After dose 1 the rates for any fever were zero in the Fluarix group and 8.2% in the AS03 group (3/4 of these subjects [6% overall] had  Grade  3  fever).  After  dose  2  the  fever  rates  were  zero  and  31.3%  (2/15  [4%  overall]  of  these subjects had Grade 3 fever) in respective vaccine groups. These numbers give overall/dose rates for fever  of  zero  for  Fluarix  and  19.6%  for  AS03  vaccine  (5/19  of  these  doses  [5%  overall]  being associated  with  Grade  3  fever).  Within  this  period  the  per  dose  rates  of  taking  any  antipyretic (regardless  of  the  reason  for  use)  in  the  3-5  year-olds  were  15%  for  Fluarix  and  31%  for  AS03 vaccine, with per subject rates of 24% and 51%.

The incidence of unsolicited AEs was 55.1% in the AS03 group and 33.3% in the control group in the 6-9  years  age  stratum.  Grade  3  unsolicited  AEs  and  unsolicited  AEs  were  infrequently  assessed  as causally  related  to  the  vaccination.  In  the  3-5  years  stratum  the  incidence  of  unsolicited  AEs  was 53.1% in the AS03 group and 47.1% in the control group. Few subjects reported Grade 3 unsolicited AEs in the AS03 group (6.1%) and there were none in the control group. The incidence of unsolicited AEs assessed as causally related to the vaccination was 18.4% in the AS03 group compared to zero in the control group. One subject in the AS03 group developed an AE of uveitis for which subsequent details specified a unilateral anterior chamber uveitis at 8 days after the second dose of the H5N1 vaccine, which was considered to have a potential causal relationship to vaccination. One subject in the AS03 group was hospitalised for gastroenteritis but the event was considered not related to vaccination and resolved after  two  days.  There  were  no  AEs  leading  to  premature  discontinuation  in  Phase  C  and  no  deaths were reported. Medicinal product no longer authorised 40 30 20 10

## H1N1-017 (Arepanrix-Pandemrix H1N1 bridging study)

The overall reporting rates for general and local symptoms were comparable between vaccines and most of these were considered to be vaccine-related. Very few symptoms were of Grade 3 and the rates were again comparable between the vaccine groups.

Unsolicited AEs considered as related to vaccination were reported by 6.6% of Arepanrix subjects and 10.2% of Pandemrix subjects. Four unsolicited AEs were Grade 3, comprising one case of back pain in  the  Arepanrix group and two cases of influenza-like illness plus a case of nasopharyngitis in the Pandemrix group.

<!-- image -->

| no   |
|------|

There were no AEs of Specific Interest (AESI) reported up to D21. The only SAE was the case of back pain in the Arepanrix group but this was not considered as causally related to the vaccine by the investigator.

## Post marketing experience

As Arepanrix is authorised outside the EU, the applicant provided two simplified periodic safety update reports (sPSURs), which have been assessed within the rolling reviews. These reports follow the abbreviated format as agreed as part of the assessment process for pandemic vaccine sPSURs.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 1 st sPSUR

The reporting period for this report is 21 October 2009 to 17 November 2009. According to the applicant 9,435,000 doses were distributed to Canada during the reporting period, however the number of doses actually vaccinated was not available.

During the reporting period, the applicant received 315 reports of which 37 were serious and including 3 cases with a fatal outcome. Canada is the only country to which Arepanrix has been supplied.

The vast majority of events reported related either to the signs and symptoms of flu-like illness (including events specifically listed such as headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fever, myalgia/arthralgia, fatigue, malaise, asthenia, chills, sweating), allergic ADRs (including dyspnoea

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and generalised rashes), lymphadenopathy, injection site reactions (including pain, swelling and localised paraesthesia or numbness) or 'psychogenic' events (i.e. events related to fear or anticipation of the injection process including syncope and related symptoms).

Cases of fever and febrile convulsion have been reported in children following Arepanrix, however, no details of these cases were provided and no comment on level of fever and dose relationship can be made. The CHMP considered that data on rates of fever in children with Pandemrix should be considered as part of the safety evaluation of Arepanrix. The corresponding wording should therefore be included in the Product Information.

## Fatal events

An 81-year-old male subject died due to anaphylaxis after vaccination with Arepanrix batch number A80CA009A. Concurrent medical conditions included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recurrent lung neoplasm and venous insufficiency. Around eighty five minutes after vaccination with Arepanrix the subject experienced rapid increasing dyspnoea with wheezing. The subject experienced respiratory difficulty with bronchospasm, mouth oedema and throat oedema. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for intubation, at the time of the intubation there was a mild throat oedema and also pharyngeal and laryngeal oedema were noted, during the intubation the subject vomited which caused an aspiration pneumonia. The subject remained intubated because of the aspiration pneumonia but his condition was stable. On 31 October 2009 am the subject condition was stable, it was also mentioned that the subject condition of COPD was controlled at the time of vaccination. The patient subsequently died. Cause of death was severe renal failure possibly related to the allergic reaction to the vaccine (an autopsy report not available). A 39-year-old female experienced an unspecified bacterial infection 2 days after vaccination with Arepanrix H1N1. The subject was also receiving Tamiflu. She died 5 days later. It was reported that the physician told the subject's family that the subject died of 'blood infection'. A subject of unspecified age and gender died due to an unknown cause, 7 days after vaccination.  It was unknown whether an autopsy was performed. Two cases contain insufficient detail to allow any causality assessment. The applicant is requested to follow these reports up for further details. The first case may have been due to anaphylaxis which is a known risk of vaccination as discussed also below. Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) Case details of convulsions included 2 febrile convulsions and 1 convulsion. Case details were not provided in the PSUR. Febrile convulsions have just been included in the SPC for Pandemrix vaccine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Serious unlisted events

The serious unlisted cases currently include a wide range of events from across all System Organ Classes with no clustering of cases suggestive of any specific signal. Most relate to possible symptoms of allergic reactions and flu-like illness.

Three reports of pyrexia, 1 report of convulsion and 1 report of febrile convulsion were reported in children aged under 2 years. An additional 16 cases of pyrexia were reported in children aged 2 to 8 years.  No details of these cases were provided and so no comment on level of fever and dose relationship can be made. Pyrexia and febrile convulsions post dose 2 in children is currently being addressed as part of the Pandemrix SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Twenty eight events in pregnant women were reported in this period. Other than 3 cases of premature birth, all events related to listed side effects, affecting the mother, and no adverse foetal events were reported.

Of the reported cases of anaphylaxis, 12 were received from the same public health physician, who was neither the treating nor vaccinating physician, and met Brighton Collaboration definition level 1 or 2 criteria. Seven of the reports (all from this physician) involved lot A80CA009A; black particles were observed in some vials from this lot and a manufacturing investigation of this lot was ongoing as of the submission of this report.  One report described fatal outcome 8 days post-vaccination (onset of anaphylaxis was 85 minutes post-vaccination). Of the remaining 7 reports, 4 did not fulfil the Brighton Collaboration case definition of anaphylaxis and 3 did not provide enough detail for assessment.

The reporting rate for confirmed cases of anaphylaxis was 0.40/100,000 doses distributed. The overall reporting rate (confirmed, unconfirmed, and unknown) was 0.63/100,000 doses distributed. This is in line with the generally expected rate of anaphylaxis with vaccines in general of 1 to 10 cases per million doses.

The vast majority of events reported related either to the signs and symptoms of flu-like illness (including events specifically listed such as headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fever, myalgia/arthralgia, fatigue, malaise, asthenia, chills, sweating), allergic ADRs (including dyspnoea and generalised rashes), lymphadenopathy, injection site reactions (including pain, swelling and localised paraesthesia or numbness) or 'psychogenic' events (i.e. events related to fear or anticipation of the injection process including syncope and related symptoms). Such events are all listed in the proposed SPC, or otherwise not unexpected, and the available information does not allow any assessment of a change in the expected frequency or severity of these events. No action is required on the basis of these cases at present. It was noted that 665 medically confirmed adverse events have been reported.

After the data lock point of this report, the applicant was notified of 57 reports of anaphylaxis involving lot A80CA007A. Analyses of these reports by the applicant is ongoing. The applicant notified all consignees in Canada on 18 November 2009 to stop vaccinating with that lot until the analyses are complete. To date, the investigation has found no link between this vaccine lot and six confirmed anaphylaxis adverse events associated with this lot. No abnormalities or deviations from established specifications have been observed. The antigen and adjuvant vials used in lot A80CA007A have also been used, separately from one another, in other boxes with different lot numbers. No abnormally high rates of anaphylaxis or other adverse events have been seen with either the antigen or adjuvant from lot A80CA007A when used in a different box combination. 2nd sPSUR The reporting period for this report is 17 November 2009 to 15 December 2009. The applicant states that 15,630,060 doses were distributed to Canada and 5,550,000 doses were distributed to other countries (non-EU, inc. Japan and Morocco) during the reporting period.  The cumulative number of doses distributed to the same countries at the data lock was 30,613,060 doses, however no data on vaccine uptake per country have yet been provided by the applicant. During the reporting period, a total of 252 adverse event reports (68 serious, 3 fatal) were received by the applicant which were all from Canada. As well as Canada, Arepanrix has also been supplied to Japan and Morocco. The cumulative total since 21 October is 565 adverse event reports (107 serious, 6 fatal).

Five cases of cyanosis including one fatal case and 4 cases of syncope possibly of psychogenetic background are so far unlabelled in the proposed  SPC of Arepanrix and the SPC of Pandemrix. The applicant committed to follow up these cases and to propose an update of the PI if appropriate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fatal events

A 32 yr old female with a history of Crohn's disease and colitis died of an unknown cause 48 hours after vaccination with Arepanrix.

A10 month old male developed cough, cyanosis and died 3 hours after vaccination with Arepanrix. Autopsy found that the lungs were twice the normal weight but there was no evidence of obstruction. A 43 yr old female experienced an unspecified haemorrhage within one week of vaccination with Arepanrix and died. The autopsy showed the subject died of an aneurysm.

The fatal cases in the 32 yr old and 10 month old contain insufficient detail to allow any assessment. The applicant committed to follow these reports up for further details and detailed post mortem findings as outlined in the Letter of Undertaking.

Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)

The following AESIs were reported:

<!-- image -->

| authorised   |
|--------------|

The serious unlisted cases currently include a wide range of events from across all System Organ Classes with no case clusters suggestive of any specific signal. Most relate to possible symptoms of allergic reactions, possible flu-like illness and possible 'psychogenic' events

The applicant stated that the SMQ for anaphylaxis includes all cases of urticaria, even in the absence of any signs of a serious anaphylactic or allergic event. Only 26 cases of anaphylaxis, including 3 cases of anaphylactic shock were actually reported in this period (46 cumulatively). Anaphylaxis is discussed further below. The case details of convulsions were not provided in the PSUR. Febrile convulsions have just been included in the SPC for Pandemrix vaccine. The cases of GBS occurred 24 hours, 24 days and 3 days (the other case did not specify onset time) following vaccination. Insufficient detail was provided to allow an assessment of diagnostic certainty. Given the number of doses likely to have been used in Canada to date, the 4 cases of GBS do not currently indicate any signal of excess risk of GBS above expected background rate (this conclusion also applies to the most up to date analysis of GBS cases associated with Pandemrix). Serious unlisted events Medicinal product no longer authorised Facial palsy Total

Two cases of hepatitis were reported although no cased details were provided.

The CHMP noted that there are several clusters of event reports in SOCs which relate to events common in the clinical risk groups targeted for immunisation (i.e. cases of cardiac disorders, respiratory disorders and pregnancy outcomes). Many of these most likely reflect background event reporting, given the wide exposure amongst such populations.

Many other reports relate to possible symptoms of flu-like illness, localised events including injectionrelated events and paraesthesia and allergic reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With regard to the 2 cases of hepatitis, given the previous assessment of possible autoimmune hepatitis associated with AS03 vaccines, the applicant should commit to provide details of these cases, and follow such cases up to rule out AIH as a diagnosis.

## ADRs by age category

In children aged below 2 years, 30 events have been reported in this period, with 88 reports in the 2-8 year age group (the number of unique reports in this age group is not stated).

The CHMP considered that this does not raise any age-specific concerns at present. The majority of serious events have been reported amongst those aged above 9 years.

## ADRs in pregnant women

Twenty five events in pregnant women were reported in this period (53 cumulatively). Other than 3 cases of premature labour/birth, all events related to listed side effects, affecting the mother, and no adverse foetal events were reported.  The CHMP considered that this does not raise any specific concerns at present.

In the reporting period, the applicant conducted analyses of reports with fatal outcomes and reports of anaphylaxis (updated analysis), convulsions, dysgeusia, and facial palsy. Regarding the cluster of reports of anaphylaxis highlighted in the last sPSUR involving lot A80CA007A, analyses of these reports by the applicant is ongoing. The applicant notified all consignees in Canada on 18 November 2009 to stop vaccinating with that lot until the analyses are complete. The applicant's preliminary analysis of the cases associated with lot A80CA007A indicate a higher reporting rate of anaphylaxis. Both Health Canada and the applicant conducted testing on retained samples to determine whether a quality issue with this lot could be contributing to a higher rate of anaphylaxis. This found no abnormalities or deviations from established specifications; testing of samples returned from vaccination sites is ongoing. To date, the investigation has found no link between this vaccine lot and the confirmed anaphylaxis adverse events. The antigen and adjuvant vials used in lot A80CA007A have also been used, separately from one another, in other boxes with different lot numbers. No abnormally high rates of anaphylaxis or other adverse events have been seen with either the antigen or adjuvant from lot A80CA007A when used in a different box combination. The apparent higher reporting rate of anaphylaxis associated with batch A80CA007A remains unexplained. The applicant committed to keep this under close review as outlined in the Letter of Undertaking. Febrile convulsions have been included as a possible side effect in the Pandemrix SPC based on post marketing data. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The remaining case clusters reviewed do not indicate any specific signal of excess reporting above background at present.

## Relevant safety data obtained with FluLaval (HA manufactured in Quebec)

In  addition  to  the  data  from  clinical  studies  with  Q-Pan  H5N1  the  applicant  summarised  pertinent safety  data  relevant  to  use  of  the  seasonal  influenza  vaccine FluLaval in  adults  to  assist  in  an assessment of any possible impact of the differences in the manufacturing process of Q-Pan and D-Pan on the safety profile. The Q-Pan H5N1 antigen is manufactured according to the same process as the FluLaval antigens. FluLaval has  been  marketed  in  Canada  since  1992  (as Fluviral )  and  in  some countries in South America, Europe (Romania) and Asia. It was approved in the US in 2006. To date, more than 100 million doses of FluLaval have been distributed under different brand names.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The last PSUR on Flu Laval was submitted in February 2009 included the data for the period Dec 2007-Dec 2008 (attached in Annex 1 to the answer). During the period covered by this report there were 30.5 million doses distributed and 423 cases fulfilled the ICH E2C criteria for inclusion in the main  line  listings  and  summary  tabulations.  The  review  of  reported  cases  did  not  raise  new  safety concerns.

Additional  safety  data  have  been  obtained  in  four  clinical  studies (SPD707-104,  IBD-707-105, IBD-707-106  and  IBD-707-108)  in  which FluLaval was  compared  to  either  another  trivalent inactivated  vaccine  (TIV)  ( Fluzone or Vaxigrip )  or  to  placebo.  Solicited  and  unsolicited  symptoms plus SAEs were collected, analysed and described for 10,165 subjects, including 5277 who received FluLaval .  In  these  four  studies  the  incidence of solicited local symptoms was generally comparable between the FluLaval and placebo groups although there was a higher risk of pain among FluLaval subjects in the 4 days following vaccination. There were no significant differences between groups for any of the solicited general symptoms experienced during the 4 day follow-up period (see second table below).

No SAEs considered to be related to study vaccination occurred in these four studies. There were five deaths but none was considered to be related to vaccination by investigators and the details of these cases all point to underlying concurrent health problems.

During the 30-minute post-vaccination period the most frequently reported general symptoms in the FluLaval group  during  this  period  were  red  eyes  (1.7%)  and  muscle  or  joint  aches  (1.6%).  The incidence of these events appeared to be similar in the control groups. All other general symptoms were reported for ≤ 1.0% of subjects in the FluLaval and control groups during the 30-minute postvaccination period. During the 4-day post-vaccination period, the most frequently reported solicited general symptoms in the FluLaval group  were  fatigue  (18.5%),  headache  (17.0%),  and  muscle  or  joint  aches  (16.6%). These were also the most frequently reported events in each of the control groups. No other events were reported for more than 10% of subjects in any group. During the 43 day follow-up period, the proportions of subjects reporting at least one post vaccination AE were comparable across all treatment groups. In the FluLaval group, 25% of subjects had at least one AE compared with 23% in the placebo group and 31% in the control TIV group. The percentages of subjects who experienced Grade 3 events were low and rates were in the range 2-3%. Unsolicited  adverse  events  occurring  in  subjects  who  received FluLaval at  an  incidence  of  &gt;2% included headache, pharyngolaryngeal pain, cough, upper respiratory tract infection and fatigue. Rates of  these  event  rates  were  comparable  to  those  in  the  pooled  control  arm. FluLaval subjects  were significantly more likely than control subjects to report diarrhoea (RR=1.72), injection site erythema (RR  =  3.00),  injection  site  pain  (RR  =  3.06),  injection  site  swelling  (RR=3.58)  and  pharyngitis (RR=2.07). Each of these events was reported by more female than male FluLaval subjects and most events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  However,  the  duration  of  these  events  appeared  to  be comparable or shorter in the FluLaval group versus the pooled control group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

There were 26 pregnancies in recipients of FluLaval reported from two of the four studies. A single pregnancy in one study is of unknown outcome since the subject was lost to follow-up.  The other 25 pregnancies all occurred in one study of which four ended in spontaneous abortion, one ended with elective termination and one was lost to follow-up. The outcome also was unavailable for one other subject  last  reported  to  have  a  normal  pregnancy.    The  outcomes  for  the  18  remaining  pregnancies were term births with healthy infants.

The entity of oculo-respiratory syndrome (ORS) was initially described in Canada in the winter of 2000-2001.  The  syndrome  definition  included  red  eyes,  cough,  wheeze,  chest  tightness/difficulty breathing, sore throat, hoarseness or facial swelling. The pathogenesis of ORS remains unknown. It is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

not an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction and, while it may recur with subsequent vaccinations, it is not a predictor of serious hypersensitivity.

The initial reports linked ORS in Canada almost exclusively to Fluviral (i.e. FluLaval ). Investigation of the product showed  an unusual frequency of unsplit virions (most prominently for the A/Panama/2007/99  H3N2  strain,  which  was  introduced  in  2000).  A  modification  of  the  detergent splitting conditions was introduced to resolve this issue.  In addition, routine electron microscopy was introduced to ensure adequate viral disruption. These manoeuvres were associated with a decline in the rate of ORS reports over time.

Similar manifestations were reported at least once from Italy in the 1990s using a different vaccine. In the  2001-2002  influenza  season  a  retrospective  study  in  immunised  healthcare  workers  in  Quebec indicated  no  significant  difference  in  the  risk  of  ORS  in  recipients  of Fluviral versus  recipients  of another  manufacturer's  vaccine.  That  study  suggested  that  ORS  could  be  a  class  effect,  and  could occur  at  a  rate  of  approximately  5%  among  TIV  recipients,  which  was  consistent  with  earlier  data descriptions.  ORS  was  noted  in  a  blinded  clinical  trial  to  have  a  vaccine-attributable  incidence  of approximately 2.9%, with the observation that many cases were sufficiently mild to escape detection under most (i.e. non-study) circumstances.

At present, the applicant believes that ORS may occur as a class effect of TIV but its occurrence has been reduced to background levels by the Fluviral/FluLaval manufacturing processes that are now in place. The  table  below  presents  the  pooled  data  relevant  to  ORS  from  the  four  randomised,  controlled, blinded clinical trials  in  which  adults  received Fluviral/FluLaval or  another  TIV  (either Fluzone or Vaxigrip ) or placebo. Complaints consistent with ORS (along with other more typical reactogenicity symptoms) were actively solicited in each trial. All of the components of ORS were reported and some were detected relatively commonly. However, the  frequency  was  indistinguishable  between  the  recipients  of Fluviral/FluLaval and  comparators  including  the  saline  placebo.  Therefore  the  applicant  concluded  that  ORS  does  not  represent  a  risk which is uniquely associated with the current formulation of FluLaval . Discussion  on safety Based  on  the  direct  comparison  made  within  study  Q-Pan-001  the  safety  profile  of  Q-Pan  H5N1 appears essentially the same as that previously described for D-Pan H5N1. Also, the data from the other reported studies with Q-Pan did not raise any new issues for the vaccine construct as a whole when compared to D-Pan. Based on these data, the differences in manufacturing process of the drug substance and in the excipients that are added during formulation of the antigen drug product do not seem to affect the safety profile of the vaccine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

As stated in the recent assessment report on the potential for the AS03 adjuvant to trigger the clinical onset of auto-immune diseases in predisposed individuals this remains under close scrutiny but so far without any definitive conclusion possible. Based on review of the individual case details from Q Pan and  Flu  NG  trials  the  available  information  does  not  provide  any  new  evidence  to  support  an association between D or Q Pan and AIH or other autoimmune disorders. There is also no indication from the data provided that Q Pan carries any excess risk of liver disorders relative to D Pan.

The  available  safety  data  on  Q-Pan  H5N1  is  already  extensive.  The  clinical  safety  experience generated  during  clinical  studies  and  routine  use  of FluLaval are  reassuring.  The  safety  of  Q-Pan (H1N1) will be further assessed in the planned clinical studies and also through the large safety cohort study committed by the applicant and foreseen in the RMP.

## 2.5  Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

Following the approval of the core dossier, a revised description of the pharmacovigilance system was submitted during the assessment of the strain change variation. This version 3.05 (dated September 2009) included the name and registration certificate of the identified QPPV on Eudravigilance.

While the revised document did not fully address some other outstanding matters the CHMP agreed that the pharmacovigilance system could be considered to fulfil the legislative requirements provided that the remaining issues were rectified in an updated description of the pharmacovigilance system to be submitted within a month of the product being placed on the market (see section 2.7 Follow-up measures following the Marketing Authorisation).

- Risk Management Plan A risk management plan for the A(H1N1)v vaccine was submitted, which included a risk minimisation plan  This was drafted in accordance with the CHMP core RMP for vaccines intended for use in a declared pandemic situation. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted was of the opinion that the following activities are appropriate and necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product as outlined in the Letter of Undertaking: · The MAH will conduct a prospective cohort safety study in at least 9,000 patients, in different age groups, including immunocompromised subjects, in accordance with the protocol submitted with the Risk Management Plan. Observed-to-Expected analyses will be performed. Interim and final results will be submitted in accordance with the protocol. · The MAH commits to provide the results of the studies in pregnancy registries in both the UK and  Canada  in  the  simplified  PSUR.  The  sPSUR  will  be  continuously  updated  with  all preliminary data and interim analysis resulting by these observational studies. · The MAH commits to establish mechanisms to promptly investigate issues affecting the benefitrisk  balance  of  the  vaccine.  The  MAH  should  provide  an  inventory  of  all  valuable  databases ready to be use to promptly investigate issues affecting the benefit-risk balance of the vaccine. Details regarding databases (e.g., data sources, characteristics of the data, potential analysis) need to be reported. The characteristics and the validity of these sources, is to be agreed with EMEA within 1 month of the Commission Decision granting the Variation. Medicinal product no longer authorised
- The MAH commits to provide the results of the clinical effectiveness studies carried out in accordance with the study protocols published by ECDC and the effectiveness trials currently ongoing in Canada.
- The MAH commits to provide an update of the RMP within one month of Commission Decision granting the conditional marketing authorisation.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the MA application is of the opinion that the risk minimisation activities as detailed in section 2.3 of this CHMP Assessment Report are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product.

## 2.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Clinical Context

In April 2009, a new strain of human influenza A(H1N1)v was identified and characterised. On 11 June 2009 the WHO declared an influenza pandemic.

Current  estimates  for  the  attack  rate  associated  with  the  influenza  A(H1N1)v  virus  vary  from approximately 10-50 % in different geographical areas including local outbreaks such as in schools and kindergartens.

The  development  of  Arepanrix  was  based  on  the  guideline  on  dossier  structure  and  content  for pandemic  influenza  vaccine  marketing  authorisation  applications  (CPMP/VEG/4717/03)  and  the guideline  on  submission  of  marketing  authorisation  applications  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccines through the centralised procedure (CPMP/VEG/4986/03).

In common with the approach taken for Pandemrix, the clinical data generated with Arepanrix (H5N1 and H1N1) can be used to support the licensure of Arepanrix in adults.

Clinical data submitted and assessed to support the MAA for Arepanrix include bridging studies between Pandemrix and Arepanrix H5N1 and H1N1 containing formulations in adults ≥ 18 years old and very limited bridging data from the two vaccines containing the AH1N1v strain.

## Extrapolation of data from adults to other age groups

Extensive post-marketing experience from the use of Arepanrix in Canada in all age groups from 6 months onwards demonstrating no higher rates of ADR than expected support the safety conclusions from this dossier.

Further clinical data generated with Arepanrix in adults and clinical data in children will be submitted post-authorisation as commitments.

## Quality

The manufacture of the A(H1N1)v antigen, the A(H1N1)v formulated vial and the AS03 (adjuvant) vial is appropriately controlled.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Adequate in-process controls, release and shelf life specifications have been set in line with relevant requirements (e.g. Ph.Eur.). The relevant quality data generated with the H5N1 vaccine construct can be considered supportive for the vaccine manufactured with the pandemic strain. Quality data required specifically for the pandemic strain have been provided and satisfactorily demonstrate the quality of the vaccine.

Commitments are made by the applicant to update some information when available, which does not impact on the risk/benefit assessment of this vaccine.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

The applicant discussed the mode of action of AS03 adjuvant and its use in prophylactic vaccines. The  applicant  also  presented  results  of  immunogenicity  studies  in  mice  and  of  homologous  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

heterologous influenza challenge studies in ferrets, each using H5N1 vaccine, manufactured in eggs at the Quebec site.

The use of adjuvant in Q-Pan H1N1 is important as it is intended to allow a lower dose of antigen which will allow more subjects to be vaccinated for a given amount of antigen.  The mode of action of AS03 is likely to be through an effect to augment the function of antigen presenting cells with release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that cause effects detected in animals in toxicity studies.  Such effects are  inherent  in  the  mechanisms  of  action  of  AS03  adjuvant.    The  applicant  provided  numerous publications  relating  to  the  mechanism  of  action  of  adjuvants  and  their  impact  on  immune  system function, including that of antigen presenting cells. Use of AS03 adjuvant to augment immunogenicity is considered adequately justified.

Two  immunogenicity  studies  were  conducted  in  mice  using  H5N1  vaccine  manufactured  at  the Quebec facility, adjuvanted with AS03.  One used vaccine antigens from A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and the  second  used  vaccine  antigens  from  A/Indonesia/5/2005.    Immunogenicity  was  greater  in  the presence  of  the  adjuvant  by  both  measures  used  (quantification  of  antigen-specific  IgG  in  sera, haemagglutination inhibition tires) and a dose-response relationship was shown between antigen dose and  serum  IgG  concentrations;  however,  there  was  no  evidence  of  a  dose-relationship  using  the functional antibody measure.

Reproductive toxicity testing was described in rats and in rabbits.  Testing suggested that the Quebecmanufactured vaccines tested did not adversely affect female fertility or pregnancy and no effect was indicated in the F1 generation.  A study with H5N1 vaccine did not identify toxicity associated with vaccination  in  pregnancy  animals  when  dosed  from  day  6  or  pregnancy.  Vaccination  in  early pregnancy,  that  is,  prior  and  up  to  implantation  of  the  embryo  has  not  been  directly  studied.  The applicant is conducting a study with AS03-adjuvanted vaccine to address this specifically.

Vaccine efficacy studies were conducted in ferrets exposed to lethal challenge doses of homologous virus (A/Indonesia/5/2005), or heterologous virus (vaccine prepared from A/Indonesia/5/2005 H5N1 and the challenge virus was A/Hong Kong/156/97 H5N1) and a final experiment where the vaccine was  based  on  H5N1  A/Vietnam/1194/04  and  the  challenge  virus  was  A/Indonesia/05/2005  (10 5 TCID).    All  studies  indicated  that  ASO3-adjuvanted  vaccine  conferred  protection  from  lethal challenge  with  influenza  virus,  whereas  without  adjuvant,  or  with  a  half-dose  of  adjuvant,  vaccine efficacy  was  compromised.    Viral  shedding,  lung  viral  load  measures  and  serology  results  were generally internally consistent, although in one experiment there was a lack of concordance between the  test  facility  and  the  applicant's  laboratory  results  for  seroconversion.  Cross-reactivity  was indicated. No  concerns  for  human  use  was  suggested  by  a  safety  pharmacology  stud  in  rats  conducted  with intravenous  dosing  of  Quebec-derived  A-Wisconsin  virus  at  60 μ g  haemagglutinin  /ml  adjuvanted with AS03. Two single dose and two repeat dose general toxicity studies have been reported and a further two repeated dose toxicity studies in rabbits are ongoing.  Test material was Quebec-manufactured H5N1 vaccine, adjuvanted with AS03.  Apart from pro-inflammatory changes at the injection site that are related  to  the  primary  mode  of  action  of  the  AS03  adjuvant,  there  was  no  toxicity  of  note.    These studies used the full human dose given intramuscularly to rabbits in a manner sufficient to support the intended clinical dosing. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Genotoxicity of the adjuvant was tested and indicated no positive findings.

The applicant provided results of a reproductive toxicity study with H5N1-AS03 adjuvanted vaccine in which there was proof of H5N1-antibody exposure; no toxicity was identified.

One remaining issue is  that  two  general  toxicity  studies  remain  to  be  completed.  One  is  a  toxicity study  in  rabbits  given  three  intramuscular  injections  of  seasonal  and  pandemic  influenza  candidate vaccines with full, half and no dose of AS03 adjuvant, intended to support a quadrivalent vaccine with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

two 'A' and two 'B' strains of influenza vaccine. The other is in rabbits given three intramuscular injections  of  Quebec-manufactured  H5N1  vaccine  with  AS03  at  the  full  human  dose.  Neither  is considered critical to the approval of Arepanrix. The applicant committed to submit the study results.

## Efficacy

The applicant has conducted a full clinical development programme with Arepanrix containing H5N1 antigens.  Pandemrix  and  Arepanrix  containing  H5N1  strains  have  been  shown  to  have  comparable immunogenicity in adults in study Q-Pan-001 and there are also data in the elderly in study Q-Pan-002 that indicate comparable responses between Dresden and Quebec-manufactured vaccines.

As for the strain variation for Pandemrix during the October CHMP the Arepanrix H5N1 data can be extrapolated to the H1N1 containing vaccine when the rules of the core-mock-up principle are applied.

There are currently no clinical date with H1N1 containing Arepanrix in children. As soon as further Arepanrix containing H1N1v strain specific data become available in any age group the CHMP will assess these and update its conclusions as necessary. The available data (including the data on safety of FluLaval ) indicate that the safety profiles of D-Pan and  Q-Pan  vaccines  are  comparable.  Taking  this  into  consideration,  along  with  the  comparable immune responses observed in adults to D-Pan (H5N1 and H1N1) and Q-Pan (H5N1 and H1N1), the CHMP concluded that the dose recommendations for Arepanrix in children can be aligned with those agreed for Pandemrix based on the following data: Data supporting the use in the elderly (&gt;60 years) was generated with Pandemrix (H1N1). The CHMP assessed data from this population in variation Pandemrix II-23 (study H1N1-008) and in II/34 post dose 1 immunogenicity and safety data from a phase III, randomised, single-blind study to evaluate the  immunogenicity and safety of sequential  administration  of  a  licensed  seasonal  trivalent  vaccine and Pandemrix administered in adults 61 years or above (DPAN-H1N1-020),. Immunogenicity data in children and adolescents aged 3-17 years generated with Pandemrix (H1N1) has been assessed in variations Pandemrix II-32 and II-34. The data assessed included post dose 1 immunogenicity and safety data from study H1N1-010, that generated safety and immunogenicity data in children aged 3-17 years, and study H1N1-023, an open-label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a prime-boost schedule of Pandemrix H1N1 (using 1.9 µg HA and AS03B i.e. half adult doses) administered to subjects aged 3 to 17 years. Data in children aged from 6 months to 9 years generated with Pandemrix H1N1 has been assessed within variation Pandemrix II/28 (post dose II safety and immunogenicity data from a phase II, randomised, open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Pandemrix H1N1 following a homologous prime-boost schedule in children aged 6 to 35 months). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Overall the immune responses to Arepanrix and Pandemrix (both as H5N1 or H1N1 vaccine) can be considered to be broadly comparable.

## Safety

Arepanrix and Pandemrix are not manufactured in an identical fashion.

Based on the limited data from the direct comparison made within study Q-Pan-001 the safety profile of Arepanrix H5N1 appears to be essentially the same as that described for Pandemrix H5N1. The data from the two reported studies with Arepanrix did not raise any completely new issues for the vaccine construct as a whole.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  data  available  with  the  H5N1  constructs  cannot  entirely  predict  the  safety  profile  of  H1N1v versions  since  there  remains  a  possibility  of  ADRs  associated  with  the  antigenicity  of  the  specific influenza strain.

Limited clinical safety data generated with Arepanrix indicate no safety concerns.

Safety data generated from FluLaval a seasonal vaccines which is manufactured in the same way like Arepanrix indicate also no safety concerns, as well as post-marketing data from Canada including over 5 million subjects including children and elderly vaccinated.

The safety of Arepanrix will be further assessed in 9000 subjects through a prospective noninterventional cohort safety study, which will occur in addition to the existing commitments for Pandemrix as outlined in the RMP

The safety data also suggested no important differences between vaccines. There was a higher rate of muscle aches in the Arepanrix group but some other symptoms showed higher rates in the Pandemrix group.

Overall the safety profiles appear to be comparable.

Study H1N1-017 is in keeping with the previous observations of comparable safety and immunogenicity between D-Pan and Q-Pan vaccines containing HA derived from H5N1 strains.

Having considered the safety concerns in the Risk Management Plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

## User consultation

The applicant has performed readability testing on its Prepandemic H5N1 (Prepandrix) PL and bridged the Pandemrix H5N1 PL to the Prepandrix PL as the content, lay-out and writing style were similar than the Prepandrix PL.  These testings were approved together with the May 2009 variations (EMEA/H/C/832/II/004-005-006). The Arepanrix PIL as submitted with the Rolling submission 2 in July 2009 corresponded to the approved Pandemrix H5N1 PL and has therefore not been retested.

The applicant further committed to perform a new readability test on the final approved Arepanrix PL and to provide the results as outlined in the Letter of Undertaking .This proposal was considered acceptable.

## Risk-benefit assessment

Benefits

Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  real  benefits  of  Arepanrix  can  only  be  assessed  by  effectiveness studies  during  the  pandemic  as  outlined  in  the  RMP.  At  present  the  benefit  can  only  be  evaluated based on detailed characterisation of immunological responses to vaccination with a similar vaccine, Pandemrix plus  data  available  from  administration  of  Arepanrix  A(H1N1)v  vaccine  during  clinical trials and post-authorisation use in Canada.

Pandemrix  and  Arepanrix  have  shown  (as  H5N1  vaccine)  to  have  comparable  immunogenicity  in adults  and  in  the  elderly  that  indicate  comparable  responses  between  Dresden  and  Quebecmanufactured vaccines.

In  addition,  the  HI  data  at  D21  in  study  H1N1-017  showed  that  both  vaccines  (as  H1N1  vaccine) elicited immune responses that met the CHMP criteria in adults regardless of baseline serostatus and prior vaccination history.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There  are  limited  data  from  clinical  trials  as  yet  in  children  with  Arepanrix.  An  extrapolation  of immunogenicity data on use of Pandemrix in children to use of Arepanrix in  the  same  age  groups might be considered on the basis of the comparable immunogenicity in adults. Therefore it is assumed based on immunogenicity considerations that the recommendations for Pandemrix H1N1v regarding use in children should also apply in principle to Arepanrix H1N1v.

Based on the data available with A(H1N1)v from clinical trials and post marketing with Arepanrix and Pandemrix the expected benefit of Arepanrix is to provide some protection against clinically-apparent infection due to A(H1N1)v.

## Risks

Limited clinical data with Arepanrix do not suggest a different safety profile than Pandemrix or the one confirmed by clinical trials with Arepanrix or Pandemrix containing vaccine constructs manufactured using both H1N1 or H5N1 antigen.

Extensive use of Arepanrix H1N1 in Canada and Pandemrix H1N1 in Europe throughout all age groups from 6 months onwards can be considered sufficient to confirm the safety profile of Arepanrix to be favourable.

## Conclusion

CHMP considers that the eligibility in accordance with  Article 2(2) of Council Regulation  (EC) No 507/2006 together with the criteria of conditional Marketing Authorisation in accordance with and 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 are fulfilled.

It can be further concluded that Arepanrix provides comparable immune responses and safety profile to the approved vaccine Pandemrix. The Benefit Risk ratio is considered positive

## Recommendation

On the basis of the  available  data  for  Arepanrix  the  CHMP  considered  by  consensus  that  the  riskbenefit  balance  of  Arepanrix  A(H1N1)v  for  the  prophylaxis  of  influenza  in  an  officially  declared pandemic  situation, in accordance with official guidance, was  favourable.  Therefore  CHMP recommended the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation.
