## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

CANCIDAS 50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion Each vial contains 50 mg caspof ungin (as acetate).

CANCIDAS 70 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion Each vial contains 70 mg caspofungin (as acetate).

For the f ull list of  excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. Before reconstitution, the powder is a white to of f-white-compact, powder.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

- Treatment of invasive candidiasis in adult or paediatric patients.
- Treatment of invasive aspergillosis in adult or paediatric patients who are refractory to or intolerant of  amphotericin B, lipid f ormulations of amphotericin B and/or itraconazole. Refractoriness is defined as progression of inf ection or failure to improve af ter a minimum of 7 days of prior therapeutic doses of eff ective antifungal therapy.
- Empirical therapy for presumed fungal infections (such as Candida or Aspergillus) in febrile, neutropaenic adult or paediatric patients.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Caspofungin should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of invasive fungal infections.

## Posology

## Adult patients

A single 70 mg loading dose should be administered on Day-1, followed by 50 mg daily thereafter. In patients weighing more than 80 kg, after the initial 70 mg loading dose, caspofungin 70 mg daily is recommended (see section 5.2). No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender or race (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric patients (12 months to 17 years)

In paediatric patients (12 months to 17 years of  age),  dosing  should be based on the patient's body surface area (see Instructions for Use in Paediatric Patients, Mosteller 1  Formula). For all indications, a single 70-mg/m 2 loading dose (not to exceed an actual dose of 70 mg) should be administered on Day 1, followed by 50 mg/m 2 daily thereafter (not to exceed an actual dose of 70 mg daily). If the 50-mg/m 2 daily dose is well tolerated but does not provide an adequate clinical response, the daily dose can be increased to 70 mg/m 2 daily (not to exceed an actual daily dose of 70 mg).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety and efficacy of  caspof ungin have not been suff iciently studied in clinical trials involving neonates and infants below 12 months of age. Caution is advised when treating this age group. Limited data suggest that caspofungin at 25 mg/m 2 daily in neonates and infants (less than 3 months of age) and 50 mg/m 2 daily in young children (3 to 11 months of age) can be considered (see section 5.2).

## Duration of treatment

Duration of  empirical therapy should be based on the patient's clinical response. Therapy should be continued until up to 72 hours af ter  resolution  of   neutropaenia  (ANC≥500).  Patients  f ound  to have a fungal infection should be treated for a minimum of 14 days and treatment should continue for at least 7 days after both neutropaenia and clinical symptoms are resolved.

Duration of tre atment of  invasive candidiasis should be based upon the patient's clinical and microbiological response. After signs and symptoms of invasive candidiasis have improved and cultures have become negative, a switch to oral antifungal therapy may be considered. In general, antifungal therapy should continue for at least 14 days after the last positive culture.

Duration of treatment of invasive aspergillosis is determined on a case by case basis and should be based upon the severity of  the patient's underlying disease, recovery from immunosuppression, and clinical response. In general, treatment should continue for at least 7 days af ter resolution of symptoms.

The safety information on treatment durations longer than 4 weeks is limited. However, available data suggest that caspofungin continues to be well tolerated with longer courses of therapy (up to 162 days in adult patients and up to 87 days in paediatric patients).

## Special populations

## Elderly patients

In elderly patients (65 years of age or more), the area under the curve (AUC) is increased by approximately 30 %. However, no systematic dosage adjustment is required. There is limited treatment experience in patients 65 years of age and older (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No dosage adjustment is necessary based on renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

For adult patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5 to 6), no dosage adjustment is needed. For adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), caspofungin 35 mg daily is recommended based upon pharmacokinetic data. An initial 70 mg loading dose should be administered on Day-1. There is no clinical experience in adult patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score greater than 9) and in paediatric patients with any degree of hepatic impairment (see section 4.4).

## Co-administration with inducers of metabolic enzymes

Limited data suggest that an increase in the daily dose of caspof ungin to 70 mg, f ollowing the 70 mg loading dose, should be considered when co-administering caspofungin in adult patients with certain inducers of metabolic enzymes (see section 4.5). When caspofungin is co-administered to paediatric patients (12 months to 17 years of age) with these same inducers of metabolic enzymes (see section 4.5), a caspofungin dose of 70-mg/m 2 daily (not to exceed an actual daily dose of 70 mg) should be considered.

## Method of administration

After reconstitution and dilution, the solution should be administered by slow intravenous infusion over approximately 1 hour. For reconstitution directions see section 6.6.

## Both 70 mg and 50 mg vials are available.

Caspofungin should be given as a single daily infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Anaphylaxis has been reported during administration of caspofungin. If this occurs, caspofungin should be discontinued and appropriate treatment administered. Possibly histamine-mediated adverse reactions, including rash, facial swelling, angioedema, pruritus, sensation of warmth, or bronchospasm have been reported and may require discontinuation and/or administration of appropriate treatment.

Limited data suggest that less common nonCandida yeasts and nonAspergillus moulds are not covered by caspofungin. The efficacy of caspofungin against these fungal pathogens has not been established.

Concomitant use of caspofungin with cyclosporin has been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers and in adult patients. Some healthy adult volunteers who received two 3 mg/kg doses of cyclosporin with caspofungin showed transient increases in alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) of less than or equal to 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) that resolved with discontinuation of the treatment. In a retrospective study of 40 patients treated during marketed use with caspofungin and cyclosporin for 1 to 290 days (median 17.5 days), no serious hepatic adverse reactions were noted. These data suggest that caspofungin can be used in patients receiving cyclosporin when the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. Close monitoring of liver enzymes should be considered if caspofungin and cyclosporin are used concomitantly.

In adult patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, the AUC is increased about 20 % and 75 %, respectively. A reduction of the daily dose to 35 mg is recommended for adults with moderate hepatic impairment. There is no clinical experience in adults with severe hepatic impairment or in paediatric patients with any degree of hepatic impairment. A higher exposure than in moderate hepatic impairment is expected and caspofungin should be used with caution in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

Laboratory abnormalities in liver function tests have been seen in healthy volunteers and adult and paediatric patients treated with caspofungin. In some adult and paediatric patients with serious underlying conditions who were receiving multiple concomitant medications with caspofungin, cases of clinically significant hepatic dysfunction, hepatitis and hepatic f ailure have been reported; a causal relationship to caspofungin has not been established. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during caspofungin therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and the risk/benefit of continuing caspofungin therapy should be re-evaluated.

Cases of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported after post-marketing use of caspofungin. Caution should apply in patients with history of allergic skin reaction (see section 4.8).

## Use during renal replacement therapy (RRT)

In patients receiving caspofungin during continuous RRT, the use of polyacrylonitrile-derived membranes (e.g., during hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration) may result in adsorption of the drug, potentially reducing caspofungin efficacy. Increasing the dose may not prevent this ef fect. It is recommended to use an alternative extracorporeal membrane, or another antifungal agent. The risk of treatment failure may result in worsening infection and death.

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ' sodium-free ' .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Studies in vitro show that caspofungin is not an inhibitor of any enzyme in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. In clinical studies, caspofungin did not induce the CYP3A4 metabolism of other substances. Caspofungin is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein and is a poor substrate for cytochrome P450 enzymes. However, caspofungin has been shown to interact with other medicinal products in pharmacological and clinical studies (see below).

In two clinical studies perf ormed in healthy adult subjects, cyclosporin A (one 4 mg/kg dose or two 3 mg/kg doses 12 hours apart) increased the AUC of caspofungin by approximately 35 %. These AUC increases are probably due to reduced uptake of caspofungin by the liver. Caspofungin did not increase the plasma levels of cyclosporin. There were transient increases in liver ALT and AST of less than or equal to 3-f old the upper limit of  normal (ULN) when caspofungin and cyclosporin were co-administered, that resolved with discontinuation of the medicinal products. In a retrospective study of 40 patients treated during marketed use with caspofungin and cyclosporin for 1 to 290 days (median 17.5 days), no serious hepatic adverse reactions were noted (see section 4.4). Close monitoring of liver enzymes should be considered if the two medicinal products are used concomitantly.

Caspofungin reduced the trough concentration of tacrolimus by 26 % in healthy adult volunteers. For patients receiving both therapies, standard monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentrations and appropriate tacrolimus dosage adjustments are mandatory.

Clinical studies in healthy adult volunteers show that the pharmacokinetics of caspofungin are not altered to a clinically relevant extent by itraconazole, amphotericin B, mycophenolate, nelf inavir, or tacrolimus. Caspofungin did not influence the pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B, itraconazole, rif ampicin or mycophenolate mofetil. Although safety data are limited it appears that no special precautions are needed when amphotericin B, itraconazole, nelfinavir or mycophenolate mofetil are co-administered with caspofungin.

Rifampicin caused a 60 % increase in AUC and 170 % increase in trough concentration of caspofungin on the first day of co-administration when both medicinal products were initiated together in healthy adult volunteers. Caspofungin trough levels gradually decreased upon repeated administration. Af ter two weeks' administration rif ampicin had limited ef f ect on AUC , but trough levels were 30 % lower than in adult subjects who received caspofungin alone. The mechanism of interaction could possibly be due to an initial inhibition and subsequent induction of transport proteins. A similar effect could be expected for other medicinal products that induce metabolic enzymes. Limited data from population pharmacokinetics studies indicate that concomitant use of caspofungin with the inducers efavirenz, nevirapine, rifampicin, dexamethasone, phenytoin, or carbamazepine may result in a decrease in caspofungin AUC. When co-administering inducers of metabolic enzymes, an increase in the daily dose of caspof ungin to 70 mg, following the 70 mg loading dose, should be considered in adult patients (see section 4.2).

All adult drug-drug interaction studies described above were conducted at a 50 or 70 mg daily caspofungin dose. The interaction of higher doses of caspofungin with other medicinal products has not been formally studied.

In paediatric patients, results from regression analyses of pharmacokinetic data suggest that co-administration of dexamethasone with caspofungin may result in clinically meaningful reductions in caspofungin trough concentrations. This finding may indicate that paediatric patients will have similar reductions with inducers as seen in adults. When caspofungin is co-administered to paediatric patients (12 months to 17 years of age) with inducers of drug clearance, such as rif ampicin, efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine, a caspofungin dose of 70-mg/m 2 daily (not to exceed an actual daily dose of 70 mg) should be considered.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited data from the use of caspofungin in pregnant women. Caspofungin should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Animal studies have shown developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Caspofungin has been shown to cross the placental barrier in animal studies.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether caspofungin is excreted in human milk. Available pharmacodynamic/ toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of caspofungin in milk. Women receiving caspofungin should not breast-feed.

## Fertility

For caspofungin, there were no effects on fertility in studies conducted in male and female rats (see section 5.3). There are no clinical data for caspofungin to assess its impact on fertility.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been perf ormed.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

Hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis and possibly histamine-mediated adverse reactions) have been reported (see section 4.4).

Also reported in patients with invasive aspergillosis were pulmonary oedema, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and radiographic infiltrates.

## Adult patients

In clinical studies, 1,865 adult individuals received single or multiple doses of caspof ungin: 564 febrile neutropaenic patients (empirical therapy study), 382 patients with invasive candidiasis, 228 patients with invasive aspergillosis, 297 patients with localised Candida inf ections, and 394 individuals enrolled in Phase I studies. In the empirical therapy study patients had received chemotherapy for malignancy or had undergone hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (including 39 allogeneic transplantations). In the studies involving patients with documented Candida inf ections, the majority of the patients with invasive Candida inf ections had serious underlying medical conditions (e.g., haematologic or other malignancy, recent major surgery, HIV) requiring multiple concomitant medications. Patients in the non-comparative Aspergillus study often had serious predisposing medical conditions (e.g., bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplants, haematologic malignancy, solid tumours or organ transplants) requiring multiple concomitant medications.

Phlebitis was a commonly reported local injection-site adverse reaction in all patient populations. Other local reactions included erythema, pain/tenderness, itching, discharge, and a burning sensation.

Reported clinical and laboratory abnormalities among all adults treated with caspofungin (total 1,780) were typically mild and rarely led to discontinuation.

Caspofungin has also been evaluated at 150 mg daily (for up to 51 days) in 100 adult patients (see section 5.1). The study compared caspofungin at 50 mg daily (following a 70-mg loading dose on Day 1) versus 150 mg daily in the treatment of invasive candidiasis. In this group of patients, the safety of caspofungin at this higher dose appeared generally similar to patients receiving the 50-mg daily dose of caspofungin. The proportion of patients with a serious drug-related adverse reaction or a drug-related adverse reaction leading to caspofungin discontinuation was comparable in the 2 treatment groups.

## Paediatric Patients

Data from 5 clinical studies completed in 171 paediatric patients suggest that the overall incidence of clinical adverse experiences (26.3 %; 95 % CI -19.9, 33.6) is not worse than reported for adults treated with caspofungin (43.1 %; 95 % CI -40.0, 46.2). However, paediatric patients probably have a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

different adverse event prof ile compared to adult patients. The most common drug-related clinical adverse experiences reported in paediatric patients treated with caspofungin were pyrexia (11.7 %), rash (4.7 %) and headache (2.9 %).

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Inadvertent administration of up to 400 mg of caspofungin in one day has been reported. These occurrences did not result in clinically important adverse reactions. Caspofungin is not dialysable.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antimycotics for systemic use, ATC Code: J02AX04

## Mechanism of action

Caspofungin acetate is a semi-synthetic lipopeptide (echinocandin) compound synthesised from a fermentation product of Glarea lozoyensis. Caspofungin acetate inhibits the synthesis of beta (1,3)-D-glucan, an essential component of the cell wall of many filamentous fungi and yeast. Beta (1,3)-D-glucan is not present in mammalian cells.

Fungicidal activity with caspofungin has been demonstrated against Candida yeasts. Studies in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that exposure of Aspergillus to caspofungin results in lysis and death of hyphal apical tips and branch points where cell growth and division occur.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Caspofungin has in vitro activity against Aspergillus species ( Aspergillus fumigatus [N = 75] , Aspergillus flavus [N = 111] , Aspergillus niger [N = 31] , Aspergillus nidulans [N = 8] , Aspergillus

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

terreus [N = 52], and Aspergillus candidus [N = 3]). Caspofungin also has in vitro activity against Candida species ( Candida albicans [N = 1,032] , Candida dubliniensis [N = 100] , Candida glabrata [N = 151] , Candida guilliermondii [N = 67] , Candida kefyr [N = 62] , Candida krusei [N = 147] , Candida lipolytica [N = 20] , Candida lusitaniae [N = 80] , Candida parapsilosis [N = 215], Candida rugosa [N = 1], and Candida tropicalis [N = 258]), including isolates with multiple resistance transport mutations and those with acquired or intrinsic resistance to f luconazole, amphotericin B, and 5-flucytosine. Susceptibility testing was performed according to a modif ication of both the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly known as the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards [NCCLS]) method M38-A2 (for Aspergillus species) and method M27-A3 (for Candida species).

Standardised techniques for susceptibility testing have been established for yeasts by EUCAST. EUCAST breakpoints have not yet been established for caspofungin, due to significant inter-laboratory variation in MIC ranges for caspofungin. In lieu of breakpoints, Candida isolates that are susceptible to anidulafungin as well as micafungin should be considered susceptible to caspofungin. Similarly, C. parapsilosis isolates intermediate to anidulafungin and micaf ungin can be regarded intermediate to caspofungin.

## Mechanism of resistance

Isolates of Candida with reduced susceptibility to caspofungin have been identified in a small number of patients during treatment (MICs for caspofungin &gt;2 mg/L (4- to 30-fold MIC increases) have been reported using standardized MIC testing techniques approved by the CLSI). The mechanism of resistance identif ied is FKS1 and/or FKS2 (f or C. glabrata ) gene mutations. These cases have been associated with poor clinical outcomes.

Development of in vitro resistance to caspofungin by Aspergillus species has been identified. In limited clinical experience, resistance to caspofungin in patients with invasive aspergillosis has been observed. The mechanism of resistance has not been established. The incidence of resistance to caspofungin by various clinical isolates of Aspergillus is rare. Caspof ungin resistance in Candida has been observed but the incidence may differ by species or region.

## Clinical eff icacy and safety

Invasive Candidiasis in Adult Patients : Two hundred thirty-nine patients were enrolled in an initial study to compare caspofungin and amphotericin B for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. Twentyfour patients had neutropaenia. The most frequent diagnoses were bloodstream infections (candidaemia) (77 %, n = 186) and Candida peritonitis (8 %, n = 19); patients with Candida endocarditis, osteomyelitis, or meningitis were excluded from this study. Caspofungin 50 mg once daily was administered following a 70 mg loading dose, while amphotericin B was administered at 0.6 to 0.7 mg/kg/day to non-neutropaenic patients or 0.7 to 1.0 mg/kg/day to neutropaenic patients. The mean duration of intravenous therapy was 11.9 days, with a range of 1 to 28 days. A favourable response required both symptom resolution and microbiological clearance of the Candida infection. Two hundred twenty-four patients were included in the primary efficacy analysis (MITT analysis) of response at the end of IV study therapy; favourable response rates for the treatment of invasive candidiasis were comparable for caspofungin (73 % [80/109]) and amphotericin B (62 % [71/115]) [% difference 12.7 (95.6 % CI -0.7, 26.0)]. Among patients with candidaemia, favourable response rates at the end of IV study therapy were comparable for caspofungin (72 % [66/92]) and amphotericin B (63 % [59/94]) in the primary efficacy analysis (MITT analysis) [% difference 10.0 (95.0 % CI -4.5, 24.5)]. Data in patients with non-blood sites of inf ection were more limited. Favourable response rates in neutropaenic patients were 7/14 (50 %) in the caspofungin group and 4/10 (40 %) in the amphotericin B group. These limited data are supported by the outcome of the empirical therapy study.

In a second study, patients with invasive candidiasis received daily doses of caspofungin at 50 mg/day (following a 70-mg loading dose on Day 1) or caspofungin at 150 mg/day (see section 4.8). In this study, the caspofungin dose was administered over 2 hours (instead of the routine 1-hour administration). The study excluded patients with suspected Candida endocarditis, meningitis, or osteomyelitis. As this was a primary therapy study, patients who were refractory to prior antifungal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

agents were also excluded. The number of neutropenic patients enrolled in this study was also limited (8.0 %). Efficacy was a secondary endpoint in this study. Patients who met the entry criteria and received one or more doses of caspofungin study therapy were included in the efficacy analysis. The favourable overall response rates at the end of  caspofungin therapy were similar in the 2 treatment groups: 72 % (73/102) and 78 % (74/95) for the caspofungin 50-mg and 150-mg treatment groups, respectively (diff erence 6.3 % [95 % CI -5.9, 18.4]).

Invasive Aspergillosis in Adult Patients : Sixty-nine adult patients (age 18-80) with invasive aspergillosis were enrolled in an open-label, non-comparative study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of caspofungin. Patients had to be either refractory to (disease progression or f ailure to improve with other antifungal therapies given for at least 7 days) (84 % of the enrolled patients) or intolerant of  (16 % of enrolled patients) other standard antifungal therapies. Most patients had underlying conditions (haematologic malignancy [N = 24], allogeneic bone marrow transplant or stem cell transplant [N = 18], organ transplant [N = 8], solid tumour [N = 3], or other conditions [N = 10]). Stringent definitions, modelled after the Mycoses Study Group Criteria, were used for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and f or response to therapy (favourable response required clinically significant improvement in radiographs as well as in signs and symptoms). The mean duration of therapy was 33.7 days, with a range of 1 to 162 days. An independent expert panel determined that 41 % (26/63) of patients receiving at least one dose of caspofungin had a favourable response. For those patients who received more than 7 days of therapy with caspofungin, 50 % (26/52) had a favourable response. The favourable response rates for patients who were either refractory to or intolerant of previous therapies were 36 % (19/53) and 70 % (7/10), respectively. Although the doses of prior antifungal therapies in 5 patients enrolled as ref ractory were lower than those often administered for invasive aspergillosis, the favourable response rate during therapy with caspofungin was similar in these patients to that seen in the remaining refractory patients (2/5 versus 17/48, respectively). The response rates among patients with pulmonary disease and extrapulmonary disease were 47 % (21/45) and 28 % (5/18), respectively. Among patients with extrapulmonary disease, 2 of 8 patients who also had definite, probable, or possible CNS involvement had a favourable response.

Empirical Therapy in Febrile, Neutropaenic Adult Patients : A total of  1,111 patients with persistent fever and neutropaenia were enrolled in a clinical study and treated with either caspofungin 50 mg once daily following a 70 mg loading dose or liposomal amphotericin B 3.0 mg/kg/day. Eligible patients had received chemotherapy for malignancy or had undergone hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, and presented with neutropaenia (&lt;500 cells/mm 3 f or 96 hours) and fever (&gt;38.0°C) not responding to ≥96 hours of parenteral antibacterial therapy. Patients were to be treated until up to 72 hours after resolution of neutropaenia, with a maximum duration of 28 days. However, patients found to have a documented fungal infection could be treated longer. If the drug was well tolerated but the patient's f ever persisted and clinical condition deteriorated af ter 5 days of therapy, the dosage of study drug could be increased to 70 mg/day of caspofungin (13.3 % of patients treated) or to 5.0 mg/kg/day of liposomal amphotericin B (14.3 % of patients treated). There were 1,095 patients included in the primary Modified Intention-To-Treat (MITT) efficacy analysis of overall favourable response; caspofungin (33.9 %) was as effective as liposomal amphotericin B (33.7 %) [% difference 0.2 (95.2 % CI -5.6, 6.0)]. An overall f avourable response required meeting each of 5 criteria: (1) successful treatment of any baseline fungal inf ection (caspof ungin 51.9 % [14/27], liposomal amphotericin B 25.9 % [7/27]), (2) no breakthrough fungal infections during administration of study drug or within 7 days after completion of treatment (caspofungin 94.8 % [527/556], liposomal amphotericin B 95.5 % [515/539]), (3) survival for 7 days after completion of study therapy (caspofungin 92.6 % [515/556], liposomal amphotericin B 89.2 % [481/539]), (4) no discontinuation from the study drug because of drug-related toxicity or lack of eff icacy (caspof ungin 89.7 % [499/556], liposomal amphotericin B 85.5 % [461/539]), and (5) resolution of fever during the period of neutropaenia (caspofungin 41.2 % [229/556], liposomal amphotericin B 41.4 % [223/539]). Response rates to caspofungin and liposomal amphotericin B for baseline infections caused by Aspergillus species were, respectively, 41.7 % (5/12) and 8.3 % (1/12), and by Candida species were 66.7 % (8/12) and 41.7 % (5/12). Patients in the caspofungin group experienced breakthrough infections due to the following uncommon yeasts and moulds: Trichosporon species (1), Fusarium species (1), Mucor species (1), and Rhizopus species (1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of caspofungin was evaluated in paediatric patients 3 months to 17 years of age in two prospective, multicentre clinical trials. The study design, diagnostic criteria, and criteria for efficacy assessment were similar to the corresponding studies in adult patients (see section 5.1) .

The first study, which enrolled 82 patients between 2 to 17 years of age, was a randomized, doubleblind study comparing caspofungin (50 mg/m 2 IV once daily following a 70-mg/m 2 loading dose on Day 1 [not to exceed 70 mg daily]) to liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg IV daily) in a 2:1 treatment fashion (56 on caspofungin, 26 on liposomal amphotericin B) as empirical therapy in paediatric patients with persistent f ever and neutropenia. The overall success rates in the MITT analysis results, adjusted by risk strata, were as follows: 46.6 % (26/56) for caspof ungin and 32.2 % (8/25) for liposomal amphotericin B.

The second study was a prospective, open-label, non-comparative study estimating the safety and efficacy of caspofungin in paediatric patients (ages 6 months to 17 years) with invasive candidiasis, oesophageal candidiasis, and invasive aspergillosis (as salvage therapy). Forty-nine patients were enrolled and received caspofungin at 50 mg/m 2 IV once daily following a 70-mg/m 2 loading dose on Day 1 (not to exceed 70 mg daily), of whom 48 were included in the MITT analysis. Of these, 37 had invasive candidiasis, 10 had invasive aspergillosis, and 1 patient had esophageal candidiasis. The favourable response rate, by indication, at the end of caspof ungin therapy was as f ollows in the MITT analysis: 81 % (30/37) in invasive candidiasis, 50 % (5/10) in invasive aspergillosis, and 100 % (1/1) in oesophageal candidiasis.

In a double-blind, randomized (2:1) comparator-controlled study safety, tolerability and eff icacy of caspofungin (2 mg/kg/d intravenously, infused over 2 hours) vs amphotericin B deoxycholate (1 mg/kg/d) was evaluated in neonates and infants less than 3 months of age with (culture-confirmed) invasive candidiasis. Due to poor enrolment, the study was terminated early and only 51 patients were randomized. The proportion of patients with fungal-free survival at 2 weeks post-therapy in the caspofungin treatment group (71.0 %) was similar to that seen in the amphotericin B deoxycholate treatment group (68.8 %). Based on this study, no posology recommendations for neonates and infants can be made.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Distribution

Caspofungin is extensively bound to albumin. The unbound fraction of caspofungin in plasma varies from 3.5 % in healthy volunteers to 7.6 % in patients with invasive candidiasis. Distribution plays the prominent role in caspofungin plasma pharmacokinetics and is the rate-controlling step in both the alpha- and beta-disposition phases. The distribution into tissues peaked at 1.5 to 2 days after dosing when 92 % of the dose was distributed into tissues. It is likely that only a small fraction of  the caspofungin taken up into tissues later returns to plasma as parent compound. Therefore, elimination occurs in the absence of a distribution equilibrium, and a true estimate of the volume of distribution of caspofungin is currently impossible to obtain.

## Biotransformation

Caspofungin undergoes spontaneous degradation to an open ring compound. Further metabolism involves peptide hydrolysis and N-acetylation. Two intermediate products, formed during the degradation of caspofungin to this open ring compound, form covalent adducts to plasma proteins resulting in a low-level, irreversible binding to plasma proteins.

In vitro studies show that caspofungin is not an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4. In clinical studies, caspofungin did not induce or inhibit the CYP3A4 metabolism of other medicinal products. Caspofungin is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein and is a poor substrate for cytochrome P450 enzymes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elimination

The elimination of caspofungin from plasma is slow with a clearance of 10-12 ml/min. Plasma concentrations of caspofungin decline in a polyphasic manner following single 1-hour intravenous infusions. A short alpha-phase occurs immediately post-infusion, followed by a beta-phase with a halflif e of  9 to 11 hours. An additional gamma-phase also occurs with a half-lif e of  45 hours. Distribution, rather than excretion or biotransformation, is the dominant mechanism influencing plasma clearance.

Approximately 75 % of a radioactive dose was recovered during 27 days: 41 % in urine and 34 % in faeces. There is little excretion or biotransformation of caspofungin during the first 30 hours af ter administration. Excretion is slow and the terminal half-life of radioactivity was 12 to 15 days. A small amount of caspofungin is excreted unchanged in urine (approximately 1.4 % of dose).

Caspofungin displays moderate non-linear pharmacokinetics with increased accumulation as the dose is increased, and a dose dependency in the time to reach steady state upon multiple-dose administration.

## Special populations

Increased caspofungin exposure was seen in adult patients with renal impairment and mild liver impairment, in female subjects, and in the elderly. Generally the increase was modest and not large enough to warrant dosage adjustment. In adult patients with moderate liver impairment or in higher weight patients, a dosage adjustment may be necessary (see below).

Weight: Weight was found to influence caspofungin pharmacokinetics in the population pharmacokinetic analysis in adult candidiasis patients. The plasma concentrations decrease with increasing weight. The average exposure in an adult patient weighing 80 kg was predicted to be about 23 % lower than in an adult patient weighing 60 kg (see section 4.2).

Hepatic impairment: In adult patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, the AUC is increased about 20 and 75 %, respectively. There is no clinical experience in adult patients with severe hepatic impairment and in paediatric patients with any degree of hepatic impairment. In a multiple-dose study, a dose reduction of the daily dose to 35 mg in adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment has been shown to provide an AUC similar to that obtained in adult subjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard regimen (see section 4.2).

Renal impairment: In a clinical study of single 70 mg doses, caspofungin pharmacokinetics were similar in adult volunteers with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 ml/min) and control subjects. Moderate (creatinine clearance 31 to 49 ml/min), advanced (creatinine clearance 5 to 30 ml/min), and end-stage (creatinine clearance &lt;10 ml/min and dialysis dependent) renal impairment moderately increased caspofungin plasma concentrations after single-dose administration (range: 30 to 49 % for AUC). However, in adult patients with invasive candidiasis, oesophageal candidiasis, or invasive aspergillosis who received multiple daily doses of caspofungin 50 mg, there was no signif icant ef f ect of  mild to advanced renal impairment on caspofungin concentrations. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. Caspofungin is not dialysable, thus supplementary dosing is not required following haemodialysis.

Gender: Caspofungin plasma concentrations were on average 17-38 % higher in women than in men.

Elderly: A modest increase in AUC (28 %) and C24h (32 %) was observed in elderly male subjects compared with young male subjects. In patients who were treated empirically or who had invasive candidiasis, a similar modest eff ect of age was seen in older patients relative to younger patients.

Race: Patient pharmacokinetic data indicated that no clinically significant diff erences in the pharmacokinetics of caspofungin were seen among Caucasians, Blacks, Hispanics, and Mestizos.

## Paediatric Patients:

In adolescents (ages 12 to 17 years) receiving caspofungin at 50 mg/m 2 daily (maximum 70 mg daily), the caspofungin plasma AUC0-24 hr was generally comparable to that seen in adults receiving

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

caspofungin at 50 mg daily. All adolescents received doses &gt;50 mg daily, and, in fact, 6 of 8 received the maximum dose of 70 mg/day. The caspofungin plasma concentrations in these adolescents were reduced relative to adults receiving 70 mg daily, the dose most of ten administered to adolescents.

In children (ages 2 to 11 years) receiving caspofungin at 50 mg/m 2 daily (maximum 70 mg daily), the caspofungin plasma AUC0-24 hr after multiple doses was comparable to that seen in adults receiving caspofungin at 50 mg/day.

In young children and toddlers (ages 12 to 23 months) receiving caspofungin at 50 mg/m 2 daily (maximum 70 mg daily), the caspofungin plasma AUC0-24 hr after multiple doses was comparable to that seen in adults receiving caspofungin at 50 mg daily and to that in older children (2 to 11 years of age) receiving the 50 mg/m 2 daily dose.

Overall, the available pharmacokinetic, eff icacy, and safety data are limited in patients 3 to 10 months of age. Pharmacokinetic data from one 10-month old child receiving the 50 mg/m 2 daily dose indicated an AUC0-24 hr within the same range as that observed in older children and adults at the 50 mg/m 2 and the 50 mg dose, respectively, while in one 6-month old child receiving the 50 mg/m 2 dose, the AUC0-24 hr was somewhat higher.

In neonates and infants (&lt;3 months) receiving caspofungin at 25 mg/m 2 daily (corresponding mean daily dose of 2.1 mg/kg), caspofungin peak concentration (C1 hr) and caspofungin trough concentration (C24 hr ) af ter multiple doses were comparable to that seen in adults receiving caspof ungin at 50 mg daily. On Day 1, C1 hr was comparable and C24 hr modestly elevated (36 %) in these neonates and infants relative to adults. However, variability was seen in both C1 hr (Day 4 geometric mean 11.73 µg/ml, range 2.63 to 22.05 µg/ml) and C24 hr (Day 4 geometric mean 3.55 µg/ml, range 0.13 to 7.17 µg/ml). AUC0-24 hr measurements were not performed in this study due to the sparse plasma sampling. Of note, the eff icacy and safety of caspofungin have not been adequately studied in prospective clinical trials involving neonates and inf ants under 3 months of age.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys using doses up to 7-8 mg/kg given intravenously showed injection site reactions in rats and monkeys, signs of histamine release in rats, and evidence of adverse effects directed at the liver in monkeys. Developmental toxicity studies in rats showed that caspofungin caused decreases in foetal body weights and an increase in the incidence of incomplete ossification of vertebra, sternebra, and skull bone at doses of 5 mg/kg that were coupled to adverse maternal effects such as signs of histamine release in pregnant rats. An increase in the incidence of cervical ribs was also noted. Caspofungin was negative in in vitro assays for potential genotoxicity as well as in the in vivo mouse bone marrow chromosomal test. No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential. For caspofungin, there were no effects on fertility in studies conducted in male and female rats up to 5 mg/kg/day.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE IN PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS

Calculation of Body Surface Area (BSA) for paediatric dosing

Before preparation of infusion, calculate the body surface area (BSA) of the patient using the following formula: (Mosteller Formula)

## Preparation of the 70 mg/m 2 infusion for paediatric patients &gt;3 months of age (using a 50-mg vial)

1. Determine the actual loading dose to be used in the paediatric patient by using the patient's BSA (as calculated above) and the following equation:

BSA (m 2 ) X 70 mg/m 2  = Loading Dose

The maximum loading dose on Day 1 should not exceed 70 mg regardless of the patient's calculated dose.

2. Equilibrate the refrigerated vial of CANCIDAS to room temperature.
3. Aseptically add 10.5 ml of water for injection. a This reconstituted solution may be stored for up to 24 hours at or below 25°C. b This will give a final caspofungin concentration in the vial of 5.2 mg/ml.
4. Remove the volume of medicinal product equal to the calculated loading dose (Step 1) from the vial. Aseptically transfer this volume (ml) c of reconstituted CANCIDAS to an IV bag (or bottle) containing 250 ml of 0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated Ringers Injection. Alternatively, the volume (ml) c of reconstituted CANCIDAS can be added to a reduced volume of 0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringers Injection, not to exceed a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. This infusion solution must be used within 24 hours if stored at or below 25°C or within 48 hours if  stored refrigerated at 2 to 8°C.

Before preparation of infusion, calculate the body surface area (BSA) of the patient using the following formula: (Mosteller Formula)

<!-- image -->

## Preparation of the 70 mg/m 2 infusion for paediatric patients &gt;3 months of age (using a 70-mg vial)

1. Determine the actual loading dose to be used in the paediatric patient by using the patient's BSA (as calculated above) and the following equation:

BSA (m 2 ) X 70 mg/m 2  = Loading Dose

The maximum loading dose on Day 1 should not exceed 70 mg regardless of the patient's calculated dose.

2. Equilibrate the refrigerated vial of CANCIDAS to room temperature.
3. Aseptically add 10.5 ml of water for injection. a This reconstituted solution may be stored for up to 24 hours at or below 25°C. b This will give a final caspofungin concentration in the vial of 7.2 mg/ml.
4. Remove the volume of medicinal product equal to the calculated loading dose (Step 1) from the vial. Aseptically transfer this volume (ml) c of reconstituted CANCIDAS to an IV bag (or bottle) containing 250 ml of 0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated Ringers Injection. Alternatively, the volume (ml) c of reconstituted CANCIDAS can be added to a reduced volume of 0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringers Injection, not to exceed a final concentration of  0.5 mg/ml. This infusion solution must be used within 24 hours if stored at or below 25°C or within 48 hours if  stored refrigerated at 2 to 8°C.

## Preparation of the 50 mg/m 2 infusion for paediatric patients &gt;3 months of age (using a 70-mg vial)

1. Determine the actual daily maintenance dose to be used in the paediatric patient by using the patient's BSA (as calculated above) and the following equation: BSA (m 2 ) X 50 mg/m 2  = Daily Maintenance Dose

The daily maintenance dose should not exceed 70 mg regardless of the patient's calculated dose.

2. Equilibrate the refrigerated vial of CANCIDAS to room temperature.
3. Aseptically add 10.5 ml of water for injection. a This reconstituted solution may be stored for up to 24 hours at or below 25°C. b This will give a final caspofungin concentration in the vial of 7.2 mg/ml.
4. Remove the volume of medicinal product equal to the calculated daily maintenance dose (Step 1) from the vial. Aseptically transf er this volume (ml) c  of reconstituted CANCIDAS to an IV bag (or bottle) containing 250 ml of  0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated Ringers Injection.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you or your child are given this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have further questions, please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaf let. See section 4.

2. What you need to know before you are given Cancidas
3. How to use Cancidas
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Cancidas
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Cancidas is and what it is used for

## What Cancidas is

Cancidas contains a medicine called caspofungin. This belongs to a group of medicines called anti-f ungals.

## What Cancidas is used for

Cancidas is used to treat the following infections in children, adolescents and adults:

- serious f ungal inf ections in  your  tissues or  organs (called 'invasive candidiasis').  This  inf ection is caused by f ungal (yeast) cells called Candida.
- People who might get this type of infection include those who have just had an operation or those whose immune systems are weak. Fever and chills that do not respond to an antibiotic are the most common signs of this type of infection.
- fungal inf ections in your nose, nasal sinuses or lungs (called 'invasive aspergillosis')  if  other anti-fungal treatments have not worked or have caused side effects. This infection is caused by a mould called Aspergillus.

People who might get this type of infection include those having chemotherapy, those who have had a transplant and those whose immune systems are weak.

- suspected fungal infections if you have a fever and a low white cell count that have not improved on treatment with an antibiotic. People who are at risk of getting a fungal inf ection include those who have just had an operation or those whose immune systems are weak.

## How Cancidas works

Cancidas makes fungal cells fragile and stops the fungus from growing properly. This stops the inf ection  f rom  spreading and gives the body's natural def ences a chance to completely get rid of  the infection.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Cancidas

## Do not use Cancidas

- if  you are allergic to caspof ungin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given your medicine.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given Cancidas if:

- you are allergic to any other medicines
- you have ever had liver problems - you might need a different dose of this medicine
- you are already taking cyclosporin (used to help prevent organ transplant rejection or to suppress your immune system) - as your doctor may need to run extra blood tests during your treatment.
- if  you have ever had any other medical problem.

If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given Cancidas.

Cancidas may also cause Serious Cutaneous Adverse Reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).

## Other medicines and Cancidas

Please tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. This is because Cancidas can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines can affect the way Cancidas works.

Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines:

- cyclosporin or tacrolimus (used to help prevent organ transplant rejection or to suppress your immune system) as your doctor may need to run extra blood tests during your treatment
- some HIV medicines such as efavirenz or nevirapine
- phenytoin or carbamazepine (used for the treatment of seizures)
- dexamethasone (a steroid)
- rif ampicin (an antibiotic).

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you are given Cancidas.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine, if you are pregnant or breast-feeding or think you are pregnant.

- Cancidas has not been studied in pregnant women. It should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justif ies the potential risk to the unborn baby.
- Women given Cancidas should not breast-feed.

## Driving and using machines

There is no information to suggest that Cancidas af f ects your ability to drive or operate machinery.

## Cancidas contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 'sodium -free'.

## 3. How to use Cancidas

Cancidas will always be prepared and given to you by a healthcare professional. You will be given Cancidas:

- once each day
- by slow injection into a vein (intravenous infusion)
- over about 1 hour.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Your doctor will determine the duration of your treatment and how much Cancidas you will be given each day. Your doctor will monitor how well the medicine works for you. If you weigh more than 80 kg, you may need a different dose.

## Children and adolescents

The dose for children and adolescents may differ from the adult dose.

## If you have been given more Cancidas than you should

Your doctor will decide how much Cancidas you need and for how long each day. If you are worried that you may have been given too much Cancidas, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you notice any of the following side effects -you may need urgent medical treatment:

Instructions of how to reconstitute and dilute CANCIDAS:

## Reconstitution of CANCIDAS

DO NOT USE ANY DILUENTS CONTAINING GLUCOSE as CANCIDAS is not stable in diluents containing glucose. DO NOT MIX OR CO-INFUSE CANCIDAS WITH ANY OTHER MEDICINES, as there are no data available on the compatibility of CANCIDAS with other intravenous substances, additives, or medicinal products. Visually inspect the infusion solution for particulate matter or discolouration.

## CANCIDAS 50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE IN ADULT PATIENTS (50 mg vial)

## Step 1 Reconstitution of conventional vials

To reconstitute the powder bring the vial to room temperature and aseptically add 10.5 ml of water for injection. The concentrations of the reconstituted vials will be 5.2 mg/ml.

The white to off-white compact lyophilised powder will dissolve completely. Mix gently until a clear solution is obtained. Reconstituted solutions should be visually inspected for particulate matter or discolouration. This reconstituted solution may be stored for up to 24 hours at or below 25°C.

## Step 2 Addition of reconstituted CANCIDAS to patient infusion solution

Diluents for the final solution for infusion are: sodium chloride solution for injection, or lactated Ringer's solution. The solution f or inf usion is prepared by aseptically adding the appropriate amount of reconstituted concentrate (as shown in the table below) to a 250 ml infusion bag or bottle. Reduced volume infusions in 100 ml may be used, when medically necessary, for 50 mg or 35 mg daily doses. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or has precipitated.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE IN PAEDIATRIC PATIENTS (50 mg vial)

## Calculation of Body Surface Area (BSA) for paediatric dosing

Before preparation of infusion, calculate the body surface area (BSA) of the patient using the following formula: (Mosteller 2  Formula)

## Preparation of the 70 mg/m 2 infusion for paediatric patients &gt;3 months of age (using a 50-mg vial)

1. Determine the actual loading dose to be used in the paediatric patient by using the patient's BSA (as calculated above) and the following equation:

BSA (m 2 ) X 70 mg/m 2  = Loading Dose

The maximum loading dose on Day 1 should not exceed 70 mg regardless of the patient's calculated dose.

2. Equilibrate the refrigerated vial of CANCIDAS to room temperature.
3. Aseptically add 10.5 ml of water for injection. a This reconstituted solution may be stored for up to 24 hours at or below 25°C. b This will give a final caspofungin concentration in the vial of 5.2 mg/ml.
4. Remove the volume of medicine equal to the calculated loading dose (Step 1) from the vial. Aseptically transfer this volume (ml) c of reconstituted CANCIDAS to an IV bag (or bottle) containing 250 ml of 0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection, or Lactated Ringers Injection. Alternatively, the volume (ml) c of reconstituted CANCIDAS can be added to a reduced volume of 0.9 %, 0.45 %, or 0.225 % Sodium Chloride Injection or Lactated Ringers Injection, not to exceed a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. This infusion solution must be used within 24 hours if stored at or below 25°C or within 48 hours if  stored refrigerated at 2 to 8°C.

## Preparation of the 50 mg/m 2 infusion for paediatric patients &gt;3 months of age (using a 50-mg vial)

- 1.
- Determine the actual daily maintenance dose to be used in the paediatric patient by using the patient's BSA (as calculated above) and the following equation: BSA (m 2 ) X 50 mg/m 2  = Daily Maintenance Dose

The daily maintenance dose should not exceed 70 mg regardless of the patient's calculated dose.

2. Equilibrate the refrigerated vial of CANCIDAS to room temperature.

## ANNEX IV

## SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for caspofungin, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on caspofungin treatment failure during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membranes from the literature, spontaneous reports (including in five cases a close temporal relationship and fatal outcomes), and in view of a plausible mechanism of action (adsorption of the free drug fraction by PAN membranes leading to subtherapeutic exposure), the PRAC considers a causal relationship between caspofungin and treatment failure during CRRT with PAN membranes is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing caspofungin should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for caspofungin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing caspofungin is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
