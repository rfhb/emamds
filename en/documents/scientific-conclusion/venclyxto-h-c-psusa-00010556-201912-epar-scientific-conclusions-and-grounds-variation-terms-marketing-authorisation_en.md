## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for venetoclax, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

The serious infections (such as sepsis, pneumonia, septic shock etc.) are considered to be the most common cause of death (after those associated with the underlying malignancy or disease progression) in relation to  venetoclax  treatment.  In  this  reporting  interval,  a  total  of  765  reports  of  serious  infections  were identified. Since the overall number of events of serious infections is high, the healthcare professionals should be explicitly reminded of these cases. Section 4.4 of the SmPC for Venclyxto should therefore include a  standalone  undersection  entitled  'infections',  including  the  warning  statement  regarding  the  risk  of infections and their monitoring. The Package leaflet should be updated accordingly.

In addition, the actual format of text for recommendation for dose reduction in case of concomitant use with CYP3A inhibitors is considered difficult to read and respective data would be more easily readable when displayed in tabular format. The relevant information in section 4.2 of the SmPC for Venclyxto should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for venetoclax the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing venetoclax is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
