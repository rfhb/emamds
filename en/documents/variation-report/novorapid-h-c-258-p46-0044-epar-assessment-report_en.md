## 1. Introduction

On 14 January 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for NovoRapid, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that the paediatric trial NN1218-3888 was conducted as part of the currently ongoing development  programme  for  a  new  faster-acting  insulin  aspart  formulation.  In  trial  NN1218-3888, NovoRapid was selected as comparator.

NovoRapid (insulin aspart) is approved for the treatment of type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM) in adults (including pregnant women), adolescents and children aged 2 and above. The first marketing  authorisation  was  granted  on  07  Sep  1999  in  the  European  Union  (EU),  and  for  use  in children aged 2 and above on 30 Mar 2005.

There is no paediatric investigational plan (PIP) for NovoRapid. The use of NovoRapid in children and adolescents has been studied in a number of clinical trials.

In  this  report,  only  data  relevant  for  the  assessment  of  efficacy  and  safety  of  NovoRapid  in  the paediatric  population  is  discussed.  Evaluation  of  the  full  clinical  trial  report  will  be  conducted  at submission of the marketing authorisation application for faster-acting insulin aspart.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

NovoRapid (insulin  aspart),  100  U/mL  solution  provided  in  a  3  mL  PDS290  pen-injector.  The  batch number was CP50922. The formulation includes glycerol, phenol, metacresol, zinc chloride, disodium phosphate dihydrate, sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid/sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment), and water for injection.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study NN1218-3888, a randomised, single-centre, double-blind, single-dose, two-period crossover trial investigating the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of faster-acting insulin  aspart  and  NovoRapid  in  a  meal-test  setting,  in  children  (6-11  years),  adolescents (12-17 years) and adults (18-64 years) with T1DM.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## NN1218-3888  -  A  Trial  Investigating  the  Pharmacokinetic  Properties  of FIAsp (fast-acting insulin aspart) in Children, Adolescents and Adults with Type 1 Diabetes

## Description

This was a randomised, single-centre, double-blind, single-dose, two-period cross-over trial investigating the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of faster-acting insulin aspart and NovoRapid  in  a  meal-test  setting,  in  children  (6-11  years),  adolescents  (12-17  years)  and  adults (18-64 years) with T1DM.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

## Primary objective:

- To  compare  the  total  exposure  of  faster-acting  insulin  aspart  between  children,  adolescents and adult subjects with type 1 diabetes.

## Secondary objectives:

- To  compare  the  maximum  concentration  of  faster-acting  insulin  aspart  between  the  three different age groups.
- To  compare  the  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  faster-acting  insulin aspart and NovoRapid between the three different age groups.
- To compare the effects of age on faster-acting insulin aspart pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  properties  with  the  effects  of  age  on  NovoRapid  pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic properties.
- To compare the early pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of faster-acting insulin aspart vs. NovoRapid in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
- To assess the safety and tolerability of faster-acting insulin aspart in children, adolescents and adult subjects with type 1 diabetes.

## Assessor's comment:

This  assessment  report  focuses  on  the  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  insulin aspart, administered as NovoRapid, in children and adolescents in comparison to previous data.

The MAH does not suggest any changes to the product information based on the results.

## Study design

This was a randomised, single-centre, double-blind, single-dose, two-period, cross-over trial investigating the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of faster-acting insulin aspart and NovoRapid  in  children,  adolescents  and  adults  with  type  1  diabetes.  Each  subject  was  randomly allocated to a treatment sequence consisting of two dosing visits during which the subject received a single subcutaneous injection of either faster-acting insulin aspart or NovoRapid at a predefined fixed dose level (0.2 U/kg bw) in connection to intake of a standardised meal (meal test).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Immediately after (as soon as possible and no later than 2 minutes after) trial product administration, a  standardised  liquid  meal  (BOOST®  Nestlé/Novartis  Medical  Nutrition;  macronutrient  distribution: 68% carbohydrates, 17% protein, 15% fat) was given to the subject and consumed within 8 minutes after  dosing.  The  amount of BOOST® given was adjusted to the subject's weight. The subject then refrained from eating until 6 hours after dosing (end of the meal test).

Blood samples for determination of blood-glucose were collected during the meal test until 6 h postadministration. Blood-samples for determination of insulin in serum were taken up to 12 hours after drug-administration.

Free (PEG-precipitated) serum insulin aspart  was  measured using a  validated insulin aspart  specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

## Assessor's comment:

In general the study design appears acceptable.

The  bioanalytical  report  or  validation  reports  could  not  be  found  in  the  dossier.    This  may  be overlooked for this application.

## Sample size

The trial was a descriptive one, and, thus, the number of subjects needed to complete the trial was set to 12 in each of the three age groups without any formal sample size calculation, in accordance with current guidelines.

## Treatments

Each subject received a single subcutaneous dose of either fast-acting insulin aspart or NovoRapid in a randomised, double-blinded manner at a dose-level of 0.2 U/kg bw.

The  subjects  were  instructed  to  comply  with  the  requirements  for  their  diabetes  treatment  prior  to each  of  the  dosing  visits  (visit  2-3).  Three  days  (72  hours)  prior  to  trial  product  administration, subjects  using  insulin  degludec  were  switched  to  NPH  insulin,  and  2  days  (48  hours)  prior  to  trial product administration, subjects using insulin detemir or insulin glargine were switched to NPH insulin, according  to  individual  dosing  instructions  provided  by  the  investigator.  The  last  injection  of  NPH insulin or other intermediate-acting insulin products was to take place at least 22 hours prior to trial product administration.

At  the  dosing  visits,  the  subjects  were  to  meet  at  the  site  the  evening  before  dosing,  in  order  to receive an overnight infusion of human soluble insulin (Actrapid) until the morning of the dosing day in order to achieve stable plasma glucose concentration.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic parameters included AUCIAsp,0- 12 h, AUCIAsp,0-15min, AUCIAsp,0-30min,  AUCIAsp,0-1h, AUCIAsp,0-90min, AUCIAsp,0-2h, Cmax,IAsp, onset of appearanceIAsp, time to 50 % Cmax,Iasp.

## Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamic parameters included ΔPGav,0-1h, ΔPGav,0-2h, ΔPGav,0-6h, PG1h, PG2h, ΔPGmax (0-6 hours), PGmax (0-6 hours), tPGmax (0-6 hours), PGmin (0-6 hours).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical Methods

The primary endpoint as well as the secondary PK/PD endpoints were each analysed by means of a linear mixed model with treatment and period as fixed effects and subjects as random effect. For all the PD endpoints, PGPre-dose was added as a covariate. For the two PK endpoints onset of appearanceIAsp and time to 50% Cmax,Iasp, and for all PD endpoints the model was chosen to be additive whereas it was multiplicative for all other endpoints. When the PK endpoints were derived, compartmental modelling was  used  as  an  aid  wherever  applicable.  All  safety  endpoints  were  listed  and  summarized  using descriptive statistics.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 55 subjects were screened, of whom 41 were randomised. The most common reasons for screening  failure  were  not  having  a  total  daily  insulin  treatment  of  &lt;  1.2  (I)U/kg/day  (inclusion criterion  5)  and  not  having  a  total  daily  bolus  insulin  treatment  of  ≥  0.3  and  &lt;  0.7  (I)U/kg/day (inclusion criterion 6).

All  but  one  of  the  randomised  subjects  were  exposed  to  trial  products;  this  unexposed  subject  was withdrawn from the trial prior to visit 2, day 1 due to violation of dosing day exclusion criterion 13. Two further subjects were withdrawn from the trial after visit 2, following exposure to trial product (faster-acting insulin aspart in both cases): one subject was withdrawn due to there being difficulties in taking blood samples on a rescheduled dosing visit, whilst the other subject withdrew as it was not possible  for  him  to  attend  a  rescheduled  dosing  visit  3  necessitated  by  a  deviation  in  the  storage temperature affecting the trial product on the original date. The remaining 38 subjects were exposed to both faster-acting insulin aspart and NovoRapid and completed the trial.

N:Number of subjects，%: Percentage of subjects

One subject who completed the trial was randomised in error. All data for this subject was used.

## Baseline data

All randomised and exposed subjects were of race group White. There were more females (n=8) than males (n=4) in the children age group, whilst this was reversed in the adult group (4 females and 11 males). The distribution in the adolescent group was more equal, with 6 females and 7 males. The mean age was 10.4 years in the children age group (age range 9-11 years), 15.1 in the adolescent group (age range 13-17 years), and 20.2 in the adult group (age range 18-25 years). Ten of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

children were assessed as prepubertal (Tanner stage 1) and 2 as pubertal (Tanner stage 2 or above), and in the adolescent group, 1 was assessed as prepubertal and 12 as pubertal. The mean body weight was 40.7 kg (range 32.8-57.0 kg) in children, 62.4 kg (range 44.1-87.8 kg) in adolescents and 74.6 kg (range 54.4-105.7 kg) in adults.

The  mean  duration  of  diabetes  was  6.1,  6.9  and  8.9  years  for  the  children,  adolescent  and  adult groups, respectively, reflecting the young mean age of the adult group. Mean observed HbA1c values were lowest in children (7.7%), with the adult group having a mean value of 7.9%, and adolescents having the highest mean of 8.1%.

## Assessor's comment:

The age range in the paediatric patient group was very narrow, only including children aged 9-11. The adult patient group was relatively young with an age range of 18-25 years.

## Onset of appearance

The estimated onset of appearance of NovoRapid in children (9.83 minutes) and in adolescents (10.99 minutes) did not statistically significantly differ to that estimated for adults (12.28 minutes; Fieller age group  ratio  with  children  0.80  [0.57;1.08]95%  CI;  Fieller  age  group  ratio  with  adolescents  0.89 [0.72;1.12]95% CI). See Table 2.

The estimated time to 50% Cmax following administration of NovoRapid in children (30.93 minutes) was not statistically significantly different to that estimated in adults (37.01 minutes; Fieller age group ratio 0.84 [0.64;1.06]95% CI), but was statistically significant for adolescents (31.27 minutes) compared to adults (Fieller age group ratio: 0.84 [0.72;1.00]95% CI). See Table 2.

## Early insulin exposure

None of the AUCs covering the first 2 hours of the meal test (AUCIAsp 0-15min, AUCIAsp, 0-30min, AUCIAsp, 0-1h, AUCIAsp, ,0-1½h and AUCIAsp, 0-2h) were statistically significantly different between children and adults, or between adolescents and adults.

## Total insulin exposure

Estimated  total  exposure  to  NovoRapid  was  411.88  pmol*h/L  in  children,  515.16  pmol*h/L  in adolescents  and  689.07  pmol*h/L  in  adults,  meaning  that  total  exposure  was  approximately  40% lower  in  children  and  25%  lower  in  adolescents  compared  to  adults  when  dosed  at  0.2  U/kg  body weight, and these differences were significant. The mean absolute dose in the children group (8.3 U) was 47% lower than that in the adult group (15.6 U), and in the adolescent group (12.8 U) it was 18% lower than that in the adult group.

The  maximum  serum  insulin  aspart  concentration  for  NovoRapid  was  similar  between  children  and adults (age group ratio 0.91 [0.70;1.18]95% CI), and between adolescents and adult (age group ratio 0.91 [0.71;1.17]95% CI).

N:Number of subjects contributing to analysis,CI:Confidence interval The endpoint was log-transformed and analysed using a linear mixed model with age group, treatment,agegroup by treatment interaction and period as fixedeffects and subject as a random effect.The variance of the random effect and residual variance depends on age group.

## Assessor's comment:

Insulin aspart was rapidly absorbed in all patient groups. Total exposure was 40% lower in children and 25% lower in adolescents compared to the adult group. Cmax was 9% lower in both children and adolescents  compared  to  adult  patients.  This  is  not  completely  consistent  with  the  results  from previously  reported  data  which  showed  higher  AUC  and  Cmax  in  children  and  adolescents  than  in adults.  The  paediatric  studies  are  however  relatively  small  which  may  explain  the  inter-study differences. The age of the patients included in the current study was also rather narrow (children 9-11 years,  adolescents  13-17  years  and  adults  18-25  years)  and  not  entirely  representative  of  the  full populations.

The Applicant concludes that in general, the pharmacokinetic responses were similar to adults, which is in  agreement  with  previous  observations.  This  is  endorsed.  The  differences  between  children  and adults have previously been considered not to be clinically relevant since insulin is individually titrated. This conclusion remains.

In summary: The pharmacokinetic conclusion remains the same.

## Pharmacodynamic results

Mean baseline adjusted PG profiles for all age groups are shown for NovoRapid in Figure 5 and Figure 6.

A number of subjects received glucose interventions following administration of NovoRapid: 2 children, 1 adolescent and 5 adults. No interventions were made during the first 60 minutes, and the majority occurred between 120 minutes and 300 minutes following product administration. Because 38.5% of adults  (5  subjects)  received  a  glucose  intervention,  the  assessment  of  mean  change  in  PG concentration from 0-6 hours, of minimum PG levels, and the 0-6 hour PG profiles was affected, and it is  most  relevant  to  consider  the  pharmacodynamic endpoints covering the first 2 hours of the meal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

test. In the children group, 2 subjects (16.7%) received an intervention, as did 1 (7.7%) adolescent subject.

## Glucose-lowering effect by age group

Analyses  of  the  pharmacodynamic  endpoints  showed  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  the glucose-lowering effect of NovoRapid between children and adults or between adolescents and adults. The estimated mean changes in PG during the first and second hours (ΔPGav,0-1h and ΔPGav,0-2h) of the meal test tended to be larger in children and adolescents than in adults, although these differences

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were not statistically  significant  (Table  4).  These  patterns  were  further  supported  by  the  estimated mean PG level at 1 hour and at 2 hours.

N: Number of subjects contributing to analysis, CI: Confidence interval A linear mixed model with age group, treatment, age group by treatment interaction and period as fixed effects, subject as a random effect and PG predose as a covariate was used in the analysis. Ratios and the corresponding CIs were estimated using Fieller's method.

As  shown  in  Table  5,  ΔPGmax  in  children  following  treatment  with  NovoRapid  was  not  statistically significantly  different  to  that  in  adults  (Fieller  age  group  ratio  1.24  [0.90;1.71]95%  CI),  but  was statistically  significantly  greater  in  adolescents  compared  to  adults  (Fieller  age  group  ratio  1.32 [1.01;1.78]95% CI).

The  observed  mean  time  to  reach  maximum  PG  concentration  (tPGmax)  with  NovoRapid  was  highly variable for children (78.75 minutes; SD 91.38 minutes) and adolescents (173.88 minutes; SD 145.42 minutes), but there was less variability in the adult group (58.62 minutes; SD 17.83 minutes).

A linear mixed model with age group, treatment, age group by treatment interaction and period as fixed effects, subject as a random effect and PG predose as a using Fieller's method.

## Assessor's comment:

The  MAH  concludes  that  the  analyses  of  the  pharmacodynamic  endpoints  showed  no  statistically significant  difference  in  the  glucose-lowering  effect  of  NovoRapid  between  children  and  adults  or between adolescents and adults over the first 2 hours of the meal test. This conclusion is endorsed. Due to the need for interventions in the adult group, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the PD data beyond 2 hours after dosing.

The mean maximum plasma glucose excursion was similar in children and adults but was 32% greater in adolescents compared to adults (Fieller age group ratio: 1.32 [1.01;1.78]95% CI).

The findings are in line with previously presented data, also reflected in the SmPC of NovoRapid.

## Safety results

## Extent of exposure

The dose level for both dosing visits was 0.2 U/kg body weight, and the actual dose (U) was calculated using  body  weight  measured  prior  to  the  first  dose  administration  (visit  2).  The  relative  dose  was calculated  based  on  the  actual  body  weight  at  the  dosing  visit.  For  each  subject,  the  actual  dose remained the same at both dosing visits. No subject experienced a body weight change in excess of 5% between dosing visits. On average, children received 8.3 U, adolescents 12.8 U, and adults 15.6 U.

## Adverse events

A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined, for each treatment period, as an AE with onset in the 7 day period following first trial product administration. AEs were allocated to the trial product last received before onset of the AE.

There were 11 AEs reported by 9 subjects outside of the treatment period. The majority of these AEs (6 events in 6 subjects) occurred before any product had been administered. The remaining 5 events (3  subjects)  were  considered  unlikely  related  to  trial  drug  and  were  not  considered  TEAEs  as  they occurred outside of the 7-day period following trial product administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TEAEs were reported evenly across the age groups; in total, 7 TEAEs were reported in 5 subjects. Of these, 1 event was of moderate severity; the remainder were mild in severity. The SOC under which the greatest number of TEAEs was reported was gastrointestinal disorders (2 TEAEs). All TEAEs were single occurrences with no obvious pattern. All TEAEs were resolved by the end of the trial.

There  were  no  treatment  emergent  SAEs  (including  deaths)  or  medical  events  of  special  interest (MESIs).

In  total,  3  TEAEs  (2  subjects)  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to  a  trial product,  both  in  adolescents:  single  events  of  vomiting,  nausea  and  pyrexia.  All  subjects  recovered from the TEAEs reported in the trial. No subject withdrew from the trial due to an AE.

No  adverse  events  related  to  abnormal  vital  signs  or  other  safety  assessment  evaluations  were reported during this trial.

## Assessor's comment:

The  number  of  AEs  was  low  and  relatively  evenly  distributed  between  age  groups.  No  new  safety concerns arise from the reported data.

## Hypoglycaemia

In total, 11 treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes were reported by 9 subjects during the trial (Table  8).  There  were  7  documented  symptomatic  episodes  and  4  asymptomatic  episodes.  Two episodes  were  confirmed  hypoglycaemia  according  to  the  Novo  Nordisk  definition,  and  occurred  in adults.  Most  hypoglycaemic  episodes  (8)  were  experienced  by  adults,  possibly  reflecting  the  lower relative  amount  of  standardised  meal  administered  compared  to  that  administered  to  children  and adolescents. Most episodes (90%) were reported after 2 hours following administration.

Sixteen subjects received glucose interventions due to low PG levels: 3 children, 1 adolescent and 12 adults.  The  majority  of  the  interventions  occurred  after  120  minutes  post-treatment.  Interventions were made for both treatment groups, and any apparent imbalance between treatments in an age group is considered to be due to the low number of subjects and episodes.

There were no severe treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes.

Assessor's comment:

Most of the hypoglycaemias observed occurred in adults. The MAH proposes that this reflects the lower relative  amount  of  standardised  meal  administered  compared  to  that  administered  to  children  and adolescents, which appears adequate. The majority of events (10/11) were observed between 2 and 5 hours after dosing. No severe treatment emerging hypoglycaemic events were reported.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Data  from  trial  NN1218-3888  has  been  submitted  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC) No1901/2006. The study was conducted as part of the currently ongoing development programme for a new faster-acting insulin aspart formulation and NovoRapid was selected as comparator.

In  this  report,  only  data  relevant  for  the  assessment  of  efficacy  and  safety  of  NovoRapid  in  the paediatric  population  is  discussed.  Evaluation  of  the  full  clinical  trial  report  will  be  conducted  at submission of the marketing authorisation application for faster-acting insulin aspart.

Insulin aspart was rapidly absorbed in all patient groups. Total exposure was 40% lower in children and 25% lower in adolescents compared to the adult group. Cmax was 9% lower in both children and adolescents  compared  to  adult  patients.  This  is  not  completely  consistent  with  the  results  from previously  reported  data  which  showed  higher  AUC  and  Cmax  in  children  and  adolescents  than  in adults.  The  paediatric  studies  are  however  relatively  small  which  may  explain  the  inter-study differences. The age of the patients included in the current study was also rather narrow (children 9-11 years,  adolescents  13-17  years  and  adults  18-25  years)  and  not  entirely  representative  of  the  full populations.

The Applicant concludes that in general, the pharmacokinetic responses were similar to adults, which is in  agreement  with  previous  observations.  This  is  endorsed.  The  differences  between  children  and adults have previously been considered not to be clinically relevant since insulin is individually titrated. This conclusion remains.

The analyses of the pharmacodynamic endpoints showed no statistically significant difference in the glucose-lowering effect of NovoRapid between children and adults or between adolescents and adults over the first 2 hours of the meal test. Due to the need for interventions in the adult group, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the PD data beyond 2 hours after dosing. The mean maximum plasma glucose excursion was similar in children and adults but was 32% greater in adolescents compared to adults (Fieller age group ratio: 1.32 [1.01;1.78]95% CI).

The  PD  findings  presented  with  this  submission  are  in  line  with  previously  presented  data,  also reflected in the SmPC of NovoRapid.

No new safety concerns arise from the reported data. Most of the hypoglycaemias observed occurred in adults, probably due to the lower relative amount of standardised meal administered compared to that administered to children and adolescents. No severe treatment emerging hypoglycaemic events were reported.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

The  data  presented  is  in  line  with  previously  presented  PK/PD  data  for  NovoRapid  in  children  and adolescents. No new safety concerns arise from the reported data. No updates to the PI are needed.
