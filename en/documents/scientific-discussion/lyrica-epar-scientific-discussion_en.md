## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of Lyrica. For information on changes after approval please refer to module 8.

## Introduction

The  active  substance  of  Lyrica  is  pregabalin.  The  original  claimed  indication  was  the  treatment  of neuropathic pain in adults and as adjunctive therapy for patients 12 years of age and older with partial seizures  with  or  without  secondary  generalisation.  The  dose  range  is  150  to  600  mg  per  day. Pregabalin  is  an  analogue  of  the  mammalian  neurotransmitter  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA). Although  its  precise  mechanism  of  action  is  still  unclear,  pregabalin  decreases  central  neuronal excitability  by  binding  to  an  auxiliary subunit  ( α 2 -δ protein)  of  a  voltage-gated  calcium  channel  on neurons in the central  nervous  system.  Pregabalin reduces the release of  several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, noradrenaline, and substance P. This application concerns a complete application concerning a new active substance according to article 8.3 (i) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## Neuropathic pain

Neuropathic  pain  is  defined  as  'Pain  initiated  or  caused  by  a  primary  lesion  or  dysfunction  in  the nervous system'. Neuropathic pains are divided into peripheral neuropathic pain due to lesion of the peripheral  nervous  system  and  central  pain  following  lesions  of  the  central  nervous  system. Neuropathic pain commonly is described as hot burning, throbbing, shooting, lancinating, stabbing, sharp,  cramping,  gnawing,  aching,  heavy,  tender,  splitting,  tiring,  exhausting,  sickening,  fearful, punishing,  cruel,  icy  cold,  tingling,  pins  and  needles,  intense  and  itch  like.  Medical  descriptors  are allodynia (pain due to a stimulus which does not normally provoke pain), hyperalgesia (an increased response to a stimulus which is normally painful), hyperaesthesia (increased sensitivity to stimulation, excluding the special senses), dysaesthesia (an unpleasant abnormal sensation, whether spontaneous or evoked),  hyperpathia  (a  painful  syndrome  characterised  by  an  abnormally  painful  reaction  to  a stimulus, especially a repetitive stimulus, as well as an increased threshold) and neuralgia (pain in the distribution  of  a  nerve  or  nerves  not  necessarily  of  paroxysmal  quality).  Neuropathic  pain  may  be associated  with  mood  changes,  sleep  disturbance,  fatigue  and  may  have  an  impact  on  physical  and social functioning. The prevalence of neuropathic pain is estimated to be about 1%.

The relationship between aetiology, pathophysiology and symptoms in neuropathic pain is complex. After  a  nerve  injury,  stimulus  independent  pain  may  be  evoked  by  an  accumulation  of  sodium channels in the injured neurons, the expression of α -adrenoreceptors on injured axons, sprouting of sympathic  axons  into  the  dorsal  root  ganglion  and  disinhibition  of  dorsal  horn  neurons.  This disinhibition  is  thought  to  be  due  to  a  reduction  in  GABA,  down  regulation  of  GABA  and  Opioid receptors at dorsal horn neurons and loss of inhibition by interneurons of the dorsal horn. Stimulus dependent pain is thought to be due to sensitisation of dorsal horn neurons mediated by glutamate and stimulation  of  NMDA  receptor.  These  mechanisms  offer  a  framework  for  pharmacotherapy  of neuropathic pain.

Well-known neuropathic pain syndromes are diabetic neuropathy and post-herpetic neuralgia.

Diabetic neuropathy causing pain is present in 10% of the cases at the time of diagnosis of diabetes and  is  more  than  50%  after  25  years  of  the  diabetic  disease.  Painful  diabetic  neuropathy  is  mostly associated  with  chronic  distal  diabetic  sensory-motor  polyneuropathy.  Persistent  burning  pains affecting the feet, ankles and lower leg is the most common symptom. The pain may cause disturbance of  sleep  and  psychological  distress.  Painful  neuropathy  in  diabetics  however,  is  not  limited  to polyneuropathy. Proximal mononeuropathies, truncal neuropathy and cranial mononeuropathies also often occur.

Postherpetic neuralgia  may be considered a complication of herpes zoster. If pain persists for more than a few months, it is unlikely to resolve spontaneously. It is estimated that about 9-14% of patients with herpes zoster develops postherpetic neuralgia. The incidence increases rapidly with high age.

Other neuropathic syndromes are trigeminal neuralgia, pain following amputation, and central pain. A variety of pain conditions may have a neuropathic component, e.g. cancer neuropathic pain.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Neuropathic pain has been shown to be therapy resistant. Usually a list of possible effective agents is tried until an agent and dose is found that provides satisfactory control of the pain for that individual patient.  However,  the  treatment  effect  of  conventional  agents  is  disappointing  and  if  an  effect  is observed it is usually transient.    A  number  of  agents  have  been  used  in  neuropathic  pain  including NSAID's, opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants,  excitatory  amino  acid  antagonists,  GABA-ergic agonists,  Substance  P  antagonists  etc.  Low  doses  of  carbamazepine  and  amitriptyline  have  been recommended for neuropathic pain in general. However, there is no acknowledged standard treatment for the neuropathic pain in the EU. In several European countries carbamazepine and amitriptyline are used  off-label  for  this  indication.  In  some  Member  states  gabapentin  has  been  approved  for  the treatment of neuropathic pain.

## Epilepsy

Epilepsy is  a  common neurological disorder, with a worldwide  estimated prevalence of 50  million. Epilepsy may be defined as a continuing tendency to experience epileptic seizures. For epidemiological purposes, the definition is that of more than one non-febrile seizure of any type. The two peaks in incidence are in early childhood and in the elderly (&gt; 65 years). Although patients with epilepsy  may  recover  spontaneously  over  time,  about  20-30%  of  all  patients  will  have  life-long epilepsy.

The  classification  of  epileptic  seizures  according  to  the  International  Classification  of  Epileptic Seizures  (ILAE)  depends  upon  clinical  symptoms  and  signs  during  the  seizure,  and  the  age  of  the patient at onset. Both aetiology (idiopathic, symptomatic and cryptogenic) and localization (partial vs generalised) are considered crucial prerequisites for an adequate approach of epileptic disorders. The debate on these topics is still ongoing. In the case of partial seizures, there is always a focus, and this type of epilepsy is limited to one part of one hemisphere. Partial seizures can be further sub-divided into  simple  partial  (without  impairment  of  consciousness),  complex  partial  (with  impairment  of consciousness  with  or  following  a  simple  partial  onset)  and  secondarily  generalised  (i.e.  partial seizures, either simple or complex, which evolve to generalised tonic-clonic seizures). Simple partial seizures, depending on the anatomical site of origin of the seizure discharge, may be motor, sensory, aphasic, cognitive, affective, dysmnesic, illusional, olfactory or psychic. Primary generalized seizures do not have a focus and are classified as absence, tonic, atonic, myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures. The complex partial and tonic-clonic types account for the majority (60%) of seizure types.

The  burden  of  epilepsy  is  high  to  the  patients  themselves,  their  families  and  society.  Patients  with epilepsy have a mortality risk approximately two to three times that of the general population, with Sudden  Unexplained  Death  in  Epilepsy  (SUDEP)  a  well-recognised  complication  of  the  condition itself. Many patients have additional behavioural, neurological and/or intellectual disturbances.

The  pathophysiology  of  most  forms  of  epilepsy  remains  poorly  understood,  but  it  is  known  that epileptic  seizures  arise  from  an  excessively  synchronous  and  sustained  discharge  of  a  group  of neurones.  The  feature  common  to  all  epileptic  syndromes  is  a  persistent  increase  in  neuronal excitability.  Established  antiepileptic  drugs  decrease  neuronal  membrane  excitability  by  interacting with  ion  channels  (e.g.  sodium,  potassium  or  calcium  channels)  or  neurotransmitter  receptor complexes (mostly promotion of inhibitory GABA-ergic neurotransmission, or interference with the glutamate system).

The treatment of an individual patient with partial seizures relies on diagnosing the seizure type and epilepsy syndrome, and is focussed on the reduction of seizure frequency, with seizure freedom as the ultimate  goal.  Usually,  treatment  consists  of  daily  anticonvulsant  medication.  Antiepileptic  drugs share their activity at the central nervous system, and therefore have similar side effects, i.e. sedation, somnolence, lethargy and ataxia. Product specific side effects and individual differences in tolerability require a treatment regime that is adjusted to the individual patient. In approximately 70% of patients, monotherapy will satisfy, whereas in another 10% of patients treatment with more than one compound is necessary. Still, up to 30% of patients remain refractory to conventional treatment. For this reason, over the past decade, several new antiepileptic drugs were developed and marketed (a/o. felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, levetiracetam), in order to optimise the therapeutic spectrum and risk/benefit profile.

## Quality aspects

## Introduction

Lyrica is presented as hard capsules containing 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 or 300 mg of pregabalin as active substance. The different strengths can be distinguished by the imprinting, colour and size of the capsules.

The other ingredients include lactose monohydrate, maize starch, talc, hard gelatin capsule shell and imprinting ink.

Lyrica  is  supplied  in  PVC/Aluminium  blister  (14,  21,  56  and  84  pack  size)  and  PVC/Aluminium perforated unit dose blister (100x1 pack size).

## Drug Substance

Pregabalin is the S enantiomer of 3-(aminoethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid, an analogue of the gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) mammalian neurotransmitter.

It is a white to off-white, highly crystalline, non-hygroscopic and water soluble (freely soluble below pH  3.7)  powder.  It  contains  one  chiral  centre,  but  is  synthesised  as  the  single  enantiomer S .  The absolute configuration has been confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. Pregabalin exists as a single anhydrous and not solvated crystal form. Polymorph screening performed during development did not indicate any possible solid-state form transition events.

## · Manufacture

Pregabalin  is  prepared  at  three  different  sites  through  a  two-step  chemical  synthesis.  The  first  step consists of the synthesis of pregabalin racemate from commercially available starting materials. The undesired R enantiomer is subsequently removed by a classical resolution method. Pregabalin crude is terminally purified by recrystallisation from isopropyl alcohol and water to give pregabalin.

Some identified non-clinical and clinical batches have been produced by a different synthetic route, but with essentially the same specification (no major differences in impurity profile).

Satisfactory specifications and associated methods have been provided for the starting materials, key intermediate (pregabalin racemate), reagents and solvents.

## · Specification

The drug substance specification includes test for appearance, identity (IR and chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC),  impurities,  water  content  (PhEur),  heavy  metals  (PhEur),  residue  on  ignition  (PhEur), residual solvents, bulk density and particle size.

The formation of the desired enantiomer of pregabalin is ensured through the route of synthesis and confirmed by a chiral identity test. In addition, the R enantiomer is controlled as part of the specified impurities.

Particle size is part of the specification, but is not expected to be a critical parameter with regards to the bioavailability of the capsules, taking into account the water solubility of pregabalin. This has been confirmed by the broad range particle size distribution of drug substance lots used in clinical studies (see pharmaceutical development).

Specification  limits  have  been  adequately  justified  by  analytical,  stability  and  toxicity  data.  The analytical methods used in routine controls have been suitably described and validated.

Batch analysis data provided for 95 lots prepared using the commercial (n=91) and the development synthesis routes have shown no major differences, especially in term of impurity profiles. These data confirm satisfactory compliance and uniformity with the proposed specification.

## · Stability

Stability data have been provided for 3 batches synthesized by the commercial process. 3-year data under long term conditions (25°C/60% RH - intended packaging) and 6-month data under accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH- intended packaging) have been provided. A photostability study has been performed and indicates that the drug substance is not light sensitive. No racemisation of pregabalin was shown during stress stability studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A  3-year  retest  period  is  supported  by  the  presented  data  when  the  substance  is  stored  in  sealed doubled low density polyethylene bags placed in drums with secure fitting lids.

## Drug Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

Pregabalin being a highly soluble and highly permeable compound, the oral dosage form developed is of standard formulation. The excipients selected are of PhEur quality, commonly used for this type of dosage form and were selected based on compatibility studies with the drug substance.

Particle size distribution of the drug substance has been shown not to adversely impact drug product manufacture and performance (see drug substance).

Regarding  the  TSE  risk,  satisfactory  certificates  of  suitability  have  been  provided  for  the  gelatine capsule shells. The lactose derived from milk of bovine origin has been considered in compliance with the current TSE requirements.

The PVC/aluminium blister selected  meet the PhEur requirements for  packaging  material  and  is  in compliance with European regulation on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs.

With the exception of an aqueous oral solution used in low-dose phase 1 study, powder-filled hard gelatine capsules of similar qualitative composition, ranging in dose from 5 to 300 mg, and prepared from  powder  blend  formulation  series  A  (25%  pregabalin  w/w),  B  (44.44%  pregabalin  w/w)  or  C (75% pregabalin w/w) have been used throughout clinical development.

Representative  formulations  from  each  series  have  shown  to  have  similar  dissolution  profiles  as defined  by  the Note  for  guidance  on  the  investigation of  bioavailability  and  bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 . Based on this result and taking into account the characteristics  of  the  drug  substance  and  of  the  drug  product,  it  is  acceptable  not  to  perform  a bioequivalence study between clinical and commercial formulations.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The  method of  manufacture  involves  the  following  operations:  delumping  of  pregabalin  and  of  the excipients,  blending  and  encapsulation.  In  order  to  accommodate  the  range  of  dosage  strengths,  2 powder blends formulation are used for commercial manufacturing. Formulation series A containing 25% w/w pregabalin is used to produce 25 and 50 mg capsules and formulation series C containing 75% w/w pregabalin is used to produce the other strengths.

Satisfactory  validation  data  have  been  provided  for  1  of  each  full-scale  powder  blend  and  the corresponding  capsules.  No  change  of  formulation  or  process  has  been  necessary  during  scale-up, confirming the robustness of the formulation and of the process.

## · Product Specification

The  product  specification  includes  tests  controlled  by  validated  methods  for  appearance,  identity (HPLC,  IR),  assay  (HPLC),  impurity  content  (HPLC),  dissolution,  uniformity  of  mass  (PhEur), identification of colourants (non routine test) and microorganism count (PhEur non routine test).

Batch analysis data have been provided for 45 batches from both formulation series. All data comply with the specifications and indicate consistent and reproducible manufacture.

## · Stability of the Product

Stability data under long-term conditions (25°C/60% RH - intended packaging) are available for 24 months  and  36  months  for  respectively  9  lots  and  1  lot  packed  in  clear  PVC  blister.  6  months accelerated  stability  data  (40°C/75%  RH-  intended  packaging)  are  available  for  22  batches.  A photostability study showed that the drug product is non-light sensitive.

The data provided support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  active  substance  is  well  characterised  and  documented.  The  pharmaceutical  form  selected  is adequate  taken  into  account  the  properties  and  stability  of  the  water-soluble  drug  substance.  The excipients  are  commonly  used  in  this  kind  of  formulation  and  the  packaging  material  is  well documented.  The  manufacturing  processes  were  developed  and  optimized  to  obtain  reproducible

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

finished product batches. Stability tests under ICH conditions indicate that the products are stable for the proposed shelf life.

## Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Lyrica contains pregabalin as drug substance. Pregabalin is a new active substance known chemically as  (S)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic  acid  and  is  structurally  related  to  the  naturally  occurring amino  acids  L-leucine  and γ -aminobutyric  acid  (GABA).  Pregabalin  has  been  developed  for  the treatment of neuropathic pain and as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures.

The maximal recommended dose in humans is 600 mg/day, with an associated mean AUC (0-24) of around 123 µ g ⋅ hr/mL.

Pregabalin was assessed in nonclinical models of analgesia in rats and monkeys, and seizure models in mice and rats. The (R)-enantiomer of pregabalin and positive control agents were included in many of these  studies.  Pharmacokinetics  were  studied  in  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  monkey.  A  standard nonclinical safety evaluation program was conducted to support oral therapy with pregabalin.

Pregabalin is structurally and pharmacologically related to gabapentin, an anti-epileptic drug approved in most European countries, registered for the adjunctive treatment of refractory partial epilepsy with or without secondary generalised seizures. In addition gabapentin has been approved in some Member states for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics ( in vitro/in vivo )

Pregabalin  is  an  analogue  of  the  mammalian  neurotransmitter  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA). However,  pregabalin  does  not  mediate  its  effects  specifically  though  an  effect  upon  GABA-ergic transmission.

Pregabalin displaces [3H]gabapentin and both in vitro and in vivo studies with animal models further indicate  that  binding  of  pregabalin  to  the  alpha 2-delta  auxiliary  subunit  protein  of  voltage-gated calcium  channels  affinity  with  high  affinity  (IC 50 =  37  nM)  is  required  for  its  pharmacology.  The (R)-enantiomer of pregabalin was 10-fold less potent than pregabalin (S-enantiomer) in binding at these  sites,  consistent  with  the  general  lack  of  effect  in  efficacy  models.  As  determined  by  either radioligand binding or functional assays, pregabalin is inactive against 41 common neurotransmitter receptors  and  ion  channels.  Pregabalin  partially  reduces  neurotransmitter  release  in  several in  vitro systems at concentrations near 10 µM (1.6 ng/mL). Inhibition is most pronounced with prior activation of  neuronal  tissues  (from  prior  peripheral  inflammation in  vivo , in  vitro application  of  sensory neuropeptides or cellular second messengers, or by depolarization lasting for 120 seconds or more). In vitro,  pregabalin  reduces  the  release  of  glutamate,  norepinephrine,  Substance P,  and  calcitonin gene-related  peptide  from  certain  brain  tissues  and  also  reduces  calcium  influx  in  synaptosomes. These  findings  indicate  that  pregabalin  inhibits  calcium  channel  function  in  a  subtle  manner. Pregabalin  also  is  a  substrate  for  the  System  L  amino  acid  transporter  of  cell  membranes  that contribute to the permeation of pregabalin across membrane barriers. Pregabalin does not change the concentration of GABA in rat brain and does not alter binding or responses at GABA-A or GABA-B receptors and is not a substrate or blocker of GABA transport, nor an inhibitor of GABA-transaminase.

Pregabalin reduces both sensory and motor spinal reflexes induced by toe pinch in rats, and this effect was pronounced only in rats that were previously inflamed by injection of an immune antigen or in rats with neuropathic pain from chronic constriction injury to the sciatic nerve. Pregabalin treatment reduces pain-related behavior in neuropathic animal models of diabetes, peripheral nerve damage or chemotherapeutic  insult and  in a model  of  musculoskeletal-associated  pain.  Pregabalin  given intrathecally  prevents  pain-related  behaviors  and  reduces  pain-related  behavior  caused  by  spinally administered agents, suggesting that it acts directly on tissues of the spinal cord or brain.

Pregabalin is also active in animal models of seizures, including maximal electroshock tonic extensor seizures in mice or rats, threshold clonic seizures from pentylenetetrazol, behavioural and electrographic seizures in hippocampal kindled rats, and tonic and clonic seizures in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

DBA/2 audiogenic mice.  Pregabalin does not reduce the incidence of spontaneous absence seizures in Genetic Absence Epilepsy in Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS).

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

Pregabalin was  also investigated in animal models  predictive of anxiolytic-like activity and inflammatory pain.

## · Safety pharmacology

Potential CNS effects of pregabalin were evaluated in 10 studies. The predominant findings in these studies were reduced spontaneous locomotor activity and/or ataxia in rats given oral doses ≥ 25 mg/kg and in mice given IV or IP doses ≥ 300 mg/kg or oral doses of 1000 mg/kg. In the Sidman Avoidance test  in  squirrel  monkeys,  pregabalin  dose-dependently  reduced  activity  and  motor  coordination  at 30 and 100 mg/kg. Pregabalin induced dose-related increases in non-rapid eye movement sleep (nonREM sleep) at ≥ 3 mg/kg and decreased REM sleep at ≥ 30 mg/kg without affecting latency to onset of non-REM  sleep  or  overall  sleep  cycle  length.  The  effects  of  pregabalin  resemble  effects  of  sleep deprivation  on  subsequent  sleep,  suggesting  pregabalin  induces  a  physiological-like  sleep  without significantly affecting total sleep duration.

No significant effects on cardiovascular parameters were observed in rats given escalating oral doses from 10 to 300 mg/kg, in rats given single IV doses of 15 and 150 mg/kg, in dogs given a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg, or in monkeys given single IV doses of 10 or 40 mg/kg. Although ECG was only evaluated visually for rate and rhythm abnormalities in safety pharmacology studies, a comprehensive evaluation, including measurement of QT interval, was conducted in monkeys given pregabalin for up to  69  weeks.  Daily  oral  administration  of  pregabalin  for  65  to  69  weeks  at  doses  up  to  500  mg/kg produced  no  cardiac  changes  attributable  to  drug  treatment.  No  statistically  significant  differences occurred between treated and control groups in echocardiographic parameters except for increases in aortic diameter in males at 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg at Week 13 (29%, 19%, and 14%, respectively) and increased left ventricular internal dimension (systole) in males at 500 mg/kg at Week 39 (52%). The latter was only seen in males at an 8-fold therapeutic exposure.

No  significant  effects  on  renal  function  were  observed  in  rats  given  single  IV  doses  of  15 and 150 mg/kg.

Pulmonary function in anesthetized dogs given a cumulative IV dose of pregabalin of 200 mg/kg was unaffected.

Pregabalin given orally decreased gastric emptying and intestinal transit of a liquid meal in rats given 100 or 300 mg/kg (4- to 8-times mean human exposure at the maximum recommended dose) but not at 30 mg/kg  (equivalent  to  mean  human  exposure),  by  a  non-opiate  mechanism.  Nevertheless, obstipation  events  were  reviewed  in  clinical  trials  and  no  specific  safety  concerns  were  identified, although a slightly higher incidence in pregabalin-treated subjects vs placebo was observed.

Pregabalin  was  inactive  at  binding  sites  associated  with  drugs  of  abuse.  Pregabalin  did  not  cause conditioned place preference in rats, suggesting that pregabalin does not share morphine's rewarding properties.  Pregabalin  did  not  produce  opiate-like  or  benzodiazepine-like  discriminative  stimulus effects and did not maintain I.V. self-administration responses in rhesus monkeys. Pregabalin induced only  modest  and  mostly  statistically  insignificant  withdrawal  signs  in  rats  upon  discontinuation  of treatment.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted.

## · Summary of salient findings

In vitro studies show that pregabalin interacts with an auxiliary subunit ( α 2δ protein) of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system. Binding to this subunit is probably required for its analgesic  and  anticonvulsant  activity.  Pregabalin  does  not  interact  with  either  GABAA  or  GABAB receptors; it is not converted metabolically into GABA or a GABA agonist; it is not an inhibitor of GABA uptake or degradation. Although its precise mechanism of action is still unclear, pregabalin decreases central neuronal excitability by binding to an auxiliary subunit ( α 2δ protein) of a voltagegated calcium channel on neurons in the central nervous system. In addition, pregabalin reduces the release  of  several  neurotransmitters,  including  glutamate,  noradrenaline,  and  substance  P.  The significance of these effects for the clinical pharmacology of pregabalin is not known.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pregabalin  induces  modest  ataxia  and  reduced  spontaneous  locomotor  activity  in  rats  given ≥ 25 mg/kg P.O., but has no effect on cardiovascular parameters. A detailed evaluation of cardiovascular safety was performed in a repeated dose toxicity study in monkeys. The analgesic and anticonvulsant actions of pregabalin occur at doses that lack obvious behavioral side effects. Pregabalin has a low potential for drug abuse or physical dependence.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  elimination  of  pregabalin  were  investigated  in  the species used in pharmacology and/or toxicology studies (mouse, rat, and monkey), using similar or identical formulations. The metabolism was also studied in dogs. Dose  proportionality and accumulation were assessed using  multiple-dose pregabalin toxicokinetic data in  mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey.

Plasma pregabalin concentrations in mouse, rat, rabbit and monkey were determined using  validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays. The limit of quantification was 0.1 ug/ml in all species. Pregabalin concentrations were quantified in dog plasma using a similar HPLC assay.

No in  vitro or in  vivo racemization  of  pregabalin  (S-enantioner)  to  PD  144550  (R-enantiomer)  was observed.

## · Absorption- Bioavailability

Pregabalin  is  well  absorbed  following  oral  administration.  Absolute  bioavailability  of  pregabalin  is high  (&gt;80%) in  mice and rats at  a  50-mg/kg  dose  and  in  monkeys  at  a  10-mg/kg  dose.  In  general, pregabalin exposure is dose-proportional up to 2500 mg/kg in mice and rats (except for gravid and lactating rats), and up to 50 mg/kg in monkeys.

## · Distribution

[14C]Pregabalin is widely distributed in most tissues and crosses the blood-brain barrier in mouse, rat, and monkey after oral administration. Radioequivalents concentrate in the pancreas of mice and rats, but not in primates. Distribution in pancreas may be related to affinity to branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase  (BCAT),  an  enzyme  found  in  high  concentrations  in  rodent  pancreas.  Pregabalin does  not  bind  to  mouse,  rat,  monkey,  or  human  plasma  proteins.  [14C]Pregabalin  red  blood  cell (RBC)/plasma partition coefficients range from 0.69 to 0.80 for all species tested.

## · Metabolism ( in vitro/in vivo )

Pregabalin  undergoes  minimal  metabolism  in  mouse,  rat,  and  monkey  with  unchanged  parent representing the majority ( ≥ 90%) of drug-derived material in urine. A minor metabolite representing 2% to 3% of the urinary radioactivity in mouse and rat is identified as the N-methyl metabolite (PD 0155083). In monkey, only 1 minor (&lt;1%) unidentified component is detected in the urine. In dog, approximately 45% of the pregabalin dose is excreted in urine as N-methyl metabolite (PD 0155083).

No  significant  inhibition  of  major  cytochrome  CYP450 isoforms  is  observed  up  to  a  pregabalin concentration  of  1 mM.  The  potential  for  metabolism  related  drug-drug  interaction  is  low  at therapeutic concentrations of pregabalin.

## · Excretion

Urine is the principal route of 14C excretion following [14C]pregabalin administration. In mouse, rat, and dog, ≥ 80% of the [14C] pregabalin oral dose is present in the 0- to 24-hour urine sample, while 71%  to  75%  is  excreted  by  monkey  during  the  same  interval.  Higher  than  90%  of  the  dose  was recovered in 0-96 hour urine in rat and monkey.

## · Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters (in different species)

Pregabalin  is  well  absorbed  after  oral  administration  (exposure  is  dose-proportional  at  doses  up  to 2500 mg/kg in rats and up to 50 mg/kg in monkeys), widely distributed in most tissues (and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier in mice, rats, and monkeys), does not bind plasma proteins (in mouse, rat, monkey and human), undergoes minimal metabolism in mouse, rat, and monkey with unchanged parent representing ≥ 90% of drug-derived material in urine. In contrast to other animal species and humans,  approximately  45%  of  the  pregabalin  dose  is  excreted  in  urine  as  N-methyl  metabolite  in dogs. These data also confirm selection of the rat and monkey as appropriate species for toxicology studies. No significant inhibition of major cytochrome CYP450 isoforms was observed at pregabalin concentrations up to 1 mM.

## Toxicology

## · Single dose toxicity

The acute oral and IV toxicity of pregabalin was assessed in adult mice and rats. The four single dose toxicity studies are summarised in the table below.

| Species/ Sex/Number/group   | Dose/Route (mg/kg)   |   Observed max non- lethal dose | Major findings                                |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Mouse 3-5/sex/gp            | Oral: 0, 5000        |                            5000 | Mild hypo-activity in males                   |
| Rat 3-5/sex/gp              | Oral: 0, 5000        |                            5000 | Mild hypo-activity, diarrhoea, urine staining |
| Mouse 3-5/sex/gp            | IV: 0, 300           |                             300 | None                                          |
| Rat 3-5/sex/gp              | IV: 0, 300           |                             300 | Hypo-activity, ataxia, urine staining         |

No mortality was observed after single oral administration of 5000 mg/kg and single IV administration of 300 mg/kg to mice and rats. Observed effects were hypo-activity in mice and rats and diarrhoea, ataxia, and urine staining in rats.

## · Repeat dose toxicity

Repeated-dose oral and IV toxicity was evaluated in rats and monkeys. Twelve oral GLP repeat dose toxicity studies were conducted in rats (14 days, two assays of 1 month, 3 months and 6 month/1 year) and cynomolgus monkeys (escalating dose study, 14 days, two assays of 1 month, 4-day toxicokinetic study, 3 months, 65-69 weeks). Pivotal studies are summarised in the table below.

Both  in  rats  and  in  monkeys,  mortality  occurred  at  exposures  7-9  times  the  maximal  daily  human exposure; in rats, mortality occurred sporadically at this exposure multiple, associated with pyelonephritis and/or cystitis.

In  rats,  generally,  body  weight  gain  and  food  consumption  were  decreased.  However,  in  the  rat carcinogenicity  study  body  weight  and  food  consumption  increased  in  the  low  dose  group.  In monkeys, decreased food consumption was only observed in one study.

CNS  effects  such  as  ataxia  and  hypoactivity,  but  also  hyperactivity  were  observed  in  rats  and monkeys.

In  some  intravenous  studies  in  monkeys,  tremors  and  convulsions  were  seen  as  well.  In  rats,  urine staining was observed frequently.

In both rats and monkeys, dermatopathy and vasculopathy were observed, primarily on the tail, but also on the extremities, and, in IV studies in monkeys, also on mucous membranes. In IV studies in monkeys, the lesions were more widespread. The primary alteration involved damage to endothelial cells  of  superficial  blood  vessels  (vasculopathy)  in  skin  and  mucous  membrane.  Temperature measurements of the tail of monkeys did not indicate changes in blood perfusion. A local lymphe node assay in rats gave no indication for allergic dermatitis.

Effects  on  haematology  were  not  consistent.  In  rats,  increases  were  observed  in  red  blood  cells, haemoglobin and hematocrit, whereas in monkeys these parameters were decreased. In rats, platelets were decreased and there was a decrease in bone marrow megakaryocytes and total nucleated cells. In monkeys,  platelets  were  decreased  in  one  study,  but  otherwise  there  were  no  relevant  effects  on platelets. Haematological changes in mice are described below when carcinogenicity is discussed.

Effects  on  the  urogenital  tissues  were  observed,  consisting  of  dilatation  of  urinary  bladder  (in  one study  accompanied  by  oedema,  haemorrhage  and  hyperplasia)  and  renal  pelvis  in  rats  and  kidney

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dilatation in monkeys. Pyelonephritis was observed occasionally in rats and occurred dose-related in males in the rat carcinogenicity study at all doses. In the same study, distension of the uterine horn was  observed  in  the  high  dose  females.  In  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies,  there  were  effects  on  male reproductive organs: hypospermia, interstitial fibrosis in epididymides, prostatic atrophy and degeneration of spermatogenic epithelium in the testes of rats and, in one study only, hypospermia in monkeys. On retrospective examination, no significant effects were observed on spermatogenesis in the testes of rats. In the rat carcinogenicity study, epididymal and testicular weight decreased 18% at the  high  dose  and  the  incidence  of  small  testes  increased  at  all  doses  and  correlated  with  tubular atrophy  observed  histopathologically  and  there  was  a  dose-related  increase  in  the  incidence  of aspermia  in  the  epididymides.  The  increased  incidence  of  bilateral  tubular  atrophy  was  not  doserelated.  The  incidence  of  small  seminal  vesicles  was  increased  at  the  high  dose,  but  there  were  no histopathologic changes. Lesions in the male reproductive tract generally were observed in debilitated animals or were consistent with spontaneous or age-related changes commonly found in rats.

Some signs of immunotoxicity were observed, generally only at very high exposures, consisting in haemorrhage and mild lymphoid depletion in the thymus of rats and thymus involution, minimal to mild lymphoid necrosis and lymphocytolysis in spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and tonsils in monkeys.

There  were  some  effects  on  the  eyes  of  rats.  Corneal  degeneration  and  mineralization  attributed  to anaesthesia and chromodacryorrhea were observed in IV studies and a dose-related increase in retinal atrophy, which was more pronounced in females, in the carcinogenicity study was seen.

In a few treated monkeys from the 4-week pivotal study, some cardiac effects were observed. In these monkeys, increased relative heart weights and minimal to mild focal myocardial necrosis or fibrosis of the left ventricular wall and/or interventricular septum as well as atrium fibrosis were observed at 3-4 times human exposure. These histopathological studies were not confirmed in a 13-week follow-up study.  Extensive  monitoring,  including  ECG,  blood  pressure  and  echocardiography  did  not  reveal abnormalities, except for increases in aortic diameter in males at ≥ 100 mg/kg. Aortas were considered normal  upon  gross  and  microscopic  examination,  and  consequently  the  increased  diameter  was  not considered significant. From the available data, the daily oral administration of pregabalin for 65 to 69 weeks  at  doses  up  to  500  mg/kg,  and  exposures  up  to  approximately  8  times  human  exposure, produced no cardiac changes attributable to drug treatment.

In the 52-week rat study, 4 rats died of malignant tumours (mesenchymal tumours, mesothelioma, and hemangiosarcoma) in week 32 (2 animals), and weeks 48 and 52 (each 1 animal).

In one rat study, atrophy and single cell necrosis was observed in the pancreas, but only at very high exposures.

## · Genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo

Pregabalin was not genotoxic based on results of a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests:

- -in  vitro :  AMES  test  performed  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  various  metabolic  activation systems and  point  mutation  and  structural  chromosome  aberration  assays  in  Chinese  hamster ovary cells.
- -in vivo : micronucleus test in mouse and rat bone marrow, and, unscheduled DNA synthesis test in rat and mouse hepatocytes.

## · Carcinogenicity (with toxicokinetics)

Two-year carcinogenicity studies were performed in mice and rats, at the following doses.

| Dose/Route                                                        | Species/number of animals         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0, 200, 1000 and 5000 mg/kg Oral/diet                             | B6C3F1 mice/ 65 animals/sex/group |
| 0, 200, 1000 and 5000 mg/kg Oral/diet                             | CD-1 mice/ 65 animals/sex/group   |
| Male: 0, 50, 150 and 450 mg/kg; Female: 0, 100, 300 and 900 mg/kg | Wistar rats/ 65 animals/sex/group |
| Male: 0, 50, 150 and 450 mg/kg; Female: 0, 100, 300 and 900 mg/kg | Wistar rats/ 65 animals/sex/group |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pregabalin induced an increase in hemangiosarcoma in male and female B6C3F1 mice at 1000 and 5000 mg/kg, i.e. at exposures ≥ 5 times the mean human exposure at the maximum recommended dose. The  NOAEL  was  seen  at  exposures  equivalent  to  the  mean  human  exposure.  In  CD-1  mice,  an increased  incidence  of  hemangiosarcoma  was  observed  at  an  exposure  28  times  the  mean  human exposure at the maximum recommended dose. The NOAEL in this study was seen at exposures up to 5 times mean human exposure. Pregabalin was not carcinogenic in rats at up to 14 and 24 times the mean human exposure at the maximum recommended dose in males and females, respectively.

See 'Discussion on the non-clinical aspects'.

## · Reproductive and developmental studies

Studies  to  assess  effects  of  pregabalin  on  fertility  and  general  reproduction  and  prenatal-postnatal development were conducted in rats, and embryo-foetal development studies were conducted in mice, rats, and rabbits. Additional in vitro and in vivo studies assessed male reproductive toxicity, a series of studies examined skull development in rats, and a study evaluated the period of drug exposure during prenatal-postnatal development that affected foetal and prenatal survival.

In the fertility studies effects were observed in treated male rats. At high doses (several tenfold human exposure),  epididymides  were  affected,  as  well  as  the  sperm  cells:  sperm  count,  motility  and  the number  of  sperm  cells  with  normal  morphology  were  dose-relatedly  decreased.  At  about  77  times human exposure, the males were infertile. This appeared to be a reversible effect: after 6 weeks of recovery,  all  fertility  parameters  returned  to  vehicle  control  values.  The  NOAEL  is  250  mg/kg  (10 times  human exposure).  Pregabalin  did  not  produce  detrimental  effects  on  reproductive  function  of healthy male subjects given 600 mg/day for 3 months, based on semen analysis and other secondary parameters,  when  compared  to  placebo  (see  clinical  section).  Although  some  effects  in  testis  and epididymides  seen  in  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study  suggest  long-term  exposure  may  exacerbate spontaneous degenerative processes in male reproductive organs in the rat, the negative findings in the clinical study and the high doses used in the fertility studies in rats and the reversibility of the effects seen at high doses suggest that the findings seen at those high doses in the rat fertility studies and the findings in the rat carcinogenicity study are of little or no clinical relevance. The applicant stated that female fertility was not affected, however, various parameters pointed to a reduced fertility index and prolonged  oestrous  cycles  in  females  at  doses  resulting  in  an  exposure  54-77  times  the  human exposure.

No maternal toxicity was observed in mice given pregabalin up to 2500 mg/kg during the period of organogenesis. At doses ≥ 1250 mg/kg (14-31 times human exposure), ossification was reduced but not in a dose-related manner. Studies in female rats dosed with pregabalin up to 2500 mg/kg showed maternal toxicity at all doses, and fetal body weight was decreased at 2500 mg/kg. At high doses ( ≥ 1250  mg/kg;  54-77  times  human  exposure),  advanced  ossification  was  observed,  resulting  in  e.g. earlier  closure of the suture between the jugal bone to maxilla, and of the suture between the nasal bones.  At  the  same  high  doses,  also  reduced  ossification  was  observed  in  rats.  In  rabbits,  maternal toxicity  was  seen  at  all  doses,  and  abortion,  decreased  foetal  and  placental  weights,  and  decreased ossification  indicative  of  developmental  toxicity  were  observed  at  1250 mg/kg  (39  times  human exposure).  Overall,  developmental  toxicity  was  not  observed  at  clinically  relevant  doses.  Variable ossification is observed in the animals at high doses. Due to the high exposure multiple the deviant skull bone ossification is considered not clinically relevant.

In  a  pre/postnatal  study  in  rats,  pregabalin  induced  maternal  toxicity  at ≥ 50 mg/kg  (twice  human exposure) and offspring developmental toxicity at ≥ 100 mg/kg (5 times human exposure). Fetal and neonatal survival were decreased at ≥ 250 mg/kg (11 times human exposure), with total litter death at 2500 mg/kg (exposure multiple is &gt;70). In a subsequent time-course study, it was shown that drugrelated  prenatal  mortality  resulted  primarily  from  exposure  during  late  gestation  (gestation  day  17 through parturition).

Therefore, pregabalin should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential  risk  to  the  foetus.  Effective  contraception  must  be  used  in  women  of  child bearing potential.

## · Local tolerance

In rabbits there was no significant irritation after intravenous administration of pregabalin in the ear for 5 days, although at the site of injection, the incidence of haemorrhage and oedema seem to have

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

been slightly  increased  in  treated  animals.  Mild  irritation  occurred  on  rat  ear  skin  in  a  local  lymph node assay. There was no evidence of contact sensitization in guinea pigs when the racemic mixture of pregabalin was tested.

## · Other toxicity studies

In  view  of  a  possible  paediatric  indication,  the  applicant  studied  juvenile  toxicity  in  single  and repeated dose studies, reproductive toxicity and neurotoxicity in juvenile rats which were 7 days at study  initiation.  Toxicity  as  observed  in  the  juvenile  rats  does  not  differ  qualitatively  from  that observed in adult rats. However, relative to adult rats juvenile rats are similarly sensitive with respect to CNS effects and decreased body weight gain and more sensitive with respect to female and male reproductive effects. In addition, neurobehavioural/cognitive effects were observed in juvenile rats 1-2 weeks after the exposure period.

Most effects  were  observed  at  clinically  relevant  exposures  (CNS,  body  weight  gain)  or  above  the mean therapeutic exposure at the maximum recommended dose (female reproductive effects).

Alterations in acoustic startle response and impaired performance in learning and memory tests were not  pharmacological but signs of developmental toxicity, since they were observed in the drug free period after exposure. The fact that no behavioural/cognitive effects were observed in adult humans is not  sufficiently  reassuring,  since  these  effects  may  be  related  to  the  developing  state  of  the  brain. Therefore  the  reversibility  of  these  effects  should  be  further  addressed  in  non-clinical  study.  See discussion on non-clinical aspects.

It  has  been  demonstrated  sufficiently  that  no  increased  risk  is  to  be  expected  from  the  impurities PD 0144550 and PD 0147804 at the maximum expected daily human dosage.

## · Summary of salient findings

In  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  monkeys  CNS  effects  were  observed,  including hypoactivity, hyperactivity and ataxia. In rats an increased incidence of retinal atrophy was observed after long-term exposure.

Pregabalin was not teratogenic in mice, rats or rabbits. Foetal toxicity in rats and rabbits occurred only at  exposures  sufficiently  above  human  exposure.  In  prenatal/postnatal  toxicity  studies,  pregabalin induced offspring developmental toxicity in rats at exposures &gt;2 times the maximum recommended human exposure.

Pregabalin is not genotoxic based on results of a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests.

In  mice,  no  increased  incidence  of  tumours  was  found  at  exposures  similar  to  the  mean  human exposure,  but  an  increased  incidence  of  haemangiosarcoma  was  observed  at  higher  exposures.  See discussion below.

In juvenile rats, at therapeutic exposures, there was evidence of CNS clinical signs of hyperactivity and  bruxism  and  decreased  body  weight  gain.  Oestrous  cycle  effects  in  female  rats  occurred  at ≥ 5 times human exposure. Neurobehavioural effects were also observed in juvenile rats. See discussion below.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

In vitro studies show that pregabalin interacts with an auxiliary subunit ( α 2 -δ protein) of voltage-gated calcium  channels  in  the  central  nervous  system.  Although  its  precise  mechanism  of  action  is  still unclear,  pregabalin  decreases  central  neuronal  excitability  by  binding  to  an  auxiliary  subunit  ( α 2 -δ protein)  of  a  voltage-gated  calcium  channel  on  neurons  in  the  central  nervous  system.  In  addition, pregabalin  reduces  the  release  of  several  neurotransmitters,  including  glutamate,  noradrenaline,  and substance  P.  The  significance  of  these  effects  for  the  clinical  pharmacology  of  pregabalin  is  not known.  Pregabalin  is  well  absorbed,  widely  distributed,  undergoes  minimal  metabolism  with unchanged parent representing ≥ 90% of drug-derived material in urine (except in dog). No significant inhibition of major cytochrome CYP450 isoforms was observed.

Pregabalin was shown to induce haemangiosarcoma in mice. An association between platelet and bone marrow  changes  and  increased  hemangiosarcoma  incidence  was  observed  at  carcinogenic  doses  of pregabalin.  Such  changes  were  not  seen  in  rats.  Given  the  role  of  bone  marrow  and  platelets  in endothelial homeostasis and the endothelial origin of haemangiosarcoma, the Applicant considered the exposure of endothelial cells to elevated levels of growth factors resulting from increased

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

megakaryopoiesis  and  increased  activation  of  platelets  as  the  most  plausible  mode  of  action  of pregabalin-induced  stimulation  of  endothelial  cell  proliferation  in  mice,  a  species  predisposed  to developing hemangiosarcoma. The relationship between increases in platelet activation, bone marrow and splenic megakaryopoiesis, circulating and tissue levels of endothelial growth factors (PDGF and VEGF, respectively), endothelial cell proliferation, and incidence of haemangiosarcoma was shown in investigational studies in mice at carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic doses of pregabalin. The temporal relationship between these changes and increased endothelial cell proliferation and haemangiosarcoma formation is consistent with a causal association. The lack of similar changes in platelet activation and related  endothelial  proliferation  in  rats  and  monkeys  demonstrates  that  the  same  mechanism  is  not active  in  these  species.  Subsequent  studies  in  mice  showed  that  pregabalin-induced  respiratory depression resulted in increased plasma bicarbonate, pCO2, and blood pH (overcompensated relative metabolic  alkalosis).  Increased  pH  was  shown  to  increase  ADP-dependent  platelet  activation  and aggregation in vitro. Although similar changes in respiration, bicarbonate, and pCO2 were seen in rats, there  were  no  changes  in  pH  as  a  result  of  appropriate  compensation  and  therefore,  no  subsequent alterations in platelet function. Thus, the Applicant concludes that the alterations in platelet function in mice result from disturbances in acid-base balance due to pregabalin-induced changes in respiratory function and overcompensation to these changes resulting in chronic relative metabolic alkalosis.

Thus  far  there  are  no  clear  indications  that  increased  platelet  activation  and  the  related  sequelae leading to haemangiosarcoma formation occur when pregabalin is administered to humans. However, additional  long  term  human  data  may  be  needed  to  understand  if  increased  platelet  activation  by pregabalin is mild in humans and without relevance. Therefore it was agreed that the applicant will provide additional long-term clinical data concerning assessment of platelet morphology, a surrogate marker of platelet activation, in humans receiving pregabalin.

In view of the pre-clinical toxicological finding of myocardial lesions in monkeys (at exposures 3-4 times  the  therapeutic  exposure),  its  relevance  to  humans  was  initially  questioned.  Clinically,  no cardiac concerns were raised with pregabalin in terms of arrhythmias that might possibly be related to the pre-clinical finding. In addition, a subsequent 13-week chronic study with pregabalin in monkeys, with an elaborate follow-up of animals with regular ECG and echocardiography, did not show druginduced  arrhythmia's  or  changes  in  blood  pressure.  No  echocardiographic  differences  were  found between pregabalin- and placebo-treated animals, except for an increased aortic diameter in males at &gt;100 mg/kg pregabalin. Aortas were considered normal upon gross and microscopic examination, and consequently the increased diameter was not considered of significance. This was not associated with other concurrent echocardiographic, or blood pressure effects. As a consequence, follow-up of patients with echocardiography does not appear meaningful.

There  were  some  effects  on  the  eyes  of  rats.  An  increased  incidence  of  retinal  atrophy  commonly observed in aged albino rats was seen after long term exposure to pregabalin at exposures 5 times the mean human exposure at the maximum recommended clinical dose. (See clinical part).

Compared to adult rats, juvenile rats are similarly sensitive, notably with respect to CNS effects and decreased  body  weight  gain.  Female  and  male  reproductive  effects  occurred  at ≥ 5  times  human exposure.  In  addition,  neurobehavioural/cognitive  effects  were  observed  in  juvenile  rats  1-2  weeks after the exposure period at exposures ≥ 5 times human exposure. The reversibility of these effects has not  been  studied.  In  view  of  further  pediatric  development,  it  may  therefore  be  questioned  whether monitoring in pediatric studies is sufficient. Upon CPMP's request, the applicant agreed to conduct an additional study in juvenile rats to assess reversibility of alterations in acoustic startle response and impaired performance in learning and memory as a post-approval commitment.

## Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The active substance of Lyrica is pregabalin, an analogue of the mammalian neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric  acid  (GABA).  Lyrica  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  peripheral  neuropathic  pain  in adults and as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation. The dose range is 150 to 600 mg per day.

The  clinical  programme  included  21  pharmacokinetic  studies,  3  pharmacodynamic  interactions studies. The clinical programme to support the claimed indications are described below. Other studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

have been performed to investigate the effect of pregabalin in psychiatric diseases and in additional pain models.

In February 2001, a partial clinical hold of pregabalin was imposed by the FDA for safety reasons; increased incidence of haemangiosarcoma formation was reported in mice. Therefore several studies were terminated prematurely, or were amended with respect to the inclusion of patients.

## Neuropathic pain:

Twelve randomised placebo controlled studies in neuropathy were submitted:

- -Six studies evaluated the efficacy in diabetic neuropathy (DPN-014, DPN-029, DPN-040, DPN131, DPN-149 and DPN-173),
- -Five studies (PHN-030, PHN-045, PHN-127, PHN-132 and -196) were performed in postherpetic neuropathy,
- -One study in both diabetic and post herpetic neuropathy (Study 155).

Studies  DPN-173  and  PHN-132  were  terminated  prematurely  due  to  the  report  of  increased haemangiosarcoma formation in mice; almost none of the patients completed the study.

There were several extension studies (open label, long term studies) which enrolled patients from the DPN  studies,  PHN  studies  or  studies  investigating  the  efficacy  of  pregabalin  in  other  (nonneuropathic) chronic pain states.

## Epilepsy:

For  efficacy  in  patients  with  refractory  partial  seizures  3  controlled  (009,  011,  034),  and  4 uncontrolled (008, 010, 012, 035) studies were submitted. Additionally, a proof of concept study (007) was performed and a controlled titration study (145) was terminated prematurely due to the report of increased hemangiosarcoma formation in mice. These two studies were not considered pivotal, but to provide additional information.

It is stated in the Applicant's clinical overview that the trials were conducted in accordance with \"good clinical practice\" (GCP).

## Pharmacokinetics

To support the application of Lyrica, the following pharmacokinetic studies were submitted:

- -3 single dose studies (1008-001, - 002, -005),
- -2 multiple dose studies (1008-002, -023),
- -2 studies in patients with an impaired renal function (studies 1008-049, -121),
- -7 interaction studies (1008-018/126, -019, -020, -075, -140, -077, -144),
- -3 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interaction studies (1008-076, -078, -079),
- -2 bioequivalence/bioavailability studies (1008-003, -128),
- -2 single dose studies conducted in Japan (studies 1008-1J, -2J)

In all studies, healthy volunteers were included, except for study 1008-018/126, -019, -020, and -140, which included epileptic patients.

## · Absorption - Bioavailability

The pharmacokinetics of pregabalin is straightforward and uncomplicated. The absolute bioavailability is estimated to be more than 90%. Pregabalin AUC and Cmax values increased linearly with dose after single dose administration over the dose range of 1 - 300 mg and after multiple dose administration  over  the  dose  range  of  25  -  300  mg  q8h  and  at  300  mg  q12h.  Peak  plasma concentrations were reached 0.5 - 1.5 h after administration. Steady state was achieved within 2 days, and  no  unexpected  accumulation  occurred.  In  line  with  the  linear  pharmacokinetics,  the  total  daily exposure  is  similar  whether  the  total  daily  dose  was  divided  q12h  or  q8h,  with  almost  comparable Cmax values, but with around 20% lower trough levels for the q12h treatment.

## · Bioequivalence

The capsule formulations used in the clinical trial  program  are comparable: identical excipients are used,  although  not  in  the  same  quantity.  In  addition,  the  to  be  marketed  capsule  formulations  are similar to the formulations used in the clinical trial program. No bioequivalence studies are submitted to compare the different formulations used. Instead a biowaiver was requested, taking into account the criteria  mentioned  in  the  CPMP  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  investigation  of  Bioavailability  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Bioequivalence. Pregabalin can be considered highly soluble and rapidly dissolving at the pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8, and is highly permeable. The excipients used were lactose monohydrate, corn starch and talc and are well known, and considered not critical with regard to dissolution, solubility and absorption. In  addition,  pregabalin  is  rapidly  absorbed,  the  pharmacokinetics  are  linear  over  the  intended  dose range after single dose as well as after multiple dose, and pregabalin is not hepatically metabolised and renally excreted almost completely as intact drug. Taking into account these data, pregabalin can be considered to fulfil the criteria for applying a biowaiver as mentioned in the guidance, and the waiver from performing in vivo bioavailability-/bioequivalence studies on pregabalin has been granted.

## · Distribution

In vitro protein binding studies using human plasma indicate that pregabalin does not bind to plasma protein at clinically relevant plasma concentrations of 0.1 - 20 µg/ml. The volume of distribution was estimated to be about 0.56 l/kg (about 42 l), similar to that of total body water.

## · Metabolism and excretion

In vitro studies using human liver cytosolic and microsomal preparations indicate that pregabalin is not (or negligibly) metabolised. In vivo, renal clearance covered 88% of the total clearance, which was indicated  by  the  excretion  of  more  than  90%  of  the  dose  as  intact  pregabalin  in  the  urine.  The elimination half-life of about 6.3 h was independent of dose and not affected by repeat administration. The total body clearance is about 80 ml/min.

## · Special populations

Pharmacokinetics in patients on concurrent anti-epileptic therapy were comparable with the pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers.

As  can  be  expected  from  a  product  that  is  completely  intact  excreted  in  urine,  an  impaired  renal function results in a lower elimination of pregabalin from the body resulting in an increased exposure. Therefore a dose reduction is proposed, based upon the relationship between the patients creatinine clearance and pregabalin plasma clearance. During haemodialysis, pregabalin is adequately eliminated from  the  body.  To  compensate  for  this  loss  of  drug,  an  additional  dose  should  be  given  after haemodialysis.

With  regard  to  male  and  female  patients,  the  elderly  and  patients  with  an  impaired  liver  function (which  have  not  been  specifically  studied)  the  pharmacokinetics  have  not  been  seen  to  be,  nor  are expected to be, clinically significantly altered in these patient groups.

## · Interaction studies

The in vitro and in vivo metabolism studies indicate that pregabalin is not a substrate for cytochrome P450 isozymes,  does  not  inhibit  cytochrome  P450  isozymes  and  does  not  bind  to  plasma  proteins. Pregabalin pharmacokinetics were not clinically significantly affected by concomitant treatment with sodium valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, ethinyl estradiol/ norethindrone, gabapentin, ethanol, phenytoin, lorazepam and oxycodone. In addition, pregabalin did not clinically significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of these drugs.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the 3 commonly  used  drug  classes, oral antidiabetics, diuretics and insulin, and the 7 most commonly used anti-epileptic drugs, carbamazepine,  lamotrignine,  phenobarbital,  phenytoin,  tiagabine,  topiramate  and  valproate,  had  no clinically significant effect on pregabalin clearance.

## Pharmacodynamics

## · Mechanism of action

Although  its  precise  mechanism  of  action  is  still  unclear,  pregabalin  decreases  central  neuronal excitability  by  binding  to  an  auxiliary subunit  ( α 2 -δ protein)  of  a  voltage-gated  calcium  channel  on neurons  in  the  central  nervous  system.  In  addition,  pregabalin  reduces  the  release  of  several neurotransmitters,  including  glutamate,  noradrenaline,  and  substance  P.  The  significance  of  these effects for the clinical pharmacology of pregabalin is not known.

There is no specific human pharmacodynamic model for studying anti-epileptic products.

## · Primary and Secondary pharmacology

Three studies were submitted, in which the pharmacodynamic interaction of pregabalin was studied in healthy  volunteers  in  relation  to  other  drugs  that  interfere  with  the  central  nervous  system,  i.e.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lorazepam  (076),  oxycodone  (078),  and  ethanol  (079).  Their  effect  was  studied  at  the  level  of  the respiratory system and CNS function. No overall mean data were presented in the dossier, therefore the results are of descriptive nature only. In none of the studies an effect was observed with respect to respiratory suppression, nor was there any correlation between plasma levels of the tested drugs and their effects on cognition.

Lorazepam  and  pregabalin  produced  consistent  impairments  in  cognitive  performance  (mainly reaction time and alertness). Their combination potentiated these effects.

The  opiate  oxycodone  administered  by  itself  resulted  in  few  decrements  of  task  performance. Pregabalin alone impaired cognitive function (mainly reaction time). When  administered in combination,  the  detrimental  effects  on  cognition  and  motor  performance  appeared  additive  rather than synergistic.

Cognitive function (mainly reaction time) was affected by ethanol alone, but not by pregabalin alone. The combination, however, showed a potentiation of pregabalin on the alcohol related impairment of cognitive and gross motor function.

From these limited number of pharmacodynamic studies no conclusion can be drawn with regard to the impact of pregabalin on cognition.

## Clinical efficacy

- Dose response study(ies)

The  selection  of  doses  (150-600  mg/day  of  pregabalin)  for  the  different  studies  was  based  on pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability data for pregabalin in healthy volunteers (001, 002, 003, and 023),  while  taking  into  consideration  the  relative  potencies  of  pregabalin  and  gabapentin  in  animal seizure  models  and  the  dose/plasma  concentrations  achieved  in  humans.  Hence,  no  formal  Phase  2 dose finding studies in patients were conducted.

- Main studies

## Peripheral Neuropathy

Twelve  randomised  placebo  controlled  studies  in  peripheral  neuropathic  pain  were  submitted.  Six studies  concerned  diabetic  peripheral  neuropathy,  five  postherpetic  neuralgia  and  one  both  diabetic peripheral  neuropathy  and  postherpetic  neuralgia.  Studies  DPN-173  and  PHN-132  were  terminated prematurely.

The table below presents main features of the pivotal studies in neuropathy.

In all studies the primary aim was to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin on the neuropathic pain versus placebo. The clinical studies in peripheral neuropathic pain were fairly similar. Each study consisted of two phases. Baseline was a one week phase during which patients were screened for eligibility to enter  the  double-blind  phase.  The  subsequent  double-blind  phase  encompassed  a  titration  period  of 0 to  2 weeks  followed  by  a  fixed-dose  period  (4 to  12 weeks). Outcome  scales  and  the  statistical analyses  of  these  studies  were  almost  identical.  The  main  differences  concerned  the  dosage  and duration  of  double-blind  period  (from  5-13  weeks).  In  study  DPN  040  an  amitriptyline  arm  was incorporated as a positive control. Study 155 includes both DPN and PHN and a flexible dose arm.

## Study Participants

The diagnosis of polyneuropathy was based on the neurological history and examination. The main inclusion and exclusion criteria for the diabetic neuropathy were a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus with a painful distal, symmetrical, sensorimotor polyneuropathy for at least 1 year (with an upper limit of 5 years in studies 14, 29 and 131) and HbA1C level ≤ 11%. Patients were required to have a score of &gt; 40 mm on the  VAS  (visual  analogue  pain  scale)  of  SF-MPQ  at  screening  and  randomisation;  and  an average daily pain score of &gt;4 points over the baseline phase. Additional inclusion/exclusion criteria included the absence of other conditions that might explain the polyneuropathy; mononeuropathy; the absence  of  other  pain  syndromes  and  the  use  of  concurrent  medication  that  may  affect  the assessments. Antidiabetic medication should be stable and constant during the study.

In the postherpetic neuralgia studies patients suffered from pain for more than 3 months, (more than 6 months for PHN-040) after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash. The main inclusion and exclusion criteria were, a score of &gt; 40 mm VAS of SF-MPQ at screening and randomisation and an average daily pain score of ≥ 4 points over the baseline phase.

## Treatments

In most studies pregabalin was titrated to the fixed doses over 1-2 weeks. The daily pregabalin dose ranged from 75 to 600 mg daily divided over three or two doses. In studies DPN-149, DPN-173, PHN127,  PHN-132  and  PHN-196  randomisation  was  stratified  according  creatinine  clearance  status. Patients  randomised  to  the  300/600  mg/day  arm  received  a  dose  of  300  mg/day  if  their  estimated creatinine  clearance  (CLcr)  was  30  to  60  mL/min,  or  a  dose  of  600  mg/day  if  their  CLcr  was  &gt;60 mL/min. The 300 mg dose in patients with a low creatinine clearance was considered equivalent to a dose  of  600  mg  in  patients  with  a  normal  renal  function.  Hence,  this  study  arm  referred  to  as  the 300/600 mg arm. Originally, pregabalin was developed with a three times daily (TID) regimen, later a two  times  daily  (BID)  programme  was  considered  based  on  the  similarity  of  the  BID  and  TID pharmacokinetic profiles and to increase compliance.

In study 155, there were 3 arms besides the placebo arm, there was a flexible dose arm and a fixed dose arm. Patients in the flexible dose arm received escalating doses of pregabalin 150-300-450-600 mg/day titrated at weekly dose intervals. Based upon patient's response the dose was increased or kept stable. If intolerance occurred, a single dose reduction to the previous level was allowed. Patients in the fixed dose arm started with pregabalin 300 mg which was increased to 600 mg daily the second week. The daily doses were given in a BID regime.

Antidepressants were allowed as a co-medication in pain studies if the medication was stable for 30 days  prior  to  study  start..  Aspirin  was  allowed  for  prevention  of  myocardial  infarction  and/or  TIA (transient ischemic attack). In some studies lorazepam was allowed as a hypnotic. The agents should have  been  used  before  study  start  and  kept  stable  for  the  duration  of  the  study.  Paracetamol  was allowed in all studies up to 3-4 gram daily on an 'as needed' basis.

In the studies in diabetic neuropathy the anti-diabetic medication had to remain stable throughout the course of the studies.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary efficacy assessment was based upon an 11 point Numerical Rating Pain Scale with 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain. The pain was assessed by the patient in their daily pain score diary. The  patients  scored  their  pain  during  the  last  24  hours  at  awakening.  The  primary  endpoint  in  all studies was the weekly mean pain score at endpoint (=endpoint mean score) defined as the mean pain score for the last 7 available pain diary entries while on study medication. Responder rates defined as a 50% reduction in pain score as compared to baseline were part of a secondary analysis.

Numerous secondary efficacy measurement scales were used. Almost all studies included the ShortForm  McGill  Pain  Questionnaire  (SF-MPQ),  a  Sleep  interference  scale,  the  global  impression  of change by clinician (CGIC), the global impression of change by patient (PGIC), the SF-36 Quality of life  Questionnaire  and  a  mood  assessment  (profile  of  mood  states  [POMS],  Hospital  anxiety  and depression scale [HADS] or Zung).

## Statistical methods

In all studies, except study DPN-149, the primary analysis concerned the ITT population defined as subject randomised receiving at least one medication. In study DPN-149 the primary dataset was the modified ITT population defined as all randomised patients with at least one study medication and not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

withdrawn as a result of regulatory agency or ethic committee decisions (11 patients less than the ITT population).  For  non-completers  the  last  observation  was  carried  forward.  Primary  comparisons concerned  the  effect  of  each  pregabalin  group  versus  placebo.  The  endpoint  mean  pain  score  was analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using the baseline mean score as the covariate, in order to adjust for differences in baseline pain score among the treatment groups.

The number of patients per treatment group was determined assuming 2-sided testing to give &gt;90% power to detect a difference in endpoint mean pain scores ≥ 1.3 between at least 1 pregabalin group and  placebo.  The  difference  in  endpoint  mean  pain  score  of  1.3  was  based  on  published  studies  in DPN and PHN.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow and Baseline data

Drop out rates across the treatment groups for all combined studies ranged from 9% to 23%.

In the diabetic neuropathy studies 6.1%, 5.2%, 4.5%, 2.6% and 3% of the subjects withdrew due to lack of efficacy for placebo, pregabalin 75mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg respectively. Withdrawal rates due to adverse events were 3.7%, 2.6%, 3.9%, 9.7% and 10.9% respectively.

In the postherpetic neuralgia studies (except study 196 which results were available later) 5.9%, 0.0%, 0.0%, 0.9% and 0.0% of the subjects withdrew due to lack of efficacy for placebo, pregabalin 75mg, 150 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg respectively. Withdrawal rates due to adverse events were 7.1%, 2.4%, 8.5, 21.7% and 28.8% respectively.

The following table provide the numbers of patients randomised, numbers of completers and reasons for withdrawal (LOE= lack of efficacy, AE=adverse event), for each study.

Treatment  groups  were  similar  with  respect  to  demographic  characteristics  including  age  and  sex. Within  the  diabetic  neuropathy  studies  the  treatment  groups  had  a  similar  duration  of  diabetes, haemoglobin  A1c  levels  and  baseline  pain  score.  Within  the  postherpetic  neuralgia  population,  the duration  of  the  disease  in  the  treatment  groups  were  comparable.  The  high  age  of  the  postherpetic neuralgia population is in accordance with what is expected.

The age distribution, duration of diabetes, type of diabetes and duration of postherpetic neuralgia are presented in the following table for each study.

a The baseline score was the mean of last 7 available scores before taking study medication.

b The mean endpoint score was the mean of the last 7 available scores on study medication, or mean of available scores.

c

- The endpoint score were adjusted for treatment and centre (cluster) and baseline score. The  p-value  is  adjusted  by  the  Hochberg  procedure  for  multiple  comparisons  between  treatment  arms  if applicable.
- d In  study  DPN149  the  data  set  analysed  concerned  the  modified  ITT  population  defined  as  all  randomised patients with an at least one study medication and not withdrawn as a result of regulatory or ethic committee decisions.
- e xx  weeks  indicates  that  the  study  was  stopped  prematurely.  In  study  173  the  median  exposure  time  was  2-3 weeks and  75% of the subjects received pregabalin for  less than 5 weeks., in study 132 the median exposure time was less than 3 weeks, 75% of the subjects received pregabalin for  less than 7 weeks.
- f Patients randomised to the 300/600 mg/day pregabalin group received either 300 or 600 mg/day based on their CLcr.

Pregabalin appears to be efficacious in reducing pain in a polyneuropathy pain model (DPN) as well as in mononeuropathy pain model (PHN). A statistically significant difference in mean endpoint score between pregabalin and placebo is observed for the 300 mg and 600 mg doses. The mean differences in pain score between placebo and pregabalin ranged from -0.18 to -1.57 for the 300 mg daily dose and -0.64 to -2.02 points for the 600 mg daily dose. Results are less consistent with pregabalin 150 mg daily and 75 mg daily is not effective.

The  overall  picture  of  the  primary  efficacy  variable  is  confirmed  in  the  responder  analysis  (50% reduction in pain score as compared to baseline values), and the results are presented in the following table.

## Secondary efficacy variables

Overall,  the  results  with  respect  to  the  secondary  efficacy  variables  (including  SF  McGill  Pain questionnaire when analysed, sleep interference,  global  impression  of  change)  were  consistent  with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that  of  the  primary  one,  nevertheless,  their  results  are  only  considered  of  exploratory  value. For example, regarding the global impression of change, 12.5% to 39.2% of the patients rated much/very much improved in the placebo-arms, from 21.3% to 33.8% in the PGB 75 mg arm, from 22.2% to 45.8% in the PGN 150 mg arm, from 27.2% to 55.7% in the PGB 300 mg arm and from 36.5% to 69.2% in the PGB 300/600 mg arms.

Based upon the longitudinal analyses of the weakly mean pain scores the onset of treatment effect was observed by week 1. The magnitude of effect was maintained relative to placebo through to the end of studies.

Results with respect to quality of life/mood evaluations showed no consistent pattern except on the bodily pain dimension, which is not unexpected.

## Ancillary analyses

## -Impact of dizziness and somnolence

Dizziness  and  somnolence  may  have  an  impact  on  the  pain  perception.  Somnolence  is  an  adverse event of pregabalin with an high incidence rate ranging from 20%-30% in the neuropathy studies. In order  to  estimate  the  magnitude  of  this  effect  the  applicant  initially  performed,  for  some  studies, separate analysis of the primary endpoint for patients without dizziness and somnolence. As these data might suggest a reduction of the effect in the absence of somnolence was observed, further analyses were requested to assess the impact of somnolence as well as to assess the clinical relevance of the overall effect. See 'Discussion on clinical efficacy'.

## -Impact of rescue medication on the results

It  was  questioned whether and to what extent the use of concurrent medication could influence the results, taking into consideration the two types of co-medication allowed; i.e. chronic co-medication kept stable during the PHN studies and paracetamol allowed as needed during all studies.

Considering that paracetamol is not considered sufficiently effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain  and  that  its  use  as  rescue  medication  was  limited  and  homogeneous  (from  1%  to  7%  in  the placebo arms and from 1% to 7.9% in the PGB arms), it is a priori not expected to have had an impact on the observed effect size.

An analysis estimating the treatment effect after adjustment for stable concurrent medications in the PHN studies did not show any relevant difference.

## Supportive studies

Patients  in  pivotal  neuropathic  pain  studies  had  the  option  to  continue  treatment  in  open  label extension studies. The main objective of these studies was to assess the safety profile of long-term exposure  but  long-term  efficacy  was  also  examined.  Dose  adjustments  of  pregabalin  were  allowed within the range of 75 to 600 mg/day as well as alternative pain medications. Overall in the open-label extension studies, the most commonly selected pregabalin dose range was 300 to 449 mg/day. Due to their design and the number of drop-outs, these studies do not provide definitive evidence to establish the maintenance of the efficacy.

An ad hoc analysis of the open-label VAS scores from 4 extension studies was conducted on a cohort of  patients  who  had  at  least  1  year  exposure  to  pregabalin  in  the  open-label  phase.  The  cohort comprised 217 patients; 69 in the placebo, 59 in the 150 mg/day pregabalin, 23 in the 300 mg/day pregabalin and 66 in the 600 mg/day pregabalin-treatment group. The patient's pain scores were stable over  time  but  such  retrospective  cohort  analysis  are  not  that  informative  as  patients  who  benefit continue in the study.

## · Analysis performed across trials

A meta-analysis incorporating all 9 completed fixed-dose neuropathic pain trials (studies DPN-014, 029,  -040,  -131,  -149  and  PHN-030,  -045,  -127  and  -196)  was  performed.  The  amitriptyline  arm (study DPN-040) and the non-effective dose arms of 75 mg/day (studies DPN-029, PHN-030) were excluded. For Studies -127, -149, and -196, patients with a CLcr&gt;30 and ≤ 60 mL/min randomised to the  300/600  mg/day  group  received  300  mg/day  and  those  with  CLcr  &gt;60  mL/min  received  600 mg/day.

The analysis was adjusted for age, neuropathic pain model (PHN or DPN), baseline pain, study, dosing regimen (BID or TID) and treatment group (dose). The treatment effect is larger in PHN

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared to DPN. The difference, ranged between 0.28 and 0.47 depending on the dose group is considered substantial. Differences in effect size in BID and TID regimes is only substantial for the 300 mg dose, and the clinical relevance of the difference is questionable .

## Epilepsy

Three multicenter, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled parallel group add-on studies (009, 011,  and  034)  were  submitted  to  support  the  claim  of  adjunctive  treatment  in  partial  seizures with/without generalised seizures. Doses ranged from 50 to 600 mg daily given three (TID) or twice (BID) daily. Study duration was 11/12 weeks. In two studies (009, 011) patients were titrated up to their  fixed  dose,  in  one  study  (034),  no  titration  scheme  was  used.  Three  open  label,  uncontrolled, extension  studies  (010,  012,  035)  were  conducted.  The  main  features  of  the  pivotal  studies  are presented in the following table.

## Study Participants

Patients  with  medically  refractory  partial  seizures  (simple  partial,  complex  partial,  and  secondarily generalised), male and female, from the age of 12 (034) to 18 (009, 011) years on, and of any race, were eligible to participate. Patients were diagnosed as suffering from epilepsy with partial seizures following  standard  procedures,  and  were  considered  refractory  to  treatment  if  they  had  received  at least  1-3  standard  anti-epileptic  drugs  (AED's)  at  doses  within  an  acceptable  therapeutic  range, without sufficient effect. The following table summarises the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

## Inclusion criteria

- Currently receiving at least 1 and not more than 3 AED's that are within a clinically acceptable therapeutic range
- History of being refractory to more than one marketed AED at maximum-tolerated dosages
- Males, and nonpregnant, nonlactating females who were premenarchal, postmenopausal, surgically sterilized, or using a reliable method of contraception (barrier or hormonal) and had a negative pregnancy test prior to study entry
- Aged (12*) 18 years or older, weighing (&gt;40kg * ) between 50 to 135 kg
- Normal ECG including a 2-minute rhythm strip, Funduscopy and visual acuity assessment at screening without abnormal findings, Chest X-ray at screening without abnormal findings
- CT scan/MRI within 2 years prior to screening without abnormal findings

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Exclusion criteria

- Administration of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening
- Administration of any concomitant medication that could alter the effectiveness of the patient's medication response or seizure frequency
- Alcohol or drug abuse within the previous year
- Pregnancy or nursing
- Treatment with gabapentin, unless discontinued at least 1 week prior to entry into baseline
* Protocol difference in study 034

## Treatments

Apart from pregabalin and placebo (see table with main feature of the studies), patients remained on their  current  AED  therapy,  except  for  those  drugs  that  were  excluded  in  the  exclusion  criteria  or otherwise  (i.e.  vigabatrin,  gabapentin,  macrolide  antibiotics,  antihistamines,  phenothiazines  and antiarrhythmics).  The  concomitant  AED's  were  to  be  kept  stable  during  the  trial,  but  could  be decreased in case of danger of toxicity. Patients who suffered from mild depression could stay on their antidepressive medication during the trial.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary outcome parameter was the Response Ratio (RRatio) after 11 (12) weeks of fixed dose treatment. The RRatio is calculated by dividing the difference between the 28-day seizure rate during treatment (T) and baseline (B) by the sum of baseline (B) and treatment (T) rate and multiplying it by 100. A RRatio of -33 is equivalent to a 50% reduction in seizure rate.

## Several secondary endpoints were assessed, in particular:

1. Responder Rate, i.e. the percent of patients who had at least a 50% reduction in 28-day seizure frequency compared to baseline seizure frequency.
2. Percent change (PCH) of seizure frequency from baseline.
3. Analysis per seizure type.
4. Seizure-free analysis (number of seizure-free days)
5. Health outcome assessment (study 034 only)

The observed seizure rate during baseline and treatment was standardised for a 28-day period, based on the patient's daily diary data using the following procedure:

Number of partial seizures in period

28-day rate = -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- x 28

[number of days in period-number of missing diary days in period]

## Sample size

The sample size estimate of each study was based on the RRatio and the Responder Rate of previous experiences  with  add-on  studies  of  gabapentin.  Assuming  a  RRatio  of  -15  for  pregabalin,  -3  for placebo,  and  a  10%  dropout  rate  at  week  12,  a  total  of  80  patients  per  treatment  group  were  to  be randomised  to  provide  &gt;80%  power  ( α =0.05,  2-sided)  for  the  ITT  population.  Similarly,  with  an assumed 30% Response Rate for pregabalin and 10% for placebo, 80 patients were to be randomised, expecting a 10% dropout rate.

## Statistical methods

The primary efficacy outcome parameter (RRatio) was analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on ranks with treatment and centre as main effects. For the multiple testing (two dose regimens

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

against placebo and each other) that was performed, the Hochberg's procedure was followed, ranking the p-values for multiple comparisons from highest to lowest values.

The  secondary  outcome  parameter  (Responder  Rate)  was  summarised  by  treatment  group  and analysed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel chi-square test, adjusting for centre.

All other outcome parameters were presented as descriptives.

The baseline characteristics of the study population show an equal distribution of males and females over the different studies, the majority being Caucasian, and representative of the Western population. Further main characteristics are similar as well and representative of the target adult population with partial epilepsy. However, only 17 elderly (&gt;65 years) were included, and 10 adolescents between the age of 12-16 years. The median baseline 28-day seizure frequency was sufficiently high (range 9.312.0) to be able to demonstrate a treatment effect. The majority of patients used 2 concurrent AED's; the most frequently used drugs being carbamazepine and lamotrigine, or their combination.

## Outcomes and estimation

It is recommended in the CPMP guideline to define the proportion (pre-defined) responders as primary measure, since it reflects both seizure reduction and its clinical significance. The response ratio is not considered the best outcome parameter, since the distribution of the RRatio is often found to be nonnormal which may biase the estimate and it is difficult to establish the clinical relevance of the effect based  on  this  parameter.  Efficacy  will  primarily  be  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  the  responder  data (responders being defined as those subjects with &gt;50% reduction in seizures).

Results regarding RRatio and Responder analyses are provided in the following tables. No efficacy was demonstrated for the 50 mg/day PGB. Efficacy has been demonstrated in the dose range of 150600 mg/day of pregabalin for the primary outcome measure RRatio and is in general supported by the outcome  measures  Responder  Rate.  Overall,  approximately  35%  of  patients  can  be  regarded  as responders to the 600 mg/day pregabalin, taking the placebo response into account. This number is reduced to 25% for the 300 mg/day dose, and further reduced to &lt;20% for the 150 mg/day dose. The clinical relevance for the latter dose may be considered questionable. Although the data may suggest that the TID dosing schedule is favourable this is unlikely to be clinically relevant.

## Secondary outcome measures (PCH, seizure-free analysis, health outcome)

Efficacy on the secondary outcome percent change from baseline (PCH) was consistent with RRatio and Responder Rate. The analysis of seizure freedom is rather limited, and would be more relevant if evaluated  after  a  longer  period  of  time  (1  year).  No  data  were  available  with  respect  to  the  health questionnaires assessed in study 034.

## Clinical studies in special populations

No studies were performed in children and adolescents, or in elderly.

## Supportive studies

Six supportive studies (007, 008, 010, 012, 035, and 145) have been submitted, three of them (010, 012, and 035) being the open label extension studies of the pivotal efficacy studies.

The objectives of study 007 were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin at 600 mg/day as compared with gabapentin at 300 mg/day in hospitalized patients with complex partial (CP) seizures, with  or  without  secondary  generalization,  who  had  their  concomitant  antiepileptic  drugs  (AEDs) discontinued as part of an inpatient hospitalization for clinical seizure monitoring. This trial explores the paradigm of pre-surgical patients which involves patient very difficult to treat. The gabapentin arm in this trial is a pseudo-placebo arm because 300 mg/d of gabapentin is a sub-therapeutic dose. This trial does not add relevant information on the potential efficacy of pregabalin. Patients from this study continued in open label treatment (008).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study 145 is a double-blind controlled titration study that was prematurely ended due to the clinical hold imposed by the FDA. Only 3 patients enrolled in this study.

The open label extension studies of the pivotal efficacy studies aimed to evaluate long-term safety, tolerance  and  efficacy  of  pregabalin  administered  as  adjunctive  therapy  at  dosages  from  75  to  600 mg/day on a twice a day (BID) or 3 times a day (TID) dosing schedule in patients with refractory partial  seizures.  Subjects  were  the  ones  who  had  chosen  to  enter  open  label  treatment  after participating in the controlled studies. In addition, newly recruited patients were allowed to enter. For these  newly  recruited  patients,  the  inclusion  criteria  were  broadened  with  respect  to  the  minimum amount  of  seizures  required  in  the  preceding  8  weeks  (4,  instead  of  6).  No  primary  or  secondary outcome  parameters  were  pre-defined.  Outcomes  were  described  for  Responder  Rate,  PCH,  and seizure-freedom.  Assessments  were  taken  at  week  4,  8,  16,  24,  and  every  12  weeks  henceforth.  A responder  rate  of  37%  and  a  median  percent  reduction  from  baseline  of  38%  were  seen  for  the evaluable population during the initial 12-week period of open-label. For a cohort of patients followed for  2  years,  the  responder  rate  and  median  percent  change  at  subsequent  intervals  were  maintained over  time.  Nevertheless,  the  gradual  dropout  of  patients  over  time  because  of  lack  of  efficacy  or tolerance  to  the  study  drug  was  not  evaluated  against  the  background  of  the  positive  responder's cohort  of  the  two  years  follow-up.  Moreover,  information  on  dosing  and  dose  adjustments  during long-term  treatment  was  lacking  and  is  essential  for  a  reliable  judgement.  Similarly,  limited information was given on the occurrence of withdrawal or rebound phenomena after withdrawal of the study drug both in the short- and long-term trials.

- Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Peripheral Neuropathy

To support the neuropathic pain claim, twelve randomised placebo controlled studies were submitted. Six  studies  concerned  the  diabetic  neuropathy  model  and  five  studies  the  postherpetic  neuralgia model. One study concerned both models. Doses ranged from 75 to 600 mg daily given twice or three times daily. Study duration ranged from 5 to 13 weeks.

Pregabalin appears to be efficacious in reducing pain in those polyneuropathy and mononeuropathy pain  models.  A  statistically  significant  difference  in  mean  endpoint  score  between  pregabalin  and placebo was observed for the 300 mg and 600 mg doses, with mean differences in pain score ranged from -0.18 to -1.57 and -0.64 to -2.02 points for 300 mg and 600 mg respectively. Results are less consistent with pregabalin 150 mg daily and 75 mg daily is not effective. The overall picture of the primary efficacy variable was confirmed in responder analysis.

Nevertheless, the following issues were discussed regarding clinical efficacy:

- -clinical  relevance  of  the  effect,  taking  into  account  the  neuropathic  pain  model,  the  dose  and regimen (BID and TID), the influence of somnolence;
- -the posology to be recommended;
- -the maintenance of the effect.

In addressing the clinical relevance, no distinction was initially made between indication (DPN versus PHN), and dose regime used (BID or TID).  For an indication in peripheral neuropathic pain, efficacy should  be  demonstrated  in  two  peripheral  neuropathic  pain  models,  clinical  relevance  should  be established for each pain model separately. A meta-analysis indicated the treatment effect is larger in PHN compared to DPN. The pain scores differ between the BID and TID regimes, but the clinical relevance of this difference is questionable.

Dizziness  and  somnolence  may  have  an  impact  on  the  pain  perception.  Somnolence  is  an  adverse event of pregabalin with an incidence rate ranging from 20%-30% in the neuropathy studies. In order to  estimate the magnitude of this effect the applicant initially performed, for some studies, separate analysis of the primary endpoint for patients without dizziness and somnolence. As these data might suggest  a  reduction  of  the  effect  in  the  absence  of  somnolence,  further  analyses  were  requested  to assess the impact of somnolence as well as to assess the clinical relevance of the overall effect. The applicant evaluated the pain scores and treatment differences for patients with and without somnolence separately. The difference in pain score for patients with/without somnolence were minimal but this was  not  the  case  for  the  responders  analysis. The  analysis  originally  presented  was  not  split  by indication (while the age per indication differs considerably and patients of elder age might be more sensitive to somnolence) or dose regime, but was provided later.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed  effect  was  therefore  originally  not  considered  sufficiently addressed for PHN and DPN separately and therefore, separate analysis of responder rates taking into account the dose regime (TID versus BID) and the absence/presence of somnolence were requested.

The applicant argued that the observed effect on neuropathic pain is clinically relevant by relating the observed  response  on  the  pain  scale  and  PGIC  (Patient's  global  impression  of  change),  for  both diabetic  neuropathy  and  postherpetic  neuropathy.  The  proportion  of  patients  achieving  a  clinical relevant response (defined as very much or much improved on the PGIC) is given in the next table based on 9 studies):

## PGIC category *

| Minimally improved No change Minimally worse | 25.9% 19.4% 4.5% | 49.8%            | 24.9% 33.7% 6.8% | 65.4%         | 25.6% 30.0% 7.0% | 62.6%            | 19.1% 45.2% 10.3% | 74.5%         |
| Much worse Very much worse                   | 2.2% 0.2%        | 2.4%             | 4.6% 0.5%        | 5.1%          | 3.5% 1.7%        | 5.2%             | 6.5% 2.1%         | 8.5%          |

In  addition,  a  clinically  meaningful  effect  on  responder  rates  is  evident  in  patients  who  do  not experience somnolence as well in patients who report somnolence across the neuropathic pain studies, however,  point  estimate  of  responder  rates  are  lower  in  the  absence  of  somnolence.  This  effect  is consistent over the dose range.  In controlled clinical trials 35% of the pregabalin treated patients and 18% of the patients on placebo had a 50% improvement in pain score.  For patients not experiencing somnolence such an improvement was observed in 33% of patients treated with pregabalin and 18% of patients  on  placebo.    For  patients  who  experienced  somnolence  the  responder  rates  were  48%  on pregabalin  and  16%  on  placebo.  In  conclusion,  the  observed  effect  on  the  pain  score  is  considered clinically  relevant  for  both  diabetic  neuropathy  as  well  as  post-herpetic  neuropathy  even  if  the observed effect is larger in presence of somnolence.

Efficacy of 150mg/day in neuropathic pain was not consistent, nevertheless as it could be of benefit in some patients and represents a well-tolerated starting dose, it was accepted as starting dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Comparable  bioavailability  of  the  BID/TID  regime  has  been  shown;  the  treatment  regimens  were bioequivalent with respect to the AUC and Cmax, however, Cmin was somewhat lower in the BID regime. In general, the overall safety profile is in favour of the BID regime but the efficacy profile is in favour of the TID regime. Nevertheless, the confidence interval for the difference between regimens was  [-0.2;  0.6],  based  on  a  meta-analysis  with  the  nine  completed  neuropathic  pain  studies,  and responder rates for BID and TID were similar across the dose range, as shown in the table below. The applicant  also  provided  data  showing  that  BID  and  TID  safety  profiles  do  not  differ  shortly  after initiation (one week) of treatment, even in elderly patients. Therefore, it was agreed that both BID and TID regimens  would  be  acceptable  which  would  allow  the  physician  to  adapt  the  treatment  to  the individual patient's need.

| Pregabalin 150mg/day | 242          | 54 (22.3%)           | 183          | 56 (30.6%)           |
| Pregabalin 300mg/day | 262          | 101 (38.5%)          | 233          | 69 (29.6%)           |
| Pregabalin 600mg/day | 306          | 137 (44.8%)          | 147          | 67 (45.6%)           |

Initial  studies  were  considered  too  short  to  establish  maintenance  of  effect.  Studies  submitted  later (studies 196 and 155) were of at least 12 weeks duration which substantiated the maintenance of the effect. In Study 196 in patients with PHN, the observed effect size was of the same order of magnitude as  earlier  studies  and  the  effect  did  not  diminish  over  the  12  week  fixed  dose  phase.  Study  149  in diabetic patients was also of 12 weeks duration. The results of the new study 155 were less convincing due to a more complicated study design. Therefore the maintenance of effect over a time period of up to  12  weeks  is  considered  established.  Long-term  efficacy  (i.e.  &gt;  12  weeks)  is  difficult  to  assess because only open label studies are available. In a cohort of 517 patients treated for at least 420 days, mean pregabalin dose was maintained over time and pooled VAS scores were stable. Although the value  of  the  cohort  study  is  limited  for  addressing  the  long  term  efficacy,  these  data  argue  for  the maintenance of an effect and do not suggest that tolerance could be a major issue.

## Epilepsy

To  support  the  claim  of  adjunctive  treatment  in  partial  seizures  with/without  generalised  seizures, three randomised placebo controlled add-on studies were submitted. The dose ranged from 50 to 600 mg daily in similar dosing schedules as for the neuropathic pain. Study duration was 11/12 weeks.

Efficacy  has  been  demonstrated  in  the  dose  range  of  150-600  mg/day  in  a  dose  dependent  way; approximately 35% of responders to the 600 mg/day pregabalin, 25% for the 300 mg/day dose, and &lt;20% for the 150 mg/day dose, after adjusting for placebo. Although the effect of the 150 mg/day dose was inconsistent , 150 mg/day is an acceptable starting dose. Additional outcome measures, such as percent change from baseline (PCH) and the number of patients experiencing a substantial amount of seizure-free days were supportive to some extent, but less favourable.

Although efficacy in short-term trials has been demonstrated, long-term maintenance of efficacy is not established. Long-term efficacy data, based on the open-label studies, is of limited value because the population  studied  was  a  mixed  one  (responders,  (partial)  responders  and  patients  converting  from placebo to pregabalin). 33% of patients dropped out of the open-label extension studies due to lack of efficacy. Of the patients who discontinued due to lack of efficacy, 39% of them displayed an increase in seizure frequency compared to baseline. Whether or not tolerance to the study drug was developed, was investigated through data from a two years cohort. In this cohort, of good responders, minimal dose adjustments were needed to maintain efficacy, which would support the fact that tolerance to the product is not a major concern.

With respect to the TID and BID dosing, one head to head epilepsy study (009) was performed and showed  a  slightly  better  response  with  TID  as  compared  to  BID.  Nevertheless,  study  009  was  not prospectively powered to detect a difference between the BID and TID regimens, and the observed difference  in  responder  rate  (5.9%)  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.430).  The  Applicant  also performed a pooled analysis of the epilepsy studies showing that the 95% confidence interval on the treatment difference in responder rate between 600mg/day BID and TID was -9.8 to 9.9, and 5.3 to 29.2 for 150mg/day (300 mg/day was only studied in BID regimen). Regarding the safety profile, TID dosing  seemed  more  favourable  in  the  epilepsy  population,  especially  with  regard  to  dizziness  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

somnolence, but this was in contrast to what was found for the incidence of these adverse events in the overall safety profile of pregabalin and the safety profiles of BID and TID were similar in study 009. In addition, the applicant provided data showing that BID and TID safety profiles do not differ shortly after  initiation  (one  week)  of  treatment.  Therefore,  it  was  agreed  that  both  BID  and  TID  regimens would be acceptable, which would allow the physician to adapt the treatment to individual patient's need.

## Clinical safety

Safety  of  pregabalin  was  assessed  on  all  subjects  who  participated  in  any  study,  controlled  and uncontrolled, with pregabalin until the time of cut-off that was determined for the integrated safety database. This does not include data from studies 155 and 196 which were submitted later.

a Patients who received ≥ 1 treatment may be included in ≥ 1 column but are counted once in the 'total' column.

As of the day of database lock, 5232 patients were randomised to pregabalin in the controlled studies, 59.2%  being  exposed  for  &gt;  6  weeks,  and  15.2%  being  exposed  for  &gt;  12  weeks.  In  the  combined controlled  and  uncontrolled  studies,  8228  patients  were  randomised  to  pregabalin,  55.8%  being exposed &gt; 12 weeks, and 26.3% being expose for &gt; 1 year. Forty seven patients (0.6%) reached the maximum exposure time, i.e. ≥ 3  years.  In  the  open  extension  studies  with  flexible  dosing  regimes, approximately one-third of the patients were exposed to a dose range of 300-450 mg/day pregabalin, comprising  the  average  recommended  dose.  Another  one-third  of  patients  were  exposed  to  the maximum  dose  of  600  mg/day  pregabalin.  Approximately  8%  of  patients  in  the  controlled  and uncontrolled studies were exposed to 600mg/day for ≥ 1 year.

## · Adverse events

Overall 65% of placebo-treated patients and 79.6% of pregabalin treated patients experienced adverse events during the controlled trials.

A summary of adverse events in &gt;2% of all pregabalin-treated patients by decreasing frequency (all controlled studies, combined regimens) is provided in the table below.

* Statistically significantly different from placebo based on odds ratio or Fisher's Exact test (p&lt;0.05)

a Includes other doses of pregabalin (e.g., 50 or 75 mg/day). Dose is total daily dose in mg/day given BID or TID.

b Amblyopia was reported by the investigators mainly as blurred/blurry vision.

The  most  common  adverse  reactions  were  dizziness  (29.1%)  and  somnolence  (22.6%)  in  the pregabalin-treated  patients.  Other  adverse  events  that  were  more  frequently  reported  in  pregabalintreated patients than placebo-treated patients were dry mouth (9.1%), asthenia, amblyopia, peripheral oedema,  thinking  abnormal,  and  weight  gain.  The  incidences  of  dry  mouth,  asthenia,  amblyopia, peripheral oedema, and thinking abnormal were generally higher at doses greater than 150 mg/day but with no consistent pattern of dose response.

Apart  from  dizziness  and  somnolence,  the  majority  of  the  other  adverse  reactions  are  also  CNS related,  and  appear  dose  related,  and  of  mild  to  moderate  severity.  The  overall  incidence  of  CNS adverse events was higher in the patients with epilepsy than in patients with neuropathic pain. In this regard,  the  use  of  concurrent  CNS  active  drugs  in  the  patients  with  epilepsy  should  be  noted.  The median time to onset of the CNS adverse events was short 1-2 days. Dizziness and somnolence did not resolve by the last day on study medication in 31% and 45% respectively, of subjects, experiencing these adverse events.

Accidental injury was mainly reported for the highest dose pregabalin.

Amblyopia, mainly referred to as 'blurred vision', was the main visual disturbance found.

Peripheral oedema (PE) was found mainly in the elderly from the neuropathic pain studies being seen in  approximately  11%  of  patients  after  1  -  3  months  of  treatment  and  persisted  in  54%  of  these specific patients.

Weight gain was in general a dose-dependent finding across studies, which was first observed as an adverse event with a median time to onset of 2 weeks. Based on the incidences in both the controlled and uncontrolled studies, weight gain is persistent over time.

See Discussion on clinical safety regarding somnolence/dizziness, peripheral oedema, weight gain and visual field abnormalities.

A summary of BID and TID regimen adverse event profiles (all controlled studies including the later submitted study 196 but not study 155 which included a flexible dose arm) is provided in the table below. The overall safety profile of BID and TID dosing is in favour of the BID, particularly for the most common adverse events dizziness and somnolence.

The overall incidence of serious adverse events in the controlled studies was 2.3% in the pregabalin treated  patients,  versus  2.1%  in  the  placebo  treated  patients.  The  most  common  treatment-related serious adverse events in the initial combined controlled and uncontrolled population were accidental injury (8 patients), visual field defect (6 patients), confusion (4 patients), ventricular extrasystoles (4 patients), congestive heart failure (3 patients), ataxia (3 patients), dizziness (3 patients), amblyopia (2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients), diplopia (2 patients), myopathy  (2  patients),  somnolence  (2  patients),  and  syncope (2 patients).  The  incidence  increased  when  combining  the  controlled  and  uncontrolled  studies, indicating an increase of incidence over time.

## Death

As of the data cut-off for the integrated clinical safety database, 49 patients in the Phase 2/3 clinical program had died. This total includes:

- -1 patient who received placebo in the Phase 2/3 controlled studies;
- -6 patients who received at least one dose of pregabalin in the Phase 2/3 controlled studies; and
- -42  patients  who  died  during  or  following  pregabalin  treatment  in  the  open-label  extension studies.

The highest proportion of deaths was in the elderly PHN population (17 deaths, 2.2%; 34.8 deaths per 1000 patient years) and the lowest was in the GAD population (1 death, 0.05%; 2.0 deaths per 1000 patient years). The difference in death rates across indications may be explained at least in part by the relative ages and co-morbid conditions of the different populations.

None  of  the  deaths  in  pregabalin-treated  patients  was  considered  related  to  treatment.  The  most frequent  causes  of  death  among  patients  treated  with  pregabalin  were  cardiovascular  events  and carcinomas. There were three sudden death, 2 in patients with diabetic neuropathy and 1 in a patient with epilepsy.

## Special safety issue

Abuse  potential: The  abuse  potential  of  pregabalin  was  studied  in  a  separate  study  (098)  versus diazepam  and  placebo.  Pregabalin  did  not  have  the  profile  of  a  prototypic  drug  of  abuse  when compared with diazepam.

Withdrawal  and  rebound  phenomena: No proper  studies  were  performed  to  assess  withdrawal  and rebound phenomena in particular in patients with epilepsy. As a consequence, the summary of product characteristics  states  that in  accordance  with  current  clinical  practice, if  pregabalin  has  to  be discontinued either in neuropathic pain or epilepsy, it is recommended this should be done gradually over a minimum of 1 week.

Ophthalmic assessment: Clinically,  visual  field  defects  during  treatment  with  pregabalin  have  been prospectively  investigated  by  closely  monitoring  patients  at  regular  intervals  during  the  short-  and long-term studies. At the time of the original submission, 6 cases (being unexplained) of visual field defects  were  found  with  pregabalin  and  clarifications  were  requested.  To  address  this  issue,  the applicant  provided  pharmacological  data  from  the  literature  to  demonstrate  that  pregabalin  and vigabatrin are different in their mechanism of action. In addition the safety database was extended and the applicant reviewed their current data extensively: ten cases (0.3%) were unexplained at that time. Data  were  collected  for  up  to  2.5  years  of  treatment  with  pregabalin.    Review  of  the  new  data supported the applicant's conclusion from the first submission of the dossier that the prevalence of visual field defects is low, and appears to be related to underlying pathology of the patients rather than to treatment with pregabalin. However, the 10 unexpected cases still require caution. From vigabatrin it is known that visual field defects are cumulative upon exposure. See discussion on clinical safety.

Cardiotoxicity: ECG assessments were made in all  studies  with  PGB  at  several  times  (3-4)  during treatment. In general no significant abnormalities were reported. No QTc prolongation was reported. A slight increase of premature ventricular contractions was found in the elderly patients with diabetes.

Reproductive  function: In  preclinical  investigations,  sperm  abnormalities  were  reported,  especially with  respect  to  morphology,  at  exposure  levels  10  times  those  used  in  humans.  One  clinical  study (072)  was  performed  to  assess  reproductive  function  in  healthy  male  subjects.  46  subjects  (16  on placebo and 32 on PGB 600 mg/day) were treated for 14 weeks (2 weeks titration included). Subjects were  between  the  age  of  18  and  55  years.  Reproductive  function  was  assessed  on  sperm  count, motility (reduction of more than 5-10% of baseline), and morphology. Five subjects (3 PGB/2PBO) were  reported  with  &gt;  15%  reduction  from  baseline  in  motility.  It  was  concluded  that  short-term treatment  with  pregabalin  does  not  induce  major  reproductive  abnormalities.  No  long-term  studies have been performed, nor studies related to age.

## · Laboratory findings

Classical laboratory parameters were measured during controlled trials. Findings of potential clinical importance to be discussed were related to creatine kinase, white blood cells and platelet. In addition, glycaemia is discussed in relation to body weight gain.

Creatine  Kinase: Although  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in  creatine  kinase  among  pregabalin treated patients was significantly different from placebo for each treatment group, there was no dose response  relationship.  In  the  combined  controlled  and  uncontrolled  studies,  the  mean  increase  in creatine  kinase (13.425 U/L) was similar in magnitude to that observed in the controlled studies. A potentially  clinically  important  increase  in  creatine  kinase  occurred  in  1.7%  of  patients.  Serious adverse events of creatine phosphokinase were reported in 3 pregabalin-treated patients with epilepsy. Myopathy/rhabdomyolysis was reported in 2 patients. Overall, pregabalin appears to elevate creatine kinase  levels  in  some  patients.  Review  of  individual  patient  cases  does  not  suggest  a  clinically important risk of renal dysfunction associated with the elevations in creatine kinase.

White  blood  cell :  Differences  in  WBC  mean  change  from  baseline  was  statistically  significant  in pregabalin group than in placebo group (controlled studies) with a decrease of 0.22 × 10 3 / µ L versus a decrease  of  0.11 × 10 3 / µ L.  There  is  no  pattern  of  consistent  decrease  but  the  incidence  of  infection deemed to increase  with  the  time  of  exposure  to  pregabalin.  Hence,  it  was  questioned  whether  the immune system may become compromised over time. Since the increase of infections during longterm  pregabalin  exposure  is  difficult  to  judge  for  the  lack  of  a  placebo  arm,  the  incidence  of  new infections was calculated as of the time of open-label treatment. It appeared that the incidence of new infections was not larger during long-term treatment than the incidence during short-term treatment. Neither  elderly,  nor  diabetic  patients  were  more  at  risk.  Therefore,  the  decrease  in  WBC  does  not appear clinically significant.

Platelets: Short-term  pregabalin  treatment  decreases  platelet  numbers,  but  platelet  function  (as measured by platelet aggregation and Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA) closure time) remains intact. No bleeding abnormalities were associated with the platelet decrease. Long-term pregabalin treatment showed an initial decrease in platelet count over time until 12-15 months, whereas beyond that time, a gradual  increase  was  seen.  Hence,  long-term  pregabalin  exposure  leads  to  a  slight  elevation  in platelets. In the light of the pre-clinical finding of haemangiosarcoma in mice where platelet activation is  seen,  patients  with  increased  platelet  counts  were  reviewed  separately.  From  these  data  it  was concluded that no persistent platelet elevations were present. See discussion on clinical safety.

Body weight and glycaemia in patients with DPN: Among patients who had baseline and termination weight measurements in the controlled studies, the mean change in weight was 1.6 kg for pregabalintreated patients and 0.3 kg for placebo-treated patients. Therefore, it was questioned whether weight gain  during  treatment  with  pregabalin  would  compromise  the  diabetic  patient.  New  data  were provided with respect to weight gain and changes in HbA1C, changes in the use of diabetic medication over time, and the incidence of metabolic and/or cardiac events. Short-term treatment with pregabalin did not show any changes in HbA1C, changes in the use of diabetic medication different from placebo or  changes  in  the  incidence  rate  of  metabolic  or  cardiac  events.  Similarly,  long-term  pregabalin treatment was not associated with loss of glycaemic control in a two-year cohort of diabetic patients who  gained  weight.  However,  long-term  data  with  respect  to  the  possible  adjustment  to  diabetic medication  were  not  provided.  Although  the  incidence  of  metabolic  and/or  cardiac  events  in  the combined controlled and uncontrolled studies was higher in DPN patients who gained weight, these patients  also  had  longer  mean  pregabalin  exposure  (approximately  500  days).  See  discussion  on clinical safety.

## · Safety in special populations

The safety profile in elderly is not much different from the general profile of pregabalin, except for the occurrence  of  peripheral  oedema  (around  11%).  Peripheral  oedema  was,  irrespective  of  age,  not associated  with  hypertension.  In  the  elderly,  the  incidence  of  accidental  injury  was  associated  with dizziness.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

The main reason for discontinuation of pregabalin was the occurrence of dizziness and/or somnolence especially in the higher dose range.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Discussion on clinical safety

The  overall  safety  profile  of  pregabalin  is  what  can  be  expected  from  the  mode  of  action  of  the compound.  Dizziness  and/or  somnolence  are  the  main  adverse  events  (about  30%  and  23% respectively).  These  events  did  not  resolve  by  the  end  of  double  blind  treatment  in  31%  and  45% respectively,  of  subjects,  experiencing  these  adverse  events..  Additionally,  the  following  adverse events were discussed: peripheral oedema, weight gain, decrease in platelets, visual field defects and, based on pre-clinical toxicological finding, haemangiosarcoma (in mice).

## Dizziness/somnolence

The impact of dizziness and/or somnolence in elderly and in particular in regard of the high incidence of  accidental  injury  was  questioned.  After  review  of  the  data  both  during  short-  and  long-term treatment, it  appeared that the incidence of dizziness is not increased in the elderly. However, they appear more susceptible to the persistence of dizziness. They are also more at risk for the occurrence of accidental injury associated with dizziness. As a consequence, a warning has been recommended to state in the summary of product characteristics that pregabalin has been associated with dizziness and somnolence which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury in the elderly population. The wording in the SPC being - Pregabalin treatment has been associated with dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury (fall) in the elderly population.  Therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medication.

## Peripheral oedema and weight gain

Peripheral oedema and weight gain are notable findings. They are unexplained. Both raised concerns: peripheral oedema, which is predominantly found in the elderly for its possible relation with cardiac events, weight gain for patients with diabetes.

After re-review of the data, both during short- and long-term treatment, peripheral oedema is regarded a  separate  finding  of  pregabalin,  and  not  primary  or  secondary  to  alterations  in  cardiovascular function.  No  consistent  temporal  relationship  of  hypertension  and  peripheral  oedema  was  observed and  a  clinically  meaningful  or  sustained  increases  in  measured  blood  pressure  in  patients  with peripheral oedema were not observed.

Weight gain in the diabetic population was not different from the weight gain in the overall population treated with pregabalin. During short-term treatment, weight gain is not associated with an increase in HbA1C, which is the severity marker for diabetes. In a two-year cohort, long-term pregabalin treatment was  not associated with loss of glycaemic  control in diabetic patients  who  gained  weight. Nevertheless,  changes  in  anti-diabetic  medication  were  difficult  to  assess  in  this  cohort.  As  a consequence,  the  applicant's  proposal  to  state  in  the  summary  of  product  characteristics  that  some diabetic  patients  who  gain  weight  on  pregabalin  treatment  may  need  to  adjust  hypoglycaemic medications, has been accepted.

## Platelets and pre-clinical toxicology: haemangiosarcoma in mice

During  long-term  exposure  to  pregabalin  (data  up  to  2-3  years),  a  change  in  platelet  numbers  is observed.  After  an  initial  decrease,  a  gradual  increase  in  platelet  counts  is  observed  beyond  the exposure time of one year. In view of the pre-clinical toxicological finding of haemangiosarcoma in mice, patients with increased platelet levels were reviewed separately. No persistency in the elevation of platelet count was reported.

The  development  of  haemangiosarcoma  in  the  animal  studies  (mice)  is  thought  to  be  mediated  by platelet activation. The triggers behind the platelet activation have not been fully elucidated. It appears that the mechanism hypothesized is not present in the rat. The threshold of platelet activation leading to haemangiosarcoma transformation is a function of dose.  To address the issue of the human risk of tumour formation in relation to the pre-clinical findings of haemangiosarcoma, the applicant provided data on the threshold of platelet activation needed for tumour formation in mice and long-term human data of platelet morphology. Platelet activation in mice was seen at 5 times the human exposure after 1 month  of  dosing:  with  no  consistent  effects  on  platelet  activation  were  observed  at  the  maximum human exposure. Having platelet data in man for up to 4 years of pregabalin exposure, the applicant concluded  that,  if  present,  any  abnormality  would  have  been  found  in  man.  The  data  are  however limited. Although the animal data do not raise such a concern as to preclude an approval and there is no evidence to suggest an associated risk to humans, it cannot be fully concluded that the mechanism of haemangiosarcoma formation does not pose any risk in man.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Long-term exposure data in man are limited to a small number of subjects. Therefore it was agreed that  the  applicant  will  provide  additional  long-term  clinical  data  concerning  assessment  of  platelet morphology, a surrogate marker of platelet activation, in humans receiving pregabalin.

## Visual field abnormalities

Visual field defect was a late finding during the use of vigabatrin and prompted the need for careful evaluations to screen possible effects on visual fields and visual acuity. In the clinical safety database (visual field testing in over 3500 patients of whom nearly 700 patients with exposures of at least 2 years),  there  were  10  unexplained  cases  of  visual  field  defect  (0.3%).  The  exposure  time  varied between 42 and 939 days (median: 186 days) of treatment with pregabalin. In the majority of cases, a unilateral nasal visual field defect was observed. The MAH retested 4 out of the 10 unexplained cases; 2 subjects had changes consistent with an artefact (false positive), one subject was normal and in the other case a pre-existing corneal defect explained the defect. The very low incidence of unexplained visual field defects, the lack of a specific pattern of defect, their variability after retesting and the size of the 'visual fields database' make it unlikely that pregabalin is a causal factor for visual field defects. As precautionary measure, visual system adverse events will be carefully assessed in periodic safety reports under a separate heading.

## Safety in adolescents

Neither efficacy nor safety was demonstrated in adolescents. The number of patients (n=10) was too small and consequently the Applicant's claim in adolescents has been withdrawn. A neurotoxicological  study  in  juvenile  rats  (see  non-clinical  section)  stressed  the  need  for  special attention  to  the  effects  of  pregabalin  on  growth  and  (cognitive)  development  in  children  and adolescents.  Additional  non-clinical  studies  have  been  requested  to  investigate  reversibility  of reproductive and neurobehavioral/cognitive effects. Upon  request, the applicant proposed the following paediatric development plan: Pharmacokinetic evaluation in lead-in phases to the efficacy and safety studies, Efficacy and safety studies in children and adolescents (4-18 year-olds, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled add-on study of 12 week duration with a cognitive test battery as secondary endpoint), Efficacy and safety study in infants, toddlers and young children (&gt;1 month  to  &lt;4  year-olds,  3-4  weeks  study  with  seizure  count  based  on  EEG  and/or  video-EEG monitoring)  and  Open-label  long-term  extension  of  efficacy  and  safety  studies.  Efficacy  and  safety studies  will  be  run  in  a  sequential  approach,  with  the  efficacy  and  safety  established  in  the  older paediatric age group prior to proceeding with the clinical study in the younger age group. Monitoring of  growth,  sexual  development,  cognitive  and  behavioural  assessments  were  planed  but  it  was questioned whether the number of patients and the duration of studies were sufficient. In conclusion, the proposed clinical development plan in children was acceptable. However, the study protocols and time frame in which these studies are implemented should be part of the post marketing commitment. The  applicant  agreed  to  undertake  a  long-term  observational  study  in  paediatric  patients  and committed to submit a protocol for such study to CPMP.

## Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a  satisfactory way. At the time of the CPMP opinion there were some outstanding minor quality issues which had no impact on the  benefit/risk  profile.  The  applicant  committed  to  provide  the  necessary  information  as  follow-up measures within an agreed timeframe, and to submit variations if required following the evaluation of this additional information.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

Pregabalin  is  an  analogue  of  the  mammalian  neurotransmitter  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA). Although  its  precise  mechanism  of  action  is  still  unclear,  pregabalin,  decreases  central  neuronal excitability  by  binding  to  an  auxiliary subunit  ( α 2 -δ protein)  of  a  voltage-gated  calcium  channel  on neurons in the central nervous system.

In  conventional  safety  pharmacology  studies  in  animals,  pregabalin  was  well  tolerated  at  clinically relevant  doses.  In  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  monkeys  CNS  effects  were  observed, including  hypoactivity,  hyperactivity  and  ataxia.  Pregabalin  was  not  teratogenic  in  mice,  rats  or rabbits. Foetal toxicity in rats and rabbits occurred at exposures sufficiently above human exposure. In prenatal/postnatal  toxicity  studies,  pregabalin  induced  offspring  developmental  toxicity  in  rats  at exposures &gt;2 times the maximum recommended human exposure. Therefore, pregabalin should not be used  during  pregnancy  unless  the  benefit  to  the  mother  clearly  outweighs  the  potential  risk  to  the foetus. Pregabalin was not genotoxic based on results of a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests.

Pregabalin  induces  haemangiosarcoma  in  mice.  This  apparently  has  an  epigenetic  origin.  The mechanism resulting in haemangiosarcoma formation has been investigated up to an acceptable extent. The  development  of  haemangiosarcoma  in  the  animal  studies  (mice)  is  thought  to  be  mediated  by platelet activation. The triggers behind the platelet activation have not been fully elucidated. It appears that the mechanism hypothesized is not present in the rat. The threshold of platelet activation leading to haemangiosarcoma transformation is a function of dose. These platelet changes were not present in rats or in humans based on short term and limited long term clinical data.  There is no evidence to suggest an associated risk to humans.

Long-term exposure data in man are limited to a small number of subjects. Therefore it was agreed that the applicant would provide additional long-term clinical data concerning assessment of platelet morphology,  a  surrogate  marker  of  platelet  activation,  in  humans  receiving  pregabalin.  as  a  postapproval commitment.

Animal juvenile toxicity studies indicated an effect on CNS, growth and female reproductive function at clinically relevant exposures. Reversibility of effects has not been studied. Upon CPMP's request in view of further paediatric development, the applicant agreed to conduct an additional study in juvenile rats  to  assess  reversibility  of  alterations  in  acoustic  startle  response  and  impaired  performance  in learning and memory as a post-approval commitment.

## Efficacy

The  pharmacokinetics  of  pregabalin  are  uncomplicated.  Since  pregabalin  is  not  metabolised  and exclusively excreted in urine, patients with renal impairment require dose adjustments.

To support the neuropathic pain claim, twelve randomised placebo controlled studies were submitted. Six studies investigating the diabetic neuropathy model and five studies investigated the postherpetic neuralgia model. One study investigated both models. Doses ranged from 75 to 600 mg daily given twice or three times daily. Study duration ranged from 5 to 13 weeks.

To  support  the  claim  of  adjunctive  treatment  in  partial  seizures  with/without  generalised  seizures, three randomised placebo controlled add-on studies were submitted. The dose ranged from 50 to 600 mg daily in similar dosing schedules as for the neuropathic pain. Study duration was 12 weeks.

Efficacy  of  pregabalin  in  neuropathic  pain  has  been  demonstrated  in  two  models  of  peripheral neuropathic pain (diabetic polyneuropathy and postherpetic neuropathy), which supports an indication in the 'treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain'. Clinical relevance of the observed effect has been substantiated  in  terms  of  responder  and  by  relating  the  change  in  pain  score  to  the  patient  global impression of change, in both pain models. Responder rates were higher in patients with somnolence as compared to patients without somnolence.. However, a clinically meaningful effect on responder rates  is  evident  in  patients  who  do  not  experience  somnolence  as  well  in  patients  who  report somnolence across the neuropathic pain studies It was recommended to provide this information in the SPC in section 5.1. No definite conclusions on long-term efficacy in neuropathy can be drawn based upon  the  open  label  (extension)  studies.  However,  the  cohort  study  presented  supports    the maintenance of the effect and development of tolerance is less likely as the mean daily dose remained stable over time. Efficacy of TID seemed better than BID but the clinical relevance of this difference is questionable and the overall safety profile of pregabalin is in favour of the BID regimen. Therefore it  was  agreed to accept both BID and TID to give the physician the choice of the best regimen for individual patients.

Pregabalin is acceptable as add-on treatment in epilepsy in adults. The original claim in adolescents has been dropped. Long-term data are not sufficient to establish maintenance of effect but this does not  raise  a  concern  for  the  potential  risk  of  tolerance.  One  head  to  head  epilepsy  study  (-009)  was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

performed  and  showed  a  slightly  better  response  with  TID  as  compared  to  BID  dosing,  but  the observed difference in responder rate (5.9%) was not  considered clinically relevant. Therefore, as for neuropathic pain, it was agreed to accept both the BID and TID regimens to allow the physician the choice of the best regimen for individual patients.

The applicant outlined a clinical developmental plan for the use of pregabalin in children/adolescents taking  into  account  the  observations  of  the  animal  juvenile  toxicity  studies.  Further  animal  studies have been requested before starting paediatric clinical development. The paediatric development was deemed  acceptable,  however,  timeframe  and  clinical  protocols  should  be  submitted  as  a  post marketing commitment.

## Safety

The  overall  safety  profile  of  pregabalin  is  what  can  be  expected  from  the  mode  of  action  of  the compound. Dizziness and somnolence are the main adverse events (about 30% and 23% respectively). These  events  appear  persistent  in  31%  and  45%  respectively,  of  subjects,  experiencing  them. Additionally, peripheral oedema and weight gain are notable findings.

Pregabalin  induces  hemangiosarcoma  in  mice.  This  apparently  has  an  epigenetic  mechanism.  The mechanism resulting  in  the  hemangiosarcoma  formation  has  been  investigated  up  to  an  acceptable extent. The development of hemangiosarcoma in the animal studies (mice) is thought to be mediated by  platelet  activation.  The  trigger  behind  the  platelet  activation  have  not  been  fully  elucidated.  It appears  that  the  mechanism  hypothesized  is  not  present  in  rat.  The  threshold  of  platelet  activation leading  to  haemangiosarcoma  transformation  is  a  function  of  dose.  Even  if  the  risk  does  not  seem major, it cannot be fully concluded whether the mechanism of hemangiosarcoma formation does not pose  any  risk  in  man.  Long-term  exposure  data  in  man  are  limited  to  a  small  number  of  subjects. Whether platelet activation occurs in subjects with a long time use of pregabalin should be evaluated as part of a post marketing commitment.

Long-term pregabalin treatment was not associated with loss of glycaemic control in diabetic patients gaining weight, although it cannot be excluded that a lack of glycaemic control has been compensated for  by  adaptations  to  the  anti-diabetic  medication  in  the  open  label  extension  studies.  The  SPC wording  proposed  by  the  applicant: 'In  accordance  with  current  clinical  practice,  some  diabetic patients who gain weight on pregabalin treatment may need to adjust hypoglycaemic medications.' resolves the issue.

The potential of pregabalin for developing visual field defects has been sufficiently studied. The very low incidence of unexplained visual field defects, the lack of a specific pattern of these defects, the variability of these defects after retesting and the size of the 'visual field database' makes it unlikely that  pregabalin  is  a  causal  factor  for  developing  visual  field  defects.  In  addition,  the  applicant committed to assess all visual adverse events under a separate heading in periodic safety reports.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Pregabalin is an analogue of the mammalian neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a  satisfactory way. At the time of the CPMP opinion there were some outstanding minor quality issues which had no impact on the  benefit/risk  profile.  The  applicant  committed  to  provide  the  necessary  information  as  follow-up measures within an agreed timeframe, and to submit variations if required following the evaluation of this additional information.

Efficacy and safety of pregabalin in peripheral neuropathic pain in adults has been demonstrated both in  diabetic  polyneuropathy  and  postherpetic  neuropathy.  Effects  in  patients  without  somnolence are considered  clinically  meaningful  even  if  the  effect  appears  greater  in  patients  with  somnolence. Efficacy  and  safety  of  pregabalin  as  an  adjunct  to  other  anti-epileptic  agents  in  adults  with  partial epilepsy  has  been  demonstrated.  Long-term  data  on  efficacy  are  limited  but  this  does  not  raise  a concern for the potential risk of tolerance. Dizziness and somnolence are the main adverse events. The adverse  event  profile  for  BID  and  TID  regimens  shortly  after  initiation  of  treatment  did  not  differ between  the  dosing  schedules.  Both  schedules  are  equally  tolerated,  also  in  the  elderly.  Efficacy results  of  TID  seemed  better  than  BID  but  the  clinical  relevance  of  this  difference  is  questionable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Therefore,  both  the  BID  and  TID  regimens  have  been  approved  which  will  allow  physicians  the choice of the best regimen for individual patients.

Two-year carcinogenicity studies with pregabalin were conducted in rats and mice. No tumours were observed in rats at exposures up to 24 times the mean human exposure at the maximum recommended clinical  dose  of  600 mg/day.  In  mice,  no  increased  incidence  of  tumours  was  found  at  exposures similar to the mean human exposure, but an increased incidence of haemangiosarcoma was observed at  higher  exposures.  The  non-genotoxic  mechanism  of  pregabalin-induced  tumour  formation  is  not fully  characterised;  however,  pregabalin-induced  platelet  changes  associated  with  endothelial  cell proliferation and tumour formation in mice are not present in rats or in humans, based on the available data. Based on this mechanistic approach there is no evidence to suggest an associated risk to man . Long-term data in humans are limited and a risk management programme to follow a potential risk of tumour in man may not provide relevant information. Therefore it was agreed that the applicant will provide  additional  long-term  clinical  data  concerning  the  assessment  of  platelet  morphology,  a surrogate marker of platelet activation, in humans  receiving pregabalin as a post approval commitment.

Animal juvenile toxicity studies indicated an effect on CNS function (hyperactivity and bruxism) and growth  and  female  reproductive  function  at  clinically  relevant  exposures.  Reversibility  of  some  of these effects will have to be assessed prior to paediatric development.

## Recommendation

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus that  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  Lyrica  in  the  treatment  of  peripheral neuropathic pain in  adults  and  as adjunctive  therapy  in  adults  with  partial  seizures  with  or  without  secondary  generalisation  was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
