## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Clopidogrel Acino 75 mg film-coated tablets is a generic medicinal product containing clopidogrel as clopidogrel besilate as active substance.

The  reference  medicinal  product  is  Plavix  75  mg  film-coated  tablets,  which  contain  clopidogrel hydrogensulphate.

Clopidogrel is a non-competitive inhibitor of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at the platelet receptors. The  effect  of  ADP  on  platelets  is  mediated  by  two  G-protein  coupled  P2Y  receptors  (P2Y1  and P2Y12) and the cation channel-coupled P2X1 receptor. The adenylate cyclase-coupled ADP receptor P2Y12 is the main target of clopidogrel and leads to inhibition of platelet activation, aggregation, and Gp  IIb/IIIa  receptor  activation.  Clopidogrel  is  a  thienopyridine  and  only  the S -enantiomer  is pharmacologically active. The safety and efficacy profile of clopidogrel has been demonstrated in several clinical trials details of  which  can  be  found  in  the  EPAR  for  Plavix.  In  addition,  there  is  a  long-term  post-marketing experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Clopidogrel Acino 75mg film-coated  tablet  contains  clopidogrel  besilate.  Since  this  application  is  a  generic  application referring  to  the  reference  medicinal  product  Plavix,  summary  of  the  clinical  data  of  clopidogrel hydrogensulphate is available and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and safety have been conducted with clopidogrel besilate. The indication proposed for clopidogrel besilate is the same for the reference medicinal product. 2.2 Quality aspects Introduction Clopidogrel Acino is presented in the form of film-coated tablets. The  film-coated  tablets  contain  75  mg,  of  clopidogrel  as  active  substance.  Other  ingredients  are defined in the SPC section 6.1. It is packaged into blisters made of OPA/Al/PVC/Al. Active Substance The  chemical  name  of  clopidogrel  besilate  is:  (S)  -  (2-chlorophenyl)-6,  7-dihydrothieno  [3,2-c]pyridine  -5  (4H)  -  acetic  acid  methyl  ester  benzene  sulphonate,  corresponding  to  the  molecular formula  C16H16ClO2NS  *C6H5SO3H  and  relative  molecular  mass  479.06.  It  is  a  white  to  off-white crystalline, non-hygroscopic powder, practically insoluble in water. The pKa value was determined to 9.67. No polymorphism of clopidogrel besilate is known. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Manufacture

Clopidogrel  besilate  is  manufactured  in  either  of  two  manufacturing  sites  by  a  six  step  chemical synthesis.  An ASMF has been submitted. Critical process parameters of all stages with appropriate justification  have  been  described.  Starting  materials  are  described  in  sufficient  detail  as  well  as synthetic intermediates.

The  active  substance  has  one  chiral  centre  therefore  it  exhibits  chirality  -  clopidogrel  besilate  is synthesized as the S-enantiomer. No racemisation was observed under the commercial manufacturing process and proposed storage conditions and also under conditions for drug product manufacture.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Specification

The  drug  substance  specification  as  tested  by  the  finished  product  manufacturer  includes  tests  for appearance (visual),  identification  (IR  and  HPLC),  solubility  (in-house),  loss  on  drying  (in-house), residue  on  ignition  (in-house),  heavy  metals  (Ph.Eur),  specific  optical  rotation  (polarimetry),  assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), methyl ester of benzene sulphonic acid (GC/MS, non-routine test).

Registration batches of clopidogrel besilate have been submitted. Data were in compliance with the specifications.  Three  registration  batches  of  clopidogrel  besilate  for  each  manufacturing  site  have been submitted. Data of these six batches were in compliance with the specifications.

## · Stability

Stability was studied in accordance with ICH guidelines under normal (25°C/60% RH), accelerated (40°C/75%RH) and intermediate (30°C/65%RH) conditions for three registration batches. Results of primary long term studies for up to 18 months have been provided. Overall the obtained results support the proposed re-test period and storage conditions. Medicinal Product · Pharmaceutical Development The tablets have been developed with the objective of developing a conventional release film-coated tablets bioequivalent with the innovator's product  Plavix tablets.  Clopidogrel  Acino  product represents  an  alternative  to  the  originator  since  it  contains  the  same  active  substance  (clopidogrel base) different in the salt (besilate instead of bisulphate) with the same dosage strength and dosage form. The  potential  risk  of  occurrence  of  contamination  with  benzene  sulphonic  acid  methyl  ester  in clopidogrel  besilate  was  further  elucidated  in  the  documentation.  A  GC/MS  method  has  been established and LOD of benzene sulphonic acid methyl ester is far below the TTC value of 1.5 µg/day intake of a genotoxic impurity mentioned in the Guideline on the Limits of Genotoxic Impurities. Results  of  batch  analysis  provided  on  several  batches  of  clopidogrel  besilate  from  both  active substance manufacturing sites, and the possible genotoxic impurity in question was below LOD. The content  of  benzene  sulphonic  acid  isopropyl  ester  in  the  drug  product  is  controlled  by  a  validated method and a specification limit has been set by the finished product manufacturer. The  manufacture  of  the  newly  developed  conventional-release  film-coated  tablet  is  based  on granulation  followed  by  blending  of  the  resulting  granules  with  an  external  phase,  compression  to tablet cores and film-coating. The drug substance clopidogrel besilate is uniformly distributed in the film-coated tablet. Bioequivalence study of Clopidogrel Acino and Plavix has been provided. During  pharmaceutical  development  different  clopidogrel  salts  were  considered  and  tested  and  the free base as well as formulations with or without stabilizing agents to get the most stable composition. Based on the stability results besilate salt has been chosen with respect to total impurities. Several polymorphic  forms  of  the  clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate  (bisulphate)  salt  contained  in  Plavix  are known. In contrast, up to now no polymorphs of the besilate salt are known. Widely used, common excipients have been chosen and compatibility with the active substance was demonstrated. The developed formulation provides rapid disintegration of the tablets and rapid clopidogrel release and therefore particle size was not considered to be an important factor. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Comparative dissolution profiles of four different batches including bio-batch of the tested product with the similar results and release of more than 85 % within 15 minutes have been submitted.

Comparative dissolution profiles of the bio-batch of the tested product and reference products from different  European  countries  including  bio-batch  have  been  submitted.  Results  demonstrate  similar profiles for test and reference.

Impurity profiles of a number of reference products sourced from different European countries (the same as for the comparative dissolution profiles experiment) and three batches of the tested product have been evaluated on impurity and active substance assay. The amount of impurities is negligible for all batches.

## · Manufacture of the Product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  manufacturing  process  comprises  four  main  steps:  granulation,  blending,  compression,  filmcoating.

A  number  of  process  parameters  have  been  identified  as  potentially  critical  for  the  quality  of  the finished product and appropriate in-process controls is performed during the manufacture of the filmcoated tablets.

## · Product Specification

The product release and shelf-life specifications include tests for appearance (visual), identification (clopidogrel besilate: HPLC, UV, titanium dioxide: chemical reaction, non-routine test), uniformity of dosage  units-mass  variation  (PhEur),  dissolution  (PhEur),  assay  (HPLC),  degradation  products (HPLC),  water  content  (PhEur),  enantiomeric  purity  (HPLC,  non-routine  test),  benzene  sulphonic acid isopropyl ester (GC/MS-  non-routine  test), residual solvent (GC,  non-routine  test)  and microbiological quality (PhEur- non-routine test).

Validation data for three production and four pilot scale batches of the finished product have been submitted.  Validation  plan  for  three  production  scale  batches  has  been  described  including  risk analysis. All presented batches comply with the proposed specification and demonstrate consistent manufacture. · Adventitious Agents None of the starting materials and excipients used for the manufacture Clopidogrel Acino film-coated tablets do contain materials that are of animal or human origin. · Stability of the Product Four pilot scale batches of Clopidogrel Acino film-coated tablets were put on long-term (25±2°C/60±5%RH) for up to 24 months, intermediate (30±2°C/65±5%RH) for up to 12 months and accelerated (40±2°C/75±5%RH) stability testing conditions for up to six months. The product shows no trends in any controlled parameter except the slight increase of water content, tablet hardness and of one impurity content at any of the storage conditions. However these changes did not present any significant change in the overall quality over time. All the results remained well within the specification limits during all the stability studies. Photostability study as per the relevant guideline has been performed and the obtained data show that the product is not sensitive to light. In conclusion the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are accepted. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  has been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 2.3 Non-Clinical aspects

Clopidogrel  is  widely  used  well-known  substance.  Its  pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and toxicological properties are well characterised and new non clinical studies were not provided. This generic  application  contains  a  different  salt  of  the  active  substance.  On  the  basis  of  the  CHMP Guidance for users of the centralised procedure for generic application (EMEA/CHMP/225411/2006), when different salts of the active substance of the reference medicinal product are used, additional information providing proof that their safety and/or efficacy profile is not different from that of the reference medicinal product is needed. A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of clopidogrel  hydrogensulphate  and  justifications  that  the  different  clopidogrel  salt  does  not  differ

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference product was provided on request of the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non clinical studies  were  not  considered  necessary.  The  excipients  used  in  drug  formulation  are  conventional, known and already used in other medicinal products.

The environmental risk assessment (ERA) in line with the CHMP Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CPMP/SWP/4447/00)  was  not  submitted; however, a justification for omission of environmental risk assessment was provided. This was based on the fact the generic medicinal product is intended to substitute the reference product and it will not result in additional hazard to the environment. The supplied justification for the lack of a full ERA was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

2.4 Clinical Aspects Introduction The CHMP assessment addressed pharmacokinetic data in respect of one bioequivalence study. GCP The bioequivalence study 014-06 as well as the relevant analytical procedures was conducted by a CRO in India. It was stated that the clinical part of the clinical study was carried out in accordance which the principles and requirements described in the ICH guideline on Good Clinical Practice. Clinical studies To support the  application for Clopidogrel Acino, one bioequivalence study 014-06 comparing the bioavailability of Clopidogrel 75 mg Tablet and Plavix following a 75 mg dose in healthy subjects under  fasting  conditions  was  presented.  The  study  was  conducted  under  fasting  conditions.  In addition,  this  generic  product  contains  a  different  salt  of  clopidogrel  (clopidogrel  besilate)  in comparison with the reference medicinal product. Thus, the CHMP raised a major concern, since on the  basis  of  the  CHMP  Guidance  for  users  of  the  centralised  procedure  for  generic  application (EMEA/CHMP/225411/2006), when different salts of the active substance of the reference medicinal product are used, additional information providing proof that their safety and/or efficacy profile is not different from that of the reference medicinal product is needed. Pharmacokinetics · Methods STUDY DESIGN Study code: 014-06 An open-label, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two sequence single dose, crossover pivotal study  to  compare  the  bioavailability  of  Clopidogrel  75  mg  CD  film-coated  tablets-Cimex  AG, Switzerland  with  Plavix  75  mg  film-coated  tablets-Sanofi-Synthelabo,  Germany  in  healthy,  adult, male, human subjects under fastening conditions. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The objective of this study was to compare the bioavailability and characterise the pharmacokinetic profile of the generic clopidogrel 75 mg tablets with respect to the reference formulation of Plavix 75 mg clopidogrel film-coated tablets in healthy, adult, male population under fasting conditions and to assess  the  bioequivalence.  This  was  an  open-label,  randomised,  two-treatment,  two-period,  twosequence single dose crossover pivotal study performed on 46 healthy adult male non-smokers or light smokers. The study was performed in fasting subjects, measuring the parent prodrug clopidogrel. The protocol and informed consent forms (ICFs) were reviewed and approved by an Ethics Committee on 14 March 06. The study was conducted between 16 March 06 and 26 March 06.

## TEST AND REFERENCE PRODUCTS

Clopidogrel 75 mg tablet, batch No. 060281-75FT; Cimex AG, 4253 Liesberg, Switzerland.

Plavix 75 mg, batch No. 501252; Sanofi Synthelabo GMBH, Germany.

## POPULATION(S) STUDIED

The study population included healthy, adult males non-smokers or light smokers (up to 10 cigarettes per day), aged &gt; 18 and &lt; 45 years and with BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m 2 . All subjects had to comply with the inclusion and exclusion criteria pre-specified in the protocol and were judged eligible for enrolment in this study, based on medical and medication histories, demographic data, vital signs measurements, 12-lead ECG, physical examination, a chest X-ray, and clinical laboratory tests. Of the 48 subjects dosed, 46 completed the trial and were included in the statistical analysis.

The results for the pharmacokinetic parameters (non-transformed values; arithmetic mean ± SD, tmax median) and for the mean ratios of the 90%CI for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax are summarised in the tables below. The pharmacokinetic parameters were not reported for subjects whose extrapolation area was found to be &gt;20%. However, the CHMP did not consider this acceptable, since subjects should not be excluded from the analysis on this ground. Therefore the submission of complete statistical analysis in which the data of all subjects are included was requested. This is presented below as an appendix to the table.

The  selected  population  is  in  accordance  with  the  NƒG  on  Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98. The study has been conducted in a population of Indian subjects,  which  is  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP,  since  there  is  no  concern  that  this  study population  would  be  less  sensitive  than  European  subjects  with  respect  to  the  detection  of formulation-specific  differences.  The  selection  of  the  population  as  well  as  enrolment  of  light smokers has been appropriate. ANALYTICAL METHODS Plasma  concentration  of  clopidogrel  was  determined  by  liquid  chromatographic  tandem  mass spectrometric  method.  The  method  was  validated  in  the  studied  range.  Samples  were  analysed between 13 April 06 to 30 April 06. Analyses were conducted at a bioanalytical laboratory in India. PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES The primary pharmacokinetic parameters defined in the protocol were AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and maximal plasma clopidogrel concentration Cmax. STATISTICAL METHODS Analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  was  carried  out  on  ln-transformed  AUC0-t,  AUC0-∞ ,  Cmax,  and untransformed t1/2 values. Factors of subjects, treatments, sequence, and period were also evaluated in the  model.    A  non-parametric  test  was  carried  out  to  compare  the  T max values  between  treatments. Individual  data  were  presented,  logarithmic  transformation  used,  individual  plasma  concentrationtime  profiles  were  shown.  Descriptive  statistics  was  used  to  summarize  the  results.  The  statistical methods used were acceptable. · Results Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ , Cmax were considered as primary parameters for bioequivalence conclusion with the  proposed  acceptance  range  of  80-125%  for  the  AUC  and  75-133%  for  the  Cmax  defined  in  the study protocol. However, widening of the limits for bioequivalence conclusions for Cmax values was not acceptable according to the current CHMP recommendations. Nevertheless, since the Cmax results of  the  study  are  within  the  standard  80-125%  limits  required  by  the  NƒG  on  Investigation  of Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98, lack of appropriate justification for widening the limits is of no importance.

In total, seven adverse events (AEs) occurred during the conduct of the study 014-06. All were mild in nature and were resolved. There were no serious adverse events or deaths reported. Two significant, possibly  related  events  were  reported:  vomiting  with  indigestion  and  diarrhoea,  but  were  resolved. No additional safety concerns were identified.

Out  of  the  48  subjects  dosed,  46  were  included  in  the  statistical  analysis.  Two  study  participants dropped out; one due to medical reasons one elected to withdraw on day 0 of period 2. Two drop-out subjects  are  acceptable  and  it  is  considered  to  have  no  relevant  impact  on  the  results  of  the  study. There  were  no  major  deviations  from  the  study  protocol  and  the  minor  deviations,  such  as  blood sample timing, vital recordings, use of concomitant medication, were well documented.  Conclusions Based on the presented bioequivalence study 014-06, Clopidogrel Acino is considered bioequivalent with Plavix. Pharmacodynamics No studies were submitted. Post marketing experience No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 2.5 Pharmacovigilance  PSUR The PSUR submission schedule for Clopidogrel Acino should follow the PSUR submission schedule of the reference medicinal product.  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.  The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market.  Risk Management Plan Medicinal product no longer authorised

Risk  Management  Plan  has  not  been  submitted.  Since  the  application  concerns  a  generic  of  a respective  reference  medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring  additional  risk minimization activities have been identified, this is considered acceptable.

## Discussion on Clinical aspects

One clinical bioequivalence trial 014-06 was provided for Clopidogrel Acino application, analysing the  parent  prodrug  clopidogrel.  The  demonstration  of  the  unchanged  safety/efficacy  profile  of clopidogrel  besilate  when  compared  with  Plavix  (clopidogrel  hydrogensulphate)  was  raised  by  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CHMP as a major issue for this generic product. Apart from this general concern, it is particularly important to evaluate the safety of the besilate moiety, since salification agents, such as benzenelsulfonic  acid,  could  impact  the  antiaggregation  effects  of  platelets  considering  that  their chemical structure may be in relation with a pharmaceutical activity. In response, the following facts were addressed: the physical-chemical properties of clopidogrel besilate, the behaviour of benzenesulphonate in various parts of the gastrointestinal tract with different pH ranges, the use of benzensulphonic  acid  as  an  excipient  and  the  clinical  experience  with  besilate  salts  present  in medicinal products on the market. It was emphasized that the properties of this moiety undergo fast elimination from human body and the use of other medicinal products containing besilate moiety has not  shown  any  safety  signals.  Therefore,  it  was  felt  that  the  potential  for  an  adverse  interaction between platelets and the besilate moiety is unlikely and the CHMP considered the issue resolved.

At  the  time  of  approval  of  the  reference  product  Plavix,  there  was  no  reliable  and  validated methodology for the determination of the pharmacokinetics of the parent prodrug clopidogrel, or of the active metabolite clopidogrel thiol. Thus, the pharmacokinetic profile was established based on the  pharmacokinetics  of  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid,  which  is  the  non-active  metabolite.    In  the meantime, a reliable bioanalytical method for determination of clopidogrel in plasma and urine was developed. Since the pharmacokinetic profile of the active metabolite is still not well established, the CHMP accepted the proof of bioequivalence based on the clopidogrel parent compound data in study 016-04. The  recently  published  literature  data  indicate  that  the  bioavailability  of  a  single  oral  dose  of clopidogrel and the pharmacokinetic parameters of clopidogrel, especially Cmax and AUCinf, might be increased  by  several  folds  in  the  fed  condition  compared  to  the  fasted  condition.  The  currently presented clinical study was conducted in fasted state and thus, the CHMP requested a clarification of this approach.  Adequate  justification  why  bioequivalence  for  the  generic  product  should  be demonstrated only under fasting condition was provided. Bioequivalence studies in fasting conditions are  normally  recommended  as  mentioned  in  the  Questions  &amp;  Answers  on  the  Bioavailability  and Bioequivalence  Guideline  (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006)  document  as  this  situation  would  be more  sensitive to differences in pharmacokinetics. In addition the dissolution studies using clopidogrel  besilate  conducted  at  three  different  pH  values  (1.2,  4.5  and  6.8)  and  mimicking  the conditions of a fed state did not show any major differences between the originator and the generic product. The  bio-analytical  technique  and  methodology  applied  in  the  analysis  of  the  samples  during  the bioequivalence study 014-06 were described. The bio-analytical technique and methodology applied in the analysis of the samples during the bioequivalence studies included validation with the analysis of calibration curves and quality controls at various concentrations. The CHMP questioned whether there is a potential for back-conversion of the quantitatively major metabolite clopidogrel carboxylic acid  to  the  parent  drug.  Considering  that  the  plasma  levels  of  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid  are considerably  higher  than  those  of  the  parent  drug,  a  minimum  back-conversion  of  the  metabolite would lead to a huge over-estimation of clopidogrel plasma levels and would bias the outcome of the bioequivalence study. Demonstration of the lack of back-conversion of clopidogrel carboxylic acid metabolite to the parent drug under all conditions for sample handling and storage was requested by the  CHMP.  To  resolve  any  doubts  and  to  confirm  that  there  is  no  back-conversion  of  the quantitatively major metabolite clopidogrel carboxylic acid to the parent-drug clopidogrel, the results of  an  experiment  conducted  with  this  purpose  were  provided  during  the  procedure.  Following  the sample  work  up  and  the  chromatographic  analysis  of  multiple  samples  prepared  by  spiking  blank human plasma with clopidogrel carboxylic acid immediately and after several hours, no area response at  retention  time  relevant  to  clopidogrel  was  observed  in  samples  of  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid. Hence,  these  results  show  that  there  is  no  potential  for  the  occurrence  for  back-conversion  of clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid  to  clopidogrel  during  the  bioanalysis  in  study  014-06.  The  CHMP considered this issue resolved. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The bioequivalence study and statistical evaluation were in accordance with accepted standards for bioequivalence testing, as stated in the Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98).  The  parameters  used  to  establish  bioavailability

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

included the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the maximal plasma concentration of the  parent  compound  of  clopidogrel.  Bioequivalence  has  been  established  as  the  calculated  90% confidence intervals for ln-transformed AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax fell within the acceptance range of 80125% for the parent drug clopidogrel as required by the above mentioned guideline.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

The application contains adequate quality, non clinical and clinical data and the bioequivalence has been shown. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are required beyond those included in the product information. Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of Clopidogrel Acino in the prevention of atherothrombotic events in: · Patients  suffering  from  myocardial  infarction  (from  a  few  days  until  less  than  35  days), ischaemic  stroke  (from  7  days  until  less  than  6  months)  or  established  peripheral  arterial disease. · Patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome: -Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial  infarction),  including  patients  undergoing  a  stent  placement  following percutaneous coronary intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). -ST  segment  elevation  acute  myocardial  infarction,  in  combination  with  ASA  in medically treated patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy, was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
