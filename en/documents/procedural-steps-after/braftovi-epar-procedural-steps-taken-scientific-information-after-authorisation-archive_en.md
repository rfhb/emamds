1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

This was a 2-part, multi-center, randomized, open label, Phase III study comparing the efficacy and safety of encorafenib plus binimetinib to vemurafenib and encorafenib monotherapy in participants with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 mutation.

The median PFS remained longer in the Combo 300 (Part 2) arm than in the Enco 300 (Parts 1+2) group with median PFS estimates of 12.9 months (95% CI: 10.9, 14.9) and 9.2 months (95% CI: 7.4, 11.1), respectively. The confirmed ORR (per BIRC) was 67.8% (95% CI: 61.8, 73.5) and 51.4% (95% CI 45.4, 57.4) in the Combo 300 (Part 2) and Enco 300 (Parts 1 + 2) arms, respectively.

This is a Phase 1, three-arm, open-label drug-drug interaction study in patients with BRAF V600-mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma or other BRAF V600-E and/or K-mutant advanced solid tumours. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 14/10/2021 | 06/01/2022 | SmPC            | SmPC new text In vivo, encorafenib is an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and/or BCRP. Coadministration of encorafenib with OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or BCRP substrates (such as rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, methotrexate) can result in increased concentrations. Repeated administration of encorafenib 450 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily with a single dose of rosuvastatin (a OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BCRP substrate) increased rosuvastatin Cmax by 2.7-fold and AUC by 1.6- fold indicating a mild inhibition of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and/or BCRP transporters. |
