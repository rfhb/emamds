## 1. Background information on the procedure

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 01 July 2025 an application for a variation.

The following changes were proposed:

| Variation(s) requested   | Variation(s) requested                                                                                                                                      | Type              |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| C.I.4                    | C.I.4 Change(s) in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling or Package Leaflet due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | Variation type II |

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update efficacy and safety information in paediatric and adult population based on final results from study J1S-MC-JP04; this is a randomized, open-label, phase 2 study evaluating abemaciclib in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide in participants with relapsed or refractory Ewing's sarcoma.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

Verzenios (abemaciclib) is a selective inhibitor of CDK4/6. CDK4/6 inhibition prevents cell cycle progression through the G1 restriction point and arrests tumour growth. Mutations or overexpression in this pathway occur frequently in human cancers and tumours that involve such alterations are potentially sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition.

Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is an aggressive sarcoma of the bone or soft tissue, or both, with a peak incidence in adolescents, but can occur from infancy to adulthood. Long-term survivors of relapsed EWS are rare. Among the accepted regimens, irinotecan (IRN) and temozolomide (TMZ) have demonstrated some of the highest response rates of up to 63% and a 2-year OS rate of 36% in EWS patients. These outcomes highlight the need for continued improvements. This highlights a need for rationale-targeted therapies beyond conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Based on the role of CDKs in the activation of DNA-damage signalling and repair, along with the evidence of CDK pathway aberrations in EWS, it was hypothesised that the addition of abemaciclib to IRN plus TMZ could be of potential benefit for the treatment of EWS.

Abemaciclib was initially authorised in the EU on 26 September 2018 and is now licensed for the treatment of early and advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

As part of the present type II variation, the MAH submitted the results of paediatric study J1S-MC-JP04 and proposed an update of section 5.1 of the SmPC. Study J1S-MC-JP04 is one of two clinical studies key binding elements in the voluntary abemaciclib PIP (EMEA- 002342-PIP01-18-M04). This voluntary PIP was intended for the development of an indication for Ewing sarcoma.

Study J1S-MC-JP04 failed to meet its primary outcome. Median PFS was 2.8 months in the abemaciclib + IRN +TMZ arm and 2.9 months in the control arm (IRN +TMZ).

Hence, add-on abemaciclib to IRN and TMZ does not lead to a favourable benefit-risk balance for patients with relapsed or refractory EWS when compared to the combination of IRN and TMZ.

The combination of abemaciclib with IRN and TMZ was generally safe and tolerated with manageable toxicities. However, the addition of abemaciclib resulted in increased high-grade toxicities notably

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

haematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity and required more dose reductions and omissions of all study drugs.

To inform the healthcare professionals of the available information for EWS, section 5.1 Paediatric population of the abemaciclib SmPC is being updated with appropriate information on study JP04.

The proposed update to section 5.1 is acceptable.

The benefit-risk balance of Verzenios, remains positive.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, this application regarding the following change:

## Summary

## SmPC 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Verzenios in all subsets of the paediatric population in breast cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

The efficacy and safety of Verzenios in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide was evaluated in Study J1S-MC-JP04, a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 2 study in participants with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

blinded independent review committee. 46 participants, 3 to 35 years of age, were randomised to receive Verzenios plus irinotecan and temozolomide or irinotecan and temozolomide in a 2:1 ratio. 58.7 % of patients (27 patients) were &lt; 18 years of age. 45 participants were treated in 21-day cycles until disease progression or having met other discontinuation criteria. No difference in PFS was observed with the addition of Verzenios. The median PFS was 2.8 months in patients treated with Verzenios in combination irinotecan and temozolomide and 2.9 months in patients treated with irinotecan and temozolomide (HR 0.64 [95% CI: 0.28, 1.45]).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5. Introduction

Abemaciclib (Verzenio) is a selective inhibitor of CDK4/6. CDK4/6 inhibition prevents cell cycle progression through the G1 restriction point and arrests tumour growth. Alterations in this pathway occur frequently in human cancers and involve i) loss of endogenous CDK inhibitors by mutation or epigenetic silencing, ii) mutation or overexpression of either CDK4, CDK6, or Cyclin D, or iii) inactivation of retinoblastoma. These alterations render cells less dependent on mitogenic signalling for proliferation. With few exceptions, cancers that involve CDK mutations or overexpression are potentially sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition.

Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive sarcoma of the bone or soft tissue, or both, with a peak incidence in adolescents, but can occur from infancy to adulthood. A multidisciplinary approach of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation (reserved for unresectable tumours) has improved 5-year eventfree survival and OS to 69% and 72%, respectively, in the paediatric population. However, 30% to 40% of those who present initially with localised or metastatic disease will ultimately suffer a disease recurrence. Time to relapse is typically short, with a median of only 1.4 years for patients with initial localised disease, and 12 months for those initially metastatic. The prognosis for patients after disease relapse is dismal, with a 5-year OS rate of only 13% and median OS of only 7 months following progression. Long-term survivors of relapsed EWS are rare. Among the accepted regimens, irinotecan (IRN) and temozolomide (TMZ) have demonstrated some of the highest response rates of up to 63% and a 2-year OS rate of 36% in EWS patients. These outcomes highlight the need for continued improvements. Despite large multinational studies of novel combinations, treatment of relapsed EWS relies entirely on chemotherapeutic agents. This highlights a need for rationale-targeted therapies beyond conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Based on the role of CDKs in the activation of DNA-damage signalling and repair, along with the evidence of CDK pathway aberrations in EWS, it was hypothesised that the addition of abemaciclib to IRN plus TMZ could be of potential benefit for the treatment of EWS.

Abemaciclib was initially authorised in the EU on 26 September 2018 and is now indicated for the treatment of early and advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Two product-specific waivers have been agreed upon:

1. for the treatment of breast cancer (procedure EMEA-002342-PIP03-18) and
2. for the treatment of prostate cancer (EMEA-002342-PIP05-23).

Two voluntary PIPs have also been agreed upon:

1. for the treatment of EWS ( EMEA-002342-PIP01-18-M04 ) and
2. for the treatment of glioma (EMEA-002342-PIP02-18).

The present variation concerns the paediatric study J1S-MC-JP04 and as part of such type II variation, the MAH proposed to update section 5.1 of the SmPC. Study J1S-MC-JP04 is one of two clinical studies key binding elements in the voluntary PIP ( EMEA- 002342-PIP01-18-M04 ). This voluntary PIP was intended for the development of an indication for Ewing sarcoma. The primary outcome of the J1S-MCJP04 study was not met. Hence, the MAH is only proposing to reflect the outcome of the study in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

## 6.1.1. Study JP04

Figure 1. Study design

Study JP04 was a randomised, open-label, Phase 2 study evaluating abemaciclib in combination with IRN and TMZ in participants with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma.

<!-- image -->

Stratification factors for the randomisation were time to first recurrence less than 2 years or at least 2 years from initial diagnosis, isolated pulmonary metastases versus other metastases at study entry, and age (less than 18 years or at least 18 years). Patients were treated until disease progression or other discontinuation criteria were met.

Under a frequentist analysis, study JP04 was powered at 82% assuming a PFS HR of 0.45 at a 1-sided alpha of 0.1, which required approximately 34 events. However, the primary analysis, which incorporated Bayesian control arm augmentation and utilised a Bayesian decision rule, namely the posterior probability of HR less than 1 being greater than 90%, was powered at 86%.

The primary objective of study JP04 was to characterise the efficacy of abemaciclib in combination with IRN and TMZ in participants with relapsed or refractory EWS by PFS by BIRC. Secondary objectives included safety, clinical activity, PK, and acceptability and palatability of the age-appropriate tablet or granule drug product, or both, of abemaciclib.

The primary analysis results are based on a database lock on 12 March 2025.

a One participant randomized to the abemaciclib + IRN + TMZ treatment arm was retrospectively diagnosed with lymphoblastic lymphoma of the bone instead of Ewing Sarcoma after enrollment.

b Participant with 'missing' Lansky score had a Lansky score of 100% during screening but never started study treatment and, therefore, does not have a calculable baseline score.

## 6.2.3. Efficacy

The primary outcome analysis for PFS by BIRC implemented a Bayesian model with control arm augmentation using historical control data from the following publications: Blanchette et al. 2015, Casey et al. 2009, and Kurucu et al. 2015. In total, 42 PFS events from 64 sarcoma patients were extracted from the publications.

## 6.3. Discussion

A total of 46 participants were included in the efficacy analyses. Most participants had relapsed disease, stage IV at study entry, and had received a median of 2 prior lines of systemic therapy. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally well balanced. The median age was 16.0 (range: 3 to 35) years, with 58.7% of participants aged less than 18 years. The abemaciclib plus IRN and TMZ arm had more participants with axial skeleton disease as original disease location (50.0% and 18.8%, respectively) and more participants with time from initial diagnosis to first recurrence less than 2 years (86.7% and 68.8%, respectively).

Although study JP04 for EWS met its primary objective with respect to PFS by BIRC under Bayesian analysis using a control arm augmented with historical data, the prespecified Bayesian exponential model appears to overestimate the PFS curve in the abemaciclib arm, thus biasing effect size estimation relative to the control arm. In addition, sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint using traditional frequentist approach did not demonstrate improved PFS by BIRC. Median PFS was 2.8 months in the abemaciclib + IRN +TMZ arm and 2.9 months in the IRN +TMZ control arm. Taken together, the primary analysis results should be interpreted with caution.

Furthermore, other efficacy endpoints including ORR failed to show benefit with add-on abemaciclib in this patient population. OS data were immature and did not indicate survival benefit (HR = 0.67, 95% CI: (0.26, 1.75).

No benefit was seen with the add-on of abemaciclib to IRN+TMZ.

The proposed update to section 5.1 is considered acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 6.4. Conclusion

The totality of evidence indicates that add-on abemaciclib to IRN and TMZ does not lead to a favourable benefit-risk balance for patients with relapsed or refractory EWS when compared to the combination of IRN and TMZ.

To inform the healthcare professionals of the available information for EWS, section 5.1 Paediatric population of the abemaciclib SmPC is being updated with appropriate information on the study JP04.

## 7.4. Discussion

TEAEs of at least Grade 3 related (per investigator assessment) to study treatment were more prevalent in the abemaciclib plus IRN and TMZ group (76.7%) compared to the IRN and TMZ group (40.0%).

Most TEAEs were low-grade. Notably, the group receiving abemaciclib plus IRN and TMZ experienced a higher incidence of haematological and gastrointestinal toxicities. Additionally, the abemaciclib group showed a higher rate of Grade 4 haematological toxicity (46.7% vs. 13.3%). Diarrhoea was the most common TEAE, affecting 96.7% of participants in the abemaciclib plus IRN and TMZ group and 86.7% in the IRN and TMZ group.

There were more dose modifications and treatment discontinuations of IRN or TMZ, or both, due to AEs in the abemaciclib group.

Dose modifications and discontinuations of IRN or TMZ, or both, due to AEs were more frequent in the abemaciclib arm.

Safety data were generally consistent with the known abemaciclib, IRN, and TMZ profiles.
