## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

No SmPC and PL changes are proposed.

## II. RECOMMENDATION 1

The efficacy data from two presented studies in AR support the current indication. It must be acknowledged that safety data from paediatric population are not complete because  study nr 113342 does not state how many children were included in the study, and there is no summary of adverse events in paediatric population (n=43) in study nr 113203. Summary of safety from other two studies do not reveal any special risk in this population.  The rapporteurs conclude that no changes in the product information are required.

## III. INTRODUCTION

On  29  November  2011,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  studies  for  Avamys,  in accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended,  on  medicinal products for paediatric use.

A short critical  expert  overview  has  also  been provided, dated 04 November 2011, written by safety development leader Simon Ashworth.

The  MAH  stated  that  the  submitted  paediatric  studies  do  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  for Avamys, nasal spray and that there is no consequential regulatory action.

## 2. Clinical studies

STUDY - FFR113342; A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, MultiCenter  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  Fluticasone  Furoate  Nasal  Spray  for  2 Weeks in Chinese Adult and Adolescent subjects with Allergic Rhinitis.

GLYPH&lt;31&gt;

## Methods

This study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Avamys in treatment of Allergic Rhinitis (currently approved indication) in Chinese adult and adolescent subjects.

- Objective: The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of Fluticasone furoate, nasal spray 110 μ g once daily with vehicle placebo nasal spray for 2 weeks in Chinese adult and adolescent subjects with Allergic Rhinitis
- Study design: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter,  phase  III  study  evaluated  the  efficacy  and  safety  of    Fluticasone  Furoate  Nasal Spray once-daily, 110 μ g once daily administered for 2 weeks in Chinese adult and adolescent subjects.
- Study population /Sample size: 365 Subjects from 7 sites in China
- Treatments: Fluticasone Furoate Nasal Spray 110 μ g once daily or placebo nasal spray for two weeks.
- Outcomes/endpoints: The  primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline over  the  entire  treatment  period  in  daily,  reflective,  total  nasal  symptom  scores  (rTNSS). The mean change from baseline to the end of study in nasal finding score by rhinoscopy was the secondary efficacy endpoint.
- Statistical Methods: The statistical analysis and generation of tables, listings and figures were performed using the SAS software package version 9.1. Using a two-sided significance level of 0.05, the proposed sample size should provide 92% power to detect a difference of 0.9 between Fluticasone Furoate Nasal Spray and placebo.

GLYPH&lt;31&gt;

## Results

- Recruitment/ Number analysed: A total of 365 subjects were randomized: 181 in FFNS and 182 in placebo group.
- Baseline data: At baseline, the mean daily rTNSS was similar between the two treatment groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Efficacy results: The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the mean change from baseline over the entire 2 Weeks treatment period in daily rTNSS. For this endpoint, once daily Fluticasone Furoate Nasal Spray 110 μ g was significantly more efficacious in reducing the nasal symptoms of AR (rhinorrhea, congestion, itching, sneezing) versus vehicle Placebo nasal spray in Chinese adult and adolescent subjects[LS mean difference: -1.498, 95% CI (-1.897, -1.099), p&lt;0.0001]. Fluticasone Furoate Nasal Spray 110 μ g was also significantly more efficacious than vehicle Placebo nasal spray in the evaluation of nasal finding by rhinoscopy (p&lt;0.0001).

· Safety  results: The  incidence  of  adverse  events  (AEs)  was  low  in  the  two  treatment groups:  7.2%  of  subjects  treated  with  Fluticasone  Furoate  Nasal  Spray  110 μ g  and  4.9%  of subjects treated with vehicle Placebo. The most common AEs demonstrated in short term AR studies  conducted  in  the  USA  and  Europe  were  headache,  epistaxis,  and  nasopharyngitis. However,  the  AE  profile  observed  in  this  study  was  different.  Rhinalgia  and  dizziness  were reported as the most common drug-related AEs in Chinese subjects.

STUDYFFU111439 ; A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Once-Daily Intranasal Administration of Fluticasone Furoate Nasal Spray 110mcg in Adult and Adolescent Subjects  12 years of Age and Older with Periannial Allergic Rhinitis.

GLYPH&lt;31&gt;

## Methods

This study is for demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Avamys in treatment of Allergic Rhinitis (currently approved indication). This Periannial Allergic Rhinitis (PAR) study was  conducted to determine the efficacy of fluticasone furoate nasal spray for the treatment of ocular symptoms associated with PAR.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Objective: The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of 4 weeks of treatment with intranasal fluticasone furoate 110 mcg once daily and placebo nasal spray in subjects ≥ 12 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis.
- Study design: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of FFNS.
- Study  population  /Sample  size:  288  subjects  from 30  -  40  investigative  sites  in  North America, Europe, and the Russian Federation.
- Treatments: once-daily, intranasal administration of fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 mcg or placebo administered for 4 weeks in adult and adolescent subjects (12 years of age and older) with PAR.
- Outcomes/endpoints: The primary efficacy measure for the study was the mean change from  baseline  over  the  entire  treatment  period  in  daily  reflective  total  nasal  symptom  scores (rTNSS).  Key  secondary  measures  were  the  mean  change  from  baseline  over  the  entire treatment period in  morning  pre-dose  instantaneous  total  nasal  symptom  scores  (iTNSS)  and the mean change from baseline over the entire treatment period in daily, reflective, total ocular symptom scores (rTOSS).
- Statistical  Methods: The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  served  as  a  gatekeeper  for  the interpretation  of  treatment  comparisons  for  the  key  secondary  efficacy  and  health  outcomes endpoints. If H0 was rejected at the 0.05 level for the primary efficacy endpoint, the conclusion would be there was a difference between fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 mcg once daily and placebo, and the p-values for the key secondary efficacy and health outcomes endpoints would be interpreted according to the rules for multiplicity adjustment.Using a two-sample t-test with a two-sided significance level of 0.05, the proposed sample size should provide 90% power to detect a difference of 1.0 between active treatment and placebo.

GLYPH&lt;31&gt;

## Results

- Recruitment/ Number analysed: A total of 509 subjects were screened for this study. The ITT population comprised 315 subjects who were randomized and received at least one dose of study medication (160 in FFNS group and 155 - placebo). Total number of participants in age between 12 to 18 yrs was 18 (9 in FFNS and 9 in placebo group). A total of 96% of subjects completed the study.
- Baseline data: The majority of subjects had reported having PAR for ≥ 10 years (61% 68%).Mean scores over the four 24-hour periods prior to randomization for the total nasal, nasal congestion, and total ocular symptom scores were similar between the two treatment groups
- Efficacy results:  In daily rTNSS the treatment difference between fluticasone furoate 110 mcg and placebo was significant for study weeks 2, 3, and 4, but not for Week 1. The LS mean differences ranged from -0.223 (Week 1; p=0.326) to -0.937 (Week 4; p=0.005). Over the entire treatment period in daily rTOSS the treatment difference between fluticasone furoate 110 mcg and placebo was not significant for any study week.

The mean change from baseline in daily rTNSS over the 4-week treatment period was greater for fluticasone furoate 110 mcg than for placebo in each age group: the 12 to &lt;18 years group (-2.8 [fluticasone furoate 110 mcg], -1.7 [placebo]), the 18 to &lt;65 years group (-3.0 [fluticasone furoate 110 mcg], -2.3 [placebo]), and the ≥ 65 years group (-3.9 [fluticasone furoate 110 mcg], -1.2 [placebo]). However, the sample sizes for the 12 to &lt;18 years and ≥ 65 years groups were too small to make meaningful comparisons.

- Safety results: Sixty-seven subjects (42%) in the fluticasone furoate 110 mcg group and 52 subjects (34%) in the placebo group experienced at least one AE during the treatment period. The  most  common  drug-related  AE,  epistaxis,  was  reported  by  19  subjects  (12%)  in  the fluticasone furoate 110 mcg group and 6 subjects (4%) in the placebo group. One subject (&lt;1%) in fluticasone furoate 110 mcg group and two subjects (1%) in the placebo group reported drugrelated  events  of  nasal  septum  ulceration  or  nasal  ulcer. No  SAEs  were  reported  during  the study.

STUDY - FFR111158; A  Pilot,  Randomised,  Double-blind,  Placebo-controlled,  Parallel  group, Multi-centre Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Once-daily Intranasal Administration of Fluticasone Furoate Nasal Spray 110 mcg for 4 Weeks in Adults and Adolescents with Irritant (Non-Allergic) Rhinitis.

GLYPH&lt;31&gt; Description : This study is a pilot trial in new indication for the product Avamys: treatment of  Irritant  (Non-Allergic)  Rhinitis  (IR).  Non-allergic  rhinitis  is  characterized  by  sporadic  or persistent  perennial  symptoms  that  do  not  result  from  events  mediated  by  immunoglobulin  E (IgE).  Additionally,  non-allergic  rhinitis  can  be  sub-classified  into  infectious  rhinitis,  vasomotor rhinitis  (VMR),  occupational/irritant  rhinitis,  hormonal  rhinitis,  drug-induced  rhinitis,  gustatory rhinitis,  and  non-allergic  rhinitis  with  eosinophilia  syndrome  (NARES). The sub-class of irritant rhinitis can be caused by a variety of irritant triggers which include environmental factors, such as physical and/or chemical compounds in the air.

GLYPH&lt;31&gt;

## Methods

- Objective:  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of fluticasone  furoate  nasal  spray  110  mcg  once  daily  with  placebo  nasal  spray  in  subjects  with irritant (nonallergic) rhinitis triggered predominantly by air pollution.
- Study  design:  This  was  a  4-week,  Phase  II,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebocontrolled, parallel-group, multicenter study conducted in Thailand.
- Study population /Sample size: Approximately 100 subjects (50 per arm) were planned to be randomized in each of the two treatment groups (fluticasone furoate nasal spray 110 mcg once daily and placebo nasal spray).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The sample size was based on the estimation that the distance from the mean to the limit (½ width)  of  the  95  %  confidence  interval  for  the  treatment  effect  was  no  larger  than  0.666, assuming a standard deviation of 1.7 based on previous VMR studies with fluticasone furoate where the same assessment ratings were used.

- Treatments: FFNS 110mcg QD or placebo for 4 weeks.
- Outcomes/endpoints: The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline over  the  entire  treatment  period  in  daily  rTNSS  (  reflective  total  nasal  symptoms  score)  as evaluated  on  a  4-point  categorical  scale. A  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  mean change from baseline over the entire treatment period in AM pre-dose iTNSS (instantantaneous TNSS).
- Statistical Methods: No formal statistical hypotheses were tested. The analysis method used for comparison of the two treatment groups was ANCOVA.

GLYPH&lt;31&gt;

## Results

- Recruitment/ Number analysed: One hundred two (102) subjects were randomized into the study, including only three adolescent patients.
- Baseline data: At baseline, the mean daily rTNSS were similar for both treatment groups.
- Efficacy results:

For primary endpoint, a statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups was not demonstrated (LS mean difference was -0.0655; p=0.845). For the key secondary endpoint, mean change from baseline in the morning (pre-dose) instantaneous total nasal symptom score (AM pre-dose iTNSS), a statistically significant difference was also not seen between the two groups (LS mean difference was -0.075; p=0.827).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Description

This  study  is  a  trial  in  a  new  indication  for  the  product  Avamys:  uncomplicated  acute rhinosinusitis (ARS).  ARS was definied as a clinically-diagnosed inflammatory condition of the upper respiratory tract lasting less than 4 weeks. Uncomplicated RS may be further classified by a  critical  assessment  of  the  duration  and  pattern  (e.g.,  improving,  persistent,  worsening)  of symptoms including nasal congestion, nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip), and facial pain/pressure. Patients with ARS generally have one of the following two clinical presentations (persistent or worsening) consistent with uncomplicated ARS: symptoms or signs of acute RS persist ≥ 10 days beyond onset or symptoms or signs of acute RS worsen within 5-10 days after an initial improvement. ARS patients with fever &gt;38°C and severe pain were classified as having fulminant bacterial rhinosinusitis (FBRS) were excluded from the study. Subjects who developed FBRS during the study were withdrawn and were treated with an antibiotic.

##  Methods

-  Objective: The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  two doses of FFNS (110 mcg once daily and 110 mcg twice daily) compared with placebo as monotherapy in the treatment of adult and adolescent subjects 12 years of age and older with uncomplicated ARS.
-  Study  design:  This  was  a  Phase  IIb,  randomized  in  3  groups,  double-blind,  placebocontrolled, parallel-group, multicenter study.
-  Study population /Sample size: A total of 1023 subjects were screened for this study.
-  Treatment: Treatment in 3 Groups for 2-week treatment period:
- -FFNS 110mcg QD (morning) and placebo (evening);
- -FFNS 110mcg BID (morning and evening);
- -Placebo (morning and evening).
-  Outcomes/endpoints: The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change from baseline in daily Major Symptoms Score (MSS: nasal congestion/stuffiness, sinus headache/pressure or facial pain/pressure, and postnasal drip ) over the entire treatment period (Weeks 1-2). First time to symptom improvement was the key secondary efficacy endpoint.
-  Statistical Methods: Analysis performed using ANCOVA with baseline value, country, AR status,  age,  and  gender  as  covariates.  Age  and  AR  status  were  based  on  subject demographics and baseline characteristics captured on the eCRF.

##  Results

-  Recruitment/  Number  analysed:  The  ITT  Population  included  737  subjects:  245  in  the placebo group, 240 in the FFNS 110 mcg QD group, and 252 in the FFNS 110 mcg BID group. Children aged from 12 to 18 yr. compromised 43 subjects (6%): 14; 14 and 15 according the treatment group. The majority of subjects in each treatment group ( ≥ 93%) completed the 2-week study.
-  Baseline data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Efficacy results: Based on the primary efficacy endpoint, the mean change from baseline over  the  entire  treatment  period  in  daily  MSS,  the  study  demonstrated  a  statistically significant  treatment  benefit  of  FFNS  compared  with  placebo  in  reducing  the  overall symptoms  of  uncomplicated  ARS  for  both  BID  and  QD  dosing  regimens  (LS  mean differences  vs.  placebo  of  -0.357  [p=0.014]  and  -0.386  [p=0.008]  for  BID  and  QD, respectively).  Between  the  two  FFNS  doses  investigated,  a  dose  response  was  not observed.

The  key  secondary  endpoint,  first  time  to  symptom  improvement,  did  not  provide supporting evidence for the efficacy of FFNS in subjects with uncomplicated ARS. The difference in the median time to symptom improvement between each regimen of FFNS and placebo was 1 day (8 days for the placebo group and 7 days for each FFNS group) and it was not statistically significant.

-  Safety results: The incidence of AEs during the treatment period was similar across the three  treatment  groups  (17-18%)  (Table  16).  SOCs  with  the  highest  incidence  of  AEs ( ≥ 5%  in  at  least  one  treatment  group)  included  Infections  and  Infestations  (5-6%), Nervous System Disorders (2-6%), and Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (4-5%).  The  incidence  of  nervous  system  disorders  was  slightly  higher  in  the  FFNS groups (4% QD, 6% BID) compared with the placebo group (2%).

1.One subject in the placeko group (Subject 224) was not diagnosed with FBRS and did not receive antibiotic.

Most of the AEs reported during this study occurred in subjects ≥ 18 years old: 17% placebo, 18% FFNS 110 mcg QD, and 19% FFNS 110 mcg BID  and were similar to the ITT Population. Four  subjects  in  the  adolescent  age  group  (n=43)  reported  AEs  which  included  headache  (1 subject in the placebo group and 2 subjects in the FFNS 110 mcg BID group) and gastritis (1 subject in the FFNS 110 mcg QD group).

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

## STUDY- FFU111439 -

Results  of  this  study  showed  once-daily  fluticasone  furoate  110  mcg  aqueous  nasal  spray produced  greater  reductions  from  baseline  in  subjects'  self-assessed,  allergy  nasal  symptom scores as compared with placebo nasal spray. These reductions were inferentially significant for the  primary  endpoint  (rTNSS)  as  well  as  for  the  key  secondary  nasal  symptom  endpoint (iTNSS).

A significant difference between the study treatments was not seen for the key secondary ocular symptom endpoint (rTOSS) or for other ocular symptom endpoints, including any of the three individual ocular symptoms (eyes itching/burning, eyes tearing/watering, and eye redness).

The summary of AE for age group 12 to &lt;18 (n=9) was presented.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## STUDY - FFR113342 -

The efficacy  results  in  this  study  were  similar  to  the  studies  conducted  in  USA,  Europe,  and Japan. There are not specified efficacy and safety data on participants by age group.

## STUDY FFR111158 -

This pilot study demonstrated a lack of efficacy of FFNS in the treatment of IR developed by air pollution in Bangkok. The safety findings of this study showed fluticasone furoate 110mcg once daily  to  be  well  tolerated  in  population  included  to  the  study.  Only  three  participants  were adolescent (12-18 yrs).

## STUDY FFS113203 -

Due to small number of participants aged 12-18 yrs (n=43) the results did not provide supporting evidence for the efficacy of the product in the treatment of uncomplicated ARS in this population. The safety data for this population collected in this study confirmed known safety profile of FFNS without any unexpected adverse event.

## V. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

##  Overall conclusion

The efficacy data from two presented studies in AR support the current indication. It must be acknowledged that safety data from paediatric population are not complete because  study nr 113342 does not state how many children were included in the study, and there is no summary of adverse events in paediatric population (n=43) in study nr 113203. Summary of safety from other two studies do not reveal any special risk in this population.  The rapporteurs conclude that no changes in the product information are required.

No further action required

## VI. REQUEST FOR SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
