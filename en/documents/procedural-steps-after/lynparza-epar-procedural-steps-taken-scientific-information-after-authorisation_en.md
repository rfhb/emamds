The study enrolled 16 patients aged ≥ 6 years to < 18 years with a homologous recombination repair (HRR) deficiency or HRR gene mutation via local test or gBRCA mutation via central test. Lynparza was administered as a single dose on day 1, followed by twice daily in a continuous schedule. Of the 16 patients enrolled, 13 patients aged ≥ 12 years to < 18 years received 300 mg of olaparib tablet twice daily and 3 patients aged ≥ 6 years to < 12 years received 200 mg of olaparib tablet twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. There was no objective response observed in the 12 participants enrolled with measurable disease at baseline. In summary, the results of the study did not allow to conclude that the benefits of Lynparza in children and adolescents outweigh the risks. The safety and efficacy of Lynparza in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years has not been established   |
