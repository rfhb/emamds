## Interactions

Recommendations regarding use of Calquence with CYP3A inhibitors or inducers and gastric acid reducing agents are provided in Table 3 (see section 4.5).

Table 3. Use with CYP3A inhibitors or inducers and gastric acid reducing agents

|                              | Co-administered medicinal product   | Recommended Calquence use                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CYP3A inhibitors             | Strong CYP3A inhibitor              | Avoid concomitant use. If these inhibitors will be used short-term (such as anti-infectives for up to seven days), interrupt Calquence. |
| CYP3A inhibitors             | Moderate CYP3A inhibitor            | No dose adjustment. Monitor patients closely for adverse reactions if taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors.                                 |
| CYP3A inhibitors             | Mild CYP3A inhibitor                | No dose adjustment.                                                                                                                     |
| CYP3A inducers               | Strong CYP3A inducer                | Avoid concomitant use.                                                                                                                  |

| Gastric acid reducing agents | H2-receptor antagonists             | Take Calquence 2 hours before (or 10 hours after) taking a H2-receptor antagonist.                                                      |
| Gastric acid reducing agents | Antacids                            | The interval between taking the medicinal products should be at least 2 hours.                                                          |

## Missed dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If a patient misses a dose of Calquence by more than 3 hours, the patient should be instructed to take the next dose at its regularly scheduled time. Double dose of Calquence should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years) (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No specific clinical studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment were treated in Calquence clinical studies. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (greater than 30 mL/min creatinine clearance). Hydration should be maintained, and serum creatinine levels monitored periodically. Calquence should be administered to patients with severe renal impairment (&lt; 30mL/min creatinine clearance) only if the benefit outweighs the risk and these patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity. There are no data in patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, Child-Pugh B, or total bilirubin between 1.5-3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] and any AST). However, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity. It is not recommended to use Calquence in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C or total bilirubin &gt;3-times ULN and any AST) (see section 5.2).

## Severe cardiac disease

Patients with severe cardiovascular disease were excluded from Calquence clinical studies.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Calquence in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Calquence is for oral use. The capsules should be swallowed whole with water at approximately the same time each day, with or without food (see section 4.5). The capsules should not be chewed, dissolved or opened as this may affect the absorption of the medicinal product into the body.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Haemorrhage

Major haemorrhagic events including central nervous system and gastrointestinal haemorrhage, some with fatal outcome, have occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in combination with other medicinal products. These events have occurred in patients both with and without thrombocytopenia. Overall, the bleeding events were less severe events including bruising and petechiae (see section 4.8).

The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood.

Patients receiving antithrombotic agents may be at increased risk of haemorrhage. Caution should be used with antithrombotic agents and additional monitoring considered for signs of bleeding when concomitant use is medically necessary. Warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with Calquence.

Consider the benefit-risk of withholding Calquence for at least 3 days pre- and post-surgery.

## Infections

Serious infections (bacterial, viral or fungal), including fatal events, have occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in combination with other medicinal products. These infections predominantly occurred in the absence of neutropenia, with neutropenic infection reported in 10.1% of patients receiving monotherapy and 26.8% in patients receiving combination therapy. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and herpes zoster virus (HZV) reactivation, aspergillosis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred (see section 4.8).

## Viral reactivation

Cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in patients receiving Calquence. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) status should be established before initiating treatment with Calquence. If patients have positive hepatitis B serology, a liver disease expert should be consulted before the start of treatment and the patient should be monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation.

Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) including fatal ones have been reported following the use of Calquence within the context of a prior or concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, then appropriate diagnostic evaluations should be undertaken and treatment with Calquence should be suspended until PML is excluded. If any doubt exists, referral to a neurologist and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments should be considered.

Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat as medically appropriate.

## Cytopenias

Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia, occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

combination with other medicinal products. Monitor complete blood counts as medically indicated (see section 4.8) .

## Second primary malignancies

Second primary malignancies, including skin and non-skin cancers, occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in combination with other medicinal products. Skin cancers were commonly reported. Monitor patients for the appearance of skin cancers and advise protection from sun exposure (see section 4.8).

## Atrial fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation/flutter occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in combination with other medicinal products. Monitor for symptoms (e.g., palpitations, dizziness, syncope, chest pain, dyspnoea) of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and obtain an ECG as medically indicated (see sections 4.5 and 4.2). In patients who develop atrial fibrillation on therapy with Calquence, a thorough assessment of the risk for thromboembolic disease should be undertaken. In patients at high risk for thromboembolic disease, tightly controlled treatment with anticoagulants and alternative treatment options to Calquence should be considered.

## Tumour lysis syndrome

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported with Calquence therapy. Patients considered at risk for TLS (e.g., presence of bulky disease at baseline) should be assessed for possible risk of TLS and closely monitored as clinically indicated.

## Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis

Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis has been reported in patients treated with Calquence in combination with bendamustine and rituximab in MCL. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. cough, dyspnea or hypoxia) and manage ILD/pneumonitis as clinically indicated.

## Other medicinal products

Co-administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors with Calquence may lead to increased acalabrutinib exposure and consequently a higher risk for toxicity. On the contrary, co-administration of CYP3A inducers may lead to decreased acalabrutinib exposure and consequently a risk for lack of efficacy. Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If these inhibitors will be used short-term (such as anti-infectives for up to seven days), treatment with Calquence should be interrupted. Patients should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity if a moderate CYP3A inhibitor is used (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided due to risk for lack of efficacy.

## Calquence contains sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), and both substances are substrates for P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).

## Active substances that may increase acalabrutinib plasma concentrations

## CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors

Co-administration with a strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor (200 mg itraconazole once daily for 5 days) increased acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 3.9-fold and 5.0-fold in healthy subjects (N=17), respectively.

Concomitant use with strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors should be avoided. If the strong CYP3A/ P-gp inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, conivaptan, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ritonavir, telaprevir, posaconazole, voriconazole) will be used short-term, treatment with Calquence should be interrupted (see section 4.2).

Co-administration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (400 mg fluconazole as single dose or 200 mg isavuconazole as repeated dose for 5 days) in healthy subjects increased acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 1.4-fold to 2-fold while the active metabolite ACP-5862 Cmax and AUC was decreased by 0.65-fold to 0.88-fold relative to when acalabrutinib was dosed alone. No dose adjustment is required in combination with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Monitor patients closely for adverse reactions (see Section 4.2).

## Active substances that may decrease acalabrutinib plasma concentrations

## CYP3A inducers

Co--administration of a strong CYP3A inducer (600 mg rifampicin once daily for 9 days) decreased acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 68% and 77% in healthy subjects (N=24), respectively.

Concomitant use with strong inducers of CYP3A activity (e.g., phenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine) should be avoided. Concomitant treatment with St. John's wort, which may unpredictably decrease acalabrutinib plasma concentrations, should be avoided.

## Gastric acid reducing medicinal products

Acalabrutinib solubility decreases with increasing pH. Co-administration of acalabrutinib with an antacid (1 g calcium carbonate) decreased acalabrutinib AUC by 53% in healthy subjects. Co-administration with a proton pump inhibitor (40 mg omeprazole for 5 days) decreased acalabrutinib AUC by 43%.

If treatment with an acid reducing agent is required, consider using an antacid (e.g., calcium carbonate), or an H2-receptor antagonist (e.g., ranitidine or famotidine). For use with antacids, the interval between taking the medicinal products should be at least 2 hours (see section 4.2). For H2-receptor antagonists, Calquence should be taken 2 hours before (or 10 hours after) taking the H2-receptor antagonist. Due to the long-lasting effect of proton pump inhibitors, separation of doses with proton pump inhibitors may not eliminate the interaction with Calquence and therefore concomitant use should be avoided (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Active substances whose plasma concentrations may be altered by Calquence

## CYP3A substrates

Based on in vitro data, it cannot be excluded that acalabrutinib is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 at the intestinal level and may increase the exposure of CYP3A4 substrates sensitive to gut CYP3A metabolism. Caution should be exercised if co-administering acalabrutinib with CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic range administered orally (e.g., cyclosporine, ergotamine, pimozide).

## Effect of acalabrutinib on CYP1A2 substrates

In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib induces CYP1A2. Co-administration of acalabrutinib with CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline, caffeine) may decrease their exposure.

## Effects of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, on medicinal product transport systems

Acalabrutinib may increase exposure to co-administered BCRP substrates (e.g., methotrexate) by inhibition of intestinal BCRP (see section 5.2). To minimise the potential for an interaction in the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract, oral narrow therapeutic range BCRP substrates such as methotrexate should be taken at least 6 hours before or after acalabrutinib.

ACP-5862 may increase exposure to co-administered MATE1 substrates (e.g., metformin) by inhibition of MATE1 (see section 5.2). Patients taking concomitant medicinal products with disposition dependent upon MATE1 (e.g., metformin) should be monitored for signs of changed tolerability as a result of increased exposure of the concomitant medication whilst receiving Calquence.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving Calquence.

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of acalabrutinib in pregnant women. Based on findings from animal studies, there may be a risk to the foetus from exposure to acalabrutinib during pregnancy. Dystocia (difficult or prolonged labour) was observed in the rat and administration to pregnant rabbits was associated with reduced foetal growth (see section 5.3).

Calquence should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with acalabrutinib.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether acalabrutinib is excreted in human milk. There are no data on the effect of acalabrutinib on the breast-fed child or on milk production. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were present in the milk of lactating rats. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding mothers are advised not to breast-feed during treatment with Calquence and for 2 days after receiving the last dose.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effect of Calquence on human fertility. In a non-clinical study of acalabrutinib in male and female rats, no adverse effects on fertility parameters were observed (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Calquence has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, during treatment with acalabrutinib, fatigue and dizziness have been reported and patients who experience these symptoms should be advised not to drive or use machines until symptoms abate.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The below tables present adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified in clinical studies with patients receiving Calquence monotherapy or combination therapy for haematological malignancies. The median duration of Calquence monotherapy treatment across the pooled dataset was 38.2 months. The median duration of Calquence treatment in patients treated with Calquence in combination with bendamustine and rituximab was 28.6 months. The median duration of Calquence treatment in patients treated with Calquence in combination with venetoclax with or without obinutuzumab was 12.9 months.

Adverse drug reactions are listed according to system organ class (SOC) in MedDRA. Within each system organ class, the adverse drug reactions are sorted by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each ADR is defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Of the 1 478 patients in clinical studies of Calquence monotherapy, 42% were greater than 65 years and less than 75 years of age and 20.6% were 75 years of age or older. No clinically relevant differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients ≥ 65 years and younger.

Of the 223 patients in clinical studies of Calquence in combination of obinutuzumab therapy, 47% were greater than 65 years and less than 75 years of age and 26% were 75 years of age or older. No clinically relevant differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients ≥ 65 years and younger.

Of the 291 patients treated with Calquence in combination with venetoclax, 28.9% were greater than 65 years and less than 75 years of age and 4.5% were 75 years of age or older. No clinically relevant differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients ≥ 65 years and younger.

Of the 284 patients treated with Calquence in combination with venetoclax and obinutuzumab, 24% were greater than 65 years and less than 75 years of age and 6.3% were 75 years of age or older. No clinically relevant differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients ≥ 65 years and younger.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no specific treatment for acalabrutinib overdose and symptoms of overdose have not been established. In the event of an overdose, patients must be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EL02.

## Mechanism of action

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Acalabrutinib is a selective inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). BTK is a signalling molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B-cells, BTK signalling results in B-cell survival and proliferation, and is required for cellular adhesion, trafficking, and chemotaxis.

Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to irreversible inactivation of BTK with minimal off-target interactions.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

In patients with B-cell malignancies dosed with acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily, median steady-state BTK occupancy of ≥ 95% in peripheral blood was maintained over 12 hours, resulting in inactivation of BTK throughout the recommended dosing interval.

## Cardiac electrophysiology

The effect of acalabrutinib on the QTc interval was evaluated in 46 healthy male and female subjects in a randomised, double-blind thorough QT study with placebo and positive controls. At a supratherapeutic dose, 4-times the maximum recommended dose, Calquence did not prolong the QT/QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent (e.g., not greater than or equal to 10 ms) (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.3).

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Patients with previously untreated CLL

## Calquence monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab

The safety and efficacy of Calquence monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab in previously untreated CLL were evaluated in a randomised, multi-centre, open-label Phase 3 study (ELEVATE-TN) of 535 patients. Patients received Calquence plus obinutuzumab, Calquence monotherapy, or obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil. Patients 65 years of age or older, or between 18 and 65 years of age with coexisting medical conditions, were included in ELEVATE-TN, 27.9% patients had a CrCl of &lt; 60 mL/min. Of the patients who were &lt; 65 years of age, 16.1% had a median CIRS-G score of 8. The study allowed patients to receive antithrombotic agents. Patients who required anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists were excluded.

Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 arms to receive:

- Calquence plus obinutuzumab (Calquence+G): Calquence 100 mg was administered twice daily starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Obinutuzumab was administered starting on Cycle 2 Day 1 for a maximum of 6 treatment cycles. Obinutuzumab 1 000 mg was administered on Days 1 and 2 (100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 2), 8 and 15 of Cycle 2 followed by 1 000 mg on Day 1 of Cycles 3 up to 7. Each cycle was 28 days.
- Calquence monotherapy: Calquence 100 mg was administered twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
- Obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil (GClb): Obinutuzumab and chlorambucil were administered for a maximum of 6 treatment cycles. Obinutuzumab 1,000 mg was administered on Days 1 and 2 (100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 2), 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 followed by 1 000 mg on Day 1 of Cycles 2 up to 6. Chlorambucil 0.5 mg/kg was administered on Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 1 up to 6. Each cycle was 28 days.

Patients were stratified by 17p deletion mutation status (presence versus absence), ECOG performance status (0 or 1 versus 2) and geographic region (North America and Western Europe versus Other). After

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) of Calquence+G arm versus GClb arm as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (IWCLL) 2008 criteria with incorporation of the clarification for treatment-related lymphocytosis (Cheson 2012). With a median follow-up of 28.3 months, PFS by IRC indicated a 90% statistically significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for previously untreated CLL patients in the Calquence+G arm compared to the GClb arm. Efficacy results are presented in Table 7.

Patients with previously untreated CLL - Fixed duration therapy

Calquence in combination with venetoclax with or without obinutuzumab

The safety and efficacy of Calquence in combination with venetoclax with or without obinutuzumab in previously untreated CLL was evaluated in a randomised, multi-centre, open-label Phase 3 study (AMPLIFY) of 867 patients. Patients received Calquence plus venetoclax, Calquence plus venetoclax and obinutuzumab, or Investigator's choice of chemoimmunotherapy, either FCR (fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide plus rituximab) or BR (bendamustine plus rituximab). AMPLIFY included patients previously untreated for CLL without del(17p) or TP53 mutation that were 18 years of age and older. The trial allowed patients to receive antithrombotic agents except warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 arms to receive:

- Calquence plus venetoclax (AV): Calquence 100 mg was administered twice daily starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 for a total of 14 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. On Cycle 3 Day 1 patients started the venetoclax 5-week dose-titration schedule, starting at 20 mg and increasing weekly to 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and finally 400 mg once daily. Venetoclax was administered for a total of 12 cycles. Each cycle was 28 days.
- Calquence plus venetoclax plus obinutuzumab (AVO): Calquence 100 mg was administered twice daily starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 for a total of 14 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. On Cycle 3 Day 1 patients started the venetoclax 5-week dose-titration schedule, starting at 20 mg and increasing weekly to 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and finally 400 mg once daily. Venetoclax was administered for a total of 12 cycles. Obinutuzumab 1 000 mg was administered on Day 1 or Day 1 and 2 (100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 1 or 2), 8 and 15 of Cycle 2 followed by 1 000 mg on Day 1 of Cycles 3-7. Each cycle was 28 days.
- Investigator's choice of chemoimmunotherapy (FCR/BR):
- o Fludarabine plus cyclophosphamyde plus rituximab (FCR): Fludarabine (25 mg/m 2 ) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m 2 ) were administered on Days 1-3 up to a maximum of 6 cycles. Rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 on Day 1 Cycle 1 and 500 mg/m 2  on Day 1 of Cycles 2 up to 6. Each cycle was 28 days.
- o Bendamustine plus rituximab (BR): Bendamustine 90 mg/m 2  was administered on Days 1 and 2 up to maximum of 6 cycles. Rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 on Day 1 Cycle 1 and 500 mg/m 2  on Day 1 of Cycles 2 up to 6. Each cycle was 28 days.

Patients were stratified by age (&gt; 65 years or ≤ 65 years), IGHV mutational status (mutated versus unmutated), Rai stage (high risk [≥ 3] versus non-high risk) and geographic region (North America and Western Europe versus other).

## Patients with CLL who received at least one prior therapy

The safety and efficacy of Calquence in relapsed or refractory CLL were evaluated in a randomised, multi-centre, open-label phase 3 study (ASCEND) of 310 patients who received at least one prior therapy not including BCL-2 inhibitors or B-cell receptor inhibitors. Patients received Calquence monotherapy or investigator's choice of either idelalisib plus rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab. The study allowed patients to receive antithrombotic agents. Patients who required anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists were excluded.

Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either:

- Calquence 100 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or
- Investigator's choice:
- o Idelalisib 150 mg twice daily in combination with rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of the first cycle, followed by 500 mg/m2 IV every 2 weeks for 4 doses, then every 4 weeks for 3 doses for a total of 8 infusions
- o Bendamustine 70 mg/m 2  (Day 1 and 2 of each 28-day cycle) in combination with rituximab (375 mg/m 2 /500 mg/m 2 ) on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles

Patients were stratified by 17p deletion mutation status (presence versus absence), ECOG performance status (0 or 1 versus 2) and number of prior therapies (1 to 3 versus ≥ 4). After confirmed disease progression, 35 patients randomised on investigator's choice of either idelalisib plus rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab crossed over to Calquence. Table 12 summarizes the baseline demographics and disease characteristics of the study population.

The primary endpoint was PFS as assessed by IRC IWCLL 2008 criteria with incorporation of the clarification for treatment-related lymphocytosis (Cheson 2012). With a median follow-up of 16.1 months, PFS indicated a 69% statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression for patients in the Calquence arm. Efficacy results are presented in Table 13. The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 3.

At final analysis, with a median follow-up of 46.5 months for Calquence and 45.3 months for the IR/BR, a 72% reduction in risk of investigator-assessed disease progression or death was observed for patients in the Calquence arm. The median investigator assessed PFS was not reached in Calquence and was 16.8 months in IR/BR. Efficacy results per Investigator Assessments (INV) are presented in Table 15. The Kaplan-Meier curve for INV assessed PFS is shown in Figure 4.

Investigator assessed PFS results at final analysis for Calquence were consistent across subgroups, including high risk features and were consistent with the primary analysis.

## Patients with previously untreated MCL

The safety and efficacy of Calquence in patients with previously untreated MCL was evaluated in ECHO, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, phase 3 study. ECHO included 598 patients 65 years of age and older with confirmed MCL that was previously untreated. Patients were randomised in 1:1 ratio in 2 arms to receive:

- Calquence plus bendamustine and rituximab (Calquence + BR) arm: Calquence 100 mg was administered twice daily from Day 1 of Cycle 1, continuously. Bendamustine, 90 mg/m 2 , was intravenously administered over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of each of six 28-day cycles; and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rituximab, 375 mg/m 2 , was intravenously administered on Day 1 of each cycle of six 28-day cycles. Calquence + BR was administered for a maximum of 6 treatment cycles (induction treatment).

- Placebo plus bendamustine and rituximab (Placebo + BR) arm: Placebo was administered twice daily from Day 1 of Cycle 1, continuously. Bendamustine, 90 mg/m 2 , was intravenously administered over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of each of six 28-day cycles; and rituximab, 375 mg/m 2 , was intravenously administered on Day 1 of each cycle of six 28-day cycles. Placebo + BR was administered for a maximum of 6 treatment cycles (induction treatment).

Calquence or placebo was administered continuously until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After the induction treatment, patients who were achieving a response (PR or CR) received rituximab maintenance at 375 mg/m 2  on Day 1 of every other cycle for maximum of 12 additional doses up to Cycle 30. Patients randomised to placebo + BR arm who had confirmed PD were eligible to cross over to Calquence monotherapy at 100 mg twice daily dose until their second disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patient randomisation was stratified by geographic region (North America versus Western Europe versus Other) and simplified MIPI (Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index) score (0-3 versus 4-5 versus 6-11).

The median age was 71 years (65-86), 70.7% were males, 78.3% were Caucasians, 93.1% had an ECOG performance status of 0-1. The simplified MIPI score was low (0-3) in 33.1%, intermediate (4-5) in 42.8% and high (6-11) in 24.1% of patients. A total of 37.7% of patients had tumour bulk ≥ 5 cm and 86% had Ann Arbor stage IV disease. Aggressive variants of MCL such as blastoid and pleomorphic forms were seen in 7.7% and 5.5% of patients respectively. A total of 47.8% patients had Ki-67 score of ≥ 30%. The baseline characteristics were similar for both arms.

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) per 2014 Lugano Classification for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in subjects with previously untreated MCL. Additionally, overall response rate (ORR) was also assessed by an IRC.

IRC-assessed PFS was assessed at a median follow-up of 49.8 months.

With an additional 6 months of follow-up from the primary PFS analysis, and a median follow-up of 63.0 months, the median overall survival had not been reached in either arm. There were a total of 218 deaths: 105 (35.1%) in the Calquence + BR arm and 113 (37.8%) in the placebo + BR arm. Efficacy results are presented in Table 16. The Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS are shown in Figure 5.

## Patients with MCL who received at least one prior therapy

The safety and efficacy of CALQUENCE in MCL were evaluated in an open-label, multi-centre, single-arm Phase 2 study (ACE-LY-004) of 124 previously treated patients. All patients received CALQUENCE 100 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial did not include patients who received prior treatment with either BTK or BCL-2 inhibitors. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR) per the Lugano classification for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Duration of Response (DoR) was an additional outcome measure. Efficacy results at final (54 months) analysis are presented in Table 17.

At final analysis, the median age was 68 (range 42 to 90) years, 79.8% were male and 74.2% were Caucasian. At baseline, 92.8% of patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The median time since diagnosis was 46.3 months and the median number of prior treatments was 2 (range 1 to 5), including 17.7% with prior stem cell transplant. The most common prior regimens were CHOP-based (51.6%) and ARA-C (33.9%). At baseline, 37.1% of patients had at least one tumour with a longest diameter ≥ 5 cm, 72.6% had extra nodal involvement including 50.8% with bone marrow involvement. The simplified MIPI score (which includes age, ECOG score, and baseline lactate dehydrogenase and white cell count) was intermediate in 43.5% and high in 16.9% of patients.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Calquence in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of mature B-cell neoplasms (for information on paediatric use, see section 4.2).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, were studied in healthy subjects and in patients with B-cell malignancies. Acalabrutinib exhibits dose-proportionality, and both acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 exhibit almost linear PK across a dose range of 75 to 250 mg. Population PK modelling suggests that the PK of acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 is similar across patients with different B-cell malignancies. At the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily in patients with B-cell malignancies (including, CLL), the geometric mean steady state daily area under the plasma concentration over time curve (AUC24h) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for acalabrutinib were 1679 ng·h/mL and 438 ng/mL, respectively, and for ACP-5862 were 4166 ng·h/mL and 446 ng/mL, respectively.

## Absorption

The time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) was 0.5-1.5 hours for acalabrutinib, and 1.0 hour for ACP-5862. The absolute bioavailability of Calquence was 25%.

## Effect of food on acalabrutinib

In healthy subjects, administration of a single 75 mg dose of acalabrutinib with a high fat, high calorie meal (approximately 918 calories, 59 grams carbohydrate, 59 grams fat and 39 grams protein) did not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

affect the mean AUC as compared to dosing under fasted conditions. Resulting Cmax decreased by 69% and Tmax was delayed 1-2 hours.

## Distribution

Reversible binding to human plasma protein was 99.4% for acalabrutinib and 98.8% for ACP-5862. The in vitro mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.8 for acalabrutinib and 0.7 for ACP-5862. The mean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) was approximately 34 L for acalabrutinib.

## Biotransformation/Metabolism

In vitro , acalabrutinib is predominantly metabolised by CYP3A enzymes, and to a minor extent by glutathione conjugation and amide hydrolysis. ACP-5862 was identified as the major metabolite in plasma, that was further metabolized primarily by CYP3A-mediated oxidation, with a geometric mean exposure (AUC) that was approximately 2 to 3-fold higher than the exposure of acalabrutinib. ACP-5862 is approximately 50% less potent than acalabrutinib with regard to BTK inhibition.

In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations and is unlikely to affect clearance of substrates of these CYPs.

In vitro studies indicate that ACP-5862 does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations and is unlikely to affect clearance of substrates of these CYPs.

## Interactions with transport proteins

In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 are P-gp and BCRP substrates. Co-administration with BCRP inhibitors is however unlikely to result in clinically relevant drug interactions. Co-administration with an OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitor (600 mg rifampin, single dose) resulted in an increase in acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 1.2-fold and 1.4-fold (N=24, healthy subjects), respectively, which is not clinically relevant.

Acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 do not inhibit P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. Acalabrutinib may inhibit intestinal BCRP, while ACP-5862 may inhibit MATE1 at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 4.5). Acalabrutinib does not inhibit MATE1, while ACP-5862 does not inhibit BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations.

## Elimination

Following a single oral dose of 100 mg acalabrutinib, the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of acalabrutinib was 1 to 2 hours. The t1/2 of the active metabolite, ACP-5862, was approximately 7 hours.

The mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 134 L/hr for acalabrutinib and 22 L/hr for ACP-5862 in patients with B-cell malignancies.

Following administration of a single 100 mg radiolabelled [ 14 C]-acalabrutinib dose in healthy subjects, 84% of the dose was recovered in the faeces and 12% of the dose was recovered in the urine, with less than 2% of the dose excreted as unchanged acalabrutinib.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

Based on population PK analysis, age (&gt; 18 years of age), sex, race (Caucasian, African American) and body weight did not have clinically meaningful effects on the PK of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862.

## Paediatric population

No pharmacokinetic studies were performed with Calquence in patients under 18 years of age.

## Renal impairment

Acalabrutinib undergoes minimal renal elimination. A pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal impairment has not been conducted.

Based on population PK analysis, no clinically relevant PK difference was observed in 408 subjects with mild renal impairment (eGFR between 60 and 89 mL/min/1.73m 2  as estimated by MDRD), 109 subjects with moderate renal impairment (eGFR between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) relative to 192 subjects with normal renal function (eGFR greater than or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). The pharmacokinetics of acalabrutinib has not been characterised in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or renal impairment requiring dialysis. Patients with creatinine levels greater than 2.5 times the institutional ULN were not included in the clinical studies (see section 4.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Acalabrutinib is metabolised in the liver. In dedicated hepatic impairment (HI) studies, compared to subjects with normal liver function (N=6), acalabrutinib exposure (AUC) was increased by 1.9-fold, 1.5-fold and 5.3-fold in subjects with mild (N=6) (Child-Pugh A), moderate (N=6) (Child-Pugh B) and severe (N=8) (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, respectively. Subjects in the moderate HI group were however not significantly affected in markers relevant for the elimination capacity of drugs, so the effect of moderate hepatic impairment was likely underestimated in this study. Based on a population PK analysis, no clinically relevant difference was observed between subjects with mild (N=79) or moderate (N=6) hepatic impairment (total bilirubin between 1.5 to 3-times ULN and any AST) relative to subjects with normal (N=613) hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST within ULN) (see section 4.2).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with acalabrutinib.

## Genotoxicity/Mutagenicity/Phototoxicity

Acalabrutinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay, in an in vitro chromosome aberration assay or in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.

Based on phototoxicity assays using 3T3 cell line in vitro , acalabrutinib is considered to have a low risk for phototoxicity in humans.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Repeat-dose toxicity

In rats, microscopic findings of minimal to mild severity were observed in the pancreas (haemorrhage/pigment/inflammation/fibrosis in islets) at all dose levels. Non-adverse findings of minimal to mild severity in the kidneys (tubular basophilia, tubular regeneration, and inflammation) were observed in studies of up to 6-month duration with a No Observed Adverse Effect level (NOAEL) of 30 mg/kg/day in rats. The mean exposures (AUC) at the NOAEL in male and female rats correspond to 0.6x and 1x, respectively, the clinical exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily, respectively. The Lowest Adverse Observed Effect Level (LOAEL) at which reversible renal (moderate tubular degeneration) and liver (individual hepatocyte necrosis) findings were observed in the chronic rat study was 100 mg/kg/day and provided an exposure margin 4.2-times greater than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily. In studies of 9 months duration in dogs, the NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day corresponding to an exposure 3-times the clinical AUC at the recommended clinical dose. Minimal tubular degeneration in kidney, slight decreases in spleen weights and transient minimal to mild decreases in red cell mass and increases in ALT and ALP were observed at 30 mg/kg/day (9-times the clinical AUC) in dogs. Cardiac toxicities in rats (myocardial haemorrhage, inflammation, necrosis) and dogs (perivascular/vascular inflammation) were observed only in animals that died during studies at doses above the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The exposures in rats and dogs with cardiac findings was at least 6.8-times and 25-times the clinical AUC, respectively. Reversibility for the heart findings could not be assessed as these findings were only observed at doses above the MTD.

## Reproductive toxicology

No effects on fertility were observed in male or female rats at exposures 10 or 9-times the clinical AUC at the recommended dose, respectively.

No effects on embryofoetal development and survival were observed in pregnant rats, at exposures approximately 9-times the AUC in patients at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily. In two rat reproductive studies, dystocia (prolonged/difficult labour) was observed at exposures &gt;2.3-times the clinical exposure at 100 mg twice daily. The presence of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were confirmed in foetal rat plasma. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were present in the milk of lactating rats.

In an embryofoetal study in pregnant rabbits, decreased foetal body weight and delayed ossification were observed at exposure levels that produced maternal toxicity which were 2.4-times greater than the human AUC at the recommended dose.

## Interactions

Recommendations regarding use of Calquence with CYP3A inhibitors or inducers are provided in Table 3 (see section 4.5).

Table 3. Use with CYP3A inhibitors or inducers

|                  | Co-administered medicinal product   | Recommended Calquence use                                                                                                               |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CYP3A inhibitors | Strong CYP3A inhibitor              | Avoid concomitant use. If these inhibitors will be used short-term (such as anti-infectives for up to seven days), interrupt Calquence. |
| CYP3A inhibitors | Moderate CYP3A inhibitor            | No dose adjustment. Monitor patients closely for adverse reactions if taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors.                                 |
| CYP3A inhibitors | Mild CYP3A inhibitor                | No dose adjustment.                                                                                                                     |
| CYP3A inducers   | Strong CYP3A inducer                | Avoid concomitant use.                                                                                                                  |

Acalabrutinib tablets can be co-administered with gastric acid reducing agents (proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, antacids), unlike acalabrutinib capsules which show impaired uptake when given with acid reducing agents (see section 4.5).

## Missed dose

If a patient misses a dose of Calquence by more than 3 hours, the patient should be instructed to take the next dose at its regularly scheduled time. Double dose of Calquence should not be taken to make up for a missed dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years) (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No specific clinical studies have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment were treated in Calquence clinical studies. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (greater than 30 mL/min creatinine clearance). Hydration should be maintained, and serum creatinine levels monitored periodically. Calquence should be administered to patients with severe renal impairment (&lt; 30 mL/min creatinine clearance) only if the benefit outweighs the risk and these patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity. There are no data in patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, Child-Pugh B, or total bilirubin between 1.5-3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] and any AST). However, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity. It is not recommended to use Calquence in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C or total bilirubin &gt; 3-times ULN and any AST) (see section 5.2).

## Severe cardiac disease

Patients with severe cardiovascular disease were excluded from Calquence clinical studies.

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Calquence in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

Calquence is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with water at approximately the same time each day, with or without food (see section 4.5). The tablets should not be chewed, crushed, dissolved or divided.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Haemorrhage

Major haemorrhagic events including central nervous system and gastrointestinal haemorrhage, some with fatal outcome, have occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in combination with other medicinal products. These events have occurred in patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

both with and without thrombocytopenia. Overall, the bleeding events were less severe events including bruising and petechiae (see section 4.8).

The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood.

Patients receiving antithrombotic agents may be at increased risk of haemorrhage. Caution should be used with antithrombotic agents and additional monitoring considered for signs of bleeding when concomitant use is medically necessary. Warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with Calquence.

Consider the benefit-risk of withholding Calquence for at least 3 days pre- and post-surgery.

## Infections

Serious infections (bacterial, viral or fungal), including fatal events, have occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in combination with other medicinal products. These infections predominantly occurred in the absence of neutropenia, with neutropenic infection reported in 10.1% of patients receiving monotherapy and 26.8% in patients receiving combination therapy. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and herpes zoster virus (HZV) reactivation, aspergillosis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred (see section 4.8).

## Viral reactivation

Cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in patients receiving Calquence. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) status should be established before initiating treatment with Calquence. If patients have positive hepatitis B serology, a liver disease expert should be consulted before the start of treatment and the patient should be monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation.

Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) including fatal ones have been reported following the use of Calquence within the context of a prior or concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, then appropriate diagnostic evaluations should be undertaken and treatment with Calquence should be suspended until PML is excluded. If any doubt exists, referral to a neurologist and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML including MRI scan preferably with contrast, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments should be considered.

Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat as medically appropriate.

## Cytopenias

Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia, occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in combination with other medicinal products. Monitor complete blood counts as medically indicated (see section 4.8) .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Second primary malignancies

Second primary malignancies, including skin and non-skin cancers, occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in combination with other medicinal products. Skin cancers were commonly reported. Monitor patients for the appearance of skin cancers and advise protection from sun exposure (see section 4.8).

## Atrial fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation/flutter occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies treated with Calquence monotherapy and in combination with other medicinal products. Monitor for symptoms (e.g., palpitations, dizziness, syncope, chest pain, dyspnoea) of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and obtain an ECG as medically indicated (see sections 4.5 and 4.2). In patients who develop atrial fibrillation on therapy with Calquence, a thorough assessment of the risk for thromboembolic disease should be undertaken. In patients at high risk for thromboembolic disease, tightly controlled treatment with anticoagulants and alternative treatment options to Calquence should be considered.

## Tumour lysis syndrome

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported with Calquence therapy. Patients considered at risk for TLS (e.g., presence of bulky disease at baseline) should be assessed for possible risk of TLS and closely monitored as clinically indicated.

## Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis

Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis has been reported in patients treated with Calquence in combination with bendamustine and rituximab in MCL. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. cough, dyspnea or hypoxia) and manage ILD/pneumonitis as clinically indicated.

## Other medicinal products

Co-administration of strong CYP3A inhibitors with Calquence may lead to increased acalabrutinib exposure and consequently a higher risk for toxicity. On the contrary, co-administration of CYP3A inducers may lead to decreased acalabrutinib exposure and consequently a risk for lack of efficacy. Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If these inhibitors will be used short-term (such as anti-infectives for up to seven days), treatment with Calquence should be interrupted. Patients should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity if a moderate CYP3A inhibitor is used (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided due to risk for lack of efficacy.

## Calquence contains sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite are primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), and both substances are substrates for P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Active substances that may increase acalabrutinib plasma concentrations

## CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors

Co-administration with a strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor (200 mg itraconazole once daily for 5 days) increased acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 3.9-fold and 5.0-fold in healthy subjects (N=17), respectively.

Concomitant use with strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors should be avoided. If the strong CYP3A/ P-gp inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, conivaptan, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ritonavir, telaprevir, posaconazole, voriconazole) will be used short-term, treatment with Calquence should be interrupted (see section 4.2).

Co-administration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (400 mg fluconazole as single dose or 200 mg isavuconazole as repeated dose for 5 days) in healthy subjects increased acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 1.4-fold to 2-fold while the active metabolite ACP-5862 Cmax and AUC was decreased by 0.65-fold to 0.88-fold relative to when acalabrutinib was dosed alone. No dose adjustment is required in combination with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Monitor patients closely for adverse reactions (see Section 4.2).

## Active substances that may decrease acalabrutinib plasma concentrations

## CYP3A inducers

Co-administration of a strong CYP3A inducer (600 mg rifampicin once daily for 9 days) decreased acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 68% and 77% in healthy subjects (N=24), respectively.

Concomitant use with strong inducers of CYP3A activity (e.g., phenytoin, rifampicin, carbamazepine) should be avoided. Concomitant treatment with St. John's wort, which may unpredictably decrease acalabrutinib plasma concentrations, should be avoided.

## Gastric acid reducing medicinal products

No clinically significant differences in acalabrutinib pharmacokinetics were observed when a 100 mg acalabrutinib tablet was used concomitantly with a proton pump inhibitor (rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily for 3 days). Acalabrutinib tablets can be co-administered with gastric acid reducing agents (proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists, antacids), unlike acalabrutinib capsules which show impaired uptake when given with acid reducing agents.

## Active substances whose plasma concentrations may be altered by Calquence

## CYP3A substrates

Based on in vitro data, it cannot be excluded that acalabrutinib is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 at the intestinal level and may increase the exposure of CYP3A4 substrates sensitive to gut CYP3A metabolism. Caution should be exercised if co-administering acalabrutinib with CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic range administered orally (e.g., cyclosporine, ergotamine, pimozide).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effect of acalabrutinib on CYP1A2 substrates

In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib induces CYP1A2. Co-administration of acalabrutinib with CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline, caffeine) may decrease their exposure.

## Effects of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, on medicinal product transport systems

Acalabrutinib may increase exposure to co-administered BCRP substrates (e.g., methotrexate) by inhibition of intestinal BCRP (see section 5.2). To minimise the potential for an interaction in the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract, oral narrow therapeutic range BCRP substrates such as methotrexate should be taken at least 6 hours before or after acalabrutinib.

ACP-5862 may increase exposure to co-administered MATE1 substrates (e.g., metformin) by inhibition of MATE1 (see section 5.2). Patients taking concomitant medicinal products with disposition dependent upon MATE1 (e.g., metformin) should be monitored for signs of changed tolerability as a result of increased exposure of the concomitant medication whilst receiving Calquence.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving Calquence.

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of acalabrutinib in pregnant women. Based on findings from animal studies, there may be a risk to the foetus from exposure to acalabrutinib during pregnancy. Dystocia (difficult or prolonged labour) was observed in the rat and administration to pregnant rabbits was associated with reduced foetal growth (see section 5.3).

Calquence should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with acalabrutinib.

## Breast-feeding

It is not known whether acalabrutinib is excreted in human milk. There are no data on the effect of acalabrutinib on the breast-fed child or on milk production. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were present in the milk of lactating rats. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding mothers are advised not to breast-feed during treatment with Calquence and for 2 days after receiving the last dose.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effect of Calquence on human fertility. In a non-clinical study of acalabrutinib in male and female rats, no adverse effects on fertility parameters were observed (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Calquence has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, during treatment with acalabrutinib, fatigue and dizziness have been reported and patients who experience these symptoms should be advised not to drive or use machines until symptoms abate.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no specific treatment for acalabrutinib overdose and symptoms of overdose have not been established. In the event of an overdose, patients must be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EL02.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Mechanism of action

Acalabrutinib is a selective inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK). BTK is a signalling molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B-cells, BTK signalling results in B-cell survival and proliferation, and is required for cellular adhesion, trafficking, and chemotaxis.

Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to irreversible inactivation of BTK with minimal off-target interactions.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

In patients with B-cell malignancies dosed with acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily, median steady-state BTK occupancy of ≥ 95% in peripheral blood was maintained over 12 hours, resulting in inactivation of BTK throughout the recommended dosing interval.

## Cardiac electrophysiology

The effect of acalabrutinib on the QTc interval was evaluated in 46 healthy male and female subjects in a randomised, double-blind thorough QT study with placebo and positive controls. At a supratherapeutic dose, 4-times the maximum recommended dose, Calquence did not prolong the QT/QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent (e.g., not greater than or equal to 10 ms) (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.3).

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Patients with previously untreated CLL

## Calquence monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab

The safety and efficacy of Calquence monotherapy or in combination with obinutuzumab in previously untreated CLL were evaluated in a randomised, multi-centre, open-label Phase 3 study (ELEVATE-TN) of 535 patients. Patients received Calquence plus obinutuzumab, Calquence monotherapy, or obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil. Patients 65 years of age or older, or between 18 and 65 years of age with coexisting medical conditions, were included in ELEVATE-TN, 27.9% patients had a CrCl of &lt; 60 mL/min. Of the patients who were &lt; 65 years of age, 16.1% had a median CIRS-G score of 8. The study allowed patients to receive antithrombotic agents. Patients who required anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists were excluded.

Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 arms to receive:

- Calquence plus obinutuzumab (Calquence+G): Calquence 100 mg was administered twice daily starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Obinutuzumab was administered starting on Cycle 2 Day 1 for a maximum of 6 treatment cycles. Obinutuzumab 1 000 mg was administered on Days 1 and 2 (100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 2), 8 and 15 of Cycle 2 followed by 1 000 mg on Day 1 of Cycles 3 up to 7. Each cycle was 28 days.
- Calquence monotherapy: Calquence 100 mg was administered twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
- Obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil (GClb): Obinutuzumab and chlorambucil were administered for a maximum of 6 treatment cycles. Obinutuzumab 1 000 mg was administered on Days 1 and 2 (100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 2), 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 followed by 1 000 mg on Day 1 of Cycles 2 up to 6. Chlorambucil 0.5 mg/kg was administered on Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 1 up to 6. Each cycle was 28 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients were stratified by 17p deletion mutation status (presence versus absence), ECOG performance status (0 or 1 versus 2) and geographic region (North America and Western Europe versus Other). After confirmed disease progression, 45 patients randomised on the GClb arm crossed over to Calquence monotherapy. Table 6 summarises the baseline demographics and disease characteristics of the study population.

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) of Calquence+G arm versus GClb arm as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (IWCLL) 2008 criteria with incorporation of the clarification for treatment-related lymphocytosis (Cheson 2012). With a median follow-up of 28.3 months, PFS by IRC indicated a 90% statistically significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for previously untreated CLL patients in the Calquence+G arm compared to the GClb arm. Efficacy results are presented in Table 7.

## Patients with previously untreated CLL - Fixed duration therapy

## Calquence in combination with venetoclax with or without obinutuzumab

The safety and efficacy of Calquence in combination with venetoclax with or without obinutuzumab in previously untreated CLL was evaluated in a randomised, multi-centre, open-label Phase 3 study (AMPLIFY) of 867 patients. Patients received Calquence plus venetoclax, Calquence plus venetoclax and obinutuzumab, or Investigator's choice of chemoimmunotherapy, either FCR (fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide plus rituximab) or BR (bendamustine plus rituximab). AMPLIFY included patients previously untreated for CLL without del(17p) or TP53 mutation that were 18 years of age and older. The trial allowed patients to receive antithrombotic agents except warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists.

Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 arms to receive:

- Calquence plus venetoclax (AV): Calquence 100 mg was administered twice daily starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 for a total of 14 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. On Cycle 3 Day 1 patients started the venetoclax 5-week dose-titration schedule, starting at 20 mg and increasing weekly to 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and finally 400 mg once daily. Venetoclax was administered for a total of 12 cycles. Each cycle was 28 days.
- Calquence plus venetoclax plus obinutuzumab (AVO): Calquence 100 mg was administered twice daily starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 for a total of 14 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. On Cycle 3 Day 1 patients started the venetoclax 5-week dose-titration schedule, starting at 20 mg and increasing weekly to 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and finally 400 mg once daily. Venetoclax was administered for a total of 12 cycles. Obinutuzumab 1 000 mg was administered on Day 1 or Day 1 and 2 (100 mg on Day 1 and 900 mg on Day 1 or 2), 8 and 15 of Cycle 2 followed by 1 000 mg on Day 1 of Cycles 3-7. Each cycle was 28 days.
- Investigator's choice of chemoimmunotherapy (FCR/BR):
- o Fludarabine plus cyclophosphamyde plus rituximab (FCR): Fludarabine (25 mg/m 2 ) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m 2 ) were administered on Days 1-3 up to a maximum of 6 cycles. Rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 on Day 1 Cycle 1 and 500 mg/m 2  on Day 1 of Cycles 2 up to 6. Each cycle was 28 days.
- o Bendamustine plus rituximab (BR): Bendamustine 90 mg/m 2  was administered on Days 1 and 2 up to maximum of 6 cycles. Rituximab was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 on Day 1 Cycle 1 and 500 mg/m 2  on Day 1 of Cycles 2 up to 6. Each cycle was 28 days.

Patients were stratified by age (&gt; 65 years or ≤ 65 years), IGHV mutational status (mutated versus unmutated), Rai stage (high risk [≥ 3] versus non-high risk) and geographic region (North America and Western Europe versus other). Table 10 summarises the baseline demographics and disease characteristics of the study population.

## Patients with CLL who received at least one prior therapy

The safety and efficacy of Calquence in relapsed or refractory CLL were evaluated in a randomised, multi-centre, open-label phase 3 study (ASCEND) of 310 patients who received at least one prior therapy not including BCL-2 inhibitors or B-cell receptor inhibitors. Patients received Calquence monotherapy or investigator's choice of either idelalisib plus rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab. The study allowed patients to receive antithrombotic agents. Patients who required anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists were excluded.

Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either:

- Calquence 100 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or
- Investigator's choice:
- o Idelalisib 150 mg twice daily in combination with rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of the first cycle, followed by 500 mg/m2 IV every 2 weeks for 4 doses, then every 4 weeks for 3 doses for a total of 8 infusions
- o Bendamustine 70 mg/m 2  (Day 1 and 2 of each 28-day cycle) in combination with rituximab (375 mg/m 2 /500 mg/m 2 ) on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle for up to 6 cycles

Patients were stratified by 17p deletion mutation status (presence versus absence), ECOG performance status (0 or 1 versus 2) and number of prior therapies (1 to 3 versus ≥ 4). After confirmed disease progression, 35 patients randomised on investigator's choice of either idelalisib plus rituximab or bendamustine plus rituximab crossed over to Calquence. Table 12 summarizes the baseline demographics and disease characteristics of the study population.

The primary endpoint was PFS as assessed by IRC IWCLL 2008 criteria with incorporation of the clarification for treatment-related lymphocytosis (Cheson 2012). With a median follow-up of 16.1 months, PFS indicated a 69% statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression for patients in the Calquence arm. Efficacy results are presented in Table 13. The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 3.

Investigator assessed PFS results at final analysis for Calquence were consistent across subgroups, including high risk features and were consistent with the primary analysis.

## Patients with previously untreated MCL

The safety and efficacy of Calquence in patients with previously untreated MCL was evaluated in ECHO, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, phase 3 study. ECHO included 598 patients 65 years of age and older with confirmed MCL that was previously untreated. Patients were randomised in 1:1 ratio in 2 arms to receive:

- Calquence plus bendamustine and rituximab (Calquence + BR) arm: Calquence 100 mg was administered twice daily from Day 1 of Cycle 1, continuously. Bendamustine, 90 mg/m 2 , was intravenously administered over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of each of six 28-day cycles; and rituximab, 375 mg/m 2 , was intravenously administered on Day 1 of each cycle of six 28-day

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cycles. Calquence + BR was administered for a maximum of 6 treatment cycles (induction treatment).

- Placebo plus bendamustine and rituximab (Placebo + BR) arm: Placebo was administered twice daily from Day 1 of Cycle 1, continuously. Bendamustine, 90 mg/m 2 , was intravenously administered over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of each of six 28-day cycles; and rituximab, 375 mg/m 2 , was intravenously administered on Day 1 of each cycle of six 28-day cycles. Placebo + BR was administered for a maximum of 6 treatment cycles (induction treatment).

Calquence or placebo was administered continuously until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After the induction treatment, patients who were achieving a response (PR or CR) received rituximab maintenance at 375 mg/m 2  on Day 1 of every other cycle for maximum of 12 additional doses up to Cycle 30. Patients randomised to placebo + BR arm who had confirmed PD were eligible to cross over to Calquence monotherapy at 100 mg twice daily dose until their second disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patient randomisation was stratified by geographic region (North America versus Western Europe versus Other) and simplified MIPI (Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index) score (0-3 versus 4-5 versus 6-11).

The median age was 71 years (65-86), 70.7% were males, 78.3% were Caucasians, 93.1% had an ECOG performance status of 0-1. The simplified MIPI score was low (0-3) in 33.1%, intermediate (4-5) in 42.8% and high (6-11) in 24.1% of patients. A total of 37.7% of patients had tumour bulk ≥ 5 cm and 86% had Ann Arbor stage IV disease. Aggressive variants of MCL such as blastoid and pleomorphic forms were seen in 7.7% and 5.5% of patients respectively. A total of 47.8% patients had Ki-67 score of ≥ 30%. The baseline characteristics were similar for both arms.

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) per 2014 Lugano Classification for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in subjects with previously untreated MCL. Additionally, overall response rate (ORR) was also assessed by an IRC.

IRC-assessed PFS was assessed at a median follow-up of 49.8 months.

With an additional 6 months of follow-up from the primary PFS analysis, and a median follow-up of 63.0 months, the median overall survival had not been reached in either arm. There were a total of 218 deaths: 105 (35.1%) in the Calquence + BR arm and 113 (37.8%) in the placebo + BR arm. Efficacy results are presented in Table 16. The Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS are shown in Figure 5.

## Patients with MCL who received at least one prior therapy

The safety and efficacy of CALQUENCE in MCL were evaluated in an open-label, multi-centre, single-arm Phase 2 study (ACE-LY-004) of 124 previously treated patients. All patients received CALQUENCE 100 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial did not include patients who received prior treatment with either BTK or BCL-2 inhibitors. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR) per the Lugano classification for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Duration of Response (DoR) was an additional outcome measure. Efficacy results at final (54 months) analysis are presented in Table 17.

At final analysis, the median age was 68 (range 42 to 90) years, 79.8% were male and 74.2% were Caucasian. At baseline, 92.8% of patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The median time since diagnosis was 46.3 months and the median number of prior treatments was 2 (range 1 to 5), including 17.7% with prior stem cell transplant. The most common prior regimens were CHOP-based (51.6%) and ARA-C (33.9%). At baseline, 37.1% of patients had at least one tumour with a longest diameter ≥ 5 cm, 72.6% had extra nodal involvement including 50.8% with bone marrow involvement. The simplified MIPI score (which includes age, ECOG score, and baseline lactate dehydrogenase and white cell count) was intermediate in 43.5% and high in 16.9% of patients.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Calquence in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of mature B-cell neoplasms (for information on paediatric use, see section 4.2).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, were studied in healthy subjects and in patients with B-cell malignancies. Acalabrutinib exhibits dose-proportionality, and both acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 exhibit almost linear PK across a dose range of 75 to 250 mg. Population PK modelling suggests that the PK of acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 is similar across patients with different B-cell malignancies. At the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily in patients with B-cell malignancies (including, CLL), the geometric mean steady state daily area under the plasma concentration over time curve (AUC24h) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for acalabrutinib were 1679 ng·h/mL and 438 ng/mL, respectively, and for ACP-5862 were 4166 ng·h/mL and 446 ng/mL, respectively.

Calquence tablets and Calquence capsules have been demonstrated to be bioequivalent. Calquence tablets contain acalabrutinib maleate, a salt form of acalabrutinib that shows higher solubility at high pH than the acalabrutinib base, which is the active content of Calquence capsules. Calquence tablets thus have a better absorption when combined with acid reducing agents.

## Absorption

The time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) was 0.2-3.0 hours for acalabrutinib, and 0.5-4.0 hours for ACP-5862. The absolute bioavailability of Calquence was 25%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Effect of food on acalabrutinib

In healthy subjects, administration of a single 100 mg dose of acalabrutinib tablet with a high fat, high calorie meal (approximately 918 calories, 59 grams carbohydrate, 59 grams fat and 39 grams protein) did not affect the mean AUC as compared to dosing under fasted conditions. Resulting Cmax decreased by 54% and Tmax was delayed 1-2 hours.

## Distribution

Reversible binding to human plasma protein was 99.4% for acalabrutinib and 98.8% for ACP-5862. The in vitro mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.8 for acalabrutinib and 0.7 for ACP-5862. The mean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) was approximately 34 L for acalabrutinib.

## Biotransformation/Metabolism

In vitro , acalabrutinib is predominantly metabolised by CYP3A enzymes, and to a minor extent by glutathione conjugation and amide hydrolysis. ACP-5862 was identified as the major metabolite in plasma, that was further metabolized primarily by CYP3A-mediated oxidation, with a geometric mean exposure (AUC) that was approximately 2 to 3-fold higher than the exposure of acalabrutinib. ACP-5862 is approximately 50% less potent than acalabrutinib with regard to BTK inhibition.

In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations and is unlikely to affect clearance of substrates of these CYPs.

In vitro studies indicate that ACP-5862 does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations and is unlikely to affect clearance of substrates of these CYPs.

## Interactions with transport proteins

In vitro studies indicate that acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 are P-gp and BCRP substrates. Co-administration with BCRP inhibitors is however unlikely to result in clinically relevant drug interactions. Co-administration with an OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitor (600 mg rifampin, single dose) resulted in an increase in acalabrutinib Cmax and AUC by 1.2-fold and 1.4-fold (N=24, healthy subjects), respectively, which is not clinically relevant.

Acalabrutinib and ACP-5862 do not inhibit P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations. Acalabrutinib may inhibit intestinal BCRP, while ACP-5862 may inhibit MATE1 at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 4.5). Acalabrutinib does not inhibit MATE1, while ACP-5862 does not inhibit BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations.

## Elimination

Following a single oral dose of 100 mg acalabrutinib tablet, the geometric mean terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of acalabrutinib was 1.4 hours. The t1/2 of the active metabolite, ACP-5862, was 6.6 hours.

The mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 134 L/hr for acalabrutinib and 22 L/hr for ACP-5862 in patients with B-cell malignancies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Following administration of a single 100 mg radiolabelled [ 14 C]-acalabrutinib dose in healthy subjects, 84% of the dose was recovered in the faeces and 12% of the dose was recovered in the urine, with less than 2% of the dose excreted as unchanged acalabrutinib.

## Special populations

Based on population PK analysis, age (&gt;18 years of age), sex, race (Caucasian, African American) and body weight did not have clinically meaningful effects on the PK of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862.

## Paediatric population

No pharmacokinetic studies were performed with Calquence in patients under 18 years of age.

## Renal impairment

Acalabrutinib undergoes minimal renal elimination. A pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal impairment has not been conducted.

Based on population PK analysis, no clinically relevant PK difference was observed in 408 subjects with mild renal impairment (eGFR between 60 and 89 mL/min/1.73m 2  as estimated by MDRD), 109 subjects with moderate renal impairment (eGFR between 30 and 59 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) relative to 192  subjects with normal renal function (eGFR greater than or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). The pharmacokinetics of acalabrutinib has not been characterised in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) or renal impairment requiring dialysis. Patients with creatinine levels greater than 2.5 times the institutional ULN were not included in the clinical studies (see section 4.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Acalabrutinib is metabolised in the liver. In dedicated hepatic impairment (HI) studies, compared to subjects with normal liver function (N=6), acalabrutinib exposure (AUC) was increased by 1.9-fold, 1.5-fold and 5.3-fold in subjects with mild (N=6) (Child-Pugh A), moderate (N=6) (Child-Pugh B) and severe (N=8) (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, respectively. Subjects in the moderate HI group were however not significantly affected in markers relevant for the elimination capacity of drugs, so the effect of moderate hepatic impairment was likely underestimated in this study. Based on a population PK analysis, no clinically relevant difference was observed between subjects with mild (N=79) or moderate (N=6) hepatic impairment (total bilirubin between 1.5 to 3-times ULN and any AST) relative to subjects with normal (N=613) hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST within ULN) (see section 4.2).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with acalabrutinib.

## Genotoxicity/Mutagenicity/Phototoxicity

Acalabrutinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay, in an in vitro chromosome aberration assay or in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.

Based on phototoxicity assays using 3T3 cell line in vitro , acalabrutinib is considered to have a low risk for phototoxicity in humans.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Repeat-dose toxicity

In rats, microscopic findings of minimal to mild severity were observed in the pancreas (haemorrhage/pigment/inflammation/fibrosis in islets) at all dose levels. Non-adverse findings of minimal to mild severity in the kidneys (tubular basophilia, tubular regeneration, and inflammation) were observed in studies of up to 6-month duration with a No Observed Adverse Effect level (NOAEL) of 30 mg/kg/day in rats. The mean exposures (AUC) at the NOAEL in male and female rats correspond to 0.6x and 1x, respectively, the clinical exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily, respectively. The Lowest Adverse Observed Effect Level (LOAEL) at which reversible renal (moderate tubular degeneration) and liver (individual hepatocyte necrosis) findings were observed in the chronic rat study was 100 mg/kg/day and provided an exposure margin 4.2-times greater than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily. In studies of 9 months duration in dogs, the NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day corresponding to an exposure 3-times the clinical AUC at the recommended clinical dose. Minimal tubular degeneration in kidney, slight decreases in spleen weights and transient minimal to mild decreases in red cell mass and increases in ALT and ALP were observed at 30 mg/kg/day (9-times the clinical AUC) in dogs. Cardiac toxicities in rats (myocardial haemorrhage, inflammation, necrosis) and dogs (perivascular/vascular inflammation) were observed only in animals that died during studies at doses above the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The exposures in rats and dogs with cardiac findings was at least 6.8-times and 25-times the clinical AUC, respectively. Reversibility for the heart findings could not be assessed as these findings were only observed at doses above the MTD.

## Reproductive toxicology

No effects on fertility were observed in male or female rats at exposures 10 or 9-times the clinical AUC at the recommended dose, respectively.

No effects on embryofoetal development and survival were observed in pregnant rats, at exposures approximately 9-times the AUC in patients at the recommended dose of 100 mg twice daily. In two rat reproductive studies, dystocia (prolonged/difficult labour) was observed at exposures &gt; 2.3-times the clinical exposure at 100 mg twice daily. The presence of acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were confirmed in foetal rat plasma. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite were present in the milk of lactating rats.

In an embryofoetal study in pregnant rabbits, decreased foetal body weight and delayed ossification were observed at exposure levels that produced maternal toxicity which were 2.4-times greater than the human AUC at the recommended dose.

acalabrutinib

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet (see section 4).

## What is in this leaflet:

1. What Calquence is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you take Calquence
3. How to take Calquence
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Calquence
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Calquence is and what it is used for

## What Calquence is

- Calquence contains the active substance acalabrutinib.
- It belongs to a group of medicines called Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors.

## What Calquence is used for

Calquence is used to treat adults with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).

CLL is a cancer of white blood cells called B-lymphocytes (or B-cells). These cells are part of the immune system (the body's defences).

Calquence is used to treat adults with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

MCL is a type of blood cancer affecting the lymph nodes.

## How Calquence works

Calquence works by blocking BTK, a protein in the body that helps these cancer cells grow and survive. By blocking BTK, Calquence helps to kill and can reduce the number of cancer cells which can slow down the worsening of the disease.

If you have any questions about how Calquence works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you take Calquence

## Do not take Calquence if:

- you are allergic to acalabrutinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Calquence.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Calquence if you:

- have ever had unusual bruising or bleeding or are on any medicines  that increase your risk of bleeding (see section 4 'Possible side effects').
- have an infection (see section 4 'Possible side effects')
- have recently had an operation or are about to have one. Your doctor may stop treatment with Calquence before and after a medical, surgical or dental procedure.
- have ever had hepatitis B (a liver infection) - this is because Calquence could cause hepatitis B to become active again and so that your doctor will look out for signs of this infection coming back (see section 4 'Possible side effects').
- have or ever had irregular heart beat (see section 4 'Possible side effects').

Talk to your doctor if you develop a new lesion or any change in the appearance of an area on the skin as you are at a high risk of developing skin cancer, see section 4. Use sun protection and make regular skin examination.

Your doctor will check your blood cell counts as needed during treatment.

## Children and adolescents

Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents aged less than 18 years. This is because it has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and Calquence

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken or might take any other medicines, especially if you take any of the following:

- antibiotics for bacterial infections - such as clarithromycin
- medicines for fungal infections - such as posaconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole
- ketoconazole - a medicine for Cushing's syndrome (a condition in which the body produces too much of the hormone cortisol)
- medicines for HIV infections - such as indinavir and ritonavir
- medicines for hepatitis C - such as telaprevir
- rifampicin - an antibiotic for bacterial infections (tuberculosis)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o antacids  - such as calcium carbonate. Take Calquence2 hours before or 2 hours after you take these medicines.
- o histamine-2 receptor blockers - such as ranitidine  and famotidine. Take Calquence 2 hours before or 10 hours after you take these medicines.
- o proton pump inhibitors - such as omeprazole. Avoid taking these medicines while you are taking Calquence.
- methotrexate - a medicine for diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, which are caused by the immune system working incorrectly.
- o This medicine should be taken at least 6 hours before or after Calquence.

## Medicines that increase your risk of bleeding

Calquence may make you bleed more easily. Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding:

- Antiplatelets (medicines that act against blood clotting) such as acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel.
- Anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin or enoxaparin.

## Pregnancy

Talk to your doctor before taking Calquence if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning on having a baby. This is because Calquence may harm your unborn baby.

## Breast-feeding

Do not breast-feed during treatment with Calquence and for 2 days after your last dose of Calquence. It is not known if Calquence passes into your breast milk.

## Driving and using machines

Calquence is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use machines. However, if you feel dizzy, weak or tired while taking Calquence, you must not drive or use machines.

## Calquence contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How to take Calquence

Calquence will only be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in the use of medicines for cancer. Always take Calquence exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.

Depending on your type of cancer, Calquence may be given in combination with other anticancer medicines.

## How much to take

- The usual dose is one capsule (100 mg) twice a day. Take doses about 12 hours apart.

## How to take

- Swallow the capsule whole with water at about the same time each day.
- Do not chew, dissolve or open the capsules as this may change how quickly the medicine gets into your body.
- You can take Calquence with food or between meals.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- You can check when you last took a capsule of Calquence by looking on the blister. Pictures on the blister will help you to take your dose at the right time - the sun for the morning dose and the moon for the evening dose.

## If you take more Calquence than you should

If you have taken more Calquence than you should, see a doctor or go to the nearest hospital straight away. Take the capsules and this leaflet with you.

## If you forget to take a dose

- If less than 3 hours have passed after your usual time for taking a dose, take the missed dose right away. Take the next dose at your usual time.
- If more than 3 hours have passed after your usual time for taking a dose, skip the missed dose. Take the next dose at your usual time.
- Do not take a double dose of Calquence to make up for a forgotten dose.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine  can cause  side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Stop taking Calquence and contact a doctor or go to your nearest emergency department immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:

## Calquence 100 mg film-coated tablets

acalabrutinib

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, please ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their symptoms are the same as yours.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet (see section 4).

## What is in this leaflet:

1. What Calquence is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you take Calquence
3. How to take Calquence
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Calquence
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Calquence is and what it is used for

## What Calquence is

- Calquence contains the active substance acalabrutinib.
- It belongs to a group of medicines called Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors.

## What Calquence is used for

Calquence is used to treat adults with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).

CLL is a cancer of white blood cells called B-lymphocytes (or B-cells). These cells are part of the immune system (the body's defences).

Calquence is used to treat adults with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

MCL is a type of blood cancer affecting the lymph nodes.

## How Calquence works

Calquence works by blocking BTK, a protein in the body that helps these cancer cells grow and survive. By blocking BTK, Calquence helps to kill and can reduce the number of cancer cells which can slow down the worsening of the disease.

If you have any questions about how Calquence works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. What you need to know before you take Calquence

## Do not take Calquence if:

- you are allergic to acalabrutinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Calquence.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Calquence if you:

- have ever had unusual bruising or bleeding or are on any medicines that increase your risk of bleeding (see section 4 'Possible side effects').
- have an infection (see section 4 'Possible side effects')
- have recently had an operation or are about to have one. Your doctor may stop treatment with Calquence before and after a medical, surgical or dental procedure.
- have ever had hepatitis B (a liver infection) - this is because Calquence could cause hepatitis B to become active again and so that your doctor will look out for signs of this infection coming back (see section 4 'Possible side effects').
- have or ever had irregular heart beat (see section 4 'Possible side effects').

Talk to your doctor if you develop a new lesion or any change in the appearance of an area on the skin as you are at a high risk of developing skin cancer, see section 4. Use sun protection and make regular skin examination.

Your doctor will check your blood cell counts as needed during treatment.

## Children and adolescents

Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents aged less than 18 years. This is because it has not been studied in this age group.

## Other medicines and Calquence

- o This medicine should be taken at least 6 hours before or after Calquence.

You can take stomach acid reducing medicines such as antacids (calcium carbonate), histamine-2 receptor blockers (ranitidine and famotidine) and proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole) with Calquence tablets.

## Medicines that increase your risk of bleeding

Calquence may make you bleed more easily. Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding:

- Antiplatelets (medicines that act against blood clotting) such as acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel.
- Anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin or enoxaparin.

## Pregnancy

Talk to your doctor before taking Calquence if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning on having a baby. This is because Calquence may harm your unborn baby.

## Breast-feeding

Do not breast-feed during treatment with Calquence and for 2 days after your last dose of Calquence. It is not known if Calquence passes into your breast milk.

## Driving and using machines

Calquence is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use machines. However, if you feel dizzy, weak or tired while taking Calquence, you must not drive or use machines.

## Calquence contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How to take Calquence

Calquence will only be prescribed to you by a doctor with experience in the use of medicines for cancer. Always take Calquence exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you take more Calquence than you should

If you have taken more Calquence than you should, see a doctor or go to the nearest hospital straight away. Take the tablets and this leaflet with you.

- If less than 3 hours have passed after your usual time for taking a dose, take the missed dose right away. Take the next dose at your usual time.
