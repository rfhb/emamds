## 1. Background information on the procedure

1.1. Submission of the dossier The Applicant applied for the following indication: Ontilyv is indicated as adjunctive therapy to preparations of levodopa/ DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (DDCI) in  adult  patients  with  Parkinson's  disease  and  end-of-dose  motor  fluctuations  who  cannot  be  stabilised  on those combinations 1.2. Legal basis, dossier content and multiples The legal basis for this application refers to: Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC - relating to informed consent from a marketing authorisation holder (MAH) for an authorised medicinal product The application  submitted  is  composed  of  administrative  information,  quality,  non-clinical  and  clinical  data with a letter from a MAH BIAL - Portela &amp; Cª, S.A  allowing the cross reference to relevant quality, nonclinical and/or clinical data. This application is submitted as a multiple of Ongentys authorised on 24 June 2016 in accordance with Article 82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 1.3. Information on Paediatric requirements Pursuant  to  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision CW/0001/2015 on the granting of a class waiver. 1.4. Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 1.4.1. Similarity Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No.  141/2000  and  Article  3  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No 847/2000, the Applicant  did  not  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with  authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication. 1.5. Scientific advice The Applicant did not seek Scientific advice from the CHMP. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The Rapporteur appointed by the CHMP was: CHMP Rapporteur: Martina Weise 2. Scientific discussion 2.1. Problem statement This informed consent application by BIAL - Portela &amp; Cª, S.A. in accordance with Art. 10c of Dir. 2001/83/EC concerns the centralised marketing authorisation (MA) for 25 mg and 50 mg opicapone hard capsules under the trade name 'Ontilyv'. The Applicant was previously granted the MA for the European reference product (ERP)  'Ongentys  25  mg  hard  capsules'  and  'Ongentys  50  mg  hard  capsules'  on  24th  June  2016 (EMEA/H/C/2790).  Hence,  this  Art.  10c  application  completely  reflects  the  same  pharmaceutical  forms, strengths, presentations and clinical indication as earlier approved for 'Ongentys'. The quality, nonclinical, and clinical data Ontilyv are identical to Ongentys. No new non-clinical and clinical studies were conducted, which is agreed given the legal basis of this application. 2.2.

| The CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a marketing authorisation to Ontilyv on no | 16 December 2021  |

According  to  Article  10c  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  an  informed  consent  declaration  by  the  marketing authorisation  holder  BIAL-  Portela  &amp;  Ca,  S.A.,  Portugal  of  the  authorised  medicinal  product  Ongentys  has been submitted in the documentation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Confirmation  that  no  risk  of  nitrosamine  has  been  identified  with  regard  to  the  authorised  drug  product Ongentys has been provided. Since this application is an informed consent declaration, the quality data in support of the Ontilyv application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Ongentys dossier, which has been assessed and approved, including  all  post-marketing  procedures. No  new  data  with  regard  to  module  3  of  the  dossier  have  been submitted, except for updated TSE certificates. 2.3. Non-clinical aspects The Applicant completely references to Module 4 of the ERP 'Ongentys' and did not perform any new nonclinical investigations, which is agreed given the legal basis of this application. 2.3.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment An environmental risk assessment (ERA) for opicapone, including documentation according to the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00)' has been submitted. It is concluded that opicapone is not expected to pose any risk to the environment when used as stated in the SmPC. However, there were changes to the ERA after the initial marketing authorisation application (MAA) procedure of the reference product 'Ongentys' (EMEA/H/C/2790). Therefore, the summary of study results has been updated in this report as indicated in Table 1. Table 1: Summary of main study results Medicinal product no longer authorised

2.3.2. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects The CHMP considers the non-clinical aspects of Ontilyv to meet the requirements to support this application. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Ontilyv 25 mg and 50 mg hard capsules is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive  2001/83/EC.  Reference  is  made  to  Ongentys  25  mg  /  50  mg  hard  capsules  (EMEA/H/C/2790  on 24th June 2016) including all indications, pharmaceutical forms, strengths and presentations, authorised and granted in the EU. The Applicant refers completely to module 5 of Ongentys MA. Therefore, the clinical data in support of BIAL Portela  &amp;  Cª,  S.A.MAA  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  clinical  data  of  Ongentys  dossier,  which  have  been assessed and authorised by the CHMP. No new clinical data has been submitted which is acceptable. 2.4.1. Conclusions on the clinical aspects The CHMP considers the clinical aspects of Ontilyv to meet the requirements to support this application. 2.5. Risk Management Plan The  Applicant  has  submitted  a  common  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  both  opicapone  products  Ongentys® and Ontilyv®-, which was updated as part of the informed consent procedure. 2.5.1. Safety concerns Table 2: Summary of safety concerns Summary of safety concerns Important identified risks None Important potential risks None Missing information None 2.5.2. Pharmacovigilance plan Only routine pharmacovigilance activities. No additional pharmacovigilance activities. 2.5.3. Risk minimisation measures Risk communication in the SmPC and the legal status (prescription only medicine) are considered sufficient to minimise the risks of the medicinal product in the approved indication. 2.5.4. Conclusion The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 6.0 is acceptable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.6. Pharmacovigilance

<!-- image -->

With respect to quality, nonclinical, and clinical data of 'Ontilyv' reference is made to 'Ongentys' .  No new quality, nonclinical or clinical data have been submitted and no new data are needed. The SmPC is identical with the currently approved SmPC for 'Ongentys' .  Since 'Ontilyv' is  a  duplicate  of 'Ongentys' ,  the  SmPC should be updated (as appropriate) in relation to the finalization of any ongoing procedures for 'Ongentys' before or in the same month as the CHMP opinion of the informed consent opinion.

2.6.1. Pharmacovigilance system The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  Applicant  fulfils  the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 2.6.2. Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Product information. The submitted summary of product characteristics (SmPC), labelling text and package leaflet are identical to those currently approved for the ERP 'Ongentys'. Text  versions  and  mock-ups  were  also  provided  for  the labels, which only deviate from 'Ongentys' in terms of the product name. Since  Ontilyv  is  a  duplicate  of  Ongentys,  the  SmPC  should  be  updated  (as  appropriate)  in  relation  to  the finalization of any ongoing procedures for Ongentys before or in the same month as the CHMP opinion of the informed  consent  opinion.  The  Applicant  confirmed  that  the  product  information  (PI)  of  Ontilyv  will  be updated in case any procedure concerning the PI of Ongentys will be approved before the CHMP opinion of the informed consent application. 2.6.3. User consultation A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the Applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Ongentys. The bridging report submitted by the Applicant has been found acceptable. 3. Benefit-Risk Balance The  current  application  for 'Ontilyv' was  submitted  under  an  informed  consent  application,  Art. 10(c)  of Dir. 2001/83/EC. Reference is made to 'Ongentys' (EMEA/H/C/2790) including all indications, pharmaceutical forms,  strengths  and  presentations,  authorised  in  the  EU.  Hence,  this  informed  consent  application  is  a complete true duplicate of 'Ongentys' . Medicinal product no longer authorised

As this MAA concerns a duplicate licence based on co-marketing reasons, prior approval by the EC has been requested  as  per  Art.  82(1)  of  Reg. 726/2004/EC.  The  EC  requested  the  Applicant  to  submit  to  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Commission services the missing information at the latest one month before adoption of the CHMP opinion. With a letter dated 28 th  June 2021, however, the EC notified the Applicant and the EMA that the conditions of Art. 82(1) of Reg. 726/2004/EC were still not fulfilled. The absence of the EC letter authorizing the duplicate application in accordance with Article 82(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (Annex 5.16) was raised as a major objection during the procedure. With the response document the appropriate EC letter authorizing the duplicate application in accordance with Article 82(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 (Annex 5.16) was provided by the MAA as requested (Modul 1.2, annex 5.16). Hence, the MO can be considered as resolved. Overall, the benefit/risk balance of the current procedure is generally considered favourable. 4. Recommendations Outcome Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Ontilyv is favourable in the following indication: Ontilyv is indicated as adjunctive therapy to preparations of levodopa/ DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (DDCI) in  adult  patients  with  Parkinson's  disease  and  end-of-dose  motor  fluctuations  who  cannot  be  stabilised  on those combinations. The  CHMP  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the  following conditions: Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation · Periodic Safety Update Reports The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product · Risk Management Plan (RMP) The  marketing  authorisation  holder  (MAH)  shall  perform  the  required  pharmacovigilance  activities  and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. Medicinal product no longer authorised

An updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
- Whenever  the  risk  management  system  is  modified,  especially  as  the  result  of  new  information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States Not applicable. Medicinal product no longer authorised
