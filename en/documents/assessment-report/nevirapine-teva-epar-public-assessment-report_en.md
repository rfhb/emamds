## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 3.1 Introduction

This is a generic medicinal product containing nevirapine (anhydrous) as active substance. Each tablet contains  200  mg  of  nevirapine;  the  product  is  indicated  in  combination  with  other  anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults, adolescents, and children of any age. The reference medicinal product is Viramune tablets.

Nevirapine  is  a  non-nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  (NNRTIs)  of  HIV-1.  It  acts  through non-competitive binding to the HIV RT enzyme blocking the RNA dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities by causing a disruption of the enzyme catalytic site. It does not have a biologically significant inhibitory effect on the HIV-2 reverse transcriptase.

The safety  and  efficacy  profile  of  nevirapine  for  the  treatment  of  HIV-1  has  been  demonstrated  in several clinical trials, details of which can be found in the EPAR for the reference medicinal product. In  addition,  there  is  a  long-term  post-marketing  experience  contributing  to  the  knowledge  of  the clinical  use  of  this  active  substance.  Since  this  application  is  a  generic  application  referring  to  the reference medicinal product Viramune, the pivotal basis is the demonstration of bioequivalence. The indication proposed for Nevirapine Teva is the same as authorised for the reference medicinal product,  which  is  indicated  in  combination  with  other  anti-retroviral  medicinal  products  for  the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults, adolescents, and children of any age. 3.2 Quality aspects Introduction Nevirapine  Teva  is  presented  as  tablets  containing  200  mg  of  nevirapine  (as  anhydrate)  as  active substance. Other ingredients are: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, povidone K25, sodium starch glycolate (Type A), colloidal silicon dioxide, and magnesium stearate. The  tablets  are  packed  in  PVC/PE/PVdC  -  Aluminium  blisters  or  OPA/Alu/PVC  -  Aluminium blisters. Active Substance Anhydrous  Nevirapine  is  a  white  or  almost  white  powder  which  is  practically  insoluble  in  water, sparingly  soluble  or  slightly  soluble  in  methylene  chloride  and  slightly  soluble  in  methanol.  The material  is  shown  to  be  non-hygroscopic  at  30°C/75  %  RH.  Nevirapine  has  the  chemical  name11Cyclopropyl-4-methyl-5,11-dihydro-6 H -dipyrido [3,2-b:2',3'e ][1,4]diazepin-6-one. Nevirapine does not exhibit isomerism but does exhibit polymorphism and is known to exist in the hemihydrate and anhydrous forms. The anhydrous form is used in this product. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Manufacture

The manufacturing of nevirapine consists in three steps. The information on the manufacturing process is  provided  in  an  ASMF.  Adequate  In-Process  Controls  are  applied  during  the  manufacture  of  the active substance. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents, have been presented and are satisfactory. The structure has been elucidated using the following methods: IR, UV, 1 H NMR and MS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Specification

The specifications  of  the  drug  substance  include  description,  solubility  (Ph  Eur),  identification  (IR, loss on drying), related substance (HPLC), heavy metals, loss on drying, sulphated ash, assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), particle size distribution, bulk density (Ph Eur), tapped density (Ph Eur). The methods  and  specifications  proposed  are  in  accordance  with  Ph  Eur  monograph  for  anhydrous nevirapine.

Batch analysis data (n=3) of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

· Stability The stability studies have been carried out on three batches of active substance in long-term conditions (25°C/60% RH) and in accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH). The data cover a period of 24 months in long term conditions and 6 months in accelerated conditions. The stability samples have been stored in the marketing pack (in a triple polybag which is placed in a High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) drum/container). The  batches  are  tested  for  the  following  parameters:  description,  assay,  water/loss  on  drying  and related substances. Photostability studies of Nevirapine Anhydrous have been performed as per ICH guidelines in three batches. The stability results justify the proposed retest period. Medicinal Product · Pharmaceutical Development The  aim  of  the  development  was  to  obtain  immediate-release  tablets  containing  qualitatively  and quantitatively the same active substance as the reference medicinal product Viramune 200 mg Tablets and exhibiting the same bioavailability. The dissolution tests described for the finished product were used as discriminating tests in order to select suitable formulations. Different manufacturing processes for the finished product (direct compression and wet granulation) were  tested  Wet  granulation  technology  was  chosen  as  manufacturing  process  in  order  to  obtain  a suitable granule for compression and an acceptable dissolution profile for the tablets. The final composition of the pilot batches used in the bioequivalence study is identical to the one used for marketing. The excipients used in the formulation are microcrystalline cellulose (filler, binder and disintegrant), lactose monohydrate (filler), povidone K25 (binder), sodium starch glycolate (Type A) (disintegrant), colloidal silicon dioxide (glidant), and magnesium stearate (lubricant). All the excipients are stated to comply with the quality requirements in Ph Eur and are tested according to the current pharmacopoeial specifications at the time of testing. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  tablets  are  packaged  in  two  types  of  blister  packs:  PVC/PE/PVdC  -  Aluminium  blisters  or OPA/Alu/PVC - Aluminium blisters. Stability studies have been performed to show that the selected quality is suitable for the intended use.

## · Adventitious Agents

The manufacturers of the lactose have provided statements pertaining to the guideline on 'Minimizing the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents in medicinal products'. Lactose is derived from milk and calf rennet. Milk is sourced from healthy animals in the same conditions as milk collected for human consumption. Lactose prepared using Calf rennet: the BSE risk is negligible

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

as per the CPMP statement 571/02. Magnesium stearate is of vegetable-base origin and is free of organic volatile impurities

## · Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process is wet granulation. The manufacturing of the product is divided into seven main steps: initial blending, granulation, blending, intermediate blending, final blending, compression and packaging.

The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies  for  the  major  steps  of  the manufacturing process.

The  batch  analysis  data  show  that  the  tablets  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly  according  to  the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation. · Product Specification The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for description, identification of active substance  (UPLC,  UV),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph  Eur),  dissolution  (UV),  assay  (UPLC), impurities/degradation products (UPLC), residual solvents (GC) and microbial quality (Ph Eur). Batch analysis results confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is under control. · Stability of the Product Two batches of the finished packed in the intended for marketing primary packaging (PVC/PE/PVdC aluminium blisters and OPA/Alu/PVC - aluminium blisters) were put on long-term (25°C/60%RH) for up 12 months , and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for up 6 months stability testing ICH conditions. The following parameters were tested: description, assay, dissolution, impurities/degradation products, and microbiological quality. The final blend for the finished product stored in bulk was put at 15-25°C / max 70% RH for up to 6 weeks. Photostability studies were also performed, the finished product is not sensible to light. The results support the shelf life in the SPC. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 3.3 Non-clinical aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

No  non-clinical  data  were  submitted  with  this  application.  The  applicant  provided  an  acceptable description  of  the  pharmacological,  pharmacodynamic  and  toxicological  properties  of  nevirapine based on published literature obtained through up-to-date literature searches. The non-clinical aspects of the SPC are in line with the SPC of the reference product. No further studies are required and the applicant has justified why no such data was provided.

The  impurity  profile  has  been  discussed  and  was  considered  acceptable.  The  absence  of  an environmental  risk  assessment  has  been  justified  by  the  applicant  with  the  assumption  that  the introduction of this generic product, which is deemed interchangeable with already marketed products, is unlikely to increase the combined sales volumes of nevirapine-containing products thus not having an adverse effect on the environment. This was considered acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Methods

## STUDY DESIGN

Study P1HA08002 was an open label, randomised, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single dose crossover bioequivalence study conducted in healthy, adult subjects under fasting conditions.

Subjects were confined to the clinical facility from at least 10 hours prior to each drug administration until  24  hours  after  dosing  and  were  requested  to  return  to  the  clinic  for  the  36,  48,  72,  120  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

168 hours  post-dosing  ambulatory  samples.  For  ambulatory  samples  a  ±1  hour  return  window  was allowed. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two dosing sequences.

Subjects  fasted  from  at  least  10  hours  prior  to  each  drug  administration  until  at  least  4  hours  after dosing.  Fluids  were  not  allowed  from  1  hour  prior  to  dosing  until  1  hour  after  dosing  with  the exception  of  240  ml  of  room  temperature  water  administered  with  the  dose.  When  fluids  were  not restricted, water was allowed ad libitum .  Lunch was provided approximately four hours after dosing and dinner was provided approximately ten hours after dosing during each period.

Blood samples were collected over a period of 168 hours. Nineteen (19) blood samples per period x 2 study periods (total of 38 samples, approximately 228 ml total volume) were taken for pharmacokinetic analysis during each group. The sampling times were as follows: pre-dose, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 120 and 168 hours post dosing. The pre-dose samples were taken up to 90 minutes prior to dosing. The actual time of sample collection was documented.

The washout period between the two treatments was 28 days. The clinical part of the study and the analytical portion of study were performed by contract research organisations. The study protocol was approved by the ethics review committee.

The CHMP noted that the study was planned in such a way that the decision to continue dosing with Group  2  was  determined  following  the  review  of  the  safety  (AEs)  and  pharmacokinetic  data  from Group 1, and requested clarification on this approach. The applicant explained that after review of the data from Group 1 the study would only have stopped for futility reasons or if there had been a safety concern. Therefore the overall type 1 error was preserved at 5% and the CHMP concluded that it is appropriate to consider the pooled results for group 1 and group 2 for the bioequivalence assessment.

ANALYTICAL METHODS Nevirapine was analysed using a LC/MS/MS technique. The analytical method was considered adequately validated. PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES Pharmacokinetic parameters for nevirapine plasma concentration were calculated with SAS Version 9.1  using  standard  noncompartmental  approaches.  The  following  pharmacokinetic  parameters  for nevirapine concentrations were calculated: AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ ,  AUC0-t/AUC0-∞ ,  C max ,  T max ,  K el ,  and t 1/2 . Values for the Tmax parameter were analyzed by a non-parametric approach. The primary pharmacokinetic parameters were ln-transformed values of Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ . STATISTICAL METHODS The statistical analysis was performed using SAS software. The  Analyses  of  Variance  (ANOVA)  was  calculated  based  on  the  ln-transformed  pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and  Cmax.  The  ANOVA model included group, sequence, period nested within group and formulation as fixed effects and subject nested within group sequence as a random effect. Sequence was tested using subject nested within group sequence as the error term. A 10% level of significance was used to test the sequence effect. A 5% level of significance was used to test the period  effect.  Each  analysis  of  variance  included  calculation  of  least  squares  means,  the  difference between adjusted formulation means and the standard error associated with this difference. With an intra-subject coefficient of variability of 28% and a fixed type-I error of 5%, a total sample size  of  thirty-six  (36)  subjects  was  expected  to  attain  at  least  80%  statistical  power  to  detect  a difference  between  the  Test  and  Reference  treatments,  assuming  the  difference  is  within  5%.  An additional four subjects were enrolled to account for potential drop-outs. Medicinal product no longer authorised

All  values  below  the  lower  limit  of  quantification  (BLQ)  were  considered  as  zero  during  the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. Any  missed  samples  or non-reportable values were considered  missed  as  if  they  had  not  been  scheduled  for  collection,  and  replaced  with  a  '.'  in  the statistical analysis. The applicant states that there were no unusual features observed in the data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Bioequivalence  was  to  be  concluded  if  the  90%  confidence  intervals  of  Test/Reference  ratios  of geometric means of Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ were all within the interval of 80.00% to 125.00%.

## · Results

38  out  of  40  subjects  completed  the  study  (19  from  each  group)  and  were  included  in  the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. Two subjects were excluded during the conduct of the trial due to the following reasons:

- -One subject from  group  1  voluntarily  withdrew  prior  to  period  2  check-in  due  to  schedule conflicts;
- -One subject from group 2 voluntarily withdrew prior to period 2 check-in due to an adverse event.

The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  ratio  of  geometric  means  of  AUC0-t ,  AUC0-inf transformed data) are within the limits of 80% to 125%. While the mean ratio of AUC0-t/AUC0-∞ for test and reference suggest an extrapolation of &lt; 20% of the overall AUC, individual patient data suggest that in 7/38 patients (18%) the ration of AUC0-t/ AUC0-∞ is &lt; 0.8, indicating a &gt; 20% extrapolation. However, as the sampling scheme goes beyond 72 h post dose, this  is  considered  acceptable  as the  absorption phase and  most  of  the  elimination  phase  were covered. Safety data In total 20 adverse events (AEs) were observed, 10 each with the test and reference formulation. With both the test and the reference formulation, 9 out of 10 AEs were considered mild, while 1 event with each formulation was considered to be of moderate severity. No serious AEs were reported. With the test  formulation,  3  AEs  were  judged  to  be  possibly  or  likely  related  to  the  study  drug.  With  the reference formulation, 9 AEs were judged to be possibly or likely related to the study drug.  Conclusions Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study  Nevirapine  Teva  is  considered  bioequivalent  with Viramune.

##  Risk Management Plan

The application for a generic medicinal product is based on a reference product for which no safety concern  requiring specific risk minimisation activities has been  identified. Therefore, a risk management plan was not considered necessary for this generic medicinal product.

## · User consultation

The results of a user consultation of the Package leaflet have been provided and the qualitative and qualitative evaluation was considered acceptable.

## Discussion on Clinical aspects

For the demonstration of bioequivalence an open label, randomised, two-treatment, two-period, twosequence,  single  dose  crossover  study  was  conducted  in  healthy,  adult  subjects  under  fasting conditions.  The  overall  design  of  the  study  as  well  as  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  defining  the study population were acceptable. The product is an immediate release formulation. According to the SPC of the reference product, the product can be taken with or without food. There is no relevant accumulation with repeated doses. Therefore, a single dose bioequivalence study in the fasting state is appropriate. The 200 mg dose (i.e. administration of one single tablet of test and reference product, respectively) was selected for the bioequivalence study. This is acceptable considering that the standard daily dose of nevirapine in adults is 400 mg in two divided doses and that nevirapine has linear pharmacokinetics after a single dose administration in a dose range of 200 mg to 400 mg. The sampling time and blood collection times were adequate to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters. There  were  three  subjects  with  positive  plasma  concentrations  at  the  beginning  of  period  II,  in  all cases the plasma concentration relative to Cmax was low (&lt;1%). This is not considered to significantly affect the study results. The washout period of 28 days is hence judged to be acceptable. The analytical method used for quantification of nevirapine in the bioequivalence study is sufficiently sensitive and allows accurate and reproducible quantification. The pharmacokinetic variables  and  evaluation  criteria  follow  the  applicable  European  requirements and are appropriate for this study. The statistical methods are adequately described. For nevirapine, the Test/Reference ratios of geometric means were 101.6% (90% CI 97.18-106.14%) for AUC0-t, 99.1% (90% CI 97.09-101.18%) for AUC0-∞ ,  and 99.8% (90% CI 95.08 - 104.77%) for Cmax.. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals were all contained within the protocoldefined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. It can be concluded that bioequivalence of test product and reference product under fasting conditions has been demonstrated. 3.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

This application concerns a generic version of nevirapine tablets. The reference product Viramune is indicated  for  the  treatment  of  HIV  -1  infection  in  combination  with  other  antiretroviral  agents.  No nonclinical studies have been provided for this generic application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance nevirapine; the applicant's clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient.

The pivotal basis forms a standard bioequivalence study with a two-period, two-sequence crossover design. The study design was adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of an immediate release oral formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. A single dose fasting study was  appropriate  as  there  is  no  food  effect  on  the  bioavailability  of  nevirapine.  Choice  of  dose, sampling  points,  overall  sampling  time  as  well  as  wash-out  period  were  adequate.  The  analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate.

The test formulation of 200 mg Nevirapine Teva met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the 200 mg reference product (Viramune). The point estimates and their 90% confidence  intervals  for  the  parameters  AUC0-t,,  AUC0-∞ ,  and  C max were  all  contained  within  the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated.

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are required beyond those included in the product information. Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered  that the benefit/risk ratio of Nevirapine  Teva  in  combination  with  other  anti-retroviral  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of HIV-1  infected adults, adolescents, and children of any age was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
