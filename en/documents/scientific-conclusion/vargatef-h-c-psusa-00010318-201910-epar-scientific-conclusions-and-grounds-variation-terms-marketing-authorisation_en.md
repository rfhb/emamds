## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for nintedanib (oncology indications), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

The MAH presented data from all sources regarding 'Sepsis', reported cumulatively and during the interval. Sepsis is listed in the Product Information as a common adverse reaction, and there is also a warning in the relevant sections of the Product Information for neutropenia and sepsis. The MAH analysed the data from 17  fatal  cases  of  sepsis  reported  cumulatively  in  the  post-marketing  period.  These  fatal  cases  are approximately 1/3 of the 50 cases of sepsis reported cumulatively. Four (4) fatal cases were reported in the interval.  There  was  no  consistent  pattern  identified  regarding  the  aetiology  for  the  sepsis  events cumulatively or in the interval. However, in two of the cases reported in the interval no other factor could be found besides the administration of the combination of Nintedanib and Docetaxel. In both cases, the reporter had considered that there was a reasonable possibility for a causal role of Vargatef.

The PRAC considers that the role of Vargatef cannot be discarded in the cumulative or interval fatal cases, as  sepsis  is  a  common  adverse  reaction  and  vargatef  is  co-administered  with  docetaxel.  The  product information is updated to inform about the fatal cases of sepsis and warn patients about early detection of signs of sepsis.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nintedanib (oncology indications) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing nintedanib (oncology indications) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.
