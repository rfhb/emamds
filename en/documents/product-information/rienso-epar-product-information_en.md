ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Rienso 30 mg/ml solution for infusion.

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

1 ml of solution contains 30 mg of iron as ferumoxytol. Each vial of 17 ml solution contains 510 mg of iron as ferumoxytol. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for infusion. Black to reddish brown solution Osmolality: 270-330 mosm/kg pH: 6.5 to 8.0 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rienso is indicated for the intravenous treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The diagnosis of iron deficiency must be based on appropriate laboratory tests (see section 4.2). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Rienso should only be administered when staff trained to evaluate and manage anaphylactic reactions is immediately available, in an environment where full resuscitation facilities can be assured. Patients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions including monitoring of blood pressure and pulse during and for at least 30 minutes following each infusion of Rienso. In addition, patients should be placed in a reclining or semi-reclining position during infusion and for at least 30 minutes thereafter (see section 4.4). Posology Treatment Course Medicinal product no longer authorised

The recommended course of Rienso is based on the patient's pre-treatment haemoglobin and body weight as provided in Table 1.

Each 510 mg dose is administered as an intravenous infusion for at least 15 minutes. For patients receiving two doses, the second 510 mg infusion is to be administered 2 to 8 days later as per Table1.

| ≤ 10 g/dl    | 2 × 510 mg iron (2 vials)                                           | 2 × 510 mg iron (2 vials)                                           |

The maximum dose is 1020 mg (2 vials) and the two doses of Rienso must not be administered at the same time.

Rienso should not be given to patients if their haemoglobin is greater than 12 g/dl, serum Transferrin Saturation (TSAT) is greater than 50% or Ferritin is greater than 800 ng/ml (see section 4.4). Patients should be re-assessed at least one month after the completion of a course of Rienso and this should include laboratory testing of haematologic and blood iron parameters. Re-treatment To maintain the target haemoglobin value, re-treatment with Rienso may be given after the patient has been re-assessed and confirmed to be iron deficient. For maintenance therapy and patient monitoring, the recommendations of current guidelines (e.g. Revised European Best Practice Guidelines) should be followed. Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Rienso in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years has not been established. No data are available. Therefore Rienso should not be administered to children and adolescents below the age of 18 years (see section 5.1). Special population - patients receiving haemodialysis For patients receiving haemodialysis, Rienso should be administered once the blood pressure is stable and the patient has completed at least one hour of haemodialysis. Hepatic Impairment Rienso has  not  been specifically studied in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment;  clinical  experience  is limited  to  8  patients.  In  patients  with  liver  dysfunction,  parenteral iron should only  be  administered after careful risk/benefit assessment. No change in dosage is recommended from Table 1. Method of administration Intravenous use by infusion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Rienso should be administered as an infusion in 50-250 ml of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride or sterile 5% glucose for at least 15 minutes (see sections 6.3 and 6.6).

## 4.3 Contraindications

The use of Rienso is contraindicated in cases of:

- Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to Rienso or any of its excipients listed in section 6.1
- Patients with any known history of drug allergy including hypersensitivity to other parenteral iron products
- Evidence of iron overload

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Anaemia not caused by iron deficiency

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Hypersensitivity Reactions

Parenterally administered iron preparations can cause hypersensitivity reactions including serious and potentially fatal anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported after previously uneventful doses of parenteral iron complexes.

The risk is enhanced for patients with known allergies including drug allergies, including patients with a history of severe asthma, eczema or other atopic allergy (see section 4.3).

Rienso should not be administered to patients with iron overload. Rienso must not be given to patients if their haemoglobin is greater than 12 g/dl, serum Transferrin Saturation (TSAT) is greater than 50% or ferritin is greater than 800 ng/ml (see section 4.2).

There is also an increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions to parenteral iron complexes in patients with immune or inflammatory conditions (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis). Rienso should only be administered when staff trained to evaluate and manage anaphylactic reactions is immediately available, in an environment where full resuscitation facilities can be assured. Patients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions including monitoring of blood pressure and pulse during and for at least 30 minutes following each infusion of Rienso. In addition, patients should be placed in a reclining or semi-reclining position during infusion and for at least 30 minutes thereafter. If hypersensitivity reactions or signs of intolerance occur during administration, the treatment must be stopped immediately. Facilities for cardio respiratory resuscitation and equipment for handling acute anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions should be available, including an injectable 1:1000 adrenaline solution. Additional treatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids should be given as appropriate. Fatal and life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions have been observed with Rienso in the post marketing setting. Clinical presentation has included anaphylactic type reactions presenting with cardiac arrest/cardiorespiratory arrest, clinically significant hypotension, syncope, and unresponsiveness (see section 4.8). Elderly patients (&gt; 65 years of age) or patients with multiple co-morbidities who experience a serious hypersensitivity reaction may have more severe outcomes. Hypotension Severe adverse reactions of clinically significant hypotension have been reported. Hypotension may follow Rienso administration with or without accompanying signs of hypersensitivity (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypotension following each Rienso administration. Iron Overload Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Immunologic Disease or Infection

Parenteral iron should be used with caution in cases of immunologic disease or acute or chronic infection. It is not recommended to administer Rienso to patients with ongoing bacteraemia.

## Re-treatment / Long term use

Limited clinical study data is available regarding re-treatment with Rienso and no clinical study data is available for repeated long term use. For information on post-marketing experience see section 5.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ethanol and sodium content

This medicinal product contains small amounts of ethanol (alcohol), less than 100 mg per 17 ml vial. This medicinal product contains less than 23 mg sodium per 17 ml vial, i.e., is essentially 'sodium free'.

## Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging

Administration of Rienso may transiently affect the diagnostic ability of MR imaging. Anticipated MR imaging studies should be conducted prior to the administration of Rienso. The effect on vascular MR imaging lasts approximately 1-2 days while tissue diagnostic imaging may be affected for up to 6 months.

MR images are interpretable earlier by readers aware of the recent administration of Rienso or by the use of T1- or proton density-weighted MR pulse sequences. Rienso will not interfere with X-ray, computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), ultrasound or nuclear medicine imaging. Interference with Serological Testing In the 24 hours following administration of Rienso, laboratory assays may overestimate serum iron and transferrin bound iron by also measuring the iron in the Rienso complex. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. As with all parenteral iron preparations the absorption of oral iron is reduced when administered concomitantly. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential and pregnancy There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of Rienso in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). A careful risk/benefit evaluation is therefore required before use during pregnancy and Rienso should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary (see section 4.4). Iron  deficiency  anaemia  occurring  in  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  can  in  many  cases  be  treated with oral iron. Treatment with Rienso should be confined to second and third trimester if the benefit is judged to outweigh the potential risk for both the mother and the foetus. Rienso is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using adequate contraception. Breastfeeding It is unknown whether Rienso is excreted in human milk. Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of Rienso in milk (see section 5.3). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## A risk to breastfeeding newborns/infants cannot be excluded.

A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Rienso therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of the therapy for the mother.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

No adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance were noted in adult rats (see Section 5.3). In a prenatal and postnatal developmental study in rats adverse effects on sexual maturation and on the ability to produce a litter were noted in the F1-generation (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Rienso may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In the case of symptoms of dizziness, confusion or light headedness following the administration of Rienso, patients should not drive or use machinery until the symptoms have ceased.

No studies regarding effects on the ability to drive or operate machines have been performed. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile In clinical trials involving 1562 subjects with CKD, adverse reactions were seen in 7.9% of patients who received Rienso, of which 0.2% were considered serious. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhoea, constipation, nausea and vomiting), headache, dizziness and hypotension, all occurring in less than 2.5% of patients. Serious hypersensitivity or hypotensive reactions are uncommon (less than 1 case per 100 patients) and were reported in 0.2% (3/1562) of subjects with CKD who received Rienso during the clinical studies. One of these three cases was also characterized as an anaphylactoid reaction. Tabulated list of adverse reactions Table 2 presents all adverse experiences observed during the clinical studies in which 1562 subjects with CKD received two injections of 510 mg of Rienso separated by an interval of 2 to 8 days and post-marketing experience.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions is an important way to gather more information to continuously monitor the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Any suspected adverse reactions should be reported via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

No data from clinical trials are available regarding overdose of Rienso in humans. During the post-marketing phase, several patients received an overdose of Rienso ranging from 1 g in 1 day to 2.5 g over 21 days. Only one case of minor rash was observed. Excessive administration of Rienso may lead to accumulation of iron in storage sites potentially leading to haemosiderosis.

Periodic monitoring of laboratory parameters of iron storage, such as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, enables recognition of iron accumulation. However, caution should be exercised in interpreting serum iron levels in the 24 hours following administration of Rienso as laboratory assays may overestimate serum iron and transferrin bound iron by also measuring the iron in Rienso. Please see the iron overload section 4.4 and for dosing guidance, see section 4.2.

Overdose should be treated, if required, with an iron chelating agent. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Not yet assigned, ATC code: Not yet assigned Mechanism of Action Rienso is a colloidal iron-carbohydrate complex. It includes iron oxide particles with an iron oxide core surrounded by a polyglucose sorbitol-carboxymethylether shell. The shell isolates the bioactive iron from plasma components until the iron-carbohydrate complex enter reticuloendothelial system macrophages of the liver, spleen and bone marrow. The iron is then released intracellularly from the iron-carbohydrate complex within vesicles in macrophages. Iron then either enters the intracellular storage iron pool (e.g., ferritin) or is transferred to plasma transferrin for transport to erythroid precursor cells for incorporation into haemoglobin. Clinical Efficacy and Safety The safety and efficacy of Rienso (cumulative dose of 1.02 grams) for the treatment of iron deficiency in CKD patients with IDA were assessed in three randomized, open-label, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3). The principal efficacy results at Day 35 from the controlled phase of each study are shown in Table 3. This includes the Baseline and mean change to Day 35 in haemoglobin (Hgb, g/dl), transferrin saturation (TSAT, %) and ferritin (ng/ml) as well as the proportion of subjects who were Hgb Responders at Day 35 (defined as proportion of subjects with an increase in Hgb of at least 1.0 g/dl) in each treatment group for Studies 1, 2, and 3.

Following completion of the controlled phase of each of the Phase 3 trials, patients who were iron deficient and anaemic could be optionally retreated and receive two additional 510 mg intravenous injections of Rienso for a total cumulative dose of 2.04 g. Overall, 69 patients received a total cumulative dose of 2.04 g. Adverse reactions following this repeat Rienso dosing were similar in character and frequency to those observed following the first two intravenous injections.

* p≤0.001 for main efficacy endpoint Hgb = haemoglobin; TSAT = transferrin saturation; SD = standard deviation In all three studies, patients with CKD and iron deficiency anaemia were randomized to treatment with Rienso or oral iron. Rienso was administered as two 510 mg intravenous injections (separated by 2 to 8 days) and oral iron (ferrous fumarate) was administered at a total daily dose of 200 mg elemental iron for 21 days. The major study outcomes assessed the change in haemoglobin from Baseline to Day 35. Studies 1 and 2 enrolled patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD and Study 3 enrolled patients who were undergoing haemodialysis. In Study 1, the mean age of patients was 66 years (range, 23 to 95); 60% were female; 65% were Caucasian, 32% were Black, and 2% were other races. In the Rienso and oral iron groups, 42% and 44% of patients, respectively, were receiving erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) at Baseline. In Study 2, the mean age of patients was 65 years (range, 31 to 96); 61% were female; 58% were Caucasian, 35% were Black, and 7% were other races. In the Rienso and oral iron groups, 36% and 43% of patients, respectively, were receiving ESAs at Baseline. In Study 3, the mean age of patients was 60 years (range, 24 to 87); 43% were female; 34% were Caucasian, 59% were Black, and 7% were other races. All patients were receiving ESAs at Baseline.

In a placebo-controlled, cross-over trial, 713 patients with CKD received a single 510 mg dose of Rienso and placebo. Adverse reactions reported in these patients were similar in character and frequency to those observed in the other clinical trials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Post-Marketing Data from Dialysis Clinics in the United States

Retrospective observational data from three large haemodialysis clinics in the US over a 1 year period included the treatment of over 8,600 patients with more than 33,300 administered doses of Rienso; nearly 50% of patients received repeat dosing with 4 or more doses. Mean haemoglobin increased (0.5-0.9 g/dl) post-treatment and stabilised in the range of 11-11.7 g/dl over the 10 month post-dose period; no new safety signals were identified with repeat dosing.

## Paediatric Population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Rienso in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties The pharmacokinetic (PK) behaviour of Rienso has been examined in healthy subjects and in patients with CKD stage 5D on haemodialysis. Rienso exhibited dose-dependent, capacity-limited elimination from plasma with a half life of approximately 16 hours in humans. The clearance (CL) was decreased with increased doses of Rienso. Volume of distribution (Vd) was consistent with plasma volume, and the mean maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and terminal half-life (t1/2) values increased with dose. The estimated values of CL and Vd following two 510 mg doses of Rienso administered intravenously within 24 hours were 69.1 ml/hr and 3.3 l, respectively. The Cmax and time of maximum concentration (tmax) were 206 mcg/ml and 0.32 hr, respectively. Rate of infusion had no influence on Rienso PK parameters. No gender differences in Rienso PK parameters were observed. Rienso is not removed by haemodialysis. 5.3 Preclinical Safety Data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, local tolerance and immunotoxicity. In a 4 week repeated dose toxicity study in rats after a recovery of 26 weeks hepatic changes (focal or multifocal haemorrhage, hemorrhagic necrosis, chronic inflammation, and/or bile duct hyperplasia) were seen in the female animals (the cumulative HED of the dose groups compares to a safety multiple of 5.1 and 10.5 to the cumulative human therapeutic dose (2 x 510 mg Fe) in a 60 kg human). Such effects were not seen in the male animals of that study or in the 13 weeks repeated dose toxicity study in rats (without recovery). As seen from clinical data there is no evidence that these effects seen in female rats are relevant for humans. No carcinogenicity studies were performed with Rienso. No adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance were noted in rats given IV Rienso at doses up to 18 mg Fe/kg/day (Human Equivalent Dose of 2.9 mg Fe/kg/day). Administration of Rienso during organogenesis in rats at maternally toxic doses of 100 mg Fe/kg/day caused a decrease in foetal weights. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In rabbits administration of Rienso during organogenesis induced decreased foetal weights and external and/or soft tissue malformations (malrotated or flexed fore- and malrotated hindlimbs, internal hydrocephaly, absent brains, cleft palate and microglossia) at the high dose of 45.3 mg Fe/kg/day (HED of 14.6 mg Fe/kg/day), a dose which induced only minimal maternal toxicity.

In a pre-natal and post-natal development study in rats sexual maturation was delayed in male pups in the high dose of 60 mg Fe/kg/day (HED of 9.7 mg Fe/kg/day). In female pups of the mid and high dose groups of 30 mg Fe/kg/day and 60 mg Fe/kg/day respectively (HED of 4.8 mg Fe/kg/day and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

9.7 mg Fe/kg/day, respectively) sexual maturation was delayed and a disruption of the oestrus cycle was noted in some females. The ability to produce a litter (reproductive competence) was reduced in high dose males and in mid and high dose females, irrespective of whether F1 males were mated with F1 females or F1 males were mated with naive females and vice versa.

In a lactation study in rats, there was minimal excretion of Rienso or Rienso-derived radioactivity into milk following single IV administration of approximately 100 mg Fe/kg (HED of 16.1 mg Fe/kg, approximately 2 times the recommended 510 mg human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) of either the unlabelled, 59 Fe or 14 C-labelled product to lactating rats 10-11 days post-parturition, which peaked at 8 to 24 hours post-administration.

## Rienso 30 mg/ml solution for infusion Iron as ferumoxytol

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important information for you.

-Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. -If you get any side effects talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Rienso is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you receive Rienso 3. How Rienso is given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Rienso 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Rienso is and what it is used for Rienso is an iron preparation, containing the active substance ferumoxytol, which is given by infusion into a vein. It is used to treat iron deficiency anaemia resulting from a lack of stored iron, in adult patients with reduced kidney function. Iron is an essential element required to make haemoglobin, a molecule in red blood cells that enables oxygen to be carried around the body. When there is insufficient iron in the body, haemoglobin cannot be formed, resulting in anaemia (low levels of haemoglobin). The aim of Rienso therapy is to replenish the body's iron stores. 2. What you need to know before you receive Rienso Before you were prescribed Rienso, the doctor will have carried out a blood test to make sure that you have iron deficiency anaemia. You must not receive Rienso: -if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to the product or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -if you have a history of medicine allergy or have experienced serious allergic (hypersensitive) reactions to other injectable iron preparations.
- -if you have iron overload (too much iron in your body).
- -if your anaemia is not caused by iron deficiency.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Rienso:

- -if you have a history of medicine allergy.
- -if you have systemic lupus erythematosus.

ANNEX IV SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS RECOMMENDING THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATIONS Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Rienso, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Cumulatively 21 cases of hypersensitivity (8 serious, 13 non-serious) have been reported during clinical trials. Cumulatively, since the granting of the marketing authorisation up to the data lockpoint (DLP) of the current PSUR, a total of 527 reported post-marketing cases of hypersensitivity reactions of which more than 50 % were serious including life threatening allergic reactions (264 serious, 263 non-serious). In total 42 fatal cases have been reported cumulatively. 29 of them were associated with hypersensitivity reactions. Within the limitations inherent to post-marketing reporting, the following reporting rate can be calculated: As of 30 June 2014, the cumulative overall post-marketing reporting rate of hypersensitivity based on 2 g per person per year is: 527/266,914 × 100 = 0.20 %. During this PSUR covering period, 45 new cases of hypersensitivity reactions have been reported: 24 serious including one fatal case already reported as part of the previous PSUR as late-breaking information and 21 non-serious cases.

After the DLP of the present PSUR, 6 additional fatal cases of hypersensitivity reactions with ferumoxytol have been reported. Two of these reports were included by the MAH as late breaking information into this PSUR. The additional four cases were reported after this PSUR was submitted for assessment. All six fatal hypersensitivity cases were reported in the US and involved elderly patients (&gt; 65 years of age) with co-morbidities. One patient had a prior history of drug allergy. In 5 out of these 6 cases, ferumoxytol was administered via IV injection (either quick or slow IV push), for the remaining case the method of administration is unknown. It should be noted that 28 out of the 35 fatal cases of hypersensitivity reactions occurred in elderly patients (&gt; 65 years of age). There is no evidence that the risk of hypersensitivity reactions as such is increased in elderly patients however these patients have an increased risk of complications. Considering the cumulative number of reported cases of hypersensitivity reactions (serious, nonserious) including 35 fatal cases, the PRAC considered new additional risk minimisation measures in addition to the ones already implemented as part of the previous PSUR, and recommended that a warning on the severity of the outcome of hypersensitivity reactions in patients over 65 or with comorbidities should be added in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Interference with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) No spontaneous post-marketing reports of MRI interference have been received to date. Within this PSUR, a further literature review has been provided by the MAH identifying 9 relevant publications addressing ferumoxytol and MRI. Four case reports have been published describing the supraparamagnetic effects of ferumoxytol on MR imaging and emphasized the importance for the radiologists to be aware if a patient received ferumoxytol recently. Based on a limited number of case reports, the influence of ferumoxytol on the interpretation of MRIs, due to its unique crystalline structure appears to be primarily noted in the first few weeks after administration and, based on animal data, dissipated within 3 months. The MAH is of the opinion that the current EU SmPC accurately reflects the current literature and provides appropriate guidance to EU practitioners. However, the MAH acknowledges that Rostoker and Cohen recommend a minimum of 6 months between ferumoxytol's administration, which they base on the study with 6 healthy volunteers published by Storey et al. Therefore the MAH proposed as part of this PSUR to amend the current warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC to reflect that interference with MRI can occur up to 6 months after administration of ferumoxytoll which was agreed by the PRAC. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Therefore, in view of available data regarding hypersensitivity reactions and interference with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Rienso, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance ferumoxytol is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.
