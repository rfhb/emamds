## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on bone mineral density decrease from clinical trials, the literature, spontaneous reports, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil and bone mineral density decrease is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC also considered that the current warning/precaution on Bone effects should be further strengthened. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
