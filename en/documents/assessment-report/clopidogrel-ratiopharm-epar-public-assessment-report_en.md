## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Clopidogrel ratiopharm 75 mg film-coated tablets is a generic medicinal product containing clopidogrel as clopidogrel besilate as active substance.

The reference medicinal product is Plavix 75 mg  film-coated tablets, which contain clopidogrel hydrogensulphate.

Clopidogrel  is  a  non-competitive  inhibitor  of  adenosine  diphosphate  (ADP)  at  the  platelet  receptors.  The effect of ADP on platelets is mediated by two G-protein coupled P2Y receptors (P2Y1 and P2Y12) and the cation  channel-coupled  P2X1  receptor.  The  adenylate  cyclase-coupled  ADP  receptor  P2Y12  is  the  main target  of  clopidogrel  and  leads  to  inhibition  of  platelet  activation,  aggregation,  and  Gp  IIb/IIIa  receptor activation. Clopidogrel is a thienopyridine and only the S -enantiomer is pharmacologically active. The safety and efficacy profile of clopidogrel has been demonstrated in several clinical trials details of which can  be  found  in  the  EPAR  for  Plavix.  In  addition,  there  is  a  long-term  post-marketing  experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Clopidogrel ratiopharm 75mg film-coated tablet contains clopidogrel besilate. Since this application is a generic application referring to the reference medicinal product Plavix, summary of the clinical data of clopidogrel hydrogensulphate is available and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and safety have been conducted with clopidogrel besilate. The indication for Clopidogrel ratiopharm is different from the reference medicinal product. It is part of the indication approved for the reference medicinal product. The therapeutic indication of Clopidogrel ratiopharm is: Clopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in: · Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), ischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease. The therapeutic indication of Plavix is: Clopidogrel is indicated in adults for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in: · Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), ischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease. · Patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome: - Non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction), including patients undergoing a stent placement following percutaneous coronary intervention, in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). - ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction, in combination with ASA in medically treated patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy. 2.2 Quality aspects Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Active Substance

The chemical name of clopidogrel besilate is: (S) - (2-chlorophenyl)-6, 7-dihydrothieno [3,2-c]- pyridine -5 (4H) - acetic acid methyl ester benzene sulphonate, corresponding to the molecular formula C16H16ClO2NS *C6H5SO3H  and  relative  molecular  mass  479.06.  It  is  a  white  to  off-white  crystalline,  non-hygroscopic powder,  practically  insoluble  in  water.  The  pKa  value  was  determined  to  9.67.  No  polymorphism  of clopidogrel besilate is known.

## · Manufacture

The  manufacture  of  the  newly  developed  conventional-release  film-coated  tablet  is  based  on  granulation followed by blending of the resulting granules with an external phase, compression to tablet cores and filmcoating. The  drug  substance  clopidogrel  besilate  is  uniformly  distributed  in  the  film-coated  tablet. Bioequivalence study of Clopidogrel ratiopharm and Plavix has been provided.

Clopidogrel besilate is manufactured in either of two manufacturing sites by a six step chemical synthesis. An ASMF has been submitted. Critical process parameters of all stages with appropriate justification have been described. Starting materials are described in sufficient detail as well as synthetic intermediates. The active substance has one chiral centre therefore it exhibits chirality - clopidogrel besilate is synthesized as  the  S-enantiomer.  No  racemisation  was  observed  under  the  commercial  manufacturing  process  and proposed storage conditions and also under conditions for drug product manufacture. · Specification The drug substance specification as tested by the finished product manufacturer includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (IR and HPLC), solubility (in-house), loss on drying (in-house), residue on ignition (in-house), heavy metals (Ph.Eur), specific optical rotation (polarimetry), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), methyl ester of benzene sulphonic acid (GC/MS, non-routine test). Three registration batches of clopidogrel besilate for each manufacturing site have been submitted. Data of these six batches were in compliance with the specifications · Stability Stability  was  studied  in  accordance  with  ICH  guidelines  under  normal  (25°C/60%  RH),  accelerated (40°C/75%RH) and intermediate (30°C/65%RH) conditions for three registration batches. Results of primary long term studies for up to 18 months have been provided. Overall the obtained results support the proposed re-test period and storage conditions. Medicinal Product · Pharmaceutical Development The tablets have been developed with the objective of developing a conventional release film-coated tablets bioequivalent  with  the  innovator's  product  Plavix  tablets.  Clopidogrel  ratiopharm  product  represents  an alternative to the originator since it contains the same active substance (clopidogrel base) different in the salt (besilate instead of bisulphate) with the same dosage strength and dosage form. The potential risk of occurrence of contamination with benzene sulphonic acid methyl ester in clopidogrel besilate was further elucidated in the documentation. A GC/MS method has been established and LOD of benzene sulphonic acid methyl ester is far below the TTC value of 1.5 μ g/day intake of a genotoxic impurity mentioned in the Guideline on the Limits of Genotoxic Impurities. Results  of  batch  analysis  provided  on  several  batches  of  clopidogrel  besilate  from  both  active  substance manufacturing  sites,  and  the  possible  genotoxic  impurity  in  question  was  below  LOD.  The  content  of benzene  sulphonic  acid  isopropyl  ester  in  the  drug  product  is  controlled  by  a  validated  method  and  a specification limit has been set by the finished product manufacturer. Medicinal product no longer authorised

During pharmaceutical development different clopidogrel salts were considered and tested and the free base as well as formulations with or without stabilizing agents to get the most stable composition. Based on the stability results besilate salt has been chosen with respect to total impurities. Several polymorphic forms of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate (bisulphate) salt contained in Plavix are known. In contrast, up to now no polymorphs of the besilate salt are known.

Widely  used,  common  excipients  have  been  chosen  and  compatibility  with  the  active  substance  was demonstrated.

The  developed  formulation  provides  rapid  disintegration  of  the  tablets  and  rapid  clopidogrel  release  and therefore particle size was not considered to be an important factor.

Comparative dissolution profiles of four different batches including bio-batch of the tested product with the similar results and release of more than 85 % within 15 minutes have been submitted.

Comparative dissolution profiles of the bio-batch of the tested product and reference products from different European countries including bio-batch have been submitted. Results demonstrate similar profiles for test and reference. Impurity profiles of a number of reference products sourced from different European countries (the same as for  the  comparative  dissolution  profiles  experiment)  and  three  batches  of  the  tested  product  have  been evaluated on impurity and active substance assay. The amount of impurities is negligible for all batches. · Manufacture of the Product The manufacturing process comprises four main steps: granulation, blending, compression, film-coating. A number of process parameters have been identified as potentially critical for the quality of the finished product and appropriate in-process controls is performed during the manufacture of the film-coated tablets. · Product Specification The  product  release  and  shelf-life  specifications  include  tests  for  appearance  (visual),  identification (clopidogrel  besilate:  HPLC,  UV,  titanium  dioxide:  chemical  reaction,  non-routine  test),  uniformity  of dosage  units-mass  variation  (PhEur),  dissolution  (PhEur),  assay  (HPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC), water content (PhEur), enantiomeric purity (HPLC, non-routine test), benzene sulphonic acid isopropyl ester (GC/MS- non-routine test), residual solvent (GC, non-routine test) and microbiological quality (PhEur- nonroutine test). Validation data for three production and four pilot scale batches of the finished product have been submitted. Validation plan for three production scale batches has been described including risk analysis. All presented batches comply with the proposed specification and demonstrate consistent manufacture. · Adventitious Agents None of the starting materials and excipients used for the manufacture Clopidogrel ratiopharm film-coated tablets do contain materials that are of animal or human origin. · Stability of the Product Four pilot scale batches of Clopidogrel ratiopharm film-coated tablets were put on long-term (25±2°C/60±5%RH)  for  up  to  24  months,  intermediate  (30±2°C/65±5%RH)  for  up  to  12  months  and accelerated (40±2°C/75±5%RH) stability testing conditions for up to six months. The product shows no trends in any controlled parameter except the slight increase of water content, tablet hardness  and  of  one  impurity  content  at  any  of  the  storage  conditions.  However  these  changes  did  not present any significant change in the overall quality over time. Medicinal product no longer authorised

All the results remained well within the specification limits during all the stability studies.

Photostability study as per the relevant guideline has been performed and the obtained data show that the product is not sensitive to light.

In conclusion the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are accepted.

## Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  has  been

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

## 2.3 Non-Clinical aspects

Clopidogrel is widely used well-known substance. Its pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties are well characterised and new non clinical studies were not provided. This generic application contains  a  different  salt  of  the  active  substance.  On  the  basis  of  the  CHMP  Guidance  for  users  of  the centralised  procedure  for  generic  application  (EMEA/CHMP/225411/2006),  when  different  salts  of  the active  substance  of  the  reference  medicinal  product  are  used,  additional  information  providing  proof  that their safety and/or efficacy profile is not different from that of the reference medicinal product is needed. A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of clopidogrel hydrogensulphate and justifications that  the  different  clopidogrel  salt  does  not  differ  significantly  in  properties  with  regards  to  safety  and efficacy  of  the  reference  product  was  provided  on  request  of  the  CHMP.  This  is  in  accordance  with  the relevant guideline and additional non clinical studies were not considered necessary. The excipients used in drug formulation are conventional, known and already used in other medicinal products. The  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  in  line  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  Environmental  Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (CPMP/SWP/4447/00) was not submitted; however, a justification  for  omission  of  environmental  risk  assessment  was  provided.  This  was  based  on  the  fact  the generic medicinal product is intended to substitute the reference product and it will not result in additional hazard to the environment. The supplied justification for the lack of a full ERA was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 2.4 Clinical Aspects Introduction The CHMP assessment addressed pharmacokinetic data in respect of one bioequivalence study. GCP The bioequivalence study 014-06 as well as the relevant analytical procedures was conducted by a CRO in India.  It  was  stated  that  the  clinical  part  of  the  clinical  study  was  carried  out  in  accordance  which  the principles and requirements described in the ICH guideline on Good Clinical Practice. Clinical studies To  support  the  application  for  Clopidogrel  ratiopharm,  one  bioequivalence  study  014-06  comparing  the bioavailability of Clopidogrel 75 mg Tablet and Plavix following a 75 mg dose in healthy subjects under fasting conditions was presented. The study was conducted under fasting conditions. In addition, this generic product  contains  a  different  salt  of  clopidogrel  (clopidogrel  besilate)  in  comparison  with  the  reference medicinal product. Thus, the CHMP raised a major concern, since on the basis of the CHMP Guidance for users of the centralised procedure for generic application (EMEA/CHMP/225411/2006), when different salts of the active substance of the reference medicinal product are used, additional information providing proof that their safety and/or efficacy profile is not different from that of the reference medicinal product is needed.

## Pharmacokinetics

## · Methods

## STUDY DESIGN

## Study code: 014-06

An open-label, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two sequence single dose, crossover pivotal study to compare the bioavailability of Clopidogrel 75 mg CD film-coated tablets-Cimex AG, Switzerland with Plavix 75  mg  film-coated  tablets-Sanofi-Synthelabo,  Germany  in  healthy,  adult,  male,  human  subjects  under fastening conditions.

The objective of this study was to compare the bioavailability and characterise the pharmacokinetic profile of  the  generic  clopidogrel  75  mg  tablets  with  respect  to  the  reference  formulation  of  Plavix  75  mg clopidogrel film-coated tablets in healthy, adult, male population under fasting conditions and to assess the bioequivalence. This was an open-label, randomised, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence single dose crossover pivotal study performed on 46 healthy adult male non-smokers or light smokers. The study was performed in fasting subjects, measuring the parent prodrug clopidogrel. The protocol and informed consent forms  (ICFs)  were  reviewed  and  approved  by  an  Ethics  Committee  on  14  March  06.  The  study  was conducted between 16 March 06 and 26 March 06. TEST AND REFERENCE PRODUCTS Clopidogrel 75 mg tablet, batch No. 060281-75FT; Cimex AG, 4253 Liesberg, Switzerland. Plavix 75 mg, batch No. 501252; Sanofi Synthelabo GMBH, Germany. POPULATION(S) STUDIED The study population included healthy, adult males non-smokers or light smokers (up to 10 cigarettes per day), aged &gt; 18 and &lt; 45 years and with BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m 2 . All subjects had to comply with the inclusion and exclusion criteria pre-specified in the protocol and were judged eligible for enrolment in this study, based on medical and medication histories, demographic data, vital signs measurements, 12-lead ECG,  physical  examination,  a  chest  X-ray,  and  clinical  laboratory  tests.  Of  the  48  subjects  dosed,  46 completed the trial and were included in the statistical analysis. The selected population is in accordance with the NƒG  on  Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98.  The  study  has  been  conducted  in  a  population  of  Indian subjects, which is considered acceptable by the CHMP, since there is no concern that this study population would  be  less  sensitive  than  European  subjects  with  respect  to  the  detection  of  formulation-specific differences. The selection of the population as well as enrolment of light smokers has been appropriate. ANALYTICAL METHODS Plasma concentration of clopidogrel was determined by liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric method. The method was validated in the studied range. Samples were analysed between 13 April 06 to 30 April 06. Analyses were conducted at a bioanalytical laboratory in India. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES

The primary pharmacokinetic parameters defined in the protocol were AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and maximal plasma clopidogrel concentration Cmax.

## STATISTICAL METHODS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out on ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ , Cmax, and untransformed t1/2 values. Factors of subjects, treatments, sequence, and period were also evaluated in the model.  A nonparametric  test  was  carried  out  to  compare  the  Tmax  values  between  treatments.  Individual  data  were presented,  logarithmic  transformation  used,  individual  plasma  concentration-time  profiles  were  shown. Descriptive statistics was used to summarize the results. The statistical methods used were acceptable.

The results for the pharmacokinetic parameters (non-transformed values; arithmetic mean ± SD, tmax median) and for the mean ratios of the 90%CI for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax are summarised in the tables below. The pharmacokinetic parameters were not reported for subjects whose extrapolation area was found to be &gt;20%. However,  the  CHMP  did  not  consider  this  acceptable,  since  subjects  should  not  be  excluded  from  the analysis on this ground. Therefore the submission of complete statistical analysis in which the data of all subjects are included was requested. This is presented below as an appendix to the table.

Appendix, table 2: The mean pharmacokinetic parameter of clopidogrel for Reference Product-A and Test Product-B of forty-six subjects in study 014-06. The AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ ,  Cmax  were  considered  as  primary  parameters  for  bioequivalence conclusion with the proposed acceptance range of 80-125% for the AUC and 75-133% for the Cmax defined in the study protocol. However,  widening  of  the  limits  for  bioequivalence  conclusions  for  Cmax  values  was  not  acceptable according to the current CHMP recommendations. Nevertheless, since the Cmax results of the study are within the  standard  80-125%  limits  required  by  the  NƒG  on  Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98, lack of appropriate justification for widening the limits is of no importance. In total, seven adverse events (AEs) occurred during the conduct of the study 014-06. All were mild in nature and  were  resolved.  There  were  no  serious  adverse  events  or  deaths  reported.  Two  significant,  possibly related  events  were  reported:  vomiting  with  indigestion  and  diarrhoea,  but  were  resolved.    No  additional safety concerns were identified. Out of the 48 subjects dosed, 46 were included in the statistical analysis. Two study participants dropped out; one  due  to  medical  reasons  one  elected  to  withdraw  on  day  0  of  period  2.  Two  drop-out  subjects  are acceptable and it is considered to have no relevant impact on the results of the study. There were no major deviations from the study protocol and the minor deviations, such as blood sample timing, vital recordings, use of concomitant medication, were well documented.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

##  PSUR

The PSUR submission schedule for Clopidogrel ratiopharm should follow the PSUR submission schedule of the reference medicinal product.

##  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The recently published literature data indicate that the bioavailability of a single oral dose of clopidogrel and the pharmacokinetic parameters of clopidogrel, especially Cmax and AUCinf, might be increased by several folds  in  the  fed  condition  compared  to  the  fasted  condition.  The  currently  presented  clinical  study  was conducted  in  fasted  state  and  thus,  the  CHMP  requested  a  clarification  of  this  approach.  Adequate justification why bioequivalence for the generic product should be demonstrated only under fasting condition was provided. Bioequivalence studies in fasting conditions are normally recommended as mentioned in the Questions &amp; Answers on the Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Guideline (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006)  document  as  this  situation  would  be  more  sensitive  to  differences  in pharmacokinetics. In addition the dissolution studies using clopidogrel besilate conducted at three different

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.  The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market.  Risk Management Plan Risk  Management  Plan  has  not  been  submitted.  Since  the  application  concerns  a  generic  of  a  respective reference medicinal product for which no safety concerns requiring additional risk minimization activities have been identified, this is considered acceptable. Discussion on Clinical aspects One clinical bioequivalence trial 014-06 was provided for Clopidogrel ratiopharm application, analysing the parent  prodrug  clopidogrel.  The  demonstration  of  the  unchanged  safety/efficacy  profile  of  clopidogrel besilate  when  compared  with  Plavix  (clopidogrel  hydrogensulphate)  was  raised  by  the  CHMP  as  a  major issue for this generic product. Apart from this general concern, it is particularly important to evaluate the safety  of  the  besilate  moiety,  since  salification  agents,  such  as  benzenesulfonic  acid,  could  impact  the antiaggregation  effects  of  platelets  considering  that  their  chemical  structure  may  be  in  relation  with  a pharmaceutical activity. In response, the following facts were addressed: the physical-chemical properties of clopidogrel besilate, the behaviour of benzenesulphonate in various parts of the gastrointestinal tract with different pH ranges, the use of benzensulphonic acid as an excipient and the clinical experience with besilate salts  present  in  medicinal  products  on  the  market.  It  was  emphasized  that  the  properties  of  this  moiety undergo  fast  elimination  from  human  body  and  the  use  of  other  medicinal  products  containing  besilate moiety has not shown any safety signals. Therefore, it was felt that the potential for an adverse interaction between platelets and the besilate moiety is unlikely and the CHMP considered the issue resolved. At the time of approval of the reference product Plavix, there was no reliable and validated methodology for the  determination  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  parent  prodrug  clopidogrel,  or  of  the  active  metabolite clopidogrel  thiol.  Thus,  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  was  established  based  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of clopidogrel carboxylic acid, which is the non-active metabolite.  In the meantime, a reliable bioanalytical method  for  determination  of  clopidogrel  in  plasma  and  urine  was  developed.  Since  the  pharmacokinetic profile of the active metabolite is still not well established, the CHMP accepted the proof of bioequivalence based on the clopidogrel parent compound data in study 016-04.

pH values (1.2, 4.5 and 6.8) and mimicking the conditions of a fed state did not show any major differences between the originator and the generic product.

The indication of Clopidogrel ratiopharm is different from that of the reference medicinal product, Plavix (please see section 2.1). Thus, the Product Information has been adequately amended to reflect this change and this is considered acceptable.

The  bio-analytical technique and methodology  applied  in the analysis of the samples  during the bioequivalence study 014-06 were described. The bio-analytical technique and methodology applied in the analysis of the samples during the bioequivalence studies included validation with the analysis of calibration curves and quality controls at various concentrations. The CHMP questioned whether there is a potential for back-conversion  of  the  quantitatively  major  metabolite  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid  to  the  parent  drug. Considering that the plasma levels of clopidogrel carboxylic acid are considerably higher than those of the parent  drug,  a  minimum  back-conversion  of  the  metabolite  would  lead  to  a  huge  over-estimation  of clopidogrel  plasma  levels  and  would  bias  the  outcome  of  the  bioequivalence  study.  Demonstration  of  the lack of back-conversion of clopidogrel carboxylic acid metabolite to the parent drug under all conditions for sample handling and storage was requested by the CHMP. To resolve any doubts and to confirm that there is no  back-conversion  of  the  quantitatively  major  metabolite  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid  to  the  parent-drug clopidogrel, the results of an experiment conducted with this purpose were provided during the procedure. Following the sample work up and the chromatographic analysis of multiple samples prepared by spiking blank human plasma with clopidogrel carboxylic acid immediately and after several hours, no area response at  retention  time  relevant  to  clopidogrel  was  observed  in  samples  of  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid.  Hence, these results show that there is no potential for the occurrence for back-conversion of clopidogrel carboxylic acid to clopidogrel during the bioanalysis in study 014-06. The CHMP considered this issue resolved. The  bioequivalence  study  and  statistical  evaluation  were  in  accordance  with  accepted  standards  for bioequivalence  testing,  as  stated  in  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98). The parameters used to establish bioavailability included the area  under  the  plasma  concentration-time  curve  and  the  maximal  plasma  concentration  of  the  parent compound of clopidogrel. Bioequivalence has been established as the calculated 90% confidence intervals for ln-transformed AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax fell within the acceptance range of 80-125% for the parent drug clopidogrel as required by the above mentioned guideline.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

The application  contains  adequate  quality,  non  clinical  and  clinical  data  and  the  bioequivalence  has  been shown. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

- Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of Clopidogrel ratiopharm in the prevention of atherothrombotic events in: · Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), ischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial disease, was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
