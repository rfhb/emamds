## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Joint surface defects can originate after trauma, after osteochondritis dissecans or can be caused by an underlying  genetic  predisposition.  The  healing  capacity  of  articular  cartilage  is  poor  and  damaged articular cartilage is thought to be a precursor to the development of osteoarthritis. Damaged articular cartilage can result in pain, loss of joint function and disability. An early intervention on symptomatic cartilage lesions may prevent or delay irreversible changes in the joint surface.

Currently, there is no uniform approach to managing significant knee cartilage defects. Interventions that  aim to provide symptomatic relief include debridement, lavage and rehabilitation. Interventions intended to re-establish the cartilage surface include marrow stimulation techniques (i.e. microfracture (MF), abrasion arthroplasty or drilling), mosaicplasty and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). Microfracture is frequently used as treatment for patients with smaller articular cartilage defects of the knee  (for  lesions  &lt;  4cm 2 ).  It  induces  cartilage  repair  by  penetrating  the  subchondral  bone  and stimulating  bleeding  and  thus  the  formation  of  a  fibrin  clot,  which  is  considered  to  stimulate  fibro cartilage formation, and has been shown to result in functional improvements within the first 2 years following treatment. For larger lesions particularly those exceeding 4cm 2 , however, this procedure is not recommended. Mosaicplasty takes advantage of the limited self-renewal capacity of the joint surface by fitting one or several  osteochondral  plugs,  obtained  from  a  low  weight  bearing  area  of  the  joint  into  a  mosaic.  It transforms  large  defects  into  several  small  defects  that  can  be  repaired  spontaneously  by  the surrounding tissue and by the invading bone marrow derived skeletal precursors/mesenchymal stem cells. The  ACI  procedure  was  first  developed  in  1994  described  by  Brittberg  et al .  (1994)  using  a  first generation autologous chondrocyte product. In the following years many groups could demonstrate the benefit  and  formation  of  'cartilage  repair  tissue'  with  long-lasting  stability  and  symptomatic  relief between two and nine years after ACI treatment. For larger lesion sizes exceeding 4cm², ACI is also considered a suitable treatment option. ChondroCelect by Tigenix nv is a medicinal product for use in ACI treatment. ChondroCelect is a suspension of approximately 10,000 cartilage cells per microliter of medium for autologous use. The cells have been obtained by ex vivo expansion of chondrocytes isolated from a biopsy of the articular cartilage from the patient's knee. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Treatment with ChondroCelect comprises a two-step surgical procedure. In the first step a cartilage biopsy is obtained arthroscopically from healthy articular cartilage from a lesser weight bearing area of the patient's knee, approximately 4 weeks prior to implantation. Chondrocytes are isolated from the biopsy by enzymatic digestion, expanded in vitro , characterised and delivered as a suspension of 1 x 10 4 cells/ μ l for implantation in the same patient. During the second step of the procedure the expanded chondrocyte suspension is implanted in an open-knee surgery. In the pivotal study a periosteal flap was  harvested  from  the  medial  tibia,  sutured  into  the  defect,  with  the  cambium  layer  facing  the subchondral bone, and sealed with fibrin glue. In future applications the defect will be covered with the help of a biodegradable membrane. The dosage of the cell suspension is defined as 0.8 to 1 million cells per cm² defect size. Hence, depending on the defect size measured at biopsy procurement, 4 or 8 or 12 million cells are formulated into 1 or 2 or 3 vial(s) of 4 million cells/ 0.4 ml excipient.

The claimed indication for ChondroCelect is repair of single symptomatic cartilaginous defects of the femoral condyle of the knee (ICRS grade III or IV) in adults.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

ChondroCelect  is  an  autologous  cell-based  medicinal  product  consisting  of  chondrocytes  that  were expanded ex vivo after sourcing from a small biopsy of healthy cartilage from a lesser weight bearing area of the same patient's damaged knee.

The  active  substance  consists  of  autologous  cartilage  forming  (chondrogenic)  cells  which  are characterised by specific marker proteins.

| Substance                                                         | Function         | Content             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Pellet of washed cells                                            | Active Substance | 4 Mio Cells/ 0,4 ml |
| Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with glucose, without phenol red | Excipient        | 0,4 ml              |

The orthopaedic surgeon will plan an arthroscopy to assess the cartilage lesion and procure a cartilage tissue biopsy. The cartilage tissue biopsy is aseptically transferred into sterile biopsy medium.

For details on the composition of ChondroCelect please refer to Table 1. Table 1. Composition of ChondroCelect Active Substance The  Active  Substance  is  a  centrifuged  pellet  of  4  to  12  million  cells  that  were  expanded ex  vivo, harvested and washed. The expansion process is designed to preserve the integrity and function of the cells and particularly to maintain the cells' ability to produce hyaline cartilage. This method has been developed and validated  in  order  to  limit  the  usually  observed  dedifferentiation  of  chondrocytes  in culture. Lineage marker analysis are performed in order to demonstrate that the culture conditions do not  enrich  for  other  cell  lineage  populations  for  example  fibroblasts  and  provide  reassurance  of  the homogeneity of the ChondroCelect cell population. · Manufacture Biopsy procurement The  starting  material  consists  of  an  autologous  articular  cartilage  biopsy  procured  arthroscopically from a non weight-bearing area of the femoral condyle of the patient's knee. The Applicant provides hospitals with biopsy procurement kits, which are stored at the orthopaedic unit. Each kit is labelled with a unique lot number on the outer box and the containers within. Eligible  patients  for  ChondroCelect  treatment  are  screened  for  HIV  type  1  and  2,  HCV,  HBV,  and syphilis. Only tissue from donors who test negative will be released from quarantine and allowed into the tissue/cell processing area. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  biopsy  kit  is  conditioned  prior  to  shipment  and  is  transported  under  strict  monitoring  of  the temperature during transport. Upon receipt of the biopsy kit, the biopsy is quarantined until successful donor screening results are available.

Each biopsy kit is identified with a unique lot number which is composed of the following elements: the date on which the biopsy kit is assembled, the product type and the batch sequence number. At the time  of  arthroscopy  the  surgeon  records  two  patient  identifiers,  i.e.  donor  initials  and  the  patient's administration number in the hospital (hospital identifier) on the patient form and thus links the patient

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

identifiers  to  the  lot  number  of  the  biopsy  kit.  These  three  codes  are  designed  to  form  a  unique combination, and the biopsy lot number is used throughout the entire process to identify the donor's tissue and all lot related materials and documentation.

## Manufacturing process

The manufacturing process of the Active Substance consists of the following steps:

- Biopsy digestion
- Expansion culture
- Cell culture harvest and wash

Biopsy digestion Before further processing, the appearance of the biopsy medium is verified with respect to clarity and colour. The tissue is minced under aseptic conditions and bone fragments are removed. The cartilage fragments are then transferred to allow for dissociation of the cartilage tissue fragments and to release the  chondrocytes from the tissue matrix. Chondrocytes are isolated, washed, counted and seeded in tissue culture flasks in culture medium. Expansion culture The isolated  cells  are  transferred  to  an  incubator  with  humidified  atmosphere  and  replenished  with fresh culture medium in regular intervals. The flasks are regularly inspected. When the cultures reach confluence the cells are dissociated from the flask surface and subcultured in fresh tissue culture flasks until the appropriate number of expanded cells has been reached. The spent medium is pooled from every flask and sampled for microbiological testing The total number of passage numbers should remain lower or equal than 3 Cell culture harvest and wash At the end of culture the cells are trypsinized and collected, centrifuged and washed thoroughly. Cell viability is verified and a gram stain is performed on the collected wash solution. The cells obtained as a  pellet  at  this  stage  are  considered  the  Active  Substance  (i.e.  living  human  autologous  cartilage forming cells). In-process controls and specifications The in-process controls of the manufacturing process have been clearly specified. Critical parameters have been included as in process controls to routinely confirm the quality of the Medicinal product by testing the biopsy and cell culture for aspects like e.g. medium appearance, pH, microbiology, cell morphology, purity, cell viability and cell yield. Appropriate operating ranges have been defined. As the manufacturing process is a continuous process and the active substance is not stored in between, no formal Active Substance specifications have been set. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Process validation and characterisation of Active Substance

The Applicant used a series of functional tests capable to characterise the cells and suitable to validate the manufacturing process. These functional assays include a cell culture (3D cell culture assay), an in vitro assay  in  animal  models  and  cellular  expression  patterns  of  genes  relevant  for  cartilage  and chondrocyte biology.

The validation of the manufacturing process has been adequately performed. Some minor issues on the acceptance  criteria  for  some  parameters  followed  during  the  validation  are  still  outstanding.  The Applicant  has  committed  to  explore  further  the  specification  limits  for  the  functional  assay  and  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

further define the acceptance criteria for process validation. On basis of the validation approach, the data collected and the commitment on further exploration of the specification limits, the comparability and consistency of lots produced by the proposed manufacturing process have been demonstrated.

## Medicinal product

The  manufacturing  process  from  the  Active  Substance  to  the  Medicinal  product  is  a  continuous process without intermediate holding steps. The cell pellet is immediately resuspended in the excipient nutrient medium and packaged for shipment. The dosage is defined as 0.8 to 1 million cells per cm 2 defect size. Hence, depending on the defect size measured at biopsy procurement, 4 or 8 or 12 million cells are formulated into 1 or 2 or 3 vial(s) of 4 million cells/ 0.4 ml excipient/ vial. Concentration of the Medicinal product is 10,000 cells formulated per microliter excipient.

A valid EDQM Certificate of Suitability for foetal bovine serum (FBS) has been provided. Absence from  bovine  viruses  according  to  Ph.  Eur.  01/2008/2262,  monograph  Serum  bovinum  and  EMEA Guideline  (CPMP/BWP/1793/02)  has  been  demonstrated.    In  addition,  test  methods  have  been described in details and virus inactivation results using gamma irradiation have been provided.

· Pharmaceutical development The Manufacture of ChondroCelect Medicinal product involves the formulation of the cell pellet in the excipient  medium  and  subsequent  filling  into  glass  vials.  The  Applicant  has  conducted  studies  to demonstrate the suitability of the transport medium to serve as the excipient of the Medicinal product. The Medicinal product is composed of the Active Substance (a pellet of washed cells) and an aqueous nutrient medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with glucose). · Manufacture of the product The Medicinal product is manufactured, routinely controlled and batch released by Tigenix (Leuven, Belgium). Operations are in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The  re-suspension  of  the  Active  Substance,  the  cell  pellet  in  medium,  without  any  intermediate holding steps yields the Medicinal product. The product is filled into a 1 ml clear, V-shaped, type 1 borosilicate glass vial, which is closed with a grey chlorobutyl /45 stopper. Vial and cap are manually crimp sealed with an aluminium tear-off seal. The glass vial complies with Ph.Eur. requirements. The chlorobutyl stopper is made of material that has 'low extractables' characteristics and is certified by the manufacturer to be compliant with all applicable procedures and specifications. Based on the cell counts from the final harvest, the Medicinal product is formulated to contain 10,000 cells /µl and 0.4 ml of the cell suspension is filled per vial. Each vial thus contains a total of 4 million cells.  Depending on the total amount of cells needed to treat a specific lesion, up to three vials are filled  and  provided  within  the  falcon  flask.  Since  the  dosage  is  0.8  to  1  million  cells  per  cm 2 ,  the defective area, which may be treated with ChondroCelect, is limited to 15 cm 2 . · Adventitious agents The raw materials of biological origin used in the production of ChondroCelect include collagenase, fetal  bovine  serum  and  porcine  trypsin.  All  raw  materials,  which  are  sourced  directly  or  indirectly from  animal  material,  are  subjected  to  a  risk  analysis  procedure  and  a  compliance  check  with  the appropriate  legislative  requirements.  Certificate  of  suitability  from  the  European  Directorate  for Quality of Medicinal Products (EDQM) have been provided. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Overall, sufficient data is provided to exclude a risk of TSE transmission through ChondroCelect. The risk of transmitting TSE by ChondroCelect is thus considered very remote.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Product specification

The quality control program performed on the Medicinal product for ChondroCelect includes a test for sterility by Ph. Eur., testing for absence of Mycoplasma by Ph. Eur., testing for absence of endotoxin by Ph. Eur. and gram staining. Dosage and cell viability are confirmed prior to release. Visual tests for absence of particles and vial integrity are performed.

All  analytical  methods  are  performed  according  to  Ph.  Eur.  where  applicable  and  are  validated according to ICH guidelines.

Compliance with the product specifications has been demonstrated, and the provided data is considered acceptable. The Company has committed to provide additional data in support of the product specification post-marketing. · Stability of the product Stability was addressed by analyzing various lots at time point 0 and time point 48 h. The data reveal no major changes. Hence, a shelf life of 48h is justified for ChondroCelect. · GMO ChondroCelect is composed of non-modified human autologous cells. The cells administered to the patient  are  likely  to  remain  in  the  implantation  site  and  are  not  released  to  the  environment. Furthermore,  incidental  cell  leakage  is  expected  to  result  in  metabolism,  as  is  the  case  for  natural release of cells within the body. Therefore the use of ChondroCelect is unlikely to result in any risk to the environment, due to its nature and also because the product is not released into the environment. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  ChondroCelect  Active  Substance  and Finished  product  have  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  the  tests  carried  out indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  finished  product, and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform performance in the clinic. At the time of CAT opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues related to the specification limits, biodegradable membrane and storage conditions (see above). These shortcomings, however, have no impact on the Risk-benefit balance of the product. The Applicant provided a Letter of  Undertaking  and  committed  to  resolve  these  as  follow-up  measures  after  the  opinion,  within  an agreed timeframe.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

Non-clinical studies were performed as combined pharmacodynamic / pharmacokinetic (distribution) / toxicological studies in the ectopic mouse (nu/nu model) and in orthotopic models in sheep and goats.

These studies were non-GLP which is not in conformity with the pharmaceutical standards. However, these  deficiencies  were  considered  by  CHMP  to  be  tolerable  in  view  of  the  specificity  of  the development  programme  for  this  particular  product.  In  addition  human  data  were  supported  by adequate clinical studies and did not raise any safety concerns.

Pharmacology · Primary pharmacodynamics Nude mouse model Nude mice received an intramuscular injection of human articular chondrocytes expanded according to the ChondroCelect culture process. Implants retrieved from nude mice at 2 weeks post injection were subjected  to histological staining. Based  on  these  characteristics,  the  cartilage  implants  were considered of hyaline-like nature. Compared to normal adult human articular cartilage, the cartilage implants were hypercellular and lacked the typical columnar organisation. A  further  mouse  study  was  performed  using  early  or  late  passage  expanded  human  articular chondrocytes. When injected intramuscularly into nude mice, late passage expanded cells did not form any  cartilage  tissue.  In  contrast,  early  passage  expanded  human  articular  chondrocytes  formed  a cartilage implant. Studies in a large animal species The  importance  of  phenotypic  stability  for  inducing in  vivo hyaline-like  cartilage  formation  was investigated by comparing  goat or human  articular chondrocytes of different passages.  The histological score of implants indicated a loss of stable cartilage-forming potential at higher passages. In  goats  ChondroCelect-like  chondrocytes  showed  a  more  stable  cartilage  forming  potential  than dedifferentiated chondrocytes. Implantation of ChondroCelect-like autologous chondrocytes resulted in  an  improved  repair  efficacy  compared  to  dedifferentiated  chondrocytes  or  dermal  fibroblasts  as observed  in  an  improved  repair  in  the  defect  centre,  and  improved  repair  tissue  integration. Dedifferentiated autologous chondrocytes induced moderate defect filling with poor repair tissue and no  or  minimal  basal  and/or  lateral  integration.  In  all  animals,  partial  or  complete  delamination  of periosteal flap and fissures in the grafted area and surrounding cartilage was observed. The  repair  of  the  cartilage  defect  was  evaluated  by  the  Modified  O'Driscoll  (MOD)  scores  that represent a scoring system to assess late-stage cartilage regeneration. The number of data points was very  limited  and  the  MOD  score  obtained  in  goats  have  shown  a  non-valid  correlation  with  the histology score obtained for the same cell preparations in nude mice. Medicinal product no longer authorised

As  observed  for  goat  chondrocytes,  the in  vivo cartilage-forming  capacity  of  human  articular chondrocytes  in  nude  mice  was  progressively  lost  during in  vitro cell  culture  from  passage  2-3 onwards. Chondrocytes expanded to higher passage numbers did not form an implant when injected into the thigh of nude mice. In another study in goats comparing passage 1 versus passage 5 expanded human articular  chondrocytes  according  to  ChondroCelect  culture  process  all  animals  showed  poor repair, possibly due to an immunological reaction to the human cells.

In a goat study ChondroCelect-like autologous chondrocytes controls were performed with or without periosteal flap. Goats sacrificed up to 53 weeks post-implantation of ChondroCelect-like autologous chondrocytes showed normal mobility, almost complete filling of the cartilage lesion with hyaline-like cartilage  or  hyaline-like  cartilage/fibrocartilage.  However,  goats  sacrificed  at  various  weeks  postimplantation showed some degree of bone front ingrowths into the defect. The degree of bone front ingrowths into the defect at 52 weeks was most prominent in animals implanted with ChondroCelectlike cells.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Secondary pharmacodynamics

The potential formation of other tissue types as a consequence of the loss of phenotypic stability during the in vitro expansion process was investigated. Further secondary pharmacodynamic studies were not performed.

- Safety pharmacology programme

ChondroCelect  is  administered  locally.  No  direct  effect  of  the  cells  or  an  effect  of  secreted pharmacologically active substances on CNS, cardiac or respiratory system is considered for this cell therapy  medicinal  product,  thus  the  omission  of  safety  pharmacological  studies  is  in  line  with  the guideline on human cell based medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/410869/2006).

· Pharmacodynamic drug interactions No  formal  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed,  since  the  Applicant justified  that  the  intended  clinical  use  and  the  applied  surgical  procedures  are  not  associated  with potential  concerns  regarding  pharmacodynamic  interactions  with  pre-,  peri-  or  post-operatively administered medicinal products. Fibrin sealants are broadly employed in orthopaedic surgery as an adjunct to haemostasis during total knee prosthesis replacement or as mechanical seal of the outside margins of the membrane used to cover the defect in ACI. Fibrin sealant products differ significantly in their quantitative and qualitative composition, of the active substance and the excipients, thus it cannot be excluded that certain fibrin glues have, due to their composition, a negative effect on the viable cells and/or membrane. Compatibility data for the fibrin glue TissuCol (Tisseel) have demonstrated the safe and effective use of this sealant with ChondroCelect in non-clinical studies. No interaction studies with any other type of fibrin glues were performed. However the concomitant use of Quixil in the pivotal clinical trial did not reveal any safety signal so far. Pharmacokinetics Two  studies  were  performed  in  goats  to  evaluate  the  persistence  of  cells  in  the  inflicted  cartilage defect  as  well  as  the  potential  migration  of  cells  outside  the  implantation  site.  These  studies  with fluorescently-tagged ChondroCelect-like autologous chondrocytes demonstrated that implanted cells become a structural part of newly formed cartilage. No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were performed. This is in line with the draft guideline on human cell based medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/410869/2006). Toxicology · Single dose toxicity Female  NMRI  nu/nu  mice  received  intramuscular  or  subcutaneous  injections  of  human  articular chondrocytes  (freshly  isolated  or  expanded  according  to  the  ChondroCelect  culture  process),  goat articular  chondrocytes,  pig  articular  or  epiphysial  chondrocytes,  a  combination  of  pig  articular chondrocytes  and  human  periosteal  cells,  goat  dermal  fibroblasts,  immortalized  cell  lines  with chondrocyte  characteristics  or  human  synovial  membrane-derived  mesenchymal  stem  cells.  Two deaths unlikely to be caused by ChondroCelect were observed, all other animals treated were normal and  healthy  during  the  course  of  the  experiment,  regardless  of  the  number  and  type  of  cells administered.

In  a  sheep  study,  70%  if  the  animals  receiving  an  implantation  of  either  autologous  articular chondrocytes  expanded  according  to  the  ChondroCelect  culture  process,  freshly  isolated  allogeneic articular chondrocytes, freshly isolated human articular chondrocytes or freshly isolated human stem cells  showed  penetration  of  cells  in  subchondral  bone,  partly  with  granulomatous  reaction.  Two  of these animals also showed complete penetration of underlying bone marrow.

In  goats  either  autologous  cells  or  human  articular  chondrocytes,  expanded  according  to  the ChondroCelect culture process were implancted via an ACI procedure. In one study an extensive set of safety parameters was monitored. Clinical and laboratory signs observed occurred with low incidence,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  of  short  duration  and  are  considered  related  to  the  surgical  procedure  including  anaesthesia and/or post-surgery immobilization. Animals  treated with autologous cells  showed  no  major differences concerning macroscopic and microscopic findings of the femoral condyle as compared to control animals.

As part of the goat study, the macroscopic, histological and biochemical composition of the synovium and  synovial  fluid  was  investigated  10  and  52  weeks  post-implantation  with  particular  attention  to inflammation and ectopic cartilage or bone formation. At 10 weeks, ca. 70 % of all animals showed various degrees of synovitis.

In a feasibility study in sheep the majority of the animals showed penetration of the transplanted cells in  subchondral  bone.  In  two  cases  complete  penetration  of  underlying  bone  marrow  was  observed. Similar  findings  were  observed  in  long-term  studies  in  goats.  In  addition  these  animals  showed complete penetration of underlying bone marrow.

The observed synovitis and the reported penetration of the transplanted cells in the subchondral bone have been identified  in  the  RMP  as  potential  safety  concerns  related  to  the  use  of  the  product  that warrant a specific statement under section 5.3 'Preclinical safety data' of the SmPC. None  of  these  potential  concerns  are  found  to  have  an  impact  on  the  safe  clinical  application  of ChondroCelect. Further risk minimization actions or additional non-clinical data are not  considered necessary. No effects on body systems or systemic toxicity was seen in the mice, sheep or goats as expected for this kind of autologous cell therapy medicinal product applied locally in this compartment. · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) As the observation period of the single dose studies described above were up to 12 weeks in mice, 14 weeks in sheep and 53 weeks in goats, these studies are considered to be sufficient to assess the longterm effects of ChondroCelect. Therefore the omission of repeat-dose toxicity studies is in line with the EMEA guideline EMEA/CHMP/410869/2006. · Genotoxicity The omission of genotoxicity studies in  the  development program for ChondroCelect is in line with EMEA/CHMP/410869/2006. · Carcinogenicity In order to address the carcinogenic potential of ChondroCelect, the Applicant performed an in vitro study to evaluate senescence of human  articular chondrocytes after serial passaging, using ChondroCelect culture conditions. Cells were kept beyond the routine cell culturing as suggested in EMEA/CHMP/410869/2006. The  results  provide  sufficient  evidence  that  immortalisation  of  human  chondrocytes  during  limited time  in in  vitro culture  conditions  would  not  occur,  and  that  the  risk  of  tumorigenic  growth  is negligible. In  view  of  these  results,  the  absence  of  standard  carcinogenicity  studies  was  considered  to  be acceptable. · Reproduction Toxicity Medicinal product no longer authorised

Taking into account the nature of the product and its intended clinical use the risk for reproductive and developmental toxicity is considered to be negligible.

Therefore,  the  omission  of reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity studies  in  the  development program for ChondroCelect is acceptable and in line with the EMEA guideline EMEA/CHMP/410869/2006.

## · Local tolerance

Local  tolerance  was  an  integral  part  of  the  toxicological  studies.  Therefore,  no  dedicated local tolerance studies with ChondroCelect. were deemed necessary. Pharmaco-toxicological studies in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

orthotropic  animal  model  showed that  implantation  of  human  or  allogeneic  chondrocytes  causes  an immune response to the CBMP, resulting in poor repair.

- Other toxicity studies

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

ChondroCelect is composed of non-modified human autologous cells. The cells administered to the patient are likely to remain in the implantation site and are not released to the environment. Therefore the use of ChondroCelect is unlikely to result in any risk to the environment, due to its nature and also because the product is not released into the environment.

Consequently, the absence of environmental studies is in line with the EMEA  guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00. 2.4 Clinical aspects Introduction GCP The GCP inspection highlighted the amount of missing data on the structural endpoint and the change to the ICRSII read-out in the pivotal study as major concerns. Most of the concerns related to the ICRSII were resolved during the procedure. The generation of new slides from the original repair biopsy has increased the ICRSII  data base from 73% to 93%.  It was, however, acknowledged that the a priori determined primary efficacy end point, the MODs score (on the basis of which the for example a priori sample size calculations and power analysis were performed), was post hoc disregarded as invalid and a new primary end point, the ICRSII was developed within the course of the study, the conclusion being that this GCP non compliance cannot, as such, be post hoc rectified. Pharmacokinetics Studies on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion have not been performed Conventional ADME  studies are usually not relevant for a cell based medicinal product. The body distribution/migration  studies  are  part  of  the  non-clinical  development  program.  This  is  acceptable considering the nature and origin (autologous) of the product. Pharmacodynamics Conventional pharmacodynamic studies for ChondroCelect have not been performed. The pharmacodynamic parameter 'histological evaluation' was part of the efficacy assessment in the phase III trial. The ChondroCelect score is a functional test which suggests a correlation between the gene expression profile of chondrocytes and hyaline cartilage formation in vivo in animal models and was used also in the phase III study (see Overview on quality and non-clinical development as regards the discussion on validity of this score). In the pivotal study a periosteal flap was used to seal the defect and maintain the chondrocyte suspension in situ. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Clinical efficacy

- Dose response study(ies)

No dose-response studies have been performed. The dose selection was based on a combination of animal studies conducted by TiGenix, published literature and experience in humans with ACI. On the basis of this information the dose of between 0.8 and 1 × 10 6 cells/cm 2 was used.

- Main study(ies)

Study  TIG/ACT/01/2000 is  a  phase  III,  multicentre,  randomized,  controlled  trial  to  compare ChondroCelect  to  the  procedure  of  microfracture  in  the  repair  of  symptomatic  single  cartilaginous lesions  of  the  femoral  condyles  of  the  knee.  This  study  TIG/ACT/01/2000  and  its  ongoing  4-year extension  phase  (TIG/ACT/O1/2000EXT)  (both  referred  to  as  TIG/ACT/OI&amp;EXT')  were  initially separate studies which were merged late in the development.

## Methods

Study Participants Patients aged between 18 and 50 years, who had a single symptomatic cartilage lesion between 1 and 5 cm 2 of the femoral condyles met the inclusion criteria. Patients  with  patellofemoral  cartilage  lesion,  osteochondritis  dissecans  (OCD),  depth  of  lesion  &gt;0.5 cm, prior meniscal transplant, prior mosaicplasty and prior microfracture within last 12 month were excluded. Patients had to agree to actively participate in a strict rehabilitation protocol and follow-up program. Treatments Microfracture is considered an effective standard treatment for smaller femoral cartilage lesions according to currently available literature data, and is an acceptable control therapy. Objectives / Outcomes / Endpoints The  primary  objectives  of  this  study  were  changed  in  August  2006,  after  end  of  the  initial  study period. The primary objective of the original protocol was to show superiority in structural repair at 12 months compared to the control group. However, CHMP Scientific Advice suggested that a clinically meaningful  primary  endpoint  should  be  used.  Therefore,  the  Applicant  decided  to  follow  CHMP Scientific  Advice  and  to  select  overall  KOOS  (The  Knee  Injury  and  Osteoarthritis  Outcome  Score, 1998) for the second primary efficacy endpoint. This questionnaire-based endpoint has five separately scored  subscales:  1)  pain;  2)  other  symptoms  such  as  swelling,  restricted  range  of  motion  and mechanical restrictions; 3) function in daily living; 4) function in sport and recreation; 5) knee-related Quality of Life. At the ad-hoc expert group that was convened on 13 th of  October 2008, the experts confirmed  that  patient-reported  outcomes  should  be  the  primary  outcome  measure  in  studies  in orthopaedics and sports medicine, and that the KOOS is one of the most meaningful clinical endpoints to date. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  modified primary  objectives of  the  study  included  the  following  structural  and  clinical objectives: To show an advantage of ChondroCelect compared with microfracture in the treatment of symptomatic cartilaginous defects of the femoral condyle of the knee by demonstrating superiority on the  structural  repair  (histology)  endpoint  at  12  months  and  non-inferiority  on  the  clinical  endpoint (change from baseline in KOOS) for the average of the 12- to 18-months follow-up data. Due, firstly, to  the  more  complex  nature  of  ACI  compared  with  microfracture  and  associated  safety  issues, secondly, due to the fact that very limited data exists on the efficacy of MF, in particular in the long term  setting,  and  thirdly,  due  to  the  fact  that  the  relevance,  both  short  term  and  long  term,  of  the structural findings has not been established, CHMP  Scientific advice (EMEA/151996/2006) recommended that it is of importance to establish the superiority of ACI.

Secondary objectives were to assess the difference between ChondroCelect and microfracture at 12 months  in terms of the following structural outcome  parameters: ICRS  II sub-scales,  MRI measurements and ICRS Visual Histological Assessment Score.

Primary efficacy parameters were

- The sum of histomorphometric scores on safranin-O and collagen II staining (sum of two ratios) and the mean Overall Histology Assessment score at 12 months.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · The change from baseline in Overall KOOS score averaged over 12 and 18 months.

## Sample size and Randomisation

Sample size calculation was based on the score component of the MODS (primary endpoint according protocol). Due to a lack on information on the expected variability, the sample size was determined using only the categorization (success/failure) element of the MODS. Anticipating a 30% success rate for the microfracture group and a 60% success rate for the ChondroCelect procedure, it was calculated that with 112 (56 per group) a one-sided test at the 2.5% level would have 90% power to detect such a difference. However, this primary endpoint was disregarded as invalid and a new histological end point was developed during the conduct of the study.

Randomisation was performed via a central IVRS. Blinding (masking) All  clinical  assessments  were  performed  by  independent  evaluators  at  each  site.  Two  central histopathologists  who  were  blinded  to  the  treatment  allocation  completed  the  histopathological  and histomorphometric  assessments  of  the  biopsies.  The  scoring  of  the  MRI  scans  was  also  performed centrally  by  two  independent  musculoskeletal  radiologists,  who  were  blinded  to  the  treatment allocation.  The  randomisation was performed using the 'minimisation' method, in order to balance groups for the most important prognostic factors. Statistical methods All analyses were performed for the FAS population (i.e. all patients randomized who underwent the surgical procedure). For the primary efficacy parameter additional (secondary) analyses were to be performed for the ITT and PP population respectively. RESULTS Participant flow Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Recruitment

The study was performed in 13 centres in 4 countries.

## Conduct of the study

The initial 12-months trial protocol was dated 22 October 2001. Seven protocol amendments were subsequently implemented. The first two amendments were implemented prior to inclusion of any patient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Baseline data

The randomisation to ChondroCelect and microfracturing groups was successful for age  (mean age 33.9 years and 33.9 years, respectively, gender (61% and 67% males), and weight (mean 78.1 kg and 80.6 kg). There was a higher proportion of patients with a BMI &gt;30 kg/m2 in the microfracture group than in the ChondroCelect group (9.8% versus 5.3%) and a slightly higher proportion of patients in the microfracture group whose onset of symptoms was acute compared to the ChondroCelect group. The median duration of time since onset of knee injury was slightly longer in the ChondroCelect group than in the microfracture group (2.0 years versus 1.6 years). The presence of concomitant cartilage lesions  was  comparable  in  both  groups  (30%  versus  25%).  More  patients  in  the  ChondroCelect treatment  group,  compared  to  patients  in  the  microfracture  group,  had  undergone  previous  knee surgery (88% versus 77%).

The lesions of the femoral condyle that were treated with ChondroCelect or microfracture were ICRS grade III or IV, except for one patient with a grade II lesion in the ChondroCelect group. Thirty per cent (17/57) of patients in the ChondroCelect group and 25% (15/61) of patients in the microfracture group had additional concomitant cartilage lesions (data from Clinical Overview). The mean surface area of cartilage defect post-debridement was similar in both treatment groups (mean 2.64 and 2. 44, respectively). Numbers analysed The patient disposition is seen in the Table below. The full analysis set (FAS) was used for the main efficacy analysis. Six patients in the ChondroCelect group were excluded from FAS because acceptable products could not be prepared from the biopsies. All patients were included in the safety analysis. Seven patients in both groups were lost for follow up between months 12 and 18. Outcomes and estimation Primary endpoints Medicinal product no longer authorised

The results of the analysis of structural repair and of the clinical endpoint are presented in the Table below:

All estimates from ANCOVA models; adjusted for age, associated lesion &amp; location of lesion (histomorphometric &amp; histological endpoints); adjusted for baseline Overall KOOS score, age, associated lesion(s) &amp; location of lesion (KOOS)

In line with the testing strategy as provided with the statistical analysis plan, superiority of ChondroCelect compared to microfracture could be shown for both endpoints describing structural repair, the histomorphometric and the histological endpoint.

The average change from baseline (at month 12 and 18) total KOOS scores for the FAS population are presented in the Table below: Mean change in Overall KOOS from baseline to the average of 12 and 18 months The mean change in Overall KOOS from baseline to the average of  12  to 18  months  was  slightly higher for patients in the ChondroCelect group than for patients in the microfracture group. The results fulfil the predefined criteria for non-inferiority in this co-primary clinical endpoint and both changes are clinically relevant ( ≥ 10 points on a scale of 0-100). No significant differences between the groups were detected in the KOOS subdomains pain and activities in daily living. No significant difference in the improvement of pain as measured by VAS was seen between the groups. Secondary endpoints A 'responder' analysis (20% improvement) showed comparable results in the groups for total KOOS and for its subdomains. The clinical data have also been analysed when all patients reached at least 36 months follow-up. Two main analyses have been documented: analysis according to mixed linear models and further analysis of the non-inferiority over time. During the procedure the Applicant completed and submitted statistical analysis of up to 60 month follow-up data including graphical illustrations of a mixed model with time as a continuous and as a categorical  variable.  However,  the  mean  structure  of  the  KOOS  (overall  as  well  as  for  each  of  the subdomains)  is  not  linear  over  time.  As  a  result,  models  anticipating  a  linear  mean  structure overestimate the effect in the CC group beyond month 24. Therefore, the time wise comparisons of treatment effects were based on a mixed model with time as a categorical variable. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The results of the different analyses are shown below. The results from 36 months on could only be considered as descriptive, because of the small number of patients already reaching later follow-up time points.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

p-value for the time by treatment interaction: 0.070 Treatment effect at month 36 (CC - MI): 7.655, p-value: 0.0481 Mixed model with time as a categorical variable - all data up to month 60 p-value for the time by treatment interaction: 0.1192 Treatment effect at month 36 (CC - MI): 7.148 p-value: 0.0514 Medicinal product no longer authorised

Treatment effect at month 48 (CC - MI): 6.893 p-value: 0.1493

Treatment effect at month 60 (CC - MI): 5.771 p-value: 0.4616

The additional analyses indicate that C hange (increase) from baseline in KOOS in the ChondroCelect group (CC) is numerically more pronounced when compared to the Microfracture group (MI). This observation is true not only for the overall KOOS but also for the subdomains. The additional mixed model analysis with time as a categorical variable does not give statistically significant differences at months 36, 48 and 60 (when considering multiplicity).

The second analysis which was performed was the further analysis of the non-inferiority over time. The Applicant has calculated the 95% CI for the treatment difference for each consecutive visit (i.e.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

months 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, and 60) in order to assess a possible non-inferiority of CC (compared to MF). For data missing as a result of treatment failure, a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was applied.

The results for the change from baseline over time in Overall KOOS are presented in the table below.

## Treatment failures

Treatment failure is defined as 'the decision by the participating orthopaedic surgeon to proceed with a  re-intervention  (i.e.  new  procedure)  on  the  same  defect  (index  lesion)  based  on  persistence  or recurrence of symptoms as reported by the patient'. In the context of this definition, any operation on the involved knee that involves the index lesion to a clinically relevant extent (i.e. 20% or more of its surface),  or  is  intended  as  a  result  of  clinical  treatment  failure  is  considered  a  re-intervention. Generally,  the  surgeon  relies  on  MRI  and/or  arthroscopic  assessment  to  confirm  the  patient's complaints are caused by failure of the therapeutic intervention on the index lesions and to exclude possible other causes (e.g. a new lesion).

After  36  months  post-surgery  follow-up,  the  total  number  of  treatment  failures  is  2  for  the ChondroCelect group and 7 for the microfracture group (p=0.178). However, as the inefficacy of the therapeutic  procedure  is  considered  a  serious  AE,  since  requiring  a  surgical  re-intervention  with hospitalisation, it was felt important to include all known treatment failures up to the 36 month time point and not only those that effectively occurred within a 36-months post-surgery timeframe. As a result,  the  cumulative  number  of  treatment  failures  becomes  5  for  the  ChondroCelect  group  (9.8%) and 9 for the microfracture group (15%) (p=0.569), as outlined in the table below. These failure rates are concurring with failure rates reported in published literature on ACI and microfracture (Peterson et al ., 2000; Peterson et al ., 2002; Peterson et al ., 2003; Micheli et al ., 2006; Wood et al ., 2006; Minas et al ., 2009; Mithoefer et al ., 2009). Table 2 TIG/ACT/01&amp;EXT - treatment failures AEs reported over a 36 month post-operative period Total number of treated patients Treatment failures after 36 months follow-up Treatment failures - all cases known at time of 36 months database cut-off As is  shown  in  table  2,  fewer  re-interventions  for  inefficacy  were  reported  in  patients  treated  with ChondroCelect compared to microfracture (i.e. 5 out of 51 patients [9.8%] versus 9 out of 61 patients [15%], respectively). Treatment failures in the ChondroCelect treated patients were all associated with some  degree  of  periost  loosening  or  graft  delamination  whereas  in  the  microfracture  group  the majority of re-interventions were reported to be associated with insufficient or inadequate repair tissue formation. As the use of a biological membrane is expected to result in less friction at the graft surface (i.e. less hypertrophy and less crepitations), the use of a biological membrane instead of periost may possibly reduce the frequency of treatment failures upon treatment with ChondroCelect.

## Prospective, long-term follow-up study of patients in the Belgian Armed Forces treated with ChondroCelect (TIG/ACT/02)

## Methodology and baseline data

This study is a prospective, non-comparative, open-label study of 2 to 5 years' duration in 20 patients with single and multiple symptomatic cartilage defects, in any location of the knee, who underwent CCI using ChondroCelect. Patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were administered ChondroCelect during an arthrotomy which occurred approximately 4 weeks after the  arthroscopic procurement of cartilage. Approximately 1 week following arthrotomy, they were discharged from the hospital and invited for regular follow-up visits for up to 5 years after CCI. Clinical outcome, knee pain  and  activity  levels  are  assessed  before  (pre-operatively)  and  after  CCI  by  the  KOOS,  visual analogue  scale  (VAS)  for  pain,  Activity  Rating  Scale  (ARS)  and  military  tests  for  physical  fitness (MTLG).  Data  on  pre-defect  activity  levels  were  available  for  the  ARS  and  were  expected  to  be available for MTLG.

Secondary objectives of this study included to assess the extent to which the ARS and MTLG scores return to their pre-defect levels within a 5-year post-operative follow-up period. An additional efficacy endpoint listed in the SAP is to assess the change from preoperative baseline in MRI measurements. A final  objective  is  to  assess  the  safety  of  CCI  with  ChondroCelect  in  this  specific  patient  population with single or multiple symptomatic cartilage defects in the knee of any location. Patients with symptomatic cartilage defects in the knee of any location were eligible for inclusion if they, were between 18-50 years of age, had a total cumulative cartilage defect between 1 and 21 cm2 and  agreed  to  adhere  to  the  rehabilitation  regimen  and  the  restrictions  with  regard  to  concomitant medication. The study population enrolled was characterized by a male predominance (80%), a relatively high age (65% ≥ 40 years), relatively high body mass index (BMI) (60% &gt;25 kg/m2), and a relatively recent onset of symptoms (mean: 0.9 years; median 0.5 years, range: 0 - 4 years). A femoral cartilage lesion was reported in 95% (19/20) of patients, a patellar lesion in 40% (8/20) and a tibial lesion in 15% (3/20). A total of 35 lesions were reported in 20 patients. The majority of patients had only one lesion (60%;12/20), whilst the remaining patients had two (10%; 2/20), three (25%; 5/20) or four (5%; 1/20) lesions. One of the patients with three lesions and the patient with four lesions each had three lesions treated with CCI. All other patients (18/20; 90%) had only single lesions treated with CCI. Of the 7 patients with multiple lesions who did not have all their lesions treated with CCI, four had their other lesions treated with either shaving (4 lesions in 3 patients) or microfracture (1 lesion in 1 patient) and three had untreated lesions. Of  all  reported  lesions,  80%  were  reported  to  be  of  ICRS  Grade  III  or  IV.  Of  24  femoral  lesions reported in 19 patients, 21 were treated with CCI. All femoral lesions were ICRS grade III-IV. Two of the femoral lesions not treated with CCI were ICRS Grade IV and were located on the trochlea, one of these had been treated with microfracture at arthroscopy; the third untreated femoral lesion was also located on the trochlea and was shaved at arthroscopy (lesion grade unknown). Of 8 patellar lesions reported in 8 patients, three were treated with CCI (one ICRS grade II, one ICRS grade III and one ICRS grade IV). Of the five untreated patella lesions, three were ICRS Grade I and two were ICRS Grade  III.  One  of  the  grade  I  patella  lesions  not  treated  with  CCI  and  one  of  the  grade  III  patella lesions not treated with CCI had been shaved at arthroscopy. Three tibial lesions were reported in 3 patients, none of which were treated with CCI. Two of the tibial lesions were ICRS grade II and one was ICRS grade II to III. One of the grade II tibial  lesions had been shaved at arthroscopy. Of all enrolled  patients,  60%  (12/20)  had  undergone  previous  cartilage  repair  surgery  at  least  once  (45% [9/20]  debridement,  10%  [2/20])  microfracture,  5%  [1/20])  abrasion  arthroplasty,  and  5%  [1/20]) multiple  osteochondral  autologous  grafts),  60%  had  a  previous  meniscus  operation,  and  20%  had previous ligament surgery at baseline. Two patients (9%) had an ACL repair and five patients (23%) had meniscus surgery during the arthroscopy performed for the harvest biopsy. The lesion size treated with ChondroCelect was 2.33 cm² (SD 1.16; range, 0.8 - 9.2 cm2). Medicinal product no longer authorised

At 24 months following CCI, the patients' clinical status was improved compared to baseline: mean change in Overall KOOS 28.3 [95% CI 11.28, 45.1; n=9]); VAS (mean change -37.3 [95% CI -63.2, 11.5; n=9]); ARS total score at 24 months was 1.0 (95% CI: -0.2 to 2.2; n=7) indicating a trend towards improved. The percentage of patients with asymptomatic knees (patient categorization derived from KOOS scores) was increased from none at baseline (0/19 patients) to 38% at Month 18 (5/13 patients) and 56% at Month 24 (5/9 patients). There was a trend towards an improvement in the patients' activity level at 18 and 24 months compared to pre-operative baseline, although their activity level remained below their pre-defect levels. The data on MTLG were insufficient to draw any conclusion. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Overall discussion on Efficacy

The efficacy evaluation of ChondroCelect is based on one pivotal study. At 12 months post-surgery, structural assessments (histology and MRI) were performed, and at 12 to 18 months post-surgery the clinical outcome was assessed. In line with the testing strategy as provided with the statistical analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

plan,  superiority  of  ChondroCelect  compared  to  microfracture  could  be  shown  for  both  endpoints describing structural repair

The  ICRSII  had  been  developed  within  the  trial,  and  the  validity  of  this  new  tool  had  not  been assessed prior to starting the trial. This finding could not be corrected post-hoc. However, the need to develop a suitable assessment method for structural repair was acknowledged, as well as the fact that the new ICRSII score was developed in a blinded manner.

A  further  issue  was  that  many  of  the  tissue  sections  could  not  be  assessed  which  lead  to  20%  of missing data. In the course of the procedure the missing data were provided, which strengthened the superiority claim of structural repair.

With  respect  to  the  clinical  component  (change  in  overall  KOOS)  non-inferiority  was  proven.  The clinical non-inferiority in the KOOS at 12-18 months was explained by the fact that cartilage requires a longer time to be repaired, given the bradytrophic nature of human joint cartilage and the long time required  for  differentiation  and  functional  repair.  However,  statistically  significant  superiority  over microfracture  at  later  time  points  could  not  be  shown,  although  the  formal  requirements  to demonstrate non-inferiority at 36 months are fulfilled. In the supportive study TIG/ACT/02 the results of the informal interim analysis show a trend towards clinical  benefit.  However,  only  9/20  patients  reached  the  24  month  time  point  by  the  time  of  the analysis and were assessed for efficacy. The contribution of this study to the benefit/risk analysis of the product is small. Clinical safety · Patient exposure A total of 463 patients have been exposed to ChondroCelect. In the two clinical studies 71 patients w were  treated  with  ChondroCelect,  and  61  underwent  microfracture  treatment.  Twenty-two  (22) patients  were  included  in  the  expanded  access  program  and  370  patients  were  included  in  the compassionate use program. Safety data from 334 patients are available from the compassionate use program. In both the clinical studies and programs, the absolute dose of ChondroCelect received was determined by the size of the lesion(s) treated. · Adverse events First, the overall frequencies of adverse events (AEs) between the two groups are summarised. Then, those AEs that occurred more frequently in the ChondroCelect group as compared to the microfracture group are discussed. Comparative AE frequencies (TIG/ACT/01&amp;EXT - ChondroCelect vs microfracture) Medicinal product no longer authorised

Table 3 provides an overview of the frequencies of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in both treatment groups in the pivotal clinical trial (ChondroCelect and microfracture). Overall, patients treated  with  either  ChondroCelect  or  microfracture  show  a  similar  frequency  pattern  of  TEAEs.  A slightly larger proportion of the patients in the ChondroCelect group experienced at least one TEAE when compared to microfracture (98% versus 82%); a similar pattern is also observed when only the related TEAEs are considered (78% versus 62%). The number of patients that experienced a severe TEAE, however, is very similar in both treatment groups. In contrast, the number of serious adverse events (SAEs) or the number of patients with an adverse event (AE) leading to discontinuation, was higher in the microfracture group (respectively 9.8% versus 18%, and 0% versus 4.9%). The totality of these  data  suggests  that,  despite  the  observed  excess  of  TEAEs  in  the  ChondroCelect  group,  the patient's functionality was not mayoral impacted. There is thus no indication that patients treated with ChondroCelect  in  the  2-step  ACI  procedure  are  significantly  more  impaired  by  AEs  than  patients treated by a 1-step microfracture technique.

TEAE Patients with at least one related TEAE Patients with at least one treatment-emergent SAE Patients with at least one AE leading to discontinuation Reference: Database cut-off TIG/ACT/01&amp;EXT (13-Feb-2008) ° AEs are presented as number of patients experiencing at least one AE A similar pattern in frequencies of TEAEs between both treatment groups is further confirmed when the  AEs  are  summarised  by  body  system  (Table  4).  Up  to  the  36  months  time  point,  the  highest incidence of TEAEs in both treatment groups were observed in the following four body systems: i) Musculoskeletal &amp; Connective Tissue Disorders, ii) Infections and Infestations, iii) Injury, Poisoning &amp; Procedural Complications, and iv) General Disorders &amp; Administration Site Disorders. The incidence in the Musculoskeletal &amp; Connective Disorders as well as in the Injury, Poisoning &amp; Procedural Complications body system was higher  in  the  ChondroCelect  group  as  compared  to  the  microfracture  group  (respectively  92% versus  77%,  p=0.038;  and  41%  versus  25%,  p=0.070).  These  observed  differences  relate  to  some specific AEs in the ChondroCelect group, and will be further discussed here below. For all other body systems,  the  frequency  in  AEs  was  quite  similar  between  both  treatment  groups  and  no  statistical differences could be found.

Mediastinal Disorders Reference: Database cut-off TIG/ACT/01&amp;EXT (13-Feb-2008) ° AEs are presented as number of patients; an AE is counted only once per patient * Comparison of treatment groups by Fisher's exact test When applying a conservative statistical significance of p&lt;0.1, a selection of those AEs that are more frequently observed in the ChondroCelect group as compared to the microfracture group up to the 36 months time point is obtained. These are summarised in Table 5. As could be expected, four of these selected AEs categorised in the Musculoskeletal &amp; Connective Tissue Disorders group (i.e. cartilage hypertrophy,  joint  swelling,  joint  crepitation,  and  joint  effusion),  whereas  influenza-like  illness  is categorised in the General Disorders &amp; Administration Site Disorders group (of note: this body system also includes the treatment failures, which will be discussed in a later section). Graft complication is categorised in the Injury, Poisoning &amp; Procedural Complications group.

## Symptomatic cartilage hypertrophy

Symptomatic  cartilage  hypertrophy  is  an  undesirable  AE  that  may  result  in  physical  impairment requiring surgical arthroscopic intervention. Symptomatic cartilage hypertrophy is generally resolved after arthroscopic shaving during day-care arthroscopy.

The events of cartilage hypertrophy included both those events that were symptomatic and those that were asymptomatic. The reporting of the latter type of (asymptomatic) hypertrophy occurred mostly at 1  year,  as  it  was  observed  at  the  12-month  arthroscopic  endpoint  biopsy  procedure  related  to  the clinical protocol.

Of  the  14  ChondroCelect-treated  patients  who  had  AEs  of  cartilage  hypertrophy  recorded,  7 had symptomatic  AEs  (7/51  [14%]).  The  other  7  patients  had  AEs  that  were  asymptomatic.  In  the microfracture group, 7 of the 8 patients had asymptomatic AEs of cartilage hypertrophy and one was symptomatic (1/61 [2%]). The difference between the two treatment groups of the clinically relevant symptomatic hypertrophy is statistically significant (p = 0.022). It is worth noting that the majority of these events occurred in the first 18 months post-surgery, indicating that this event is related to the regenerative  phase  of  the  repair  tissue.  All  reported  AEs  of  cartilage  hypertrophy  were  mild  or moderate in severity in both treatment groups. None was recorded as severe and none was reported as serious. In the pivotal clinical trial, a periosteal flap was used to cover the ChondroCelect implant as this was at that time the standard surgical procedure. However, the use of a periosteal flap to cover the cultured chondrocytes is also generally considered to involve a risk of cartilage hypertrophy. Indeed, literature data indicate that tissue hypertrophy can be related to the periosteal flap that is used to cover the defect before  injection  of  the  cells  (Gooding et  al .,  2006).  In  recent  publications,  the  potential  risk  of hypertrophy was reported to be reduced with the use of biological membranes without periosteal cells (Haddo et al ,  2004; Gooding et al .,  2006; Steinwachs and Kreuz, 2007). In current clinical practice, the  use  of  a  periosteal  cover  has  decreased  over  the  last  years  in  favour  of  the  use  of  biological membranes. The preference for collagen membranes was also confirmed by the experts in the ad-hoc scientific advisory group organised by EMEA on October 13, 2008. It is anticipated that the frequency of hypertrophy as observed in the clinical trial can be reduced when a biological membrane is used., This is supported by a comparison of the symptomatic hypertrophy frequency observed in the pivotal trial  population  (7/51  patients,  i.e.  14%)  and  the  patients  treated  under  compassionate  use  (6/334 patients, i.e. 1.8%). Joint swelling The reported frequency of joint swelling is higher after ChondroCelect than after microfracture and is mainly  explained  by  the  arthrotomy  performed  for  the  ChondroCelect  implantation.  Knee  swelling suggests  the  accumulation  of  fluid  in  and/or  around  the  knee.  It  is  a  well-described  symptom  after arthrotomy as a result of the inflammatory synovial reaction due to incision (Muckle, 1984). This is further  confirmed  by  analysing  the  temporal  relationship  of  the  reported  joint  swelling  events  with surgery, showing a high frequency and a significant difference with microfracture in the first weeks after the intervention. 7 of the 11 patients reported with joint swelling  after  ChondroCelect experienced  the  AE  in  the  first  4 weeks  after  intervention,  compared  to  none  after  microfracture (p=0.003). This earlier onset in the ChondroCelect group is linked to the arthrotomy procedure. After this initial 4-week post-operative period, no significant differences between the 2 groups were reported (i.e.  3  patients  in  the  ChondroCelect  group  versus  4  patients  in  the  microfracture  group).  Postoperative  swelling  is  not  associated  with  a  significant  risk  and  is  temporary.  No  events  of  joint swelling were recorded as severe during the study, and none was reported as serious. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Compassionate use program

## Comparison of TIG/ACT/01&amp;EXT and compassionate use AEs

In  Table  6,  a  comparison  is  made  between  the  safety  results  of  the  pivotal  trial  population  and  the patients  treated  under  compassionate  use,  this  latter  population  being  considered  to  be  more representative  for  the  real-life  situation.  In  this  table,  only  those  AEs  that  are  considered  related  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ChondroCelect  or  to  the  surgical  intervention  are  reported.  Overall,  the  frequencies  of  AEs  are consistently  lower  in  the  compassionate  use  population  as  compared  to  the  TIG/ACT/01&amp;EXT population.  This  is  likely  explained  by  a  relative  underreporting  of  AEs  in  the  real-life  situation, outside the controlled environment of a clinical trial. Assuming a 50% underreporting rate, the overall frequency for most of the reported AEs becomes similar to the frequencies observed in the clinical trial.

The  incidence  of  symptomatic  cartilage  hypertrophy  was  reduced  to  1.8%  in  the  CUP  patients compared to 14% in the pivotal study. It can be assumed that the 6 reported AEs in the CUP patients are all symptomatic AEs, as these patients did not undergo an endpoint biopsy. In the patients treated under compassionate use, ChondroCelect has been covered with a biological membrane (ChondroGide ® ) in the majority of the patients in contrast to the use of a periosteal flap in the pivotal trial. The lower incidence of cartilage hypertrophy observed in the CUP is in line with other reports published in the literature on low hypertrophy rates with a biological membrane (Haddo et al ,  2004; Gooding et  al .,  2006;  Steinwachs and Kreuz, 2007), and illustrates that a similar benefit of using a biological membrane can also be obtained for ChondroCelect.

In the pivotal study, a similar frequency of Arthralgia was observed in the ChondroCelect (47%) and microfracture (43%) groups up to the 36 months cut-off.

The relatively high incidence of joint effusion in the compassionate use patients (7.2% of patients in the  CUP as compared to 9.8% in the pivotal trial) is  considered  to  result  from  the  fact  that  in  this population more salvage cases with more complex concomitant knee pathology have been treated. A detailed assessment of these cases reveals that in all patients but 2, the effusion was considered to be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of mild (14) or moderate (8) intensity. None of the 24 cases was reported to be serious. In 15 cases, the joint  effusion  was  considered  to  be  related  to  the  surgical  procedure  (3  unknown,  6  not  related  to surgery), and in 7 patients the event was considered to be related to ChondroCelect.

For  all  other  AEs,  similar  or  slightly  lower  frequencies  are  observed  when  considering  a  50% underreporting in the CUP (i.e. joint crepitation [18% versus 5.1%], joint swelling [14% versus 6.9%], and treatment failures [9.8% versus 2.7%]).

- Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Twenty four serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 16 patients (8 SAEs in 7 patients in the TIG/ACT/01&amp;EXT study and 16 SAEs in 9 patients in the TIG/ACT/02 study). Only one of the 24 cases  was  considered  to  be  related  (possibly)  to  ChondroCelect.  In  this  case,  the  ChondroCelect transplant was considered to have failed possibly because of loosening of the periosteal flap, and was removed;  microfracture  was  subsequently  performed.  The  majority  of  cases  (14/24;  58%)  were considered to be unrelated to the study procedure. In the pivotal TIG/ACT/01&amp;EXT there were 10 SAEs in 8 patients recorded in the microfracture group. All cases recorded for microfracture-treated patients were considered either unrelated or unlikely to be related to the surgical procedure. From additional safety information gathered from the EAP and compassionate use program, there have been 26 SAEs reported for 18 patients (17 SAEs in 10 of the 22 patients in the EAP, 9 SAEs in 8 of the 163 patients in the compassionate use program for whom safety data are available). Of these, only one case was considered by the surgeon to be related (possibly) to ChondroCelect. In this case the patient experienced a deficit in knee mobilisation of moderate severity, approximately 2 months after the implantation of ChondroCelect (secured with ChondroGide). The patient underwent a procedure to mobilize the knee under anaesthesia. There  were  no  patient  deaths  recorded  during  the  study.  No  patients  are  recorded  as  being discontinued from the study due to SAEs. · Laboratory findings No laboratory findings related to the ChondroCelect treatment were reported. · Safety in special populations Twelve paediatric patients were treated in the compassionate use program with ChondroCelect. Five  of  the  11  (45%)  paediatric  patients  had  no  reported  AE.  The  remaining  6  paediatric  patients reported a total of 11 AEs. None of the AEs reported was considered serious. None of the AEs was considered to be related to ChondroCelect; most were considered to be related to surgery (7/11 events; 64%). Most AEs (8/11; 73%) were of mild or moderate intensity and did not require any intervention or  medical  therapy.  Three  events  were  recorded  as  being  of  severe  intensity,  one  event  of  muscle atrophy (n=2) and arthralgia (n=1). There was one pregnancy during ChondroCelect therapy. The mother developed pre.eclampsia, had a premature birth of a normal child. The use of ChondroCelect is not recommended during pregnancy, mainly because of the surgical procedures.

A clinically meaningful event that is not reported in the classical AE capturing relates to the impact of the procedures on the subchondral bone. Detailed assessment of the MRI data of the pivotal clinical trial  revealed  that  treatment  with  ChondroCelect  resulted  in  less  subchondral  bone  reaction  as compared to microfracture. A difference of 0.45 on the 0-3 global scale was observed in favour of ChondroCelect (p=0.0559). In addition, the incidence of subchondral bone plate elevation was shown to be higher in the microfracture group when compared to the ChondroCelect group (51.5% compared to 25%, respectively).

The most likely AEs observed when treating with ChondroCelect are arthralgia, symptomatic cartilage hypertrophy,  joint  crepitations,  joint  swelling,  and  joint  effusion.  Arthralgia  is  an  expected  and common consequence of knee surgery and occurs in both treatment arms. The data provided on the CUP  program  as  well  as  data  from  published  literature  suggest  that  it  may  be  possible  to  reduce ChondroCelect-related cartilage hypertrophy by the use of a collagen membrane. This modification will  reduce  the  potential  for  morbidity  associated  with  the  harvest  of  the  periosteal  flap.  Joint crepitation is a mild complication and occurs also in the normal population. Joint swelling is another complication  observed  at  a  higher  rate  in  the  ChondroCelect  group.  It  is  a  consequence  of  the arthrotomy surgical intervention and can as such not be avoided. However, it is a mild and transient complication. The incidence of joint effusion was higher after 18 months post-intervention than in the period  after  the  surgery,  and  the  reason  for  this  is  not  completely  clear.  Analysis  of  the  individual cases indicate that the underlying knee disease status as well as potentially higher physical activity rate might  be  related  to  this  occurrence.  The  cases  were  not  severe  or  serious,  and  do  therefore  not represent a major safety signal.

The  difference  in  subchondral  bone  reactions  relates  to  the  difference  in  surgical  intervention.  In microfracture,  chondral  defects  are  treated  by  recruiting  blood  and  cell  populations  including mesenchymal stem cells from the underlying bone marrow. By physically disturbing the osteochondral junction (upon puncturing the subchondral bone), an osteochondral defect is de facto created, and the biology of the cartilage defect significantly altered. In contrast, in ACI cells are re-implanted into the defect  without  damaging  the  subchondral  bone.  The  consequences  of  the  injury  and  its  increased subchondral  bone  reaction  and  moving  up  of  the  bone  front  might  lead  to  poorer  repair  tissue, decreased  durability  of  the  repair  tissue,  and  consequently  increased  risk  of  treatment  failure (Mithoefer et al .,  2009).  The  moving  of  the  bone  front  (ultimately  leading  to  intra-lesional osteophytes)  might  also  have  consequences  for  future  re-interventions.  Indeed,  Minas et  al .,  2009 published  that  prior  treatment  affecting  the  subchondral  bone  such  as  microfracture  increases  the failure rate of subsequent regenerative procedures. Finally, the biological stability of the osteochondral junction can be of importance in the development of osteoarthritis, instability of the subchondral bone and  progressive  bone  damage  being  important  factors  in  progression  to  the  disease  (Dieppe  and Lohmander,  2005;  McQueen,  2007).  It  is  also  anticipated  that  in  genetically  predisposed  patients, disturbing the osteochondral junction presents an additional risk for a fast progression to osteoarthritis (Luyten et al ., 2009). Discussion on Safety Microfracture  is  performed  in  one  arthroscopic  procedure  with  either  local  (spinal)  or  general anaesthesia, while ACI requires 2 interventions: an arthroscopy to inspect the defect and to obtain the biopsy specimen, and open knee surgery (arthrotomy) in general anaesthesia for chondrocyte implant four weeks later. In the case of patients included in the ChondroCelect arm of the pivotal trial a second incision was made over the medial tibia to harvest the periosteal flap which was needed to cover the chondrocyte suspension.

Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  ChondroCelect  is  considered  acceptable.  Considering  that  cartilage hypertrophy may be reduced by use of a physical seal the main difference is related to arthrotomy and the implantation procedure. No complications were seen in relation to the arthroscopic harvest biopsy procedure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Considering  the  higher  treatment  failures  after  microfracture  which  require  more  surgical  reinterventions microfracture and ChondroCelect implantation have a balanced safety profile.

The CHMP was of the opinion that the indications (section 4.1 of the SPC) should be reworded as follows:

Repair of single symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyle of the knee (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade III or IV) from 2 cm² onwards in adults. Concomitant asymptomatic cartilage lesions (ICRS grade I or II) might be present

Demonstration of efficacy is based on a randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of ChondroCelect in patients with lesions between 1-5cm 2 .

The scientific reasons for this change are described below: CHMP considered that putting a precise lower boundary would prevent physicians from treating patients on-label who have lesions in sizes formally below 2cm2, for whom, however, ChondroCelect treatment might nevertheless be medically indicated by the individual decision of the treating physician. Likewise, CHMP recognised the greater need for the treatment of larger lesions, but was concerned about the amount of data available for larger lesions. Therefore, in line with previous similar scenarios, the CHMP has taken the approach to put an indication that is permissive, but to point out the limitations of the data and to clearly inform the prescribing physician in section 4.1. A wording like this is usually perceived as stronger as compared to a wording in section 5.1, thus being more in line with the overall principles of the CAT draft opinion. This allows the physician to take an informed decision for a particular patient's situation based on the knowledge of the availability of evidence from the pivotal study. 2.5 Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system as agreed at CAT The CAT considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the Applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

The CAT, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the risk management system should be requested according to the Article 14 (2) of the Regulation (EC) 1394/2007. There are the following particular causes for concern:

- There were deficiencies in the conduct of the pre-authorisation studies and uncertainties related to the result of the submitted single pivotal trial.
- There is unknown long-term durability of the product efficacy.

· Benefit/risk of the product is significantly influenced by the level of compliance with the defined procedures throughout the treatment with ChondroCelect, from the biopsy harvest till the correct physiotherapy. The CAT, having considered the data submitted in the application is of the opinion that the following risk minimisation activities are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product: The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall ensure that the medicinal product will be distributed only to Healthcare Establishments that meet criteria described in the Risk Management Plan. The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall ensure, prior to the distribution of the product to a particular Healthcare Establishment, that all surgeons and other healthcare professionals involved in the handling and administration of ChondroCelect or its components, as well as those involved in follow-up of patients treated with ChondroCelect in the Healthcare Establishment, receive training as per the educational programme described in the Risk Management Plan. The educational programme for healthcare professionals contains the following components: · Training material for Surgeons · Training material for other Healthcare Professionals · Informed consent for the patients to be signed prior to the treatment with ChondroCelect The training materials for Surgeons shall include the following key messages and components: · Summary of Product Characteristics · The biopsy harvest procedure · The surgical checklist to be completed at the operating theatre immediately prior to the first incision confirming the right patient, the right product, the right side of the implantation, and the type of biological membrane and fibrin sealant to be used in the procedure. · The implantation procedure by knee-joint arthrotomy · The follow-up protocol The training material for other Healthcare Professionals shall include the following key messages and components: · Summary of Product Characteristics · The need for screening of donors using patient questionnaire and laboratory tests for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV, and Syphilis · The handling of the biopsy harvest Medicinal product no longer authorised

- The schedule of follow-up of patients
- The handling of ChondroCelect and its preparation for the implantation
- The recommended physiotherapy

The CAT also considered that performing of post-authorisation studies will need to be a part of the Pharmacovigilance plan and Efficacy follow-up plan presented in the Risk Management Plan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the Risk Management Plan, the MAH commits to confirm and extend the pivotal clinical study data with an appropriately designed trial. The design should be subject to EMEA Scientific Advice, and agreed with the CAT.

In  the  Risk  Management  Plan,  the  MAH  also  commits  to  further  study  efficacy  and  safety  of ChondroCelect  in  large  lesions.  The  design  of  such  a  study  should  be  subject  to  EMEA  Scientific Advice, and agreed with the CAT.

The timetable for the conduct of the studies was agreed with the Applicant. The MAH commits to submit, within two weeks after the CHMP opinion, an update to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) to include the following points:

a. Studies, and their protocol outlines as requested by CAT and CHMP to be reflected in the Pharmacovigilance plan and Efficacy Follow-up plan. b. Timetables of the actions in the Pharmacovigilance plan and in the Efficacy Follow-up plan: - Submission of application for Scientific Advice to EMEA regarding all interventional studies planned in the RMP - Date of CHMP opinion + 2 month - Start of the studies in a way recommended by the Scientific Advice - within 1 year after adoption of the requested EMEA Scientific Advice - Annual reporting providing interim analysis of safety and efficacy from the studies. The CHMP agreed with the above 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation Quality The Applicant has made considerable progress towards the improvement of critical quality aspects in the  manufacture  and  control  of  ChondroCelect.    The  outstanding  major  concerns  raised  during  the procedure could be resolved and are now considered adequately addressed with data and/or follow-up commitments. A number of control measures as well as adequate tools to monitor functionality of the cells and to perform a robust process validation have been successfully implemented. Some activities related to the specification limits are still under development and await their final implementation. The Applicant has committed to address these minor outstanding issues through follow-up measures. In  conclusion,  information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  ChondroCelect  Active Substance and finished product have been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of the tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of the manufacturing process and finished product,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and uniform performance in the clinic. Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology Medicinal product no longer authorised

Primary pharmacodynamic studies were performed in two animal models, an ectopic model in nu/nu mice and an orthotopic model in goats. These pharmacodynamic studies were conducted non-GLP. The implications of this deficiency to the validity and significance of the safety data collected in the pivotal goat study are considered tolerable.

The mouse ECFA assay was originally central on the one hand in validating the potency assay, and on the other hand in correlating the potency data with the cartilage repair in clinically relevant setting, i.e. implantation to knee. Since a direct correlation between the potency and the cartilage repair in patients could not be demonstrated, the animal data would have been invaluable in providing evidence for this

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

interrelationship. Since the Applicant has later developed a new functional assay to follow potency of the Medicinal product during characterisation and process validation studies, the problems related to the validity of the ECFA assay in bridging the potency and clinical efficacy data is no more an issue.

The studies  in  goats  are  adequate  to  demonstrate  proof  of  principle  in  a  clinically  relevant  setting. However, the  set  of  data  is  very  limited  and  the  Applicant  did  not  demonstrate  a  valid  correlation between  the  ECFA  histology  score  and  cartilage  repair  in  the  orthotopic  goat  model.  In  addition, although  the  orthotopic  goat  model  demonstrates  the  proof  of  concept  of  ChondroCelect-like chondrocytes, this model is not fully representing the human situation (such as using membrane/ fibrin sealant) and is limited for cartilage repair in long-term.

Since data in humans are available, it is agreed that further data to obtain a real correlation between the ECFA histology score and cartilage repair in the goat model is not appropriate.

Regarding the fibrin sealants used together with ChondroCelect compatibility data for the fibrin glue TissuCol (Tisseel) have demonstrated the safe and effective use of this sealant with ChondroCelect in non-clinical studies. The concomitant use of Quixil in the pivotal clinical trial did not reveal any safety signal so far. The concomitant use of fibrin glue has been addressed in the SPC. Efficacy In one pivotal, multicentre, randomized, controlled phase III study ACI  was  compared to Microfracture  with  regards  to  structural  repair  and  KOOS.  Results  of  the  histological  analysis  of structural repair at 12 months favour ChondroCelect and the difference is statistically significant for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. It was, however, acknowledged that this end point was not in compliance with GCP as it was developed during the conduct of the study as the original a priori determined primary efficacy point was considered as invalid. The  mean  change  in  overall  KOOS  from  baseline  to  the  average  of  12  to  18  months  was  slightly higher for patients in the ChondroCelect group than for patients in the microfracture group. The results fulfil the predefined criteria for non-inferiority and changes are clinically relevant. The clinical data have also been analysed when all patients reached at least 36 months follow-up. During  the  procedure  the  Applicant  provided  data  for  the  pivotal  clinical  trial  including  graphical illustrations of a mixed model with time as a categorical variable. The additional mixed model analysis indicates  that  change  (increase)  from  baseline  in  KOOS  in  the  ChondroCelect  group  (CC)  is numerically more pronounced when compared to the Microfracture group (MI), but does not give a statistically significant difference at months 36, 48 and 60 (when considering multiplicity) in favor of ChondroCelect. However, it does fulfill the formal requirement for non-inferiority. Neither BMI nor Gender has a significant influence on the overall KOOS. The results of time points beyond 36 months were to be taken only as descriptive, because of the small number of patients already reaching later follow-up time points (i.e. 48 and 60 months). Safety The  overall  safety  summary  shows  that  the  main  difference  in  treatment  related  adverse  events compared to microfracture is related to the open knee surgery (arthrotomy) which causes an increase in  joint  swelling  and  possible  joint  effusion.  Cartilage  hypertrophy  can  be  reduced  by  using  a biomembrane  to  cover  the  lesion,  and  will  therefore  not  pose  a  major  safety  concern  in  future applications of ChondroCelect. However, a higher number of patients in the microfracture arm have a treatment  failure  and  require  a  subsequent  surgical  intervention.  Therefore  the  short  and  long  term complication rate is not higher for ChondroCelect compared to microfracture. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Risk-benefit assessment

The CAT, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the risk management system should be requested according to the Article 14 (2) of the Regulation (EC) 1394/2007. There are the following particular causes for concern:

Given that  microfracture  is  considered  an  effective  standard  treatment  for  femoral  cartilage  lesions below  3-4cm²  size,  and  given  the  proven  statistical  non-inferiority  of  ACI  with  ChondroCelect  to microfracture as well as the balanced overall safety profile the final overall B/R is considered positive. However, considering the limited data as efficacy is only based on one single pivotal trial, follow up of the clinical efficacy is required.

· There were deficiencies in the conduct of the pre-authorisation studies and uncertainties related to the result of the submitted single pivotal trial. · There is unknown long-term durability of the product efficacy. · Benefit/risk of the product is significantly influenced by the level of compliance with the defined procedures throughout the treatment with ChondroCelect, from the biopsy harvest till the correct physiotherapy. Therefore, fully produced Risk Management Plan, including Pharmacovigilance plan, Risk Minimisation plan and Efficacy Follow-up plan was required. The details are described above in the Chapter 3.5 - Pharmacovigilance. Benefits The benefits of the ACI technique using ChondroCelect for smaller lesions (up to 5 cm2) are based on the  demonstration  of  superiority  for  structural  repair  and  non-inferiority  in  the  clinical  analysis (KOOS) compared to the standard treatment microfracture. ACI techniques would particularly be suitable for larger  defects  ( ≥ 4  cm 2 ),  for  which  other  suitable treatment  does  not  exist.  While  limited  data  are  available  with  ChondroCelect  the  literature  data provided confirm this observation. The repair of full size chondrocyte defects and the restoration of functional  cartilage  need  special  consideration  with  the  aim  to  reduce  the  risk  of  developing  knee osteoarthritis on the long term. Risks The combination of current conservative and invasive therapies for cartilage injuries is associated with reasonably good control of symptoms and physical function in the short term. However, it is less clear whether these therapies provide a good long term outcome or whether the injury will have long term consequences, such as secondary arthrosis.

Based  on  the  CAT/CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CAT  considered  by majority  that the risk-benefit balance  of ChondroCelect  in  the  treatment  of  repair  of single symptomatic cartilaginous defects of the femoral condyles of the knee (ICRS grade III or IV) in adults (Concomitant asymptomatic cartilage lesions (ICRS grade I or II) might be present) was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

The CAT, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the risk management system should be requested according to the Article 14 (2) of the Regulation (EC) 1394/2007. There are the following particular causes for concern:

- There were deficiencies in the conduct of the pre-authorisation studies and uncertainties related to the result of the submitted single pivotal trial.
- There is unknown long-term durability of the product efficacy.
- Benefit/risk of the product is significantly influenced by the level of compliance with the defined procedures throughout the treatment with ChondroCelect, from the biopsy harvest till the correct physiotherapy.

The CHMP agreed with the Benefit-Risk assessment and recommendation for approval of the Marketing Authorisation for ChondroCelect as expressed by the CAT. The CHMP had a comment to amend the wording of the indication (section 4.1 of the SPC) as follows: Repair of single symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyle of the knee (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade III or IV) from 2 cm² onwards in adults. Concomitant asymptomatic cartilage lesions (ICRS grade I or II) might be present Demonstration of efficacy is based on a randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of ChondroCelect in patients with lesions between 1-5cm 2 . The scientific reasons for this change are described below: CHMP considered that putting a precise lower boundary would prevent physicians from treating patients on-label who have lesions in sizes formally below 2cm 2 , for whom, however, ChondroCelect treatment might nevertheless be medically indicated by the individual decision of the treating physician. Likewise, CHMP recognised the greater need for the treatment of larger lesions, but was concerned about the limited amount of data available for larger lesions. Therefore, in line with previous similar scenarios, the CHMP has taken the approach to put an indication that is permissive, but to point out the limitations of the data and to clearly inform the prescribing physician in section 4.1. A wording like this is usually perceived as stronger as compared to a wording in section 5.1, thus being more in line with the overall outcome of the CAT draft opinion. This allows the physician to take an informed decision for a particular patient's situation based on the knowledge of the availability of evidence from the pivotal study.
