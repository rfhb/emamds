## Scientific conclusions

Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR(s)  for  roxadustat,  the  scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on Secondary Hypothyroidism from clinical trial(s), the literature, spontaneous reports including  in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and in view of a plausible  mechanism  of  action,  the  PRAC  considers  a  causal  relationship  between  roxadustat  and Secondary Hypothyroidism  is  at  least  a  reasonable  possibility.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product information of products containing roxadustat should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for roxadustat the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing roxadustat is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
