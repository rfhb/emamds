1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The

CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update the recommendations for the management of pyrexia and to reflect the results of cross comparison clinical studies that used either the existing or updated pyrexia management guidance; the Package Leaflets are updated accordingly. In addition, the WSA took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives and to include minor editorial changes in the Package Leaflets. The requested worksharing procedure proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, and Package Leaflet. Amendments are also made to Annex II and Annex IIIA of Tafinlar product information to bring it in line with the QRD template version 10.2. | 22/07/2021 | 26/08/2021 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | A comparison of five large clinical studies showed that a revised guidance for the management of pyrexia resulted in a reduction in the incidence of grade 3/4 pyrexia AEs, hospitalizations due to serious pyrexia, and pyrexia with complications. Based on this comparison, it is recommended that therapy should be interrupted (trametinib when used as monotherapy, and both trametinib and dabrafenib when used in combination; dabrafenib when used as monotherapy, and both dabrafenib and trametinib when used in combination) if a patient's temperature is ≥38oC. In case of recurrence, therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia. Treatment with anti-pyretics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen/paracetamol should be initiated. The use of oral corticosteroids should be considered in those instances in which anti-pyretics are insufficient. Patients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of infection and if necessary treated in line with local practice. Trametinib, dabrafenib or both trametinib and dabrafenib, when used in |

Norethindrone exposure increased by 20% and ethinyl estradiol exposure was similar when co- administered with trametinib. Based on these results, no loss of efficacy of hormonal contraceptives is expected when co administered with trametinib monotherapy.

This cohort included patients with BRAFV600E mutant melanoma with asymptomatic brain metastases without prior local brain-directed therapy and ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The intracranial response rate in 76 patients in cohort A was 59% (95% CI: 47.3-70.4). Due to small sample size reflected by wide 95% CIs, the results in cohorts B, C, and D should be interpreted with caution. The safety profile observed in the study appears to be consistent with the integrated safety profile of the combination.

The 3-year OS estimate for the combination arm was greater than for dabrafenib monotherapy (44% vs. 32%, respectively). The median OS for the combination arm was approximately 8 months longer than the median OS for dabrafenib monotherapy (26.7 months versus 18.7 months). These data also demonstrated a reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.96) which was consistent with the primary OS analysis. An updated OS analysis (15 July 2016) for study MEK116513 (COMBI-v) demonstrated improvement in OS for the combination compared with vemurafenib monotherapy. The 3-year OS |

In addition the MAH has taken the opportunity to align the storage recommendations in section 5 of the Package Leaflet with the current wording in section 6.4 of the SmPC for Mekinist.

The median OS for the combination arm was approximately 8 months longer than the median OS for vemurafenib monotherapy (26.1 months versus 17.8 months). These data also demonstrated a reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.83) which was consistent with the primary OS analysis. These updated 3- year OS data for these two phase III studies demonstrated that durable survival is achievable with dabrafenib and trametinib, that the beneficial effect of combining dabrafenib with trametinib is maintained over time and that long-term clinical tolerability is considered acceptable.   |

As it cannot be excluded that strong inhibition of hepatic P-gp may result in increased levels of trametinib, caution is advised when co-administering trametininb with medicinal products that are strong inhibitors of P-gp (e.g. verapamil, cyclosporine, ritonavir, quinidine, itraconazole). In vitro studies demonstrated that trametinib is metabolised predominantly via deacetylation alone or with mono-oxygenation or in combination with glucuronidation biotransformation pathways. CYP3A4 oxidation is considered a minor pathway of metabolism. The deacetylation is mediated by carboxyl-esterases (i.e. carboxylesterase 1b/c and 2) and may also be mediated by other hydrolytic enzymes. Trametinib was found to be an in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, an inducer of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of the transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, Pgp and BCRP. However, based on the low dose and low clinical systemic exposure relative to the in vitro potency of inhibition or induction values, trametinib is not considered to be a in vivo inhibitor or inducer of these enzymes or transporters, although transient inhibition of BCRP substrates in the gut may occur. Trametinib is not a substrate of CYP enzymes or of the transporters BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, OCT1, |

| II/0001/G | This was an application for a group of variations. C.1.4 - To update Section 5.3 (Preclinical Safety Data) of the SmPC following the completion of a trametinib in vitro phototoxicity assay C.1.13 - Submission of the final reports from trametinib and metabolite M5 plasma protein binding studies C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 20/11/2014   | 20/04/2015   | SmPC                     | Trametinib was phototoxic in an in vitro mouse fibroblast 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) assay at significantly higher concentrations than clinical exposures, indicating that there is low risk for phototoxicity to patients taking trametinib. M5 is highly bound to plasma proteins with a free fraction of 1.2%, which is comparable to the free fraction of trametinib at clinically relevant concentrations of 1.4%. The calculated contribution of M5 to the total pharmacological activity is 12%. This is less than the recommended cut-off value of 50%. Therefore, it is agreed that the enzyme(s) and transporter(s) involved in the elimination pathway(s) of M5 do not have to be further investigated. |
