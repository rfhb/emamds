## ANNEX I

## SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1 . NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

mRESVIA dispersion for injection in pre-filled syringe Respiratory Syncytial Virus mRNA vaccine

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each single-dose pre-filled syringe contains one dose of 0.5 mL.

One dose (0.5 mL) contains 50 micrograms of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles.

The active substance is a single-stranded 5' capped mRNA encoding the RSV-A glycoprotein F stabilised in the prefusion conformation.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Dispersion for injection.

White to off-white dispersion (pH: 7.0 - 8.0).

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

mRESVIA is indicated for active immunisation for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in:

- adults 60 years of age and older;
- adults 18 through 59 years of age who are at increased risk for LRTD caused by RSV.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Posology

The recommended dose of mRESVIA is one single dose of 0.5 mL.

Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of mRESVIA in children (from birth to less than 18 years of age) have not yet been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

For intramuscular injection only.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mRESVIA should be administered preferably in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. The injection should be given using standard aseptic technique.

The vaccine must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally.

The vaccine should not be mixed with any other vaccines or medicinal products in the same syringe.

For instructions for preparation of the medicinal product before administration and special handling requirements, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis

Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis, following administration of the vaccine.

## Anxiety-related reactions

Anxiety-related reactions including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.

## Concurrent illness

Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute infection or febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not delay vaccination.

## Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders

As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals.

## Immunocompromised individuals

Safety and immunogenicity data on mRESVIA are not available for immunocompromised individuals. Individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy or patients with immunodeficiency may have a diminished immune response to this vaccine.

## Limitations of vaccine effectiveness

As with all vaccines, vaccination with mRESVIA may not protect all vaccine recipients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Excipient - sodium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 0.5 mL dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Use with other vaccine

mRESVIA can be administered concomitantly with:

- seasonal influenza vaccines, either standard dose or high dose unadjuvanted
- COVID-19 mRNA vaccine

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of mRESVIA in pregnant women. Animal studies with mRESVIA do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of mRESVIA during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether mRESVIA is excreted in human milk.

## Fertility

No human data on the effect of mRESVIA on fertility are available.

Animal studies with mRESVIA do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to female reproductive toxicity. Animal studies are insufficient to assess male reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

mRESVIA has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 (e.g., fatigue, dizziness) may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety profile and the frequencies of adverse reactions presented below are based on data generated in two clinical studies: Study 1 in adults ≥ 60 years of age (n=18 245) and Study 2 in adults 18 through 59 years of age (n=502).

## Individuals 60 years of age and older

In Study 1, which enrolled individuals 60 years of age and older, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were injection site pain (55.9%), fatigue (30.8%), headache (26.7%), myalgia (25.6%) and arthralgia (21.7%). The onset of most solicited local and systemic adverse reactions was within 1 to 2 days after injection and resolved within 1 to 2 days after onset. The majority of local and systemic solicited adverse reactions were mild in intensity.

Individuals 18 through 59 years of age at increased risk for LRTD caused by RSV

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Study 2, which enrolled individuals 18 through 59 years of age, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were injection site pain (73.9%), fatigue (36.9%), headache (33.3%), myalgia (28.9%) and arthralgia (22.7%). Most solicited local and systemic adverse reactions had onset within 1 to 2 days after injection, and a median duration of 2 days.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions reported are listed according to the following frequency convention:

Very common (≥ 1/10) Common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10) Uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100) Rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000) Very rare (&lt; 1/10 000)

Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness (Table 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

* Lymphadenopathy was collected as 'Axillary (underarm) swelling or tenderness ipsilateral to the side of injection'.

† In Study 1, one participant in the vaccine group had a serious adverse event of facial paralysis with onset on Day 5 assessed by the investigator as related to injection. Within the 42-day risk window following injection, Bell's palsy and/or facial paralysis was reported by 2 participants in the mRESVIA group and 2 participants in the placebo group. All 4 of these participants had risk factors for Bell's palsy. In Study 2, one participant who had multiple confounding underlying medical conditions and received a lower dose of the investigational vaccine had an SAE of Bell's palsy on Day 43 that was assessed by the investigator as related to injection.

‡ Reported as common in individuals 60 years of age and older (Study 1).

§ Urticaria has been observed with either acute onset (within a few days after vaccination) or delayed onset (up to approximately two weeks after vaccination) and may be acute or chronic (≥ 6 weeks) in duration.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

Overdose with mRESVIA is unlikely due to its single dose presentation (see section 4.2).

In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccine, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX05

## Mechanism of action

mRESVIA is an mRNA-based vaccine encoding the membrane-anchored RSV-A F glycoprotein stabilised in the prefusion conformation through changes to the amino acid sequence. The RSV-A prefusion glycoprotein is antigenically cross-reactive to the RSV-B prefusion glycoprotein. The prefusion F glycoprotein is the target of neutralising antibodies that mediate protection against RSV-associated respiratory tract disease.

mRESVIA stimulates production of RSV-A and RSV-B neutralising antibodies and induction of antigen-specific cellular immune responses.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

## Study 1 - in individuals 60 years of age and older

Study 1 (EUDRA CT number 2021-005026-20) is an ongoing phase 2/3 randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal study conducted in 22 countries in Central and Latin America, Africa, Asia Pacific, North America and Europe. The study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single dose of mRESVIA for the prevention of RSVLRTD in adults ≥ 60 years, with or without underlying medical conditions.

The primary efficacy analysis population (per-protocol efficacy set) included 35 088 participants who received either mRESVIA (n=17 572) or placebo (n=17 516). Among all participants, 50.9% were male, 63.5% were White, 12.2% were Black or African American, 8.7% were Asian, and 34.6% were Hispanic or Latino. The median age was 67 years (range: 60-96), with 63.5% aged 60-69, 30.9% aged

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

70-79, and 5.5% aged ≥ 80 years. A total of 6.9% had protocol-defined LRTD risk factors [congestive heart failure (CHF) and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)] and 29.3% had ≥ 1 comorbidity of interest. A total of 21.8% scored 'vulnerable' or 'frail' according to Edmonton Frail Scale.

The primary efficacy endpoints were the prevention of a first episode of RSV-LRTD with ≥ 2 or ≥ 3 symptoms, occurring between 14 days and 12 months post injection. RSV-LRTD was defined as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed RSV infection and radiologic evidence of pneumonia or experienced new or worsening of ≥ 2 of predefined symptoms lasting ≥ 24 hours including shortness of breath, cough and/or fever, wheezing, sputum production, tachypnoea, hypoxemia and pleuritic chest pain.

The primary efficacy endpoints were met (lower bound of the alpha-adjusted confidence interval [CI] of the vaccine efficacy [VE] was &gt; 20%), including VE of 83.7% (95.88% CI: 66.0%, 92.2%) against RSV-LRTD as defined by ≥ 2 symptoms. The other primary efficacy endpoint against RSV-LRTD defined by ≥ 3 symptoms was also met, with a VE of 82.4% (96.36% CI: 34.8%, 95.3%). These analyses were performed after a median of 3.7 months of follow-up.

An additional analysis of efficacy was performed after a median of 8.6 months (range: 0.5 to 17.7 months) of follow-up. A single dose of mRESVIA met the same criterion as defined in the primary analysis for the prevention of RSV-LRTD with ≥ 2 symptoms (see Table 2). The vaccine efficacy against RSV-LRTD with ≥ 3 symptoms was 63.0% (95% CI: 37.3%, 78.2%; number of participants in mRESVIA group was n=19 / N=18 112 and in the placebo group was n=51 / N=18 045).

At the time of the additional analysis, point estimates of VE in the subgroup analyses by age, comorbidity and frailty were generally consistent with VE of overall population based on the PPE Set (Table 2).

* Based on the number of participants in each subgroup.

† NA = not applicable due to low number of total cases accrued in this subgroup.

‡  Comorbidities included in this analysis were chronic cardiopulmonary conditions, including CHF, COPD, asthma and chronic respiratory conditions as well as diabetes, advanced liver, and advanced kidney disease.

As shortness of breath is associated with more severe RSV disease, an exploratory analysis was conducted. A total of 54 cases of RSV-LRTD with shortness of breath occurred: 43 in placebo recipients and 11 in mRESVIA recipients.

Study 2 - in individuals 18 through 59 years of age at increased risk for LRTD caused by RSV Study 2 is a phase 3 randomised, double-blind trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of mRESVIA in individuals 18 through 59 years of age at increased risk for LRTD caused by RSV. The clinical study was conducted in the US, Canada and United Kingdom.

Eligible participants enrolled in the study had at least one of the conditions that increased their risk for developing RSV-LRTD. Of the 494 participants in the Per-Protocol (PP) Set, diabetes mellitus (DM) was reported in 59.7%, persistent asthma in 38.1%, coronary artery disease (CAD) in 20.9%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 10.1%, congestive heart failure (CHF) in 8.9%, and chronic respiratory disease other than COPD or asthma in approximately 2.4%. Additionally, 63.6% of participants had a BMI of 30 kg/m² or higher, indicating a significant prevalence of obesity within the study population. The median age was 53 years (range: 19-59). Most participants were White (80.2%), 53.6% were female and 27.5% of participants were Hispanic or Latino.

Efficacy of mRESVIA in this population was inferred by comparison of RSV neutralising antibody (nAb) levels at Day 29 post-vaccination to those in a subset of Study 1 participants ≥ 60 years of age . Non-inferiority was demonstrated for the nAb geometric mean titres (GMTs) for RSV A and RSV B [Study 2 PP/Study 1 Per-Protocol Immunogenicity (PPI) subset; lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the geometric mean ratio (GMR) &gt; 0.667].

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with mRESVIA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD), as per paediatric investigation plan (PIP) decision, for the granted indication (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of repeat toxicity, genotoxicity and developmental and reproductive toxicity.

## General toxicity

General toxicity studies were conducted in rats (intramuscularly with mRESVIA receiving up to two doses that exceeded the human dose, once every 3 weeks or intramuscularly receiving up to 4-dose administrations of related vaccine drug products once every 2 weeks). Transient and reversible injection site oedema and erythema and transient and reversible changes in laboratory tests (including increases in eosinophils, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen) were observed. Results suggests the toxicity potential to humans is low.

## Genotoxicity/carcinogenicity

In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies were conducted to evaluate the novel lipid component SM-102 of the vaccine. Results suggests the genotoxicity potential to humans is very low. Carcinogenicity studies were not performed.

## Developmental and reproductive toxicity

In a combined developmental and reproductive toxicity study, mRESVIA was administered to female rats 4 times intramuscularly at 96 micrograms/dose (twice prior to mating [28 and 14 days prior] and twice after mating [on gestation days 1 and 13]). Anti-RSV antibodies were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on lactation day 21, as well as in foetuses and offspring, and maternal milk. There were no vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, pregnancy, embryo foetal or offspring development or postnatal development.

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## mRESVIA dispersion for injection Respiratory Syncytial Virus mRNA vaccine

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

4. Possible side effects
5. How to store mRESVIA
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What mRESVIA is and what it is used for

mRESVIA is a vaccine that helps to protect adults aged 60 years and older against a virus called 'respiratory syncytial virus' (RSV).

mRESVIA also helps to protect against RSV in adults 18 through 59 years of age at increased risk for RSV disease.

RSV is a common virus that spreads very easily and causes respiratory tract disease in people of all ages. RSV infection can be mild, with cold-like symptoms including blocked nose, cough and/or sore throat. However, the virus can also cause more serious problems, such as lung infections and pneumonia. Older adults are at risk of more serious complications that can lead to hospital admission or even death.

mRESVIA activates the immune system (the body's natural defences) to protect against lung diseases caused by the RSV. The vaccine contains a substance called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) that contains instructions that the body can use to make the same protein present on the RSV. When the immune system encounters this protein, it makes antibodies (substances in the blood that recognise and fight infections) against it. If a person comes into contact with the RSV, the immune system will recognise and attack the virus to help protect you against lung diseases caused by it.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive mRESVIA

## Do not use mRESVIA

- -if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given mRESVIA if:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -you have ever had a severe allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection in the past.
- -you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily.
- -you have a weakened immune system which may prevent you from getting the full benefit from mRESVIA.
- -you are feeling nervous about getting the vaccine or have ever fainted after any injection.
- -you have an infection with a high fever. If this is the case, then vaccination will be postponed. There is no need to delay vaccination for a minor infection, such as a cold, but talk to your doctor first.

As with all vaccines, mRESVIA may not fully protect all people who are vaccinated.

## Children and adolescents

mRESVIA is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years.

## Other medicines and mRESVIA

Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

mRESVIA can be given at the same time as a flu vaccine or a COVID-19 vaccine.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before you are given this vaccine. The vaccine should not be used in women who are pregnant.

## Driving and using machines

Some of the effects mentioned below in section 4 'Possible side effects' like feeling tired and dizziness may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. If you experience such side effects, wait until they have worn off before you drive or use machines.

## mRESVIA contains sodium

This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How and when mRESVIA is given

mRESVIA is given by a doctor, pharmacist or nurse, usually as a single injection in the muscle of the upper arm (deltoid muscle).

The recommended dose is 0.5 mL.
