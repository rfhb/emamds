## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Introduction

Nexavar contains sorafenib, an antineoplastic agent that acts as protein kinase inhibitor (ATC code: L01XE05).  Sorafenib  inhibits  tumour  cell  proliferation  and  the  tumour  vascularisation  through activating the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) signalling RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade pathway.

Nexavar is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who have failed prior interferon-alpha or interleukin-2 based therapy or are considered unsuitable for such therapy. The recommended dosage is 400 mg bid given orally as 2x 200 mg tablets.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has now applied for an extension of indication to include treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been amended accordingly. The proposed dosage for the new indication is the same as that previously approved for renal cell carcinoma, i.e. 400 mg (two tablets) twice daily.

## Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

It has been estimated that world wide about 560 000 new cases of hepatocellular cancer are diagnosed per year, but in Europe HCC is an orphan disease most commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis. In the western world, an increase is foreseen due to the increased incidence of chronic hepatitis C. Other aetiologies include chronic hepatitis B and alcohol.

(Thomas et al, JCO 2005)

Potentially curative therapies include resection, transplantation and percutaneous ablation. In patients for whom surgery or ablation is not an option, TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) has been used in some centers. In general, it is assumed that the best candidates for TACE are those who still have well-preserved liver function (normal or Child-Pugh class A) and multinodular, asymptomatic tumors without vascular invasion. These patients constitute less than 15% of the HCC population. However, TACE is not used uniformly as a therapeutic option worldwide.

There are currently no medicinal products licensed in the EU for the treatment of HCC, but, e.g., doxorubicin alone or in combinations has some use in clinical practice. Recently (Robert Gish et al, JCO July 2007) a randomised study comparing the experimental compound nolatrexed with doxorubicin showed a survival benefit for doxorubicin. The results of this study will be discussed in relation to the outcome of the sorafenib study as appropriate (see below).

## Non-clinical aspects

## Study MRC-01324

Preclinical data submitted in support of this variation consists of a primary pharmacodynamic study 'Sorafenib blocks the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, inhibits tumour angiogenesis and induces tumor cell apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma model PLC/PRF/5'  (Study MRC-0134) and a series of literature references.

Sorafenib blocks the enzyme RAF kinase and inhibits the VEGF-2/PDGFR-beta signalling cascade. Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor with activity against pathways of cell growth and angiogenesis, including serine/threonine kinases c-Raf and B-raf and the receptor tyrosine kinase RET, Flt-3 and cKit.

The new pharmacology data for sorafenib includes a description of the activity of sorafenib on the proliferation of human hepatocellular tumour cells and the tumour growth inhibitory effects of the compound when administered to immunodeficient mice bearing human models of hepatocellular carcinomas grown as xenografts.

HCC is characterized by the activation of intracellular signalling pathways, namely the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (MAPK pathway), and is a highly angiogenic tumour. The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can be activated by a number of mechanisms including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the receptor for hepatocytes growth factor. In addition, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein NS5A has been shown to interact and activate Raf kinase, in a process crucial for viral replication, which leads to the activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and increased viral replication. This activation of Raf by NS5A can be inhibited by sorafenib. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), one of the most potent growth factor for endothelial cells, is found overexpressed in HCC. In addition, the receptor for VEGF, VEGFR2, has been found inappropriately expressed on HCC tumour cells, opening up the possibility for an autocrine VEGF/VEGFR2 loop supporting tumour cell growth.

In two models of human hepatocellular carcinoma, sorafenib inhibited tumour cell growth in vitro and this inhibition was associated with the down regulation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Sorafenib inhibited the proliferation of human HCC cell lines PLC/PRF/5 (p53-mutant) and HepG2 (p53-wildtype) in vitro with IC50 values of 6.3 and 4.5 µM, respectively (it is noted that likely an erroneous value for IC50 has been included in the pharmacology written summary; 1.6 instead of 4.5 µM). This inhibition correlated with the inhibition of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway as measured by the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK (pMEK and pERK). Phosphorylation levels of AKT were not affected. The reduction in MEK and ERK phosphorylation led to a reduction in the proliferation marker cyclin D1 in both cell lines, consistent with the anti-proliferative activity of the compound. Further the anti-apoptotic protein Mc1-1 was reduced by sorafenib in both cell lines.

When tested in vivo against PLC/PRF/5 tumour grown as tumour xenograft in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, sorafenib  inhibited its growth, with partial tumour regressions seen at the highest dose used. A dose of 10 mg/kg once a day inhibited tumour growth by 49% and complete tumour stasis was seen at a dose of 30 mg/kg. In further studies using PLC/PRF/5 xenograft tumours, analysis revealed a decrease in Raf/MEK/ERK signalling (pERK) and a reduction in tumour vasculature (TUNEL staining) supporting the dual mechanism of action of sorafenib; that of targeting both tumour cell signalling and tumour angiogenesis. The reduction if Raf/MEK/ERK signalling and tumor vasculature was accompanied by an increase in tumour cell apoptosis and inhibition of tumour growth.

## Discussion on Non-clinical aspects

Sorafenib was shown to exhibit antitumour activity with effects on both tumour cell signalling (Raf/MEK/ERK pathway) and angiogenesis and induced tumour cell apoptosis. Sorafenib seemed to inhibit MEK/ERK dependent and independent signalling. The non-clinical data are consistent with the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

fact that sorafenib activity in HCC is coupled to inhibition of RAF/MEK/ERK signalling, induction of MEK/ERK independent pro-apoptopic effects and inhibition of angiogenesis. While comparisons on a mg/kg dose basis are uncertain, the non-clinical data in vitro and in vivo support a role of sorafenib at clinically relevant doses in the treatment of HCC.

## Clinical aspects

## Clinical pharmacology

Two new pharmacokinetic studies have been submitted in the present application; one phase I study in Japanese patients with HCC (Study 10875) and one population pharmacokinetic analysis on pharmacokinetic data from different studies, including the phase III study in HCC (see below). For reference, the MAH also discusses the previously submitted phase II study in patients with HCC and mild-moderate hepatic impairment (Study 10874).

## Study 10874 (submitted with original Marketing Authorisation Application)

Study 10874 was conducted to evaluate the anti-cancer activity, safety, pharmacokinetics and tolerability of sorafenib at the 400 mg BID dose in patients with advanced inoperable HCC.  Patients in this study had a baseline hepatic function status of either Child-Pugh A (n=15) or Child-Pugh B (n=6).  Plasma samples were collected at steady state over the 12-hour dosing interval, at 28 days after the start of dosing.

Unfortunately, concentration data up to 12 hours were available only in 6 subjects, and therefore AUC(0-8),ss at 400 mg BID rather than AUC(0-12),ss was presented.

## Sorafenib plasma pharmacokinetic parameters (presented as geometric mean, %CV except for tmax which is presented as median, range) in hepatically impaired cancer patients dosed 400 mg BID

| Child Pugh Status   |                                   | AUC (0-8,ss) (mg*h/L)   | C max,ss (mg/L)   | t max,ss (h)   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Child Pugh A        | N=15 Geometric mean (Approx. CV%) | 25.4 (38.4%)            | 4.92 (38.7%)      | 1.0 (0-12)     |
| Child Pugh B        | N=6 Geometric mean (Approx. CV%)  | 30.3 (82.1%)            | 5.97 (73.8%)      | 0.5 (0-8)      |

It was suggested that the AUC values observed in this study were within the range of AUC observed in previous phase I studies in patients without hepatic impairment, and that the increased AUC in Child Pugh B patients was not clinically relevant. There was no correlation between AUC and toxicity and no obvious difference in tolerability between the two groups in this study.

The pharmacokinetics of the metabolites is shown in table below.

M5 AUC(0-8,ss) and Cmax,ss values appear to be slightly lower in Child-Pugh B patients compared to Child-Pugh A patients.  However, these parameters have overlapping ranges in the two populations. The AUC(0-8,ss) and Cmax,ss values of M2 and M4 metabolites are similar in Child-Pugh A and B patients.

During the assessment of the original application for renal carcinoma, dose adjustments or special caution were not considered necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The SPC, however, includes a warning that exposure might be increased in severe hepatic impairment, and that no data for the latter group is available.

## Study 10875 (new)

This was a Phase I study to describe the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 200 mg BID and 400 mg BID sorafenib in Japanese HCC patients.  Twelve patients were evaluable in the 200 mg group (6 Child-Pugh A and 6 Child-Pugh B) and 11-14 patients were evaluable in the 400 mg group (6 Child-Pugh A and 5-8 Child-Pugh B).  Eight of the Child Pugh A subjects and all of the Child Pugh B subjects were positive for hepatitis C antigen. Three Child Pugh A subjects and one Child Pugh B subject tested positive for hepatitis B.

Patients received a single dose of either 200 or 400 mg sorafenib followed by a 7 day washout period, so that the single dose pharmacokinetics could be properly evaluated.  After the washout period, the twice-daily dosing regimen was begun, and additional pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed on Days 14 and 28 of multiple dosing.  The pharmacokinetic results for sorafenib are shown in Table 3. At both doses there was no discernible difference in sorafenib pharmacokinetics between the ChildPugh A and Child-Pugh B patients.  The mean AUC and Cmax tended to be lower in the Child-Pugh B patients, but this was suggested to be a consequence of the pharmacokinetic variability in both groups. Mean half-life ranged from 22 to 30 hours, which is similar to that reported for healthy volunteers. The steady-state AUC(0-12) values were generally consistent with the single dose AUC values, though the Day 14 and Day 28 AUC(0-12) values in Child-Pugh A patients on 400 mg BID were slightly greater than Day 1 AUCs.  The exposures seen with the 400 mg BID dose regimen did not show a doseproportional increase relative to the 200 mg BID regimen, also suggested possibly due to the pharmacokinetic variability of sorafenib and relatively small number of patients.

The pharmacokinetics of metabolites after 28 days of 400 mg BID dosing are shown in the table below. The results were similar for the 200 mg BID dose and on day 14, and are not presented here.

Also for the metabolites, there were no discernible differences between the Child Pugh A and the Child Pugh B group, suggesting no difference in metabolism based on Child-Pugh status.

## Population pharmacokinetic analysis (Study 12785)

Plasma sorafenib concentration data from the Phase III HCC Study 100554 (n=164) and Phase II Study 10874 (n=20) along with multiple dose pharmacokinetic data from 7 single agent Phase I studies and single dose pharmacokinetic data from 3 healthy volunteer studies, were analysed by population pharmacokinetic methods. The population pharmacokinetic model was developed based on data from twelve studies (100283, 10164, 100277, 100342, 100483, 100545, 10658, 11497, 10874, 10875, and 100554 including 479 subjects (410 cancer patients and 69 healthy subjects) with in total 6446 plasma concentration observations. Population analysis was performed with NONMEM software version V, using first order conditional estimation method with interaction.

The chosen structural model was a two compartment model with first order absorption and a lag time. Bioavailability was modelled as dose dependent and a stepwise model was considered most adequate based on objective function value.  Exponential error models were used to describe interindividual variance and a proportional residual error model. Covariates were tested in a forward inclusion process using inclusion criteria of p&lt;0.001 corresponding to a difference in OFV of 10.83 for 1 additional parameter (1 degree of freedom).

The influence of age, body weight, gender, ethnicity (Japanese versus non-Japanese), baseline SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, creatinine clearance (estimated from serum creatinine) and disease (cancer patients versus healthy subjects) on sorafenib clearance was evaluated. The effect of age, body weight, gender and ethnicity (Japanese versus non-Japanese) on the central and peripheral volumes of distribution was evaluated. The effect of total protein and disease (cancer patients versus healthy subjects) on central volume of distribution was also evaluated. The effect of ethnicity (Japanese versus non-Japanese) on absorption rate constant and bioavailability was evaluated. In the first step of the stepwise forward inclusion procedure, inclusion of ethnicity (Japanese versus non-Japanese) as a covariate for absorption rate constant resulted in a maximum decrease (24.359 points) in the value of objective function. In the second step, inclusion of SGOT (AST) as a covariate for clearance resulted in a maximum decrease (11.305 points) in the value of objective function and in the third step, inclusion of bilirubin as a covariate for clearance resulted in a maximum decrease (11.701 points) in the value of objective function. No additional covariates were identified in the fourth and final step of the covariate model building procedure. The final model together with confidence intervals obtained with nonparametric bootstrap is presented in Table 5.

The model included a relation to SGOT which suggested that a SGOT value &gt; normal would result in higher clearance although not physiologically plausible. The MAH concludes that the covariate relations are not clinically relevant.

## Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology

Sorafenib is eliminated via metabolism (mainly CYP3A4 and glucuronidation) and likely also to some extent by biliary excretion. Unchanged sorafenib recovered in faeces has been suggested to represent not only unabsorbed drug but also biliary excreted drug, either as parent compound or as glucuronide, which has then been cleaved to sorafenib in the gut. Metabolic hepatic impairment and possibly cholestasis might therefore be expected to affect the elimination of sorafenib.

None of the two studies in hepatically impaired patients included a control group without hepatic impairment so a direct comparison could not be made, although the AUC values observed in the studies appear to be within the range observed for healthy subjects in phase I studies. The degree of metabolic impairment vs. e.g. degree of cholestatis was not discussed for these patients and the results from HCC patients cannot readily be extrapolated to cirrhosis patients.

A new study in hepatically impaired Japanese subjects confirmed the results from a previous study in non-Japanese subjects. Based on these data, the increase in sorafenib exposure in patients with moderate hepatic impairment is marginal compared with patients with mild hepatic impairment and does not warrant dose adjustments. Unfortunately, there is no pharmacokinetic data in severe hepatic impairment, which is considered a deficiency, as also safety data from this group is lacking. The possibility to make a specific recommendation for patients with HCC and severe hepatic impairment, perhaps specifically in patients with metabolic impairment or cholestasis, would be valuable.

The MAH has made a post-authorisation commitment to discuss the possibility to obtain data on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib in patients with severe hepatic impairment and make adequate recommendations for this group.

The submitted population pharmacokinetic analysis is not considered informative. Several problems with the model has been identified, that must be resolved if the model is going to be used in further PK/PD modelling or for simulation purposes. However, for approval of the new indication, a reanalysis is not required. Even if re-analysed, the population pharmacokinetic data is not expected to add useful information from a pharmacokinetic perspective to that already obtained in the two pharmacokinetic studies, since no data from subjects with severe renal impairment are available.

## Clinical efficacy

## Main studies

The efficacy of sorafenib in HCC patients is primarily based on the Phase III, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial (Study 100554), and also supported by Study 10874 (a single arm, large Phase II study in HCC).

## Study 100554 (pivotal)

This was a Phase III randomized, placebo-controlled study of sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Period of study: 10 Mar 2005 to 17 Oct 2006.

## Objectives:

Primary:

Overall survival (OS) and time to symptomatic progression (TTSP).

Secondary:

Time to tumour progression (TTP) Overall disease control rate

Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep) response rate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

| Tertiary:   | Overall response rate, overall response duration, and time to objective response. FACT-Hep Physical Well-being (PWB) and Functional Well-being (FWB) subscale response rates.   |

## Treatment:

Sorafenib (or matching placebo) was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg (2 x 200 mg tablets) twice daily; 2 dose reductions to predefined levels of 400 mg once daily (OD) and 400 mg every other day were permitted for adverse events related to study treatment. Study treatment was administered orally on a continuous schedule, but for the purpose of data recording, the treatment period was divided into 6-week cycles. Study drug could be taken either with a low/moderate fat meal or without food. After a dose, patients did not have to wait before eating.

Treatment was continued until death or until a criterion for stopping therapy was met. Treatment beyond radiological and symptomatic progression was allowed upon request of the treating investigator.

Subjects assigned to the placebo arm were not crossed over to the sorafenib arm at any time during the study before the OS endpoint was met.

## Key inclusion criteria:

- Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks
- Advanced HCC (subjects not eligible for surgical or loco-regional treatments)
- Histologically or cytologically documented HCC
- At least one tumour lesion that met both of the following criteria:
- -Measurable according to RECIST (response evaluation criteria in solid tumours)
- -Not previously treated with local therapy (such as surgery, radiation therapy, hepatic arterial  therapy, chemo-embolization, radiofrequency ablation, etc.)
- Local therapy completed at least 4 weeks prior to the baseline scan.
- ECOG PS (eastern cooperative oncology group performance status) of 0, 1, or 2
- Child-Pugh class A liver function status only.

## Key exclusion criteria:

- Cardiac
- -Congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA (New York Heart Association) class 2;
- -Active coronary artery disease (CAD);
- -Cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy other than beta blockers or digoxin;
- -uncontrolled hypertension.
- -Myocardial infarction more than 6 months prior to study entry was permitted.
- CNS tumours including metastatic brain disease
- Subjects with clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 30 days prior to study entry

## Statistical Planning (SAP dated December 2006)

All randomized patients (Intent to Treat Population) will be included in the primary analyses. Onesided alpha of 0.02 and 0.005 will be used for OS and TTSP analyses, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Randomization will be stratified by geographical region [North America versus South America (including Mexico) versus Europe (including Australia/New Zealand)], ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2) and tumour burden (presence of either macroscopic vascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread vs none).

It was expected that there will be a small number of patients with ECOG PS 2. Patients with ECOG PS 1 and 2 will be combined together for statistical analyses. The following efficacy analyses were to be performed according to the above stratification with ECOG PS 1 and 2 combined (i.e. Geographic region, ECOG 0 vs 1 and 2, and tumour burden).

The first interim analysis of OS was planned when approximately170 deaths were observed. The second interim analysis of OS was planned when approximately 300 deaths were observed. For OS interim analyses, an O'Brien-Fleming-type error spending function will determine the criteria for early stopping for efficacy so that the overall false positive rate (alpha) is less than or equal to 0.02 (onesided).

The scenario in the table below serves as an example. The actual boundaries used for analyses will be calculated according to the actual number of events (deaths) for a given analysis.

Sensitivity analyses will be carried out for Overall Survival and TTSP as follows:

1. Stratified log-rank using stratification from IVRS
2. Non-stratified log-rank
3. Non-stratified log-rank adjusting for covariates of region, ECOG, and tumour burden from CRF (Cox regression)

Baseline variables that were significant in a model including treatment and the single covariate were included in a multivariate stepwise regression procedure. In this stepwise Cox regression the following conditions were associated with decreased survival regardless of treatment:

- Baseline ECOG greater than 0
- Macroscopic vascular invasion
- Presence of macroscopic vascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Child-Pugh status of B or C
- Higher than median baseline AFP
- Lower than median baseline albumin
- Higher than median baseline alkaline phosphatase
- Higher than median baseline total bilirubin.

## - Second primary endpoint

Symptomatic progression was defined as a decrease of at least 4 points from baseline score based on subject responses to the FHSI-8 questionnaire with a confirmatory decline at the next actual visit, deterioration to an ECOG PS of 4, or death.

The disease control rate (DCR), (defined as at least SD for at least 28 days), was 31.7% (96 subjects) in the placebo group, compared with 43.5% (130 subjects) in the sorafenib group.

DCR rates are markedly affected by the availability of 'follow-up' scans since the rate calculation requires non-progressing patients to have at least 2 follow-up scans after the baseline scan to contribute to disease control rates. If patients that did not have the opportunity to have two scans are excluded, the DCR rate is 54% (129/240) for the sorafenib group and 39% (95/242) for the placebo group.

## Study 10874 (supportive)

Study 10874, a single-arm, uncontrolled international Phase II trial, enrolled patients with 'advanced', measurable HCC who had not received prior systemic (excluding hormonal) therapy for HCC. Patients with rare subtypes of HCC (fibrolamellar variant, mixed cholangio-hepatocellular carcinoma) were excluded.  Prior surgical and loco-regional therapy was permitted.  Inclusion criteria permitted enrollment of patients with either Child-Pugh class A or Child-Pugh class B liver function status.  The term 'advanced' was not defined in the protocol, but was understood to mean those not suitable for potentially curative therapy (i.e., 'inoperable'), and was not defined according to criteria for any specific staging system.

Study 10874 enrolled 98 patients with Child-Pugh status A and 38 patients with Child-Pugh status B (One patient had data missing for Child-Pugh scoring).  No patients with Child-Pugh C were enrolled in Study 10874.

The primary endpoint was objective tumour response rate. Of 137 treated subjects from investigator assessment, 8 subjects achieved partial response (PR) and 6 achieved minor response (MR); 72 subjects had stable disease and 32 subjects had PD as their best response.

As per investigator assessment, median TTP was 18.4 weeks, and median OS was 39.4 weeks. These results were considered encouraging in comparison to historical data: the median survival of untreated patients with non-resectable HCC is cited in the literature to be less than 6 months.

Outcomes of subjects with Child-Pugh A status at baseline were seemingly better (in terms of tumour response, TTP, and OS) compared to subjects with Child-Pugh B status at baseline.

A secondary objective was to evaluate phosphorylated extracellular-signal-related kinase (pERK) in pre-treatment tumour biopsies and to explore its relationship to measures of clinical benefit.

Thirty-three (24%) treated subjects had both pERK data and clinical anti-tumour activity data. There appeared to be a statistically significant correlation between pERK levels (measured as maximum staining intensity) within the tumour and TTP.

As a result, tumours that contain higher levels of pERK may be more sensitive to the raf kinase inhibitory activity of sorafenib than those tumours that have lower levels of pERK and which may be driven by other signalling pathways.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pERK expression was comparable in subjects with Child-Pugh class A and B across different degrees of staining intensity and a retrospective analysis of the magnitude of change in the size of target lesions by Child-Pugh cirrhotic status, demonstrated similar patterns of tumour response.

## Discussion on Clinical efficacy

## Study 100554

The use of placebo as comparator was accepted in a CHMP scientific advice procedure in 2004 due to the absence of reference products with at that time documented favourable benefit/risk in the target population for this study. Similarly, the exclusion of patients with liver impairment &gt; Child-Pugh A was accepted due to seemingly less favourable results in Child-Pugh B patients in an exploratory, single arm study.

Note that there are two alternative primary endpoints (i.e. efficacy established if either positive), overall survival and time to symptomatic progression (TTSP). The latter was introduced based on recommendations from FDA. Both measures are in principle acceptable from an EU perspective, but at the time of the CHMP advice, only survival was discussed (and endorsed).

From a statistical perspective, the analysis plan is acceptable, but at least the first interim analysis is conducted on too immature data.

## Base line characteristics

White, European males dominated the trial and the proportion of women is smaller than expected. The percentage of patients with hepatitis B/C as the only likely etiological factor was about 45% and data are therefore considered to be reasonably informative for EU, given the variability in chronic hepatitis comparing north and south. Only few individuals with PS status 2 were included, but the percentage of patients above 65 years of age was around 60%.

The BCLC (Barcelona-clinic liver cancer) staging classification (1999) comprises four stages. Early stage (A) includes patients with asymptomatic early tumours suitable for radical therapies with curative intent. Intermediate stage (B) comprises patients with asymptomatic multinodular HCC. Advanced stage (C) includes patients with symptomatic tumours and/or an invasive tumoural pattern (vascular invasion/extrahepatic spread). End-stage disease (D) contains patients with extremely grim prognosis that should merely receive symptomatic treatment. This study enrolled mainly stage C patients (about 80%).

In comparison with the nolatrexed vs. doxorubicin study, it is noticed that in the latter study about 25% of the patients had a Child Pugh score of B and about 14% had a Karnofsky PS of ≤ 70. A qualified comparison is not considered possible, but it appears as if the overall prognosis is poorer in this study compared with the sorafenib study.

## Efficacy results - primary endpoints

A significant difference in the median duration of overall survival has been demonstrated, in favor of the Sorafenib arm (10.6 months for the Sorafenib arm versus 7.9 months for the placebo arm). This difference is derived from a planned interim analysis, with a reasonable number of events and the analysis is performed on the ITT population. The median duration of survival for patients in the placebo comparator arm is acceptable when compared to the historical series of advanced HCC (5 months).

Therefore, a favourable effect on overall survival has convincingly been demonstrated, even though the number of events after the median appears too low to obtain a precise estimate of the treatment effect in patients with a less unfavourable prognosis. Due to the magnitude of the treatment effect, this constitutes no concern from a regulatory perspective. Nevertheless it is proposed that the applicant should submit the most mature data set possible not being too confounded by cross-over. The MAH has made a commitment in this regard.

The nolatrexed trial was analysed when survival data were mature (about 80% event rate). Median survival in the doxorubicin arm was 32 weeks and the hazard ratio was 0.75, p=0.0068 in favour of doxorubicin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With respect to exploratory subgroup analyses encompassing a reasonable number of patients, the treatment effect appears stable, possible exceptions being patients with metastatic disease at baseline (HR: 0.90, n=294) and patients below 65 years of age (HR: 0.92, n=232).

With respect to age, no imbalances as regards prognostic factors (see above) were identified comparing patients below and above the age of 65.

## Efficacy results - secondary endpoints

No favourable effects were documented in terms of time to symptomatic progression. The MAH's interpretation is that the questionnaire might capture drug related adverse reactions as well as disease related events and that this confounds the assessment. This might be the case and it is not considered meaningful to try to further investigate to what extent other sources of possible bias such as informative censoring (e.g. 'objective' tumour progression prior to symptomatic progression) contributed to this lack of demonstrated effects.

With respect to events of progression, the investigator assessment with a cut-off of 17 October is considered mature and the results are reasonably consistent with the independent review results of May 2006 and overall survival results. Results in relation to subgroups in analogy with survival data were not reported.

In the nolatrexed vs. doxorubicin trial, no difference in PFS was observed (HR 0.96) and median PFS was about 11 weeks.

Also in patients with HCC, sorafenib is mainly a cytostatic compound. It is notable that response rates in the nolatrexed vs. doxorubicin trial (conventionally viewed as 'cytotoxic' compounds) also were very low, 1 and 3%, respectively.

## Results Supportive trial

Due to the very low objective response rate, it is hard to draw any conclusions as regards covariates of importance for sorafenib activity. TTP (and OS) data may be used in historical comparisons, but without a randomised control, covariates of importance for prognosis cannot be disentangled from those predictive for sorafenib activity.

## Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

As of May, 2007, over 10,000 patients have been treated with sorafenib (as a single agent and in combination with commonly used chemotherapy agents) in clinical trials.

In Study 100554, 599 patients received at least one dose of study medication, at 400 mg bid. The mean duration of treatment for the placebo group was 22.6 weeks (158 days) and 25.3 weeks (177 days) for the sorafenib patients.

In Study 10874, the median duration of treatment was 21.3 weeks and 30% of HCC patients received more than 24 weeks of study treatment.

This report will focus mainly on the pivotal HCC study 100554.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

## Deaths

In Study 100554, there were 165 patient deaths within 30 days of receiving study medication, 97 (32%) in the placebo arm and 68 (23%) in the sorafenib-treated arm. The cause of death was reported as HCC progression in 68 placebo patients and 55 sorafenib treated patients.

In the sorafenib patients 13 deaths were not attributed to disease progression including: bleeding oesophageal varices (4 patients), haemorrhage into the abdominal cavity (1 patient) and one patient each with liver dysfunction, anorexia, right ventricular failure, visceral arterial ischemia, depression (leading to suicide), renal failure, myocardial infarction and unknown.

Drug-related deaths were reported in 6 (2%) of the placebo patients and 4 (1.3%) of the sorafenibtreated patients and the causes of deaths in the sorafenib-treated group were: bleeding oesophageal varices (1), haemorrhage into abdominal cavity (1), visceral arterial ischemia (1) and renal failure of pre-renal origin (1) following dehydration.

## Serious adverse events

In addition to SAE:s mentioned above, more ( ≥ 0.5%) cases in the sorafenib arm were reported for myocardial infarction (1.3%, listed), anaemia (2.4%, listed), hepatic failure (3%, not listed, to be discussed later) and anorexia (1%, listed). More cases in the placebo arm were reported for fatigue (2.6%), physical deterioration (1.7%). No additional signals were identified among SAEs reported as related.

## Discontinuation/Interruption from Study due to Adverse Events

The rate of discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events was similar in the two treatment arms (35.4% for placebo and 31.6% for sorafenib patients). There were no age or gender-related differences in the rate of premature termination due to adverse events.

Study drug was temporarily interrupted in 101 (33.3%) placebo patients and in 154 (51.5%) sorafenib patients.

The most frequent adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study drug in the sorafenib group were fatigue and liver dysfunction/failure in 14 (4.7%) patients each.

In the placebo group the most frequent causes for permanent discontinuation were hepatobiliary events in 13 (4.3%) and constitutional symptoms in 9 (3.0%) patients.

## Hypertension/Cardiovascular Events

First appearance of diastolic blood pressure increases over 100 mm generally occurred within the first 3 cycles for both treatment groups. The majority of the first onset of systolic blood pressure increases over 160 mmHg occurred within the first 3 cycles in both treatment groups.

## Summary of incidence of increased blood pressure from baseline

|                 | Placebo (N=302) n (%)   | Sorafenib (N=297) n (%)   |
|-----------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| DBP >= 100mmHg  | 22 (7.7%)               | 47 (16.7%)                |
| DBP >= 110 mmHg | 4 (1.4%)                | 15 (5.2%)                 |
| SBP >= 160 mmHg | 46 (17.2%)              | 63 (24.4%)                |
| SBP >= 180 mmHg | 8 (2.8%)                | 22 (7.7%)                 |

Abbreviations: DBP - diastolic blood pressure, SBP - systolic blood pressure. mmHg-mimeters of mercury.

Hypertension led to permanent discontinuation of study drug in one sorafenib patient vs. two on placebo.

Six placebo patients reported CNS ischemic events (3 Grade 3, 2 Grade 4, and 1 Grade 5). None of the sorafenib patients suffered any CNS ischemic event.

Cardiac ischemia/infarction was reported as an adverse event in 4 patients in the placebo group and 8 patients in the sorafenib group. All of these events were reported as serious adverse events; most were Grade 3 or 4 events: 3 placebo patients and 6 in the sorafenib group. Of the events occurring in the sorafenib group, one Grade 3 event and one Grade 4 event were assessed as drug-related. In 3 sorafenib patients, myocardial ischemic events were the reason for permanent discontinuation of study treatment. (Myocardial ischemia and infarction are listed.)

## Hepatobiliary Events

Overall 34 liver dysfunction/failure adverse events were reported in sorafenib patients, thereof 21 as serious adverse events and 1 was assessed as related to study drug.

None of the 23 liver dysfunction/failure adverse events, of which 14 were reported as serious adverse events, in the placebo group were deemed drug-related. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 liver dysfunction adverse events was similar between groups, reported in 9 placebo patients and 10 sorafenib patients.

Liver dysfunction led to permanent discontinuation of treatment in 14 sorafenib patients and 5 placebo patients, and to dose reductions in 3 (1.0%) sorafenib patients and 1 (0.3%) placebo patient.

## Study 10874

In Study 10874, almost all treated patients (97%) had one or more adverse events during the study and 85% had drug-related adverse events.  At least one serious adverse event was recorded in 77 (56%) patients and 18 (13%) had drug-related serious adverse events.  Twenty-eight patients (20%) discontinued study treatment due to adverse events.  These results were consistent with those seen in Study 100554.

In Study 10874, there were 93 (68%) deaths within 30 days of receiving study medication.  Most patients died as a result of progressive disease; no death was reported by the investigator as related to study drug.

## Adverse Effects by Population Subgroups

Women had a reported higher incidence of pain (28.2% versus 8.5%), alopecia (38.5% vs. 10.5%) and hand-foot skin reaction (33.3% vs. 19.4%).

The baseline AST and ALT were used to assess for hepatic impairment.  Patients with a baseline AST and ALT of &lt;1.8X the upper limit of normal (ULN) were considered to have normal hepatic function. Those with an AST or ALT greater than 3X ULN were considered to have moderate hepatic impairment.  For the selected adverse events, no major differences between hepatic impairment groups were noted for diarrhea, anorexia, hand-foot skin reaction, alopecia or abdominal pain (NOS) In Study 100554, a higher percentage of Child-Pugh A patients compared to the Child-Pugh B patients had diarrhea (56% vs. 42.9%, respectively), anorexia (29.1% vs. 21.4%, respectively) and hand-foot skin reaction (22.0% vs. 7.1%, respectively).  A higher percentage of Child-Pugh B patients compared to the Child-Pugh A patients had voice changes (21.4% vs. 8.5%, respectively) and hypertension (14.3% vs. 9.2%, respectively).

As regards hand-foot skin reactions it is noticed that 0/33 treated for 6 weeks or less reported this reaction and 8/56 of those treated 6 - 12 weeks while those treated for a longer period of time reported this reaction about twice as frequently per treatment cycle (6 w). This probably partly reflects delayed

lly, this . tudy compared with the sorafenib study probably reflects differences baseline characteristics. In a doxorubicin comparative study designed to demonstrate the superiority of the experimental agent nolatrexed, however, doxorubicin therapy was shown to provide a survival benefit. Theoretica could be due to nolatrexed being worse than placebo, especially as no difference in PFS was demonstrated. Nolatrexed, however, belongs to a well known class of cytotoxic compounds (thymidylate synthase inhibitor) and the adverse event profile appears as expected and seemingly not worse than doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 every three weeks. Thus the most likely explanation to the observed difference is that doxorubicin therapy also provides a survival benefit to patients with advanced HCC Between studies comparisons should be undertaken with care, but the apparently shorter survival in the doxorubicin vs. nolatrexed s in ents Sorafenib shows high inter- and intra-patient pharmacokinetic variability in exposure with coeffici of variation around 65% and 45%, respectively.
