No literature review on the efficacy/effectiveness has been submitted by the MAH within this application. Since the clinical efficacy of clopidogrel in the approved indications is well established and evidence of clinical efficacy has been discussed at time of approval the CHMP finds acceptable the MAH approach of not performing a literature review on the efficacy/effectiveness of clopidogrel. The beneficial effect of Zyllt remains in line with that of the originator product (Plavix), and is considered positive.
