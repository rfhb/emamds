## 1. Introduction

On 1 December 2014, the MAH submitted one completed paediatric study (VX10-770-107) for Kalydeco (Ivacaftor), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Kalydeco and that no consequential regulatory action is required.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study VX10-770-107 is a stand-alone study. No line listing is provided, since the study is not specifically part of a development program.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies

The  pharmaceutical  formulation  used  in  this  study  was  ivacaftor  150-mg  film  coated  tablets, essentially the same as the currently approved formulation. Ivacaftor 150-mg tablets were used for the  adolescent  subjects  recruited  in  the  study;  hence  no  specific  paediatric  formulation  was required for this study.

Ivacaftor  150-mg tablets were  administered  under similar  conditions  as  the  approved  SmPC  for Kalydeco:

- -Orally at a dosage of 150 mg q12h
- -Recommended to take study drug 30 minutes after the start of a standard 'CF' high fat, high calorie meal or snack.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Kalydeco  (ivacaftor)  was  first  authorised  23  July  2012  via  the  centralised  procedure  in  the European Union. Kalydeco is currently indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have one of the following gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R.

The MAH submitted final reports for:

- Study VX10-770-107, A Phase 2, Single-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Effect of VX-770 (ivacaftor) on Hyperpolarized Helium-3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Subjects with Cystic Fibrosis, the G551D Mutation, and FEV1 ≥ 40% Predicted.

## 2.3.2. Clinical studies

## Study VX10-770-107

## Description

The purpose of this exploratory study was to evaluate the effects of ivacaftor on hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging (3He-MRI), with the view to determine if the latter could be a potential biomarker of lung function in CF trials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## · Objective(s) Primary Objective

The primary objectives of the study were to assess the short-term (28 days, part A) and long-term (48  weeks,  part  B)  effects  of  ivacaftor  on  hyperpolarized  helium-3  magnetic  resonance  imaging (He-MRI),  with  the  aim  to  explore  the  possibility  of  using  this  imaging  technique  as  a  potential biomarker of lung function in CF studies.

## Secondary Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-770 in subjects aged 12 years and older with CF who have the G551D-CFTR mutation on at least 1 allele.

## Exploratory Objective

To evaluate 3He-MRI 'Ventilation Segmentation' automated quantification method.

## · Study design

Part A: a Phase 2, single-blind, placebo-controlled study of orally administered VX-770 in subjects with CF. The study included a Screening Visit, 4 weeks of VX-770 treatment, 4 weeks of placebo treatment, and a follow-up telephone call.

Part B: a Phase 2, open-label, 48-week study of orally administered VX-770 in subjects with CF. The study included a Screening Visit, 48 weeks of VX-770 treatment, and a Follow-up Visit.

## · Study population /Sample size

Male and female subjects with CF who were ages 12 years and older with G551D-CFTR mutation on at least 1 allele and≥40% predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) value.

The number of subjects planned in part A was 2 to 8 subjects; a maximum of 12 subjects were planned to be enrolled in part B.  The chosen sample sizes were based primarily on operational considerations. Thus, no power analysis was performed.

## · Treatments

VX-770 -matched placebo tablet was administered orally q12h (recommended to take study drug 30 minutes after the start of a standard 'CF' high fat, high calorie meal or snack).

Blue, film-coated tablet with wax.

Subjects were not allowed to take Grapefruit/grapefruit juice, Seville orange/marmalade, CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, Inhaled hypertonic saline treatment or commercially Kalydeco™. Subjects were  allowed  to  continue  their  prior  inhaled  antibiotics  and  bronchodilators  during  the  study periods.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

In  Part  A,  the  primary  efficacy  variable  was  change  from  Day  15  Visit  to  Day  43  Visit  in  total ventilation  defect.  Average  change  from  Day  15  Visit  to  Day  29  and  Day  43  Visits  were  also summarized.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Part B, the primary efficacy variable, average change from baseline through Week 48 in total ventilation  defect  was  summarized by human reader and by ventilation segmentation algorithm. Change from baseline to each scheduled visit was also summarized.

In  both  parts  of  the  study,  safety  was  assessed  in  terms  of  the  following  secondary  (safety) endpoints:  Incidence  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs);  Clinical  laboratory  values (including coagulation studies); Electrocardiogram (ECG) outcomes, and Vital signs.

Total defect volume (L), total lung volume (L), and total number of defects were obtained from the 3He-MRI  record  of  each  subject  as  exploratory  endpoints  in  both  parts  of  the  study.  Total ventilation defect was defined as the ratio of total defect volume to total lung volume, expressed as a percentage. Analysis for total ventilation defect was determined by 'Ventilation Segmentation' algorithm  was  performed  per  the  schedule  of  assessments.  Each  individual  parameter  was  also summarized.

A Pharmacokinetic (PK) Evaluation was conducted in Part A only. Blood pharmacokinetic samples were to be collected to determine the plasma concentrations of VX-770 and metabolites M1 and M6 at the Day 29, Day 43, and Early Termination Visits.

## · Statistical Methods

For  efficacy  and  safety  assessments,  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  was  used,  which  included  all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug (i.e., VX-770 or placebo).

## Efficacy Analyses :

Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to assess within subject change. Raw values and changes from  baseline  were  also  summarized.  Total  ventilation  defect  was  further  summarized  by  FEV1 severity.    Additional  summary  included:  total  ventilation  defect  by  human  reader,  and  each individual  parameter  (total  defect  volume,  total  lung  volume,  and  total  number  of  defects), evaluated by reader-averaged value and by individual reader.

Predicted  FEV1  (KNUFEV  [L])  was  calculated  using  the  Knudson  method  and  percent  predicted FEV1 was the ratio of FEV1 to KNUFEV, expressed as a percentage. Responder rate defined by ≥ 5 percentage  point  change  from  baseline  at  each  visit  (including  the  Safety  Follow-up  Visit)  in percent predicted FEV1 were summarized.

Change from baseline in sweat chloride was calculated as Left Right Base mean (SWright , SWleft)SWbase , where SW Left and SWRight were the measurements obtained on the left and right arms, respectively, at a particular visit and  SWbase  was  the  mean  of  right  and  left  baseline measurements. If 1 of the 2 measurements at a time point was missing, the other was used as the mean. In Part A, change from Day 15 Visit to Day 43 Visit, average change from Day 15 Visit to Day  29  and  Day  43  Visits  in  sweat  chloride  were  summarized.  Raw  values  and  changes  from baseline in each treatment phase were also summarized. In Part B, average change from baseline through Week 48, change from baseline to each scheduled visit (including the Safety  Follow-up Visit) in sweat chloride were summarized.

Safety  analysis: Continuous  variables  (e.g.,  blood  pressure)  were  summarized  by  means  of descriptive  statistics  and  categorical  variables  (e.g.,  presence  of  an  adverse  event  [AE])  were summarized by  contingency  tables.  Only  descriptive  analysis  of  safety  were  performed  (i.e.,  no statistical testing was performed).

Pharmacokinetics  Analyses (Part  A  only):  PK  of  VX-770  and  metabolites,  M1  and  M6,  were characterized as trough concentration. Bioanalysis was not conducted on samples when subjects were administered placebo.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Summary statistics were calculated for the number of observations (N), arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) in Part A on Day 29 and 43.

Compliance was informally assessed by identifying subjects with abhorrent plasma concentration values with drug accountability records.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

In  Part  A,  8  subjects  were  enrolled;  the  FAS  and  the  Safety  Set  were  identical.  All  subjects completed dosing and there were no discontinuations from the study.

A total of 9 subjects enrolled in Part B. Four of the subjects from part A were allowed to enrol in part B of this study. Eight subjects completed dosing, and 7 subjects completed the safety followup  visit.  The  reason  for  not  completing  the  study  in  the  2  subjects  who  discontinued  was withdrawal of consent after the last dose (and they did not complete their safety follow-up visits).

## Baseline data

Most of the subjects in Part A were White (n=7, 87.5%) with a mean age of 18.9 years (range: 12, 25) and mean baseline percent predicted FEV1 of 89.95%. There were an equal number of male and  female  subjects.  Six  out  of  8  subjects  had  G551D/F508del-CFTR  mutations,  1  subject  had G551D/unknown mutations, and 1 subject had G551D/G542X mutations.

In Part B, all 9 (100%) subjects were White, with a mean age of 24.4 years (range: 13, 48) and mean baseline percent predicted FEV1 of 74.08%. Six out of 9 (66.7%) subjects were male. Seven out of 9 subjects had G551D/F508del-CFTR mutations, 1 subject had G551D/Unknown mutations, and 1 subject had G551D/G551D mutations.

## Efficacy results

## Part A

## Primary endpoint

During  Placebo  Run-in,  the  mean  total  ventilation  defect  values  showed  small  changes  from baseline  (mean  [SD]  of  2.20  [7.583]  by  human  reader  and  1.79  [6.098]  by  ventilation segmentation algorithm) that were not statistically significant.  During  VX-770  Treatment  Period, the total ventilation defect decreased significantly in the first 2 weeks of treatment (Days 15 to 29 mean  [SD]  change  from  baseline  of  -8.50  [8.580]  by  human  reader  and  -6.28  [16.378]  by ventilation  segmentation  algorithm)  and  remained  decreased  through  the  second  2  weeks  of treatment (Days 15 to 43 mean [SD] change from baseline of -8.20 [9.013] by human reader and -12.81  [10.047]  by  ventilation  segmentation  algorithm).  After  the  Placebo  Washout,  the  total ventilation defect values returned to levels similar to those at the start of the Placebo Run-in.

## Secondary endpoints

Table 11-3 provides the within-subject absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 by treatment  phase.  During  Placebo  Run-in,  the  percent  predicted  FEV1  values  showed  a  decrease from  baseline  (mean  [SD]  of  -3.95  [4.929]).  During  VX-770  Treatment  Period,  the  percent predicted FEV1 increased significantly from baseline (mean [SD] of 9.57 [11.297]) for the first 2 weeks  [Day  15  to  Day  29])  and  this  increase  sustained  through  Day  43  (mean  [SD]  of  12.78 [9.203]). After the Placebo Washout, the percent predicted FEV1 returned to similar level as Day 1.

Table 11-5 provides the within-subject absolute change from baseline in pooled CFQ-R respiratory domain  score  by  treatment  phase.  During  Placebo  Run-in,  the  CFQ-R  values  showed  a  small increase from baseline (mean [SD] of 2.78 [6.640]). During VX-770 Treatment Period, the score decreased  from  baseline  (mean  [SD]  of  -2.08  [25.361]  during  Day  15  to  Day  29  and  -7.64 [27.529]  during  Day  15  to  Day  43).  The  mean  CFQ-R  respiratory  domain  score  continued  to decrease during the Placebo Washout. This observation was not consistent with other studies with VX-770, and the mean CFQ-R respiratory domain score during the VX-770 treatment period may have been influenced by a small number of outlying values.

## Part B

## Primary endpoint

Table 11-2 provides the within-subject change from baseline in total ventilation defect by study visit.  With  the  exception of the human reader result at Day 15, the decrease in total ventilation defect  by  human  reader  and  by  ventilation  segmentation  algorithm  was  greater  during  VX-770 treatment (Day 1 through Week 48) than after the treatment (Week 52). The effect across time appeared to be reasonably stable. After the end of VX-770 Treatment Period, the total ventilation defect values returned to levels similar to those at baseline.

The changes from baseline in total ventilation defect were consistent with those observed in Part A and generally not statistically significant; however, the analysis was limited by the sample size of the study.

## Correlation Analysis

Mean changes in total ventilation defect and mean changes in percent predicted FEV1 values for all 8 subjects in Part A (Day 15 Visit to Day 57 Visit) are shown in Figure 11-11 and for all 9 subjects in Part B (Day 1 to Week 52) are shown in Figure 11-12, respectively. In Part A and Part B, the total ventilation defect during VX-770 treatment decreased significantly (both as quantified by the human reader and by a computer algorithm) and percent predicted FEV1 increased significantly. After  the  end  of  VX-770  treatment,  total  ventilation  defect  values  and  percent  predicted  FEV1 values returned to levels similar to those at baseline.

In  Part  A,  with  the  exception  of  1  subject  (Subject),  all  subjects  had  a  reduction  in  ventilation defect volume relative to Day 15 following treatment with VX-770. While ventilation defects were not completely eliminated, use of this absolute metric identified 1 subject who had an especially marked reduction such that only approximately 30% of total ventilation defect remained following treatment.

Spearman  correlation  was  calculated  between  the  primary  efficacy  variable  and  each  of  the secondary efficacy variables for Part A and Part B.

In  Part  A,  the  change  from  baseline  in  total  ventilation  defect  (%)  by  human  reader  versus absolute  change  from  baseline  in  percent  predicted  FEV1  (%)  showed  a  moderate,  negative correlation during Day 15 to Day 43 (-0.5238). In Part B, the total ventilation defect (%) by human reader versus percent predicted FEV1 (%) showed a moderate, negative correlation (-0.6172) for the duration of 48 weeks.

Similarly,  the  change  from  baseline  in  total  ventilation  defect  (%)  by  human  reader  showed  a moderate, negative correlation with the change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 (%) for the duration of 48 weeks (-0.6679).

In Part A, the change from baseline in total ventilation defect (%) by human reader versus change from baseline in sweat chloride (mmol/L) values showed a weak, positive correlation during Day 15 to Day 43 (0.0240). In Part B, the change from baseline in total ventilation defect (%) by human reader  versus  change  from  baseline  in  sweat  chloride  (mmol/L)  also  showed  a  weak,  positive correlation for the duration of 48 weeks (0.2293).

In Part A, the change from baseline in total ventilation defect (%) by human reader versus change from baseline in pooled CFQ-R respiratory domain score showed a weak, positive correlation during Day 15 to Day 43 (0.0976,). In Part B, the change from baseline in total ventilation defect (%) by human reader versus change from baseline in pooled CFQ-R respiratory domain score showed a weak, negative correlation for the duration of 48 weeks (-0.2048).

## Safety results

Overall Summary of Adverse Events

## Part A

Four (50.0%) subjects had 6 AEs: 3 events during the Placebo Run-in Period and 3 during the VX770 Treatment Period. There were no SAEs, no deaths, and no discontinuation of study drug dosing due to an AE. None of the AEs reported were considered study drug-related.

Table 12-4 shows the incidence of all AEs by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) in Part A. the SOC with the highest incidence was the respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders SPC (2 [25.0%] subjects) in the Placebo Run-in Period; however all AEs by PT had an incidence of 1 (12.5%) subject.

| Table 12-4 Adverse Events by System Organ Class and   | Preferred Term,   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|

Sources: Table 14.3.1.2 and Listing 16.2.7.1

## Part B

Six (66.7%) subjects had 32 AEs; 4 (44.4 %) subjects had AEs that were considered related or possibly  related  to  the  study  drug.  There  was  1  (11.1%)  subject  with  an  SAE.  There  were  no deaths and no discontinuation of study drug dosing due to an AE.

Table 12-5 shows the incidence of all AEs by SOC and PT in Part B. The SOCs with the highest incidences  were  infections  and  infestations  (5  [55.6%]  subjects)  and  investigations  (4  [44.4%] subjects). The AEs by PT with the highest incidence were upper respiratory tract infection (44.4%), infective  pulmonary  exacerbation  of  CF  (33.3%),  BMI  increased  (22.2%),  abnormal  spirometry (22.2%), and pyrexia (22.2%). All other AEs had an incidence of 11.1% (1 subject).

## AEs by severity

There were no life-threatening AEs on either part of this study.

In part A, there was 1 AE of moderate severity (abdominal distension) and 5 AEs of mild severity that occurred in a total of 4 subjects. The 1 AE of moderate severity occurred during the VX-770 Treatment Period, it started 3 days after the first dose of VX-770, lasted for 10 days, and resolved after treatment with polycarbophil calcium.

In part B, There were 18 AEs of moderate severity in a total of 5 subjects (infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF [2 out of 9 subjects]; pyrexia [2 out of 9 subjects]; all other AEs [1 out of 9 subjects]). There was 1 AE that was severe in severity: a 48-year-old White male, had a severe infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF that started 249 days after the first dose of VX-770, lasted for 49 days, and resolved after intravenous administration of ceftazidime.

## AEs Leading to Discontinuation

There were no AEs leading to study drug discontinuation on either part of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

In  the  clinical  setting,  FEV1  is  currently  the  main  marker  of  lung  function,  since  the  initial ventilation  defect  in  CF  is  usually  obstructive.  This  clinical  parameter  is  also  recognized  in  the regulatory  setting  as  the  recommended  primary  endpoint  in  CF  trials.  However,  FEV1,  which reflects total airways resistance, has some limitations in terms of a lower sensitivity to changes in small  calibre  airways,  which  contribute  to  less  than  10%  of  the  overall  resistance  (in  healthy lungs).  Additional difficulties can be identified to perform the lung function assessment of young children (especially those 5 years of age and younger), which require to be carried in specialised centres to promote standardised methods. In this context, it is agreed that new and adequately validated methods to measure lung function would be valuable.

Hyperpolarized noble gas magnetic resonance imaging (HG-MRI) is a method for assessing lung function by direct imaging of certain non-radioactive isotopes of an inert noble gas, usually helium or xenon. This imaging  technique provides high-resolution, 3-dimensional images  of lung ventilation that can be obtained in both pediatric and adult patients during a single short breathhold  following  inhalation  of  the  gas.  In  CF  patients,  HG-MRI  images  show  a  'ventilation  defect' areas  of  the  lung  into  which  inhaled  gas  does  not  flow  due  to  obstruction  of  the  airway.    This ventilation  defect  does  not  usually  show  in  healthy  subjects  and  it  is  thought  to  correlate  with disease severity. It can be quantified using both manual and automated techniques.  In addition, HG-MRI allows magnetic-resonance-specific measures (such as apparent diffusion coefficient) to be calculated from the data.

HG-MRI is a novel, yet experimental, method to assess lung function must be properly validated before  being  considered  as  a  basis  for  the  demonstration  of  efficacy  in  CF  paediatric  and  adult patients.

## Efficacy

Study VX10-770-107 was a phase 2, single-blind, placebo-controlled study  which evaluated the short-term/long-term effect of ivacaftor on hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Design &amp; conduct of the study

The  study  was  conducted  in  a  single  centre  in  the  USA  and  took  place  from  October  2010  to February 2013.

Subjects  aged  ≥12  years  with  the  G551D -cystic  fibrosis  transmembrane  conductance  regulator gene  (CFTR)  mutation  (on  at  least  1  allele)  were  allowed  to  enrol.  No  formal  sample  size calculations were performed and the sample size was selected based on operational considerations. This  approach  can  be  accepted,  considering  the  low  prevalence  of  the  disease  and  the  selected CFTR mutation. However, the inherent limitations associated with small sample sizes need to be acknowledged.

The primary objectives of the study were to assess the short-term (28 days, part A) and long-term (48 weeks, part B) effects of ivacaftor on He-MRI, in order to explore the possibility of using this imaging technique as a potential biomarker of lung function in CF studies.

## Efficacy data &amp; additional analyses

A  total  of  17  patients  were  included  (8  in  phase  A,  and  9  in  phase  B),  of  which  only  4  were pediatric patients (age range 12-16). In term of overall results, correlation between the changes in ventilation defect and clinical endpoints was considered modest.

Only global results, including all subjects (pediatric and adult) have been provided and no separate results are available for the pediatric subjects in this study. It is acknowledged that the number of pediatric  patients  included  in  the  study  was  very  small  (n=4)  and  the  applicability  of  the  study results would probably be very limited as well. However, the lack of pediatric-specific data hampers from  reaching  any  sort  of  conclusion.  Therefore,  the  MAH  is  asked  to  provide  pediatric  data separately from the global study results. Efficacy as well as safety results should be provided.

## Safety

In general, ivacaftor seemed to be well tolerated during study VX10-770-107. There were no lifethreatening AEs or AEs leading to study drug discontinuation on either part of this study.

In part A, the SOC with the highest incidence of AEs was the respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders  SOC  (2  [25.0%]  subjects).  A  total  of  4  (50.0%)  subjects  had  6  AEs,  none  of  them considered study drug-related.

In  part  B,  the  SOCs  with  the  highest  incidences  were  infections  and  infestations  (5  [55.6%] subjects) and investigations (4 [44.4%] subjects). A total of 6 (66.7%) subjects had 32 AEs; 4 (44.4 %) subjects had AEs that were considered related or possibly related to the study drug (1 acute  bronchitis  AE,  1  acute  labyrinthitis  AE,  2  increased  BMI  AEs,  2  abnormal  decrease  in spirometry AEs, and one upper respiratory infection  AE). There was 1 (11.1%) subject with an SAE.

The  overall  safety  profile  observed  in  study  VX10-770-107was  consistent  with  that  observed  in previous studies for CF subjects with G551D mutation on 1 allele.  However, pediatric data has not been provided separately from the global study results. Therefore, no conclusion on pediatric safety can be reached and additional information is needed from the MAH.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

## Overall conclusion

From the provided data, no conclusions can be reached on the effect of ivacaftor on hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging in pediatric subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF). Considering that the aim of this procedure is to specifically assess pediatric data, the provided results (global results  only)  do  not  allow  performing  an  adequate  assessment.  The  MAH  is  asked  to  provide pediatric data separately from the global study results. Efficacy as well as safety results should be provided (see further details in the next section).

## Recommendation

- [ ] Fulfilled:

- [x] Not fulfilled:

## Additional clarifications requested

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide the following information as part of this procedure.

## 1) Efficacy :

a. Separate efficacy results should be provided for the 4 paediatric subjects included in the study. Primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints data should be presented, using  adequate descriptive statistics.

- b. Potential differences between paediatric and adult results should also be discussed.

## 2) Safety:

- a. An appropriate description of safety in the paediatric patients should be provided. An overall description as well as separate information for each part of the study should be provided.
- b. Patients´  demographic and disease characteristics should also be provided separately for the paediatric patients.
- c. Special attention should be paid to the one SAE and the drug-related AEs reported in the study. The  MAH  should  clarify  if  these  AEs  occurred  in  paediatric  patients,  and  should  provide  a  brief description of the AEs, including demographic and disease characteristics of these patients.

## 4. Assessment of the responses to the Request for Supplementary Information.

## Question 1

1a. Separate efficacy results should be provided for the 4 paediatric subjects included in study  107.  Primary,  secondary  and  exploratory  endpoints  data  should  be  presented, using adequate descriptive statistics.

1b. Potential differences between paediatric and adult results should also be discussed.

## MAH's response

## 1.a. Study Part A

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Primary Endpoint

The mean (standard deviation) (SD) change in total ventilation defect from Day 15 to Day 43 (for paediatric subjects) was -6.47% (6.478%) when analyzed by human reader. A similar change for these subjects -9.72% (4.804%) was observed when analyzed using the ventilation segmentation algorithm (Table 1). The mean change in total ventilation defect for paediatric subjects was slightly less than that determined for adult subjects (-9.23% [10.844%] by human reader and -14.67% [12.396] by ventilation segmentation algorithm. Over the 4 weeks of VX-770 treatment, the total ventilation defect as well as total defect volume, total lung volume, and total number of subjects showed a decrease in both paediatric and adult subjects (exception being the mean change from Day 15 to Day 29) in total ventilation defect and total defect volume for the paediatric subjects analyzed  by  ventilation  segmentation  algorithm.  Following  wash-out,  the  total  ventilation  defect values returned to pre-treatment levels in both paediatric and adult subjects. The changes from baseline  for  all  parameters  measured  were  not  statistically  significant,  most  likely  because  the analysis was limited by the sample sizes.

Notes: Baseline is the most recent non missing measurement collected prior to imitial administration of study drug in each treatment phase (Day 1 to Day 15 on PlaceboRun-in, Day 15 to Day 43 on VX 770,and Day 43 to Day 57 on PlaceboWashout. P value was calculated using Wilcoxon signedrank test. Pediatric subjectswere &lt;18years of age when enrolledin the study.

The mean and median change from baseline in the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain scores did not change during the Placebo Run-in, indicating that subjects were stable during that phase (Table 4). During VX-770 treatment, the mean CFQ-R respiratory domain scores  for  pediatric  subjects  decreased  through  4  weeks  of  treatment,  while  the  mean  CFQ-R scores for adult subjects did not change during VX-770 treatment. Interpretation of these results is confounded  because  the  mean  CFQ-R  respiratory  domain  score  during  the  VX-770  Treatment Period may have been influenced by a small number of outlying values and the small sample size.

Notes: Baseline is the most recent non missing measurement collected prior to imitial administration of study drug in each treatment phase (Day 1 to Day 15 on Placebo Run-in, Day 15 to Day 43 on VX 770, and Day 43 to Day 57 on Placebo Washout. P value was calculated using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Pediatric subjects were &lt;18 years of age when enrolled in the study.

## Study Part B

## Primary Endpoint

The  changes  from  baseline  in  total  ventilation  defect  (Table  5)  were  generally  greater  in  the pediatric  subgroup than  the  adult  subgroup,  though  they  typically  followed  the  same  pattern  as those observed in the adult subgroup and were consistent with those observed in Part A; however, analysis is limited by the sample size of the subgroups.

## Secondary Endpoints

The mean percent predicted FEV1 increased from baseline and remained fairly constant throughout the 48-week treatment period for the pediatric subgroup as well as the adult subgroup (Table 6). In both subgroups, FEV1 values returned to baseline following completion of study treatment at the Week 52 Safety Follow-up Visit.

For  the  most  part,  given  the  small  sample  size  of  the  subgroups,  the  results  for  the  paediatric subjects in this study are consistent with the results obtained for the adult subjects as well as the overall study population in both Part A (Table 9) and Part B (Table 10), indicating that the overall treatment effect of VX-770 was similar across the age groups.

CFQ R: Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire -- Revised; FEV: forced expiratory volume in 1 second; n: size of subsample;SD:standard deviation.

Notes: Baseline is the most recent non missing measurement collected prior to initial administration of study drug. P value was calculated using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Pooled across CFQ-R types, i.e., all self-response questionnaire versions are used: Adult/Adolescent and Child versions. Only the version of the questionnaire used at baseline for each subject was used in the analysis. Pediatric subjects were &lt;18 years of age when enrolled in the study. Adults were 18 year of age or greater when enrolled in the study.

## CHMP comments

Separate efficacy results for the 4 paediatric patients have been provided, as requested.

Changes from baseline for all the studied parameters were not statistically significant, and it can be agreed with the Applicant that this fact is likely due to the very small sample size. In addition, as previously noted for the overall results, the correlation between the changes in ventilation defect and clinical endpoints in paediatric patients seems to be very modest.

Paediatric results generally show the same trends that overall and adults results.  In general, the sizes of the observed results varied from paediatric to adult patients; however, these differences are  difficult  to  interpret  due  to  the  small  number  of  paediatric  patients.  Overall,  no  large  or worrisome differences are noted between paediatric and adult results. No additional information is being requested at this time.

In  conclusion,  the  requested  information  has  been  provided.  In  that  regard,  the issue  can  be considered solved.

## Question2

- 2a. An appropriate description of safety in the paediatric patients should be provided. An overall description as well as separate information for each part of the study should be provided.

2b. Patients' demographic and disease characteristics should also be provided separately for the paediatric patients.

2c. Special attention should be paid to the one SAE and the drug-related AEs reported in the study. The MAH should clarify if these AEs occurred in paediatric patients, and should provide a brief description of the AEs, including demographic and disease characteristics of these patients.

## MAH's response

## 2.a.

A total of 4 paediatric subjects were enrolled in this study, 3 in Part A and 2 in Part B; 1 subject was enrolled in both Parts A and B (Part A as Subject; Part B as Subject). The overall safety profile was  assessed  in  terms  of  the  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAE),  clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

laboratory values, electrocardiogram outcomes, and vital signs. These data were summarized using descriptive statistics and contingency tables. All individual paediatric subject data were presented in subject data listings.

## Part A:

Of  the  8  subjects  enrolled  in  Part  A,  3  were  paediatric  (&lt;18  years  of  age).  Only  one  of  the  3 paediatric subjects had a TEAE (Subject; 14-year-old male), a non-serious event of mild CF lung, which  was  considered  unlikely  related  to  study  drug.  Of  the  remaining  2  paediatric  subjects, neither had a TEAE; one (Subject ; 12-year-old male) did not have any adverse events (AEs) and the other (Subject ; 15-year-old female) had 2 pre-treatment AEs (events of pain [not related] and oropharyngeal pain [unlikely related]) during the Placebo Run-in.

## Part B:

Of the 9 subjects enrolled in Part B, 2 were paediatric (Subjects and). Subject (13-year-old male) was also enrolled in Part A (as Subject) and did not have an AE in Part B of the study. Subject completed his Week 48 Visit, then withdrew consent, and did not complete the Safety Follow-up Visit.

Subject  (16-year-old  male)  had  6  TEAEs  in  Part  B  (events  of  nausea,  pain,  pyrexia  [2  events], pharyngitis streptococcal, and upper respiratory tract infection). All of the TEAEs were non serious, mild to moderate in severity, considered not related or unlikely related to study drug, and resolved. Subject completed the 48-week VX-770 treatment.

## 2.b.

Demographic data for the 4 paediatric subjects from Part A and Part B are provided in Table 11. Baseline disease characteristics and CF history for the 4 paediatric subjects from Part A and Part B are provided in Table 12.

## 2.c.

One subject  (Subject),  a  48-year-old  White  male  with  G551D/  G551D,  had  an  SAE  of  infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF in Part B of the study.

There were no AEs reported as related to study drug in Part A for any subject (pediatric or adult). In Part B, 4 subjects had 7 AEs that were considered possibly related to study drug, all were mild in  severity  unless  noted  and  no  events  were  considered  related;  none  of  these  subjects  were pediatric subjects.

- -Subject  (26-year-old  white  female)  had  3  AEs  that  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  as possibly related to study  treatment  (bronchitis, labyrinthitis,  and  body  mass  index  [BMI] increased).  The  events  of  labyrinthitis  and  BMI  increased,  both  moderate  in  severity,  resolved during the study. The event of bronchitis occurred 344 days from first dose and had not resolved by the end of study.
- -Subject (22-year-old white female) had 1 AE that was assessed by the investigator as possibly related to study treatment (spirometry abnormal). This event resolved while on study treatment.
- -Subject (31-year-old white male) had 2 AEs that were assessed by the investigator as possibly related  to  study  treatment  (upper  respiratory  tract  infection  and  spirometry  abnormal).  Both events resolved while on study treatment.
- -Subject (48-year-old white male) had 1 AE that was assessed by the investigator as possibly related to study treatment (BMI increased). This event occurred 256 days from first dose and had not resolved by the end of study.

Demographic data for the 4 subjects from Part B who had an AE assessed by the investigator as possibly related to study treatment are provided in Table 13.  Baseline disease characteristics and CF history for  the  4  adult  subjects  from  Part  B  who  had  an  AE  assessed  by  the  investigator  as possibly related to study treatment are provided in Table 14.

2.a,

Of the 3 paediatric patients enrolled in part A, only one reported a treatment-related AE, which was mild  in  intensity  and  considered  unlikely  related  with  study  treatment.  In  part  B,  one  of  the  2 paediatric  patients included  experienced  a  total  of  6  treatment-related  AEs,  of  mild-to-moderate intensity and considered not related-unlikely related to study treatment. The other patient did not experience any AEs or SAEs and did not complete the Safety follow-up visit.

In general, these data does not seem to differ with the overall population safety data and no new concerns have been identified.

2.b.

The requested information has been provided. Bearing in mind that the sample size is very small, the  patients  included  can  be  considered  representative  of  CF  paediatric  patients,  in  terms  of baseline demographic and disease characteristics.

2.c.

No SAEs or treatment-related AEs were reported in paediatric patients on either part of the study. This  is  considered  reassuring,  although  the  limitations  derived  from  the  small  sample  size  are acknowledged.

In conclusion, no new safety signals have been identified in paediatric patients included in study 107.

Issue considered solved.

## 5. CHMP's updated  overall conclusion and recommendation

As a response to the CHMP´s request for additional information, the MAH has submitted separate data from paediatric patients included in study VX10-770-107, a phase 2, single-blind, placebocontrolled study  which evaluated the short-term/long-term effect of ivacaftor on hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging (HG-MRI) in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF).

In  terms  of  efficacy,  changes  from  baseline  for  all  the  studied  parameters  were  not  statistically significant in paediatric patients, likely due to the very small sample size. In addition, as previously noted for the overall results, the correlation between the changes in ventilation defect and clinical endpoints in paediatric patients seems to be very modest.

Paediatric efficacy results generally showed the same trends that the overall and adults results.  In general, the sizes of the observed effects varied from paediatric to adult patients; however, these differences  are  difficult  to  interpret  due  to  the  small  number  of  paediatric  patients.  Overall,  no large or worrisome differences in efficacy are noted between paediatric and adult results.

Regarding to safety, very few AEs reported in paediatric patients, most of them mild in intensity and considered not related/unlikely related to the study treatment.  No SAEs or treatment-related AEs were reported in paediatric patients on either part of the study.  This is considered reassuring, although the limitations derived from the small sample size are acknowledged.

In general, these data does not seem to differ with the overall population safety data and no new concerns or safety signals have been identified.

## Overall conclusion

The number of paediatric patients included in study VX10-770-107 was very small. Results do not indicate  large  differences  with  those  from  the  overall  and  adult  population.  As  a  result  of  the limited sample size, the applicability of the study results is considered very limited as well.

In  conclusion,  paediatric  data  from  study  VX10-770-107  does  not  change  the  B/R  of  Kalydeco (ivacaftor) in the currently approved indication. Therefore, further actions regarding the conditions of use and the product information are not required at this time.
