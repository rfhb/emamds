## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for tenofovir alafenamide, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

The existing Product Information of tenofovir alafenamide containing medicinal products reflects the need of renal function monitoring during tenofovir therapy. However, based on the cumulative review data, an update to the existing warning on nephrotoxicity is considered appropriate in order to inform prescribers on the observed cases of acute renal failure and proximal renal tubulopathy in the post marketing setting. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tenofovir alafenamide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing tenofovir alafenamide is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
