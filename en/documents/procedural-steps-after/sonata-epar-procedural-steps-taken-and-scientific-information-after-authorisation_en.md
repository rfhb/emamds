1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

mg, respectively) of each drug. However, because both of these compounds have CNS effects, an additive pharmacodynamic effect is possible.

In a fertility and reproductive performance study in rats, mortality and decreased fertility were observed in males and females at an oral zaleplon dose of 100 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 49-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg on a mg/m2 basis). Followup studies indicated that impaired fertility was due to an effect on the female.

In embryofetal development studies, oral administration of zaleplon up to 100 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively, produced no evidence of teratogenicity (equivalent to 49- (rat) and 48(rabbit) times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). Pre-and postnatal growth of rats was reduced at the maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose for growth of rat offspring was 10 mg/kg (equivalent to 5-times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). No adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed in rabbits.

In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, increased stillbirth and postnatal mortality, and decreased growth and physical development, were observed in the offspring of females treated with doses of ≥7 mg/kg/day that did not elicit maternal toxicity. The no-effect dose for postnatal development was 1 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 0.5-times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). In a subsequent cross-fostering study, adverse effects on offspring viability and growth appeared to result from both in utero and lactational exposure to zaleplon.

| II/0019   | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics (section 4.4 Special Warnings and Special Precautions for Use) to include a specific warning on the potential for dependence with zaleplon. Corresponding changes have been introduced in section 2 of the Package Leaflet. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet   | 27/04/2006   | 12/06/2006    | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL longer   | In the 9th Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) for Sonata, 4 case reports of dependence were included. In view of this the CHMP requested the MAH to update the Product Information accordingly. Subsequently, the MAH identified in its database 14 reports consistent with dependence on zaleplon. Most of the patients were taking other psychotropic medications. Therefore, the following information has been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics: \"There have been post-marketing reports of dependence associated with zaleplon predominantly in combination with other psychotropic agents.\" The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. In addition, in this Type II variation, the MAH updated the list of local representatives and updated the Product Information in accordance to the latest template.   |
