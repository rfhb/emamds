## 1. Introduction

On 18 October 2024, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Recarbrio, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that the study 'A Phase 2/3 Open-label, Randomized, Active-controlled Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of MK-7655A in Pediatric Participants from Birth to Less Than 18 Years of Age With Confirmed or Suspected Gram-negative Bacterial Infection', P021MK7655A, also called MK-7655A-021, PN021, Ped002, and P021) is part of the paediatric clinical development programme for Recarbrio. A variation application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e containing several studies) to support the extension of indication(s) from adults to children is expected to be submitted by 06/25. A line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Treatment was given with imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam (IMI/REL) powder for suspension, with an option for oral switch to an appropriate oral antibacterial agent.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- P021MK7655A, A Phase 2/3 Open-label, Randomized, Active-controlled Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of MK-7655A in Pediatric Participants from Birth to Less Than 18 Years of Age With Confirmed or Suspected Gram-negative Bacterial Infection.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

P021MK7655A, A Phase 2/3 Open-label, Randomized, Active-controlled Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of MK-7655A in Pediatric Participants from Birth to Less Than 18 Years of Age With Confirmed or Suspected Gramnegative Bacterial Infection.

## Description

The study was a Phase 2/3 randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-site, open-label study of IMI/REL in paediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age with confirmed or suspected gram-negative bacterial infections. Participants with HAP/VAP, cIAI, or cUTI were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive IMI/REL or active control. Participants were stratified by age group and infection type prior to randomization.

Five paediatric age cohorts were to be evaluated in the study:

- Age Cohort 1: Adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Age Cohort 2: Older Children (6 to &lt;12 years)
- Age Cohort 3: Younger Children (2 to &lt;6 years)
- Age Cohort 4: Infants and Toddlers (3 months to &lt;2 years)
- Age Cohort 5: Neonates and Young Infants (birth to &lt;3 months)

## Methods

Safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK were assessed during the intervention and follow-up periods. Study visits were performed at randomization (Day 1), on therapy (OTX), at the end of IV therapy (EOIV, only for participants who switch to oral therapy), and at the end of therapy (EOT). Following the completion of all study intervention, participants were evaluated 7 to 14 days after EOT (at the Early Follow-up [EFU] visit) and 7 to 14 days after the EFU visit (at the Late Follow-up [LFU] visit). The investigator was allowed to switch participants with cIAI or cUTI to oral antibacterial therapy based on the participant's clinical condition after a minimum of 3 days of IV study intervention; these participants had an EOIV visit and completed a minimum of 5 days up to a maximum of 14 days of all study intervention (IV + oral). Oral switch was not allowed for participants with HAP/VAP, and completed a minimum of 7 days of IV study intervention. Safety and tolerability was monitored periodically throughout the study and at the planned interim analysis by an eDMC in conjunction with the Sponsor Executive Oversight Committee (EOC).

Age Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, were enrolled in parallel. To assess whether the safety and tolerability profile was acceptable overall and for each age cohort and to confirm the proposed initial doses for Age Cohorts 4 and 5, an interim analysis was performed when at least 30 participants in each of Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 had final data available. Once the proposed initial doses for Age Cohorts 4 and 5 were confirmed based on the findings from the interim analysis, enrolment in Age Cohorts 4 and 5 was done in parallel.

## Study participants

Male or female participants from birth to less than 18 years of age who required hospitalization and treatment with IV antibacterial therapy for confirmed or suspected Gram-negative bacterial infection (in the absence of meningitis) involving 1 of 3 primary infection types: HAP/VAP, cUTI, or cIAI.

## Treatments

Treatment details are given in the table below. Briefly, active treatment was IMI/REL given as intravenous infusion at doses 15/7.5 mg/kg q6-8h or 500/250 mg q6h, based on cohort. Active control was given per investigators discretion from a list of predefined treatments, dosed according to approved product information or international guidelines.

An option for oral switch was allowed for patients with cIAI or cUTI after at least 3 days of i.v. therapy, based on clinical condition.

## Outcomes/endpoints

See table above.

## Sample size

Approximately 140 participants were planned to be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive IMI/REL or active control. As differences in the distribution of infection types within each age cohort were considered likely, a balance of infection types across age cohorts was unlikely to be achievable; therefore, an interactive response technology (IRT) system was be used to meet the following targets:

- Minimum of 28 participants each Approximately 50 participants each with HAP/VAP and cIAI enrolled.
- At least 10% of participants with cIAI have a diagnosis other than complicated appendicitis.
- A maximum of 48 with cUTI in the 3 youngest Age Cohorts (3, 4, and 5) combined, but no minimum.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

A 3:1 randomisation ratio was selected to gain greater experience with IMI/REL and to maximize the opportunity to assess safety and efficacy. Randomization was stratified by age and by infection type for balanced distribution across age cohorts and infection types. The oldest 3 age cohorts (Age Cohorts 1, 2, and 3) were studied in parallel. Enrolment in the 2 youngest age cohorts (Age Cohorts 4 and 5) was initiated after completion of the interim review of aggregated safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK data from Age Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, and confirmation of doses.

The study was open-label; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator, and participant know which intervention was administered.

## Statistical Methods

No hypothesis testing was performed, rather, point estimates of efficacy and safety endpoints were calculated with within-group and between-group confidence intervals. PK data were used to update the paediatric popPK model.

## Recruitment

The disposition of all randomized participants was generally comparable for the IMI/REL and Active Control intervention groups [Table 10-1]. Disposition across age cohorts was generally comparable, although the interpretation of differences in disposition across age cohorts is limited by the low sample sizes (especially in the Active Control group).

A total of 130 participants were screened across 38 study sites in 18 countries. Of these, 115 participants in 35 study sites in 15 countries were randomized to treatment. All but 2 participants (1 in each treatment group) received at least 1 dose of study intervention and the majority (&gt;82%) completed study intervention. Most participants in each age cohort completed the study and the study medication. The most common reasons for discontinuing study intervention were 'other' in the IMI/REL group (7.1%) and 'adverse event' and 'physician decision' (each 7.1%) in the Active Control group. Most randomized participants (&gt;96%) completed the study. The disposition of all randomized participants by infection type was generally comparable for both intervention groups. A higher percentage of participants with HAP/VAP (100%) and cIAI (92.5%) infections completed the study medication compared with participants with cUTI (74.1%).

## Baseline data

Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable for both interventions except for the proportion of participants of 'Not Hispanic or Latino' ethnicity which was lower in the IMI/REL group (58.1%) compared with the Active Control group (69.0%). Most participants were White, and not Hispanic or Latino; cIAI and cUTI were more common types of infection than HAP/VAP. Most participants with cIAI (39 of 40 participants) were in Age Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, whereas participants with HAP/VAP or cUTI infections were more evenly distributed across age cohorts.

## Number analysed

The efficacy analyses were based on the MITT and mMITT populations.

Of the 115 randomized participants, 113 (98.3%) were included in the MITT population. Two randomized participants were not included in the MITT population due to withdrawal by parent/guardian.

Source:[P021MK7655A:adam-adsl]

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MITT population was used for analysis of clinical response and mMITT for analysis of microbiological response in this study. The mMITT population included all randomized participants who met the following conditions: For participants with HAP/VAP and cIAI:

- The participant received at least 1 dose of IV study intervention; AND
- The participant's baseline infection-site culture grew at least 1 Gram-negative pathogen.

For participants with cUTI:

- The participant received at least 1 dose of IV study intervention; AND
- The participant's baseline urine culture grew at least 1 Gram-negative pathogen at sufficient quantity (ie, growth at ≥10 5  CFU/mL of uropathogen)

For analyses of efficacy data using the mMITT population, participants were included in the intervention group to which they were randomized.

Of the 115 randomized participants, 90 (78.3%) were included in the mMITT population. Twenty-three randomized participants (20.0%) had a baseline culture that did not meet culture identification requirements for inclusion.

## Safety Analysis Population

Safety analyses were based on the APaT population, which included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of IV study intervention. For analyses of safety data using the APaT population, participants were included in the intervention group corresponding to the study intervention they actually received.

For this study, the APaT and MITT populations were the same. Of the 115 randomized participants, 113 (98.3%) were included in the APaT population. Two randomized participants were not included in the APaT population due to withdrawal by parent/guardian.

## PK Analysis Population

PK analyses for the plasma concentration listing provided in the CSR were based on the 85 participants who received at least 1 dose of IMI/REL and had at least 1 measurable PK sample.

The other secondary PK endpoints, based on the protocol-defined PK population, will be presented in a separate paediatric population PK modelling and simulation report.

## Efficacy results

## All-cause Mortality Through Day 28 (MITT)

No participants died in either intervention group in the study through Day 28.

## Clinical Response (MITT and mMITT)

The majority of participants in the MITT population (&gt;69% in both intervention groups) achieved a favourable clinical response at the EOT visit (cure, improved), and favourable clinical response at the EFU and LFU visits (sustained cure, cure).

The percentage of participants with a favourable clinical response at the EOT, EFU, and LFU visit was numerically comparable for the IMI/REL and Active Control groups.

Results for favourable clinical responses by outcome categories and by visit were generally comparable for both intervention groups.

The majority of participants in the mMITT population (&gt;79%, in both intervention groups) achieved a favourable clinical response at the EOT, EFU, and LFU visits. The percentage of participants with a favourable clinical response at the EOT, EFU, and LFU visits was comparable for both intervention groups (the 95% CIs of the difference in percentage for IMI/REL vs Active Control groups included 0).

Results for favourable clinical responses by outcome categories and by visit were generally comparable for both intervention groups.

Clinical Response by Age Cohort and Infection Type (MITT, mMITT)

The percentage of participants with a favourable clinical response at the EOT, EFU, and LFU visits was generally comparable for both intervention groups, overall and across age cohorts, within each infection type.

The percentage of participants with cUTI with a favourable clinical response at the EOT, EFU, and LFU visits was in general numerically lower than rates for cIAI for both intervention groups.

In the MITT population, a higher percentage of participants with cUTI was reported with a clinical response category of 'indeterminate' compared with participants with HAP/VAP and cIAI for both intervention groups. Participants with indeterminate outcomes included those who failed to meet microbiological criteria in this response category and those who received prohibited antibiotic treatment.

Microbiological Response (mMITT)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Most participants in the mMITT population (&gt;85% in both intervention groups) achieved a favourable microbiological response at the EOT, EFU, and LFU visits (eradication, presumed eradication). The percentage of participants with a favourable microbiological response at the EOT, EFU, and LFU visit was numerically comparable for the IMI/REL and Active Control groups. Results for favourable microbiological responses by outcome categories and by visit were generally comparable for both intervention groups.

Microbiological Response by Age Cohort and Infection Type (mMITT)

The percentage of participants in the mMITT population with a favourable microbiological response at the EOT, EFU, and LFU visits was generally comparable for both intervention groups, overall and across age cohorts, within each infection type.

The percentage of participants with cUTI infection type with a favourable microbiological response at the EOT, EFU, and LFU visits was in general lower than for the percentage of participants with cIAI for both intervention groups.

## Safety results

## Adverse Events

Overall, 57 (67.1%) participants receiving IMI/REL experienced at least 1 AE; most of these were not considered by the investigator to be related to study intervention. Most AEs were mild or moderate in intensity and generally comparable for both intervention groups.

The percentage of participants who had any drug-related AE, SAE, and AE leading to discontinuation was comparable for both intervention groups. There were no AEs reported with an outcome of death or SAEs leading to discontinuations of IV study intervention. There were few participants (≤ 3) who had drug-related SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuations of IV study intervention, or discontinuations due to drug-related AEs.

## Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events

The most frequently reported AEs (incidence ≥5% in either treatment group) were: vomiting (15.3%), diarrhoea (9.4%), nausea (7.1%), abdominal pain (5.9%), headache (5.9%), pyrexia (5.9%), and thrombocytosis (5.9%) in the IMI/REL group, and vomiting (10.7%), diarrhoea (7.1%), nasopharyngitis (7.1%), nausea (7.1%), pyrexia (7.1%), and tachycardia (7.1%) in the Active Control group. The percentage of participants with AEs (incidence ≥12 participants in the IMI/REL group, or ≥2 participants in the Active Control group) was comparable for both intervention groups, except tachycardia, which was reported for 2 participants in the Active Control group and none in the IMI/REL group.

## AEs Related to Study Intervention

Overall, the percentage of participants with drug-related AEs (22 [19.5%] participants) was generally comparable for both intervention groups (IMI/REL: 20.0%; Active Control: 17.9%). The most frequently reported drug-related AEs (incidence ≥2 participants in either intervention group) were nausea (3 [3.5%]), vomiting (3 [3.5%]), chromaturia (2 [2.4%]), and pruritus (2 [2.4%]) in the IMI/REL group; and diarrhoea (2 [7.1%]), and nausea (2 [7.1%]) in the Active Control group.

The percentage of participants who had AEs considered by the investigator to be drug related (incidence ≥12 participants in the IMI/REL group or ≥2 participants in the Active Control group) was comparable for both intervention groups.

## Serious Adverse Events and Other Clinically Meaningful Adverse Events

There were no AEs reported with an outcome of death in this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The percentage of participants with SAEs was comparable for both intervention groups (IMI/REL: 11.8%; Active Control: 10.7%). Most of the SAEs were reported in 1 participant in either treatment group (IMI/REL: calculus urinary, drug intolerance, Escherichia urinary tract infection, food poisoning, and short-bowel syndrome; Active Control: gastroenteritis rotavirus, neonatal infection, and postoperative wound infection), except for intestinal obstruction reported in 2 (2.4%) participants in the IMI/REL group and urinary tract infection reported in 3 (3.5%) participants in the IMI/REL group. All SAEs were resolved.

No participants had SAEs leading to discontinuation of IV study intervention. Two participants in each intervention group (IMI/REL: 2.4%; Active Control: 7.1%) had SAEs leading to discontinuation of study intervention during oral step-down therapy.

## Drug-related Serious Adverse Events

Two (2.4%) participants in the IMI/REL group (calculus urinary and drug intolerance) and none in the Active Control group had SAEs that were considered by the investigator to be drug related. Of these, the SAE of calculus urinary was considered by the investigator to be IV drug related. Study intervention continued with no modification and the SAE was resolved after a duration of 5 days. The SAE of drug intolerance was considered by the investigator to be related to oral step-down therapy. Oral step-down therapy was discontinued and IV therapy resumed. Drug intolerance was resolved 23 hours after its onset and the participant completed the study.

## Discontinuations and Interruptions Due to Adverse Events

AEs leading to discontinuation of study intervention were reported for 5 (5.9%) participants in the IMI/REL group and 2 (7.1%) participants in the Active Control group. All of these AEs resolved during the study. AEs leading to discontinuation of IV study intervention were reported in 3 (3.5%) participants in the IMI/REL group (peripheral swelling, rash, and rash erythematous) and none in the Active Control group. Of these, the AEs of rash and rash erythematous were considered by the investigator to be IV drug related.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

No cases of elevated liver enzymes or potential drug-induced liver injury events meeting predefined criteria were reported in the study.

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluation

## Laboratory Values Over Time

The percentage of participants with post-baseline grade increases in laboratory abnormalities during treatment and through the 14-day follow-up period was generally comparable for both intervention groups.

## Vital Signs, Physical Examinations, and Other Observations Related to Safety

No ne of the reported abnormalities in vital signs and physical examination findings were SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation.

## PK results

A table was included with Listing of Individual Plasma Concentrations of IMI/REL Following IV Administration of Concentration-Time Data Imipenem/Cilastatin/Relebactam (IMI/REL) to Participants in Cohorts 1-5. The table is over 100 pages and is not shown here. No summary table was found/ provided.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These data, along with existing paediatric PK data from P020, were used to update the population PK model and calculate the secondary PK endpoints (for REL, plasma exposure [AUC0-24hr], fAUC024hr/MIC, and Ceoi; for imipenem, % fT&gt;MIC, plasma exposure [AUC0- 24hr], and Ceoi), which will be presented in a separate paediatric population PK modelling and simulation report.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The submitted study was a Phase 2/3 randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-site, openlabel study of IMI/REL in paediatric participants from birth to less than 18 years of age with confirmed or suspected gram-negative bacterial infections. Participants with HAP/VAP, cIAI, or cUTI were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive IMI/REL or active control. The study randomised a total of 115 participants.

## Efficacy

Efficacy objectives and endpoints were secondary and descriptive in nature. Treatment with IMI/REL resulted in a numerically comparable effect with the comparative treatment regimens of the respective indications HAP/VAP, cIAI and cUTI and studied cohorts. No concerns related to efficacy are noted.

## Safety

The safety of IMI/REL was generally comparable to comparator regimens. Reported adverse events were in line with the known safety profile when IMI/REL is used in adults. No new safety concerns were noted.

## Pharmacokinetics

The individual plasma concentrations were provided in a very large table, however no summary table was provided. While a summary table (from either NCA or popPK) would have been appreciated. The applicant has stated that the popPK analysis calculating the relevant PK metrics, will be provided in a future type II variation planned for 2025. This is accepted and this issue is therefore not pursued.

## 3. Overall conclusion and recommendation

The MAH submitted the results of a completed paediatric study included in the paediatric investigational plan. No claims or proposals for updating the product information are made in this submission. No major concerns with regards to efficacy and safety were noted. The benefit-risk balance for the approved indications remains favourable.
