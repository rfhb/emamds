Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

On 23 June 2025, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Gardasil 9, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that V503-076, A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of 2-dose Regimens of 9vHPV and mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines Where the First Dose of Each Vaccine Are Given Concomitantly in Boys and Girls 9 to 11 Years of Age is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Commercially available vaccine formulations Gardasil 9 (9vHPV, MSD) and Spikevax (mRNA-1273, Moderna) were used in this clinical trial. Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil 9 contains VLPs of HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. SARS-CoV-2vaccine mRNA-1273 includes mRNA, which encodes S- protein from Wuhan strain.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

· V503-076, A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of 2-dose Regimens of 9vHPV and mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines Where the First Dose of Each Vaccine Are Given Concomitantly in Boys and Girls 9 to 11 Years of Age.

The 9vHPV vaccine (V503) is an aluminum-adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccine prepared from the VLPs of the recombinant major capsid (L1) protein of HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 and was shown to be efficacious clinical studies. The 9vHPV vaccine is currently indicated in many countries for the prevention of cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal and head and neck cancers, and precancerous or dysplastic lesions, genital warts, and infection caused by the 9 HPV types targeted by the vaccine. The 9vHPV vaccine was initially licensed and recommended as a 3-dose vaccination series. It was subsequently approved for a 2-dose regimen in individuals 9 to 14 years of age (the main target population for vaccination) in many countries, including EU.

The Spikevax (mRNA-1273) received CMA in EU in January 2021 of a 2-dose regimen of the mRNA1273 vaccine at the 100μg dose level for persons ≥18 years of age was based on a clinical study (mRNA-1273-P301; NCT04470427), which demonstrated clinical efficacy in preventing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection with an acceptable safety profile. The mRNA-1273 SARSCoV-2 vaccine was studied in children 6 to 11 years of age (mRNA-1273-P204; NCT04796896). The study demonstrated a robust neutralizing antibody response after 2 doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine at the 50μg dose level with a favourable safety profile, which was the basis for authorization for individuals aged 6 to 11 years of age from the European Commission on 02-MAR-2022.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Previous studies (V503-005, V503-007) have demonstrated that the concomitant use of the 9vHPV vaccine with other vaccines (ie, meningococcal, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) routinely administered in this age group was well tolerated and did not interfere with antibody responses to any of the vaccines concomitantly administered. Concomitant administration of vaccines in this age group may help minimize the number of vaccination visits required and improve implementation of vaccination programs.

There are data available for SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines co-administered with other vaccines in adult populations, but to date, no coadministration data for an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has been generated in pediatric populations. At the time of initial authorization for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in the pediatric population in MAY 2021, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) noted the lack of available data and called for studies to generate safety and immunogenicity data on coadministration. Currently, the monovalent COVID-19 mRNA-1273 vaccine that was used in this study is no longer authorized for use in the US, though it remains authorized for use as a 2-dose primary series vaccination in the EU. The originally authorized mRNA-1273 vaccine has been adapted to target the most recent strains of the virus and 4 adapted mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are at the time of this CSR authorized for use in Europe.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study V503-076, A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of 2-dose Regimens of 9vHPV and mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines Where the First Dose of Each Vaccine Are Given Concomitantly in Boys and Girls 9 to 11 Years of Age

## Description

This was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a 2-dose regimen of 9vHPV vaccine, where the first dose was administered concomitantly with a first dose of a 2-dose regimen of mRNA-1273 vaccine versus nonconcomitant administration of 9vHPV and mRNA-1273 vaccines in boys and girls 9 to 11 years of age.

Originally, this study supposed to be hypothesis tested to demonstrate non-inferior immune responses when Gardasil 9 is co-administered with mRNA-1273. It was planned to recruit at least 400 individuals. With protocol amendment nr .3 (15.02.2023), the study became descriptive due to the early closure of enrolment. Therefore, this study was a descriptive study. No hypotheses were tested. The study was designed to enrol approximately 160 participants. Eligible participants were planned to be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the following groups:

· Concomitant Group: Participants were randomly assigned to receive their first dose of 9vHPV vaccine and first dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine on Day 1; they then received their second dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine at Month 1 and their second dose of 9vHPV vaccine at Month 6. Serum for anti-HPV antibodies was collected on Day 1 and Month 7, and serum for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific binding antibody was collected on Day 1 and Month 2.

· Nonconcomitant Group: Participants were randomly assigned to receive their first and second doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine on Day 1 and at Month 1, respectively; they then received their first and second doses of 9vHPV vaccine at Months 2 and 8, respectively. Serum for anti-HPV antibodies was collected on Month 2 and Month 9, and serum for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific binding antibody was collected on Day 1 and Month 2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For both the concomitant and nonconcomitant groups, solicited AEs were collected Day 1 to Day 7 after each vaccination visit, and unsolicited AEs were collected Day 1 to Day 28 after each vaccination visit. SAEs, AESIs, and MAAEs were collected through the duration of participation in the study.

CHMP ' s comment: the study design, objectives and endpoints are acceptable. Co-administration studies are often descriptive.

## Sample size

## Immunogenicity

This is an estimation study. There are no hypotheses to be evaluated. The expected total sample size is approximately 160 participants.

The study planned to enrol approximately 400 participants (200 per group) according to the Study Protocol nr.1 to be able to estimate non-inferior immune response. Given this sample size, the study would have at least 90% power to demonstrate the H1 and H2 hypotheses at an overall Type I error α =0.025 (1-sided). The achieved power corresponding to a sample size of 200 per group assuming all assumptions hold is 99.2%. As the study enrolment was stopped when 160 individuals were recruited, the study became an estimation study instead of the hypothesis tested study.

Sample Size and Power for Safety Analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The probability of observing at least 1 vaccine-related SAE depends on the number of participants vaccinated and the underlying incidence rate in the study population. In this study with 80 participants in each vaccination group, there is ≥0.90 probability of observing at least 1 vaccine-related SAE in a vaccination group if the incidence of a SAE is ≥2.84% (Table 3). If no vaccine-related SAE is observed among the approximately 80 participants in a vaccination group, this study will provide 97.5% confidence that the underlying incidence rate of vaccine-related SAE in that vaccination group is ≤4.51% (10 of every 222 individuals).

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Intervention allocation/randomization occur centrally using an IRT system. There were 2 study intervention arms. Participants were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to the Concomitant Group and Nonconcomitant Group, respectively. This was an open-label study therefore, the Sponsor, investigator, and participant will know the vaccine administered.

The 9-valent HPV cLIA was used as a primary method to evaluate antibodies specific for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 in serum [Roberts, C., et al 2014]. The purpose of the assay is to detect these HPV antibodies before and after vaccination with the 9vHPV vaccine. The testing will be performed by Q Squared Solutions (California, USA). For the 9-valent HPV cLIA, HPV type-specific, yeast-derived VLPs are coupled to 9 distinct Luminex magnetic microspheres. Each VLP-coupled microsphere has its own distinct fluorescent dye that can be recognized by excitation with an infrared laser, allowing for the measurement of antibodies against multiple HPV types from a single test of an individual's serum. HPV type-specific monoclonal antibodies labeled with R-Phycoerythrin compete with an individual's serum antibodies for binding to the neutralizing epitopes of the VLPs. The fluorescent signal from the R-Phycoerythrin-labelled, type-specific monoclonal antibodies is inversely proportional to the anti-HPV antibody concentration of a sample. Antibody concentrations are derived from a standard curve, which is generated using a reference standard made from a pool of serum from individuals immunized against the 9 HPV vaccine types. A standard curve for each HPV vaccine type is calculated using a weighted 4 parameter logistic curve fit. Results are expressed as mMU/mL.

## SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein-specific Binding Antibody Measured by ECL Assay

PPD VSD in Richmond, VA, has developed and validated an ECL Method for the Detection of SARS-CoV2 Spike, Nucleocapsid, and Receptor Binding Domain antibodies in human serum. The assay is based on the Meso-Scale Discovery technology, which employs disposable multispot microtiter plates. The validation study established the assay operating characteristics, evaluated the precision and ruggedness, and assessed the dilutional linearity, selectivity, and relative accuracy of the SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The SARS-CoV-2 ECL assay met the prespecified acceptance criteria and is considered

validated with regard to precision, ruggedness, relative accuracy, dilutional linearity, specificity, and selectivity.

## Statistical Methods

## Immunogenicity Analyses Population

The Per Protocol Immunogenicity (PPI) population served as the primary population for the analysis of immunogenicity relating to 9vHPV vaccination. The PPI population was HPV type-specific. The PPI population consisted of all randomized participants who:

1. Received all vaccinations planned within the context of the study with the correct dose of the 9vHPV vaccine and each vaccination visit has occurred within day ranges acceptable for statistical analysis.
2. Were seronegative by HPV-9 cLIA to the appropriate HPV type pre-9vHPV vaccination.
3. Had evaluable serology results based on serum sample collected within 21 to 49 days Postdose 2 of 9vHPV vaccination.
4. Had no protocol deviations that could interfere with the evaluation of participant's immune response to 9vHPV vaccination.

The mRNA-1273-PP population served as the primary population for the analysis of immunogenicity relating to mRNA-1273 vaccination. This population consisted of all randomized participants who:

5. Had received all vaccinations planned within the context of the study with the correct dose of mRNA-1273 and each vaccination visit has occurred within day ranges acceptable for statistical analysis.
6. Had evaluable serology results based on serum sample collected within 21 to 42 days Postdose 2 of mRNA-1273 vaccine.
7. Had no protocol deviations that could interfere with the evaluation of participant's immune response to mRNA-1273 vaccine.

## Key Immunogenicity Analyses

Evaluation of primary and secondary objectives were performed separately for each immunogenicity parameter. Analysis of variance modelling was used. The response variable was the natural logarithm of the relevant antibody titers and an indicator variable representing the concomitant vaccination group was a fixed effect. Point estimates of the GMTs/GMCs and corresponding within-group 95% CIs as well as geometric mean ratio and corresponding 95% CI of the geometric mean ratio were derived from the estimate of the fixed effect.

## Safety Analysis Population

Safety analyses were based on the APaT population, which included all 162 randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention according to the study intervention they received. This was the treatment group which they were randomized except for participants who received incorrect vaccination regimen for the entire vaccination period; such participants were included in the treatment group corresponding to the vaccination regimen actually received.

## Key Safety Analyses

By-treatment group summaries of safety endpoints were provided in terms of treatment group-specific counts and proportions (or percent) of participants who were cases of particular safety endpoints. CIs of risk difference (difference in percent or proportions), when provided, were calculated using the M&amp;N method.

## Results

## Participant flow

The disposition of participants was similar between the concomitant and nonconcomitant administration groups [Table 4Table 4]. Overall, a total of 165 participants were randomized, 3 participants did not receive study intervention, more than 78% of participants completed the study. The reasons for discontinuing either study intervention were lost to follow-up and withdrawal by parent/guardian.

CHMP ' s comment: the numbers analysed are lower than expected and it creates uncertainty of the magnitude of the seroresponses and AEs.

## Efficacy results

The most common reasons for exclusions from either the PPI and/or PP populations were:

- Participant did not receive 2 -doses of 9vHPV vaccine or mRNA-1273 vaccine
- Participant was missing serum samples or had samples collected out of range following Dose 2 of 9vHPV vaccine or mRNA-1273 vaccine
- Participant received Dose 2 of 9vHPV vaccine or mRNA -1273 vaccine out of range
- Participant was seropositive to a vaccine -targeted HPV type at Day 1 (PPI population only)

Based on the results from this study, the following key immunogenicity results were observed:

- Antibody responses to HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 following 2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine with the first dose concomitantly administered with the first dose of mRNA-1273 are generally similar to responses following 2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine with the first dose administered alone [Table 9]. The point estimates of [concomitant/nonconcomitant] GMT ratios of anti-HPV6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 at 4 weeks following Dose 2 of 9vHPV vaccine ranged from 1.20 to 1.45 depending on the HPV type; the lower bounds of the 95% CIs of the GMT ratios ranged from 0.91 to 1.13.

All (100.0%) PPI-eligible participants contributing to the analysis of immune response following Dose 2 of 9vHPV vaccine seroconverted for each of the 9vHPV vaccine types 4 weeks following Dose 2 of the 9vHPV vaccine in both the concomitant group and nonconcomitant group.

- Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein following 2 doses of mRNA-1273 with the first dose concomitantly administered with the first dose of 9vHPV vaccine is generally similar to the response following 2 doses of mRNA-1273 with the first dose administered alone [Table 10]. The point estimate of [concomitant/nonconcomitant] GMC ratio of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific binding antibody at 4 weeks following Dose 2 of the mRNA-1273 vaccine was 1.17; the associated 95% CI was (0.99, 1.40).

Seroresponse was similar following concomitant (96.4%) and nonconcomitant (95.0%) administration.

## Safety results

- The overall proportion of participants with any AEs following Dose 1 of 9vHPV vaccine and mRNA1273 vaccine was generally similar when 9vHPV vaccine and mRNA-1273 vaccine were administered either concomitantly or nonconcomitantly; most events were mild in intensity.

Reported advcrsc cvcnts includc any advcrsc cvcnts within 28 days of 9vHPV Dosc 1 and mRNA-1273 Dosc I and prior to ncxt vaccination visit, if any.

- The proportion of participants with injection-site AEs 28 days following Dose 1 was generally similar between the concomitant and nonconcomitant groups.
- The proportion of participants with systemic AEs after Dose 1 of mRNA-1273 was generally similar in concomitant and nonconcomitant groups; however, the proportion of participants with solicited systemic AEs after Dose 1 of 9vHPV vaccine was lower when Dose 1 of 9vHPV vaccine was administered nonconcomitantly (16.7%) compared to when Dose 1 of 9vHPV vaccine was administered concomitantly with mRNA-1273 vaccine (33.3%).

This difference was primarily driven by fewer AEs of chills, headache, and nausea following Dose 1 of 9vHPV vaccine alone compared with concomitant administration with mRNA-1273 vaccine (chills 9.9% in the concomitant group; 0% in the nonconcomitant group), headache (22.2% in the concomitant group; 9.7% in the nonconcomitant group), and nausea (7.4% in the concomitant group; 0% in the nonconcomitant group).

- The proportion of participants with a temperature elevation ≥100.0°F (37.8°C) was generally similar when 9vHPV vaccine was administered concomitantly with mRNA 1273 vaccine and nonconcomitantly.
- Few participants reported MAAEs.
- No SAEs, AESIs, or deaths were reported in the study, and no participant discontinued either study vaccine due to AE.

CHMP ' s comment: the Spikevax is more reactogenic than Gardasil 9 and therefore the safety profile of co-administration is similar to the SARS-Cov-2 mRNA vaccine safety profile. This is an expected result. As the sample size was low, the probability to discover rare AEs is low.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The results of V503-076 demonstrated that antibody responses following 2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine are generally similar when the first dose of 9vHPV vaccine is administered concomitantly and nonconcomitantly with the first dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine among boys and girls 9- to 11-years-old. The data in this application is consistent with prior findings, demonstrating robust immunogenicity of the 9vHPV vaccine in young adolescents, including when administered with other concomitant vaccinations.

Concomitant administration of the 9vHPV vaccine with the mRNA-1273 vaccine in girls and boys 9- to 11-years-old was generally well tolerated. The safety profile in this study evaluating concomitant and nonconcomitant administration of the 9vHPV vaccine did not reveal any new findings compared with previous studies of the 9vHPV vaccine. Therefore, there were no safety findings that would indicate any change to the safety profile of the 9vHPV vaccine. The benefit to risk ratio of the 9vHPV vaccine continues to be favourable.

The MAH do not propose any changes to the current EU product information for Gardasil 9 from this estimation study with a small sample size, considering that the originally authorized mRNA-1273 vaccine no longer reflects more recent strains of the virus. Also, there is no routine vaccination against Covid-19 in EU among children and the co-administration of Gardasil with Covid-19 vaccine is unlikely to happen. Only in some rare cases among immunosuppressed population this data may be currently relevant, but in this instance, the clinician can ensure that these vaccinations do not happen simultaneously. Therefore the CHMP agrees now, that no update in SmPC is needed. On the other

hand, we encourage the MAH to publish this study to ensure, that this data will be available for the public. These data are relevant as a description of the interaction between different vaccine platforms. Also, in the future, it may happen, that Sars-Cov-2 epidemiology changes and this information may help clinicians to take the decision about co-administration.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The results of this study indicate no new efficacy or safety concerns but provides new valuable information about co-administration of Gardasil 9 and Spikevax (mRNA-1273, 50 µg). As the data was limited and children in EU are not routinely vaccinated against SARS-Cov-2, this information is not seen as essential to be included in Gardasil 9 PI.
