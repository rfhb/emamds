- 3 μ g RNA/dose of the Tris/Sucrose vaccine product (requires dilution, 0.2 mL administration) for individuals 6 months through 4 years of age, EU MA numbers EU/1/20/1528/010.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Study C4591007 is a randomised, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2/3 paediatric study in healthy children aged 6 months to &lt;12 years of age. For these paediatric groups, the study was designed to evaluate BNT162b2 vaccination in an age-de-escalation Phase 1 dose-finding portion and Phase 2/3 selecteddose portion, in protocol-defined age groups: 5 to &lt;12 years, 2 to &lt;5 years, and 6 months to &lt;2 years of age. Initiation of the study with the oldest paediatric group (5 to &lt;12 years of age) was based on acceptable safety and tolerability demonstrated in adolescents in Study C4591001. The BNT162b2 series was initially planned as a 2-dose series; however, based on emerging clinical and real-world data, the protocol was amended on 04 January 2022 to add a third dose at the selected dose level for each age group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

BNT162b2 10 μ g for children aged 5 to 11 years of age was approved in EU on 25 November 2021. Comirnaty 3 μ g for children aged 6 months to 4 years was approved in EU on 19 October 2022.

A bivalent (original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) booster (30 μ g) dose was granted EUA in the US for individuals ≥12 years of age on 31 August 2022. An EUA for the bivalent booster (10 μ g) in individuals 5 through 11 years of age followed on 12 October 2022. The EUA for the bivalent booster (3 μ g) as the third dose in the primary series (3 doses) in children 6 months to &lt;5 years of age was authorised on 08 December 2022. As of 18 April 2023, the US FDA reissued the EUA for the original/Omicron BA.4/BA.5 bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to be used for all doses administered to individuals 6 months of age and older. In early 2023, the WHO, EMA, and FDA recommended that updated COVID19 vaccines target the XBB.1.5 Omicron subvariant as a monovalent vaccine.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study C4591007 - Children 6 Months to &lt;16 Years of Age: A Phase 1, Open-Label DoseFinding Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity and Phase 2/3 PlaceboControlled, Observer-Blinded Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity Study of a SARS-CoV2 RNA Vaccine Candidate Against COVID-19 in Healthy Children

## Study Design

Study C4591007 was a Phase 1/2/3 study in healthy children.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Phase 1 enrolled 16 participants per dose level in each age group (planned); however, an additional 16 participants per dose level (total 32) were enrolled to receive 10 μ g in the 2 to &lt;5 years of age group. The doses tested and selected in each age group during Phase 1 were:

- 5 to &lt;12 years of age: dose levels 10, 20, 30 μ g - selected dose level 10 μ g
- 2 to &lt;5 years of age: dose levels 3, 10 μ g - selected dose level 3 μ g
- 6 months to &lt;2 years of age: dose level 3 μ g - selected dose level 3 μ g

Phase 2/3 commenced with the selected vaccine dose level for each age group, with participants randomised 2:1 to receive vaccine or placebo at sites in the US, Finland, Poland, and Spain. Brazil enrolled participants 6 months to &lt;5 years of age randomised 2:1 to receive vaccine or placebo.

Phase 2/3 was planned to evaluate BNT162b2 as a 2-dose series given 21 days apart at the selected dose levels for each age group for safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity, and to include supportive efficacy analyses evaluated within or across age groups in which immunobridging is successful, depending on the accrual of a sufficient number of cases in those age groups.

All Phase 2/3 study participants could be unblinded at the 6-month post-Dose 2 follow-up visit. Participants who originally received placebo for the initial 2 doses were offered the opportunity to receive BNT162b2 (at the age-appropriate dose at the time of vaccination) as part of the study.

For participants 6 months to &lt;5 years of age, the study was unblinded in stages. Unblinding completed once all ongoing participants either had been individually unblinded or had concluded their 6-month post-Dose 2 study visit. Due to several waves of enrollment and stages of unblinding, there were different lengths of follow-up time for participants 6 months to &lt;5 years of age (refer to Section 3.7 and Figure 1 for additional information). The study was unblinded in the following sequence.

The participant:

- became EUA age-eligible at 5 years of age
- enrolled prior to protocol amendment 6 (addition of 3 rd  dose as primary series for 6m-&lt;5y)
- enrolled after protocol amendment 6

All remaining participants 6 months to &lt;5 years of age were unblinded after the US FDA issued an EUA (17 June 2022) for BNT162b2 3 μ g as a 3-dose primary series. Placebo participants were eligible to receive BNT162b2 at the age-appropriate dose level in an open- label manner. As enrolment was ongoing at the time of the EUA, participants may have been unblinded prior to the protocol-specified 6month post-Dose 2 period. In all case of unblinding, participants who remained in the study were followed in an open-label manner until the end of the study participation.

## Troponin group

In the troponin group, troponin I assessment at baseline and after vaccination was performed to evaluate whether elevated troponin I levels, potentially indicative of subclinical myocarditis, occurred following vaccination. Samples were analysed using a High Sensitivity Troponin-I assay. An elevated troponin I result was defined as &gt;35 ng/L in male participants and &gt;17 ng/L in female participants. These values were established as the 99th percentile cut-off in male and female individuals, respectively, in a reference range study conducted by the assay manufacturer.

Troponin I Analyses: At Baseline and After Vaccination in Participants ≥5 to &lt;12 Years of Age and ≥12 to &lt;16 Years of Age (Troponin Group).

Troponin I level in participants ≥5 to &lt;12 years of age and ≥12 to &lt;16 years of age in the participants specifically enrolled for this purpose (troponin group) were drawn at baseline and on Day 4 after Dose 2 of vaccine or placebo (if ≥5 to &lt;12 years). As a result of the 2 dose primary series EUA with BNT162b2 10 μg for individuals ≥5 to &lt;12 years, participants were unblinded prior to the 6 months post-Dose 2 visit in this age group. Participants who received placebo crossed over to the BNT162b2 group and did not have an additional blood draw after Dose 2. With the emergence of Omicron and adult clinical trial data showing an improved Omicron response after Dose 3, a third dose was added for all study participants. Collection of a blood sample for troponin I level analysis was included for the troponin group on Day 4 after Dose 3 for participants ≥5 to &lt;12 years of age who originally received active vaccine and for all participants ≥12 to &lt;16 years of age.

In addition to the scheduled testing of troponin I after Dose 2 and Dose 3 in the troponin group participants, potential symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis, protocol-specified AESIs in Study C4591007, were monitored in all participants. Per Section 8.14 of the protocol, specified procedures were to be followed for any study participant who reported acute chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or any other symptom(s) that in the medical opinion of the investigator might be indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis within 4 weeks after a study vaccination.

All participants in the 10 μ g and 30μ g groups received Dose 3 of BNT162b2 and 47.1% of participants in the 20μ g group received Dose 3 of BNT162b2. Of the 16 participants assigned to the 30μ g dose level group at Dose 1, the 4 sentinel participants received 30 μ g at Dose 2. However, due to increased reactogenicity observed at the 30μ g dose level, the remaining 12 participants received 10 μ g at Dose 2 as this dose was selected for Phase 2/3 in this age group. Dose 3 reflects age-appropriate dosing for all Phase 1 participants. The 30μ g dose level was discontinued in the study.

All participants aged 6 months to &lt;2 years of age received Dose 1 and Dose 2 of BNT162b2 3 μ g, and 93.8% received Dose 3. A total of 8 participants (50.0%) completed the study and 8 participants (50.0%) withdrew from the study, with the majority reason due to 'other' (37.5%). One participant (6.3%) each withdrew due to protocol deviation and withdrawal by parent/guardian/participant.

Of participants who originally received placebo and then received BNT162b2, the majority (100.0%, 99.4%, and 83.0%) received crossover Dose 1, 2, and 3 of BNT162b2, respectively. Approximately half of the participants (50.4%) who originally received placebo and then received BNT162b2 after unblinding, completed the study after BNT162b2 vaccination. A total of 626 participants (49.6%) who originally received placebo and then received BNT162b2 after unblinding withdrew from the study for non-safety reasons. Most of these withdrawals were due to withdrawal by parent/guardian/participant (26.6%).

The majority of participants aged 5 to &lt;12 years, who originally received placebo then received BNT162b2 after unblinding received Dose 1 (100.0%), Dose 2 (98.4%) and Dose 3 (86.8%). In participants who originally received placebo and then received BNT162b2 after unblinding, 55 participants (22.6%) withdrew from the study after BNT162b2 vaccination.

The safety population in this age group of the troponin group included a total of 778 (99.2%) of 784 randomised participants. A total of 6 randomised participants (0.8%) did not receive study vaccination and were excluded from the safety population. In the safety population, 518 and 260 participants were in the BNT162b2 group and placebo group, respectively.

Among the participants aged 12 to &lt; 16 years, the majority of participants in the BNT162b2 group received Dose 1 (99.8%), Dose 2 (97.8%) and Dose 3 (89.2%). A total of 443 participants (87.4%) in the BNT162b2 group completed the study. Most of the withdrawals in the BNT162b2 group were due to withdrawal by parent/guardian (7.9%). Two participants withdrew from the study due to pregnancy. Both pregnancies had an onset (153 days and 169 days after Dose 2) that was greater than the protocol-specified window of 28 days after vaccination.

The safety population in this age group of the troponin group included 487 (96.1%) of 507 assigned participants. A total of 20 assigned participants (3.9%) were excluded from the safety population, of whom 1 participant (0.2%) did not receive study vaccination and 19 participants' (3.7%) parent/guardian did not provide acceptable dual parental informed consent required per local regulation.

## Demographics

## Phase 1

In the group 5 to &lt;12 years of age, the majority of participants were White and the median age at vaccination was 6.0 years for participants in the BNT162b2 30/30μ g group and 8.5 years for all other dose level groups.

The overall median follow-up time in this age group from Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 of BNT162b2 to end of study was 20.2 months, 19.2 months, and 9.3 months, respectively.

In the group 2 to &lt;5 years of age that received BNT162b2 3μ g, there were 9 males (56.3%) and 7 females (43.8%) in the safety population. In the BNT162b2 10μ g group, there were 19 males (59.4%) and 13 females (40.6%) in the safety population. Across both groups, the majority of participants were White. The median age at vaccination was 3.0 years in both groups.

The overall median follow-up time in this age group from Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 of BNT162b2 to end of study was 23.1 months, 22.3 months, and 12.5 months, respectively.

In the group 6 months to &lt;2 years of age, there were 10 males (62.5%) and 6 females (37.5%) in the safety population and the majority of participants were White. The median age at vaccination was 15.5 months.

The overall median follow-up time in this age group from Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 of BNT162b2 to end of study was 23.4 months, 22.7 months, and 12.5 months, respectively.

## Phase 2/3

In the group 5 to &lt;12 years of age, the percentage of participants who were baseline positive for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar in the BNT162b2 group (9.5%) and placebo group (9.6%). The median age at vaccination was 8.0 years of age for both groups and the majority of participants were White from USA.

The overall median follow-up time in this age group from Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 of BNT162b2 to end of study was 19.8 months, 19.1 months, and 12.5 months, respectively. The overall median follow-up time from Dose 1 and Dose 2 of placebo to the first dose of open-label BNT162b2 vaccination, withdrawal, or end of study was 3.5 months and 2.8 months, respectively. In participants who originally received placebo and then received BNT162b2, the overall median followup time from Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 of BNT162b2 to end of study was 18.6 months, 18.1 months, and 11.6 months, respectively.

In the group 2 to &lt;5 years of age, the percentage of participants who were baseline positive for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar in the BNT162b2 group (20.0%) and placebo group (20.1%). The median age at vaccination was 3.0 years for both groups and the majority of participants were White from USA.

In the original blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period in this age group, the overall median followup time from Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 of BNT162b2 to end of study was 16.0 months, 15.3 months, and 12.5 months, respectively. The overall median follow-up time from Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 of placebo to the first dose of open-label BNT162b2 vaccination, withdrawal, or end of study was 6.8 months, 6.3 months, and 2.8 months, respectively.

As participants in the placebo group crossed over to receive BNT162b2, limited additional follow-up time accrued for these participants, resulting in the lower median time. In participants who originally received placebo and then received BNT162b2 after unblinding, the overall median follow-up time from

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 of BNT162b2 to end of study was 13.1 months, 12.3 months, and 10.3 months, respectively.

In the group 6 months to &lt;2 years of age, the percentage of participants who were baseline positive for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar in the BNT162b2 group (13.4%) and placebo group (10.4%). The median age at vaccination was 16.0 months for the BNT162b2 group and 15.0 months for the placebo group and the majority of participants were White from USA.

The overall median follow-up time in this age group from Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 of BNT162b2 to end of study was 17.5 months, 16.6 months, and 12.5 months, respectively. The overall median follow-up time from Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 of placebo to the first dose of open-label BNT162b2 vaccination, withdrawal, or end of study was 7.1 months, 6.4 months, and 2.1 months, respectively. As participants in the placebo group crossed over to receive BNT162b2, limited additional follow-up time accrued for these participants, resulting in the lower median time. In participants who originally received placebo and then received BNT162b2, the overall median follow-up time from Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 of BNT162b2 to end of study was 13.1 months, 12.5 months, and 10.5 months, respectively.

## Phase 2/3 Troponin Group

Within the Troponin group aged 5 to &lt;12 years, among the subjects receiving BNT162b2, 51.4% of participants were male and 14.9% of participants had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection ('baseline positive'). In the placebo group, 53.8% of participants were male and 14.2% of participants were baseline positive. The majority of participants in the BNT162b2 and placebo group were not obese and did not have any comorbidities. All participants were from the US, with 10 to 13.1% of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity). In contrast to participants ≥12 to &lt;16 years of age in the troponin group were prevalent, contributing to the lower percentage of baseline positives compared with that in the ≥12 to &lt;16 year s age group.

In the Troponin group aged 12 to &lt;16 years, a total of 55.6% of participants were male. Overall, 88.7% of participants were baseline positive. The majority of participants were from Mexico and of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. In contrast to participants ≥5 to &lt;12 years of age in the troponin group most participants in this age group were enrolled when Omicron sublineage(s) were prevalent, contributing to the higher percentage of baseline positives compared with that in the ≥5 to &lt;12 year s of age group. The majority of participants were not obese and did not have any comorbidities.

## Results

## Efficacy results

## Phase 1 - Confirmed COVID-19 Occurrences

## Participants 5 to &lt;12 Years of Age

In the Dose 1 all-available efficacy population, 17 participants reported at least 1 occurrence of COVID19. Of these 17 participants, 5 participants were assigned to BNT162b2 10 μ g, 7 participants were assigned to BNT162b2 20 μ g, and 5 participants were assigned to BNT162b2 30 μ g. One participant assigned to BNT162b2 20 μ g reported multiple COVID-19 occurrences, with the first occurrence after Dose 2 and the second occurrence after Dose 3.

## Participants 2 to &lt;5 Years of Age

In the Dose 1 all-available efficacy population, 8 participants reported at least 1 occurrence of COVID19. Of these 8 participants, 2 participants were assigned to BNT162b2 3 μ g, 4 participants were assigned to BNT162b2 10 μ g, and 2 participants were assigned to BNT162b2 30 μ g. No participants reported multiple occurrences of COVID-19.

## Participants 6 Months to &lt;2 Years of Age

In the Dose 1 all-available efficacy population, 4 participants assigned to BNT162b2 3 μ g reported at least 1 occurrence of COVID-19. No participants reported multiple occurrences of COVID-19.

## Phase 1 - Severe COVID-19 Illness and MIS-C

There were no participants in any age group that met 1 or more severe COVID-19 illness criteria. No cases of MIS-C were reported.

## Phase 2/3 - Selected Dose Portion - COVID-19 Incidence

This section presents results of analyses for participants 5 to &lt;12 years of age, 2 to &lt;5 years of age, and 6 months to &lt;2 years of age, for the following protocol exploratory objective

- COVID-19 incidence per 1000 person-years of follow-up through the entire study follow- up period in participants who received BNT162b2 at initial randomization or subsequently

## 5 Years to &lt;12 Years of Age

In the Dose 1 all-available efficacy population, the IR of first COVID-19 occurrence after vaccination from 07 June 2021 to 30 September 2021, when Delta variant was the predominant strain, was 11.691 and 88.804 per 1000 person-years of follow up in the original BNT162b2 10μ g group and original placebo prior to crossover group, respectively. The substantially lower IR in the BNT162b2 group comparing to the placebo group was consistent with the high VE in the blinded placebo-controlled period reported previously.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the transition of the Delta variant to Omicron variant in late 2021 to early 2022, a large increase in IR was observed for all groups. To note, with EUA issued on 29 October 2021 for this age group, study participants were offered to be unblinded and placebo participants started to receive BNT162b2. The majority of placebo participants completed the switch to BNT162b2 by 01 January 2022, with very limited placebo-controlled surveillance afterwards.

Table 10: Cumulative incidence curves for the first COVID-19 occurrence after vaccination - Phase 2/3 - selected dose portion -5 to &lt;12 years of age - dose 1 all available efficacy population

<!-- image -->

## 2 to &lt;5 Years of Age

In the Dose 1 all-available efficacy population, the IR of first COVID-19 occurrence after vaccination from 21 June 2021 to 30 September 2021 after vaccination, when Delta variant was the predominant strain, was 38.084 and 41.155, per 1000 person-years of follow up in the original BNT162b2 3μ g group and original placebo prior to crossover group, respectively. During the transition of the Delta variant to Omicron variant in late 2021 to early 2022, large increase in IR was observed for all groups.

## 6 Months to &lt;2 Years of Age

In the Dose 1 all-available efficacy population, the IR of first COVID-19 occurrence after vaccination from 21 June 2021 to 30 September 2021, when Delta variant was the predominant strain, was 0 and 55.937 per 1000 person-years of follow up in the original BNT162b2 3μ g group and original placebo prior to crossover group, respectively. During the transition of the Delta variant to Omicron variant in late 2021 to early 2022, large increase in IR was observed for all groups.

## Phase 2/3 - Selected Dose Portion -Severe COVID-19 Illness and MIS-C

This section presents Phase 2/3 severe COVID-19 occurrences and MIS-C from Dose 1 through end of the study. No cases of MIS-C were reported in Phase 2/3.

## 5 Years to &lt;12 Years of Age

Fifteen participants had COVID-19 that met 1 or more severe illness criteria. Criteria for severe illness were fulfilled for 13 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 2 occurrences in the placebo group (noting 2:1 randomization and significantly shortened surveillance period for placebo group due to unblinding and crossover). All occurrences in the placebo group met protocol-defined severe illness criteria. In the BNT162b2 group, 10 occurrences met protocol-defined severe illness criteria, 1 case met CDC-defined severe illness criteria, and 2 cases met both severe illness criteria.

## 2 to &lt;5 Years of Age

Thirteen participants had COVID-19 that met 1 or more severe illness criteria. Criteria for severe illness were fulfilled for 9 occurrences in the BNT162b2 group and 4 occurrences in the placebo group (noting 2:1 randomization and significantly shortened surveillance period for placebo group due to unblinding and crossover). One occurrence in the BNT162b2 group met both severe illness criteria. All other occurrences across BNT162b2 and placebo groups met a single protocol-defined criterion for severe illness.

## 6 Months to &lt;2 Years of Age

Seven participants had COVID-19 that met 1 or more severe illness criteria. Criteria for severe illness were fulfilled for 6 occurrences in the BNT162b2 group and 1 occurrence in the placebo group (noting 2:1 randomization and significantly shortened surveillance period for placebo group due to unblinding and crossover). No participants with occurrences meeting severe criteria had evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2. Two occurrences in the BNT162b2 group met both criteria for severe illness, and all other occurrences met a single protocol-defined criterion for severe illness.

## Phase 2/3 - Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Analysis (PBMC) Subset - 10 to &lt;12 Years of Age

Blood samples were obtained prior to Dose 1, at 7 days and 6 months after Dose 2, and prior to and 1 month after Dose 3 from 55 participants ≥10 to &lt;12 years of age for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs). The analysis included the frequency of T-cell specific responses to epitopes (amino acid 1-643) in the spike protein S1 subunit of the wild-type virus.

Frequencies of CD4+ T cells secreting interferon gamma in response to S1 peptide stimulation increased 7 days after Dose 1 and 1 month after Dose 2 for some participants.

Frequencies of CD8+ T cells secreting interferon gamma in response to S1 stimulation increased 7 days after Dose 1. The geometric mean interferon gamma responses in CD8. T cells remained relatively unchanged for the rest of the sampling period.

## Safety results

The local and systemic reactions as well as AEs and SAEs for the phase I/II/III have already been presented in previous reports (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0138, EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0160 and EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0203) and therefore not included here. The main safety focus in this report includes safety data for the Troponin group. Furthermore, MIS-C cases are also a target for this report.

## Participants 6 Months to &lt; 2 Years of Age

During the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period from Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 2 or prior to Dose 3, 24 participants (1.7%) in the BNT162b2 3μ g group and 17 participants (2.4%) in the placebo group reported at least 1 SAE.

During the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period from Dose 3 to 6 months after Dose 3, 1 participant (0.1%) in the BNT162b2 3μ g group reported an SAE of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis.

Figure 8 : Local reactions, by maximum severity, within 7 days after each dose (E -diary only) - phase 2/3 - Troponin group - 5 to &lt;12 years of age - safety population

In the BNT162b2 group, most local reactions were mild or moderate. Two participants (0.5%) reported severe local reactions of pain at the injection site after Dose 3. In the placebo group, 1 participant (0.4%) reported a severe local reaction of redness after Dose 1. No Grade 4 local reactions were reported after any dose in either group.

Median time to onset for any local reaction after receiving any dose of BNT162b2 occurred on Day 1.0 and also occurred on Day 1.0 after receiving Doses 1 and 2 of placebo. All local reactions resolved with a median duration of 1.0 to 2.0 days after any dose of BNT162b2 10 μ g and with a median duration of 1.0 day after Dose 1 and 1.0 to 1.5 days after Dose 2 of placebo.

Figure 9 : Systematic events, by maximum severity, within 7 days after each dose (E -diary only) phase 2/3 - Troponin group - 5 to &lt;12 years of age - safety population

In both groups, the majority of systemic events were mild or moderate. After any dose in the BNT162b2 10μ g group, severe cases of headache (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), chills (0.4%), and diarrhea (0.2%) were reported infrequently. After any dose in the placebo group, 2 participants (0.8%) reported severe cases of fatigue. No Grade 4 systemic events were reported after any dose. After any dose, 43 participants (8.3%) in the BNT162b2 10μ g group and 8 participants (3.1%) in the placebo group reported fever ≥38.0° C. Of the 43 participants in the BNT162b2 group, 20 participants (3.9%) reported fevers ≥38.0°C to 38.4°C, 14 participants (2.7%) reported fevers &gt; 38.4°C to 38.9°C, and 9 participants (1.7%) reported fevers &gt; 38.9°C to 40.0°C. No participants reported fever &gt;40°C. Antipyretic or pain medication use after any dose was reported by 199 participants (38.5%) and 31 participants (11.9%) in the BNT162b2 10μ g group and placebo group, respectively. Median time to onset for any systemic event after Dose 1 of BNT162b2 10 μ g occurred on Day 1.0, while median time to onset for any systemic event after Dose 2 and Dose 3 occurred on Day 2.0. Median time to onset for any systemic event after Dose 1 of placebo occurred on Day 2.0 and on Day 1.0 for Dose 2. All events resolved with a median duration of 1.0 day after any dose of BNT162b2. All events resolved with a median duration of 1.0 day after Dose 1 or Dose 2 of placebo, except for fever, which resolved with a median duration of 2.0 days after Dose 1.

Note that participants who originally received placebo and then received BNT162b2 after unblinding did not complete a reactogenicity e-diary after BNT162b2 vaccination as, per protocol, local reactions and systemic events were reported as AEs.

The SOC containing the most frequently reported AEs in both the BNT162b2 group and placebo group was infections and infestations (2.5% and 2.7%, respectively), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (1.4% and 2.3%, respectively), general disorders and administration site conditions (1.9% and 0.8%, respectively), and gastrointestinal disorders (1.0% and 1.2%, respectively). One participant (0.2%) in the BNT162b2 group reported noncardiac chest pain.

From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2, 61 participants (25.1%) who originally received placebo and then received BNT162b2 after unblinding reported any AE. The SOC containing the most frequently reported AEs was general disorders and administration site conditions (19.3%), infections and infestations (3.7%), nervous system disorders (3.3%), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (2.5%), and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (1.6%). One participant (0.4%) each reported chest pain and noncardiac chest pain. Many of the AEs were reflective of reactogenicity events that were reported as AEs (eg, injection site pain, fatigue, headache).

From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, the percentage of participants reporting any AE was 11.5% in the original BNT162b2 group and 15.3% in the original placebo/BNT162b2 group. The higher percentage of any AE reported in the original placebo/BNT162b2 group is due to these participants having their reactogenicity events reported as AEs. The percentage of participants reporting any AEs assessed as related to study intervention by the investigator was 4.5% in the original BNT162b2 group and 10.4% in the original placebo/BNT162b2 group. All related AEs were nonserious. One participant

(0.2%) in the original BNT162b2 group and 1 participant (0.5%) in the original placebo/BNT162b2 group reported a nonserious, severe AE. No SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, life-threatening AEs, or deaths were reported in either the original BNT162b2 group or the original placebo/BNT162b2 group during this time period.

The SOCs containing the most frequently reported AEs in the original BNT162b2 and original placebo/BNT162b2 group were general disorders and administration site conditions (4.1% and 9.9%, respectively), infections and infestations (3.8% and 3.5%, respectively), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (1.9% and 2.0%, respectively), and gastrointestinal disorders (1.7% and 1.0%, respectively).

Many of the AEs were reflective of reactogenicity events that were reported as AEs (eg, injection site pain, fatigue, headache

## Related AEs

During the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period, from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2, AEs assessed as related to study intervention by the investigator were reported by 12 participants (2.3%) and 4 participants (1.5%) in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups, respectively. These AEs were all nonserious.

Most related AEs reported by participants in the BNT162b2 group were reactogenicity events in the general disorders and administration site conditions SOC (1.5%) and the most commonly reported PT in this SOC was injection site pain (1.0%). One participant (0.2%) reported noncardiac chest pain. Related AEs (injection site rash, vomiting, syncope, insomnia, and oropharyngeal pain) in the placebo group were reported by 1 participant (0.4%) each.

From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, AEs assessed as related to study intervention by the investigator were reported by 19 participants (4.5%) and 21 participants (10.4%) in the original BNT162b2 group and original placebo/BNT162b2 group, respectively. These AEs were all nonserious. Most related AEs reported by participants in the original BNT162b2 group and in the original placebo/BNT162b2 group were reactogenicity events in the general disorders and administration site conditions SOC (3.1% and 9.9%, respectively). The most commonly reported PT in this SOC in the original BNT162b2 group and original placebo/BNT162b2 group was injection site pain (1.7% and 8.4%, respectively).

## Immediate AEs

Five participants (1.0%) in the BNT162b2 group and 1 participant (0.4%) in the placebo group reported any immediate adverse events (Table 14.100).

## Deaths

No deaths were reported in participants 12 to &lt;16 years of age in the troponin group during the study.

## Serious Adverse Events

## Serious Adverse Events from Dose 1 to 6 Months After Dose 2 (Prior to Dose 3)

From Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 2 (prior to Dose 3), 1 participant (0.2%) each reported an SAE of abortion spontaneous and ovarian cyst. The spontaneous abortion occurred in a participant who developed worsening abdominal pain and underwent an abdominal ultrasound 187 days after vaccination, which confirmed pregnancy at approximately 8 weeks' gestation. On postvaccination Day 193, the participant experienced vaginal hemorrhage, vomiting, and diarrhea for which the participant was evaluated in the emergency department. The participant was diagnosed with 'latent abortion' and received treatment with progesterone. The following day, a repeat ultrasound was performed which demonstrated absence of product in the uterus and uterine aspiration was performed. The participant recovered the same day. This spontaneous abortion was assessed as not related to study intervention.

## Serious Adverse Events from Dose 3 to 6 Months After Dose 3

From Dose 3 to 6 months after Dose 3, no participants reported an SAE.

## Elevated Troponin I Level At Baseline and After Vaccination - Troponin Group - 12 to &lt;16 Years of Age

At baseline, a total of 2 male participants (0.4%) (95% CI: 0.0, 1.5) had an abnormal troponin I value range of &gt;50 to 100 ng/mL (Table 50), with no further abnormal troponin I levels.

At Day 4 after Dose 2, a total of 2 participants (0.4%) (95% CI: 0.1, 1.5) had an abnormal troponin I result: one male participant with a troponin value range of &gt;35 to 50 ng/mL, and 1 female participant (0.5%) (95% CI: 0.0, 2.6) with a troponin value range of &gt;17 to 35 ng/mL (Table 50). Neither participant had abnormal troponin I levels at baseline or at the after Dose 3 visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At Day 4 after Dose 3, a total of 3 participants (0.7%) (95% CI: 0.1, 2.1) had an abnormal troponin I result: two male participants and 1 female participant (Table 50). One male participant had a troponin value range of &gt;35 to 50 ng/mL, and the other male participant had a troponin value range of &gt;50 to 100 ng/mL. The female participant had a troponin value range of &gt;35 to 50 ng/mL. None of these participants had abnormal troponin I levels at baseline or at the after Dose 2 visit. No participant in the troponin group with elevated troponin I levels at baseline or after study vaccination reported symptoms of potential myocarditis/pericarditis.

## Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children

No cases of MIS-C were reported in any of the Phase I/II/III study.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

This is the final report for the Phase 1/2/3 study C4591007, which is a randomised, placebo-controlled, study in healthy children aged 6 months to &lt;12 years of age. For these paediatric groups, the study was designed to evaluate BNT162b2 vaccination in an age-de-escalation Phase 1 dose-finding portion and Phase 2/3 selected-dose portion, in protocol-defined age groups: 5 to &lt;12 years, 2 to &lt;5 years, and 6 months to &lt;2 years of age. Initiation of the study with the oldest paediatric group (5 to &lt;12 years of age) was based on acceptable safety and tolerability demonstrated in adolescents in Study C4591001. The BNT162b2 series was initially planned as a 2-dose series; however, based on emerging clinical and real-world data, the protocol was amended on 04 January 2022 to add a third dose at the selected dose level for each age group.

BNT162b2 were administered at the following dose levels: 5 to &lt;12 years of age (10 μ g), 2 to &lt;5 years of age (3 μ g) and 6 months to &lt;2 years of age (3 μ g).

Interim data from this study has previously been presented and assessed in EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0138, EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0160 and EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0203.

## Efficacy

The incidence rate of COVID-19 was monitored for approximately one year post dose 3. During this period, the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 strains changed drastically. Breakthrough cases started to appear during the Delta strain wave. The high vaccine efficacy, which was recorded earlier, (7 days to 2 months post last dose) in placebo-controlled settings, vanished later on, when Omicron strains became prevalent. The incidence rate (IR) increase was observed in all study arms in all studied age groups. Also, severe cases appeared in all study arms, but no MIS-C case was reported. Interestingly, among children below 5 years, who received 3 doses of 3 µg Original Comirnaty, the IR was lower in the cross-over arm than in original active arm, showing, that recent vaccination protected better than vaccination with the same vaccine longer time ago. This observation shows the importance of the level of circulating antibodies, which is constantly decreasing with time since vaccination.

Exploratory PBMC analysis revealed that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells stimulated with S1 peptide responded with interferon gamma, IL2 and IL4 secretion in some vaccinated subjects, whereas such secretion was not observed in placebo recipients. This data supports the mechanism of action for Comirnaty as some T cell mediated immunity is also recorded besides of the B cell and neutralising antibody mediated immunity.

The data provided do not raise new concerns and are in agreement with other data.

## Safety

The local and systemic reactions as well as adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) for the phase I/II/III have already been presented in previous reports (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0138, EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0160 and EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0203) and therefore not included here.

Among the participants aged 6 months to &lt;2 years of age, any AEs were reported at a frequency of 1.7% in the vaccine group and by 2.4% in the placebo group.

The main safety focus in this report includes safety data for the Troponin group. Among the 778 participants aged 5 to &lt;12 years of age (518 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 260 participants in the placebo group) pain at injection site was the most commonly reported local reaction at all three doses of vaccine (67-73%). The most reported systemic events for all three doses of vaccine were fatigue (37-39%) followed by headache (24-30%) and muscle pain (12-19%). Fever was reported

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

among 1-3% of the subjects in the vaccine group. Most of the local and systemic events were mild to moderate at intensity and resolved within 1-2 days.

Up to one month after dose 2, any AEs were reported in 7,1% of the subjects in the vaccine group and in 8,1% of the subjects in the placebo group. The system organ class (SOC) containing the most frequently reported AEs in both the vaccine group and placebo group was infections and infestations (2.5% and 2.7%, respectively). Most related AEs reported in the vaccine group were reactogenicity events in the general disorders and administration site conditions SOC (1.5%) and the most commonly reported PT in this SOC was injection site pain (1.0%). One participant (0.2%) reported noncardiac chest pain.

From dose 3 to 1 month after dose 3, the percentage of participants reporting any AE was 11.5% in the original vaccine group and 15.3% in the original placebo and then switched to the vaccine group. The higher percentage of any AE reported in the original the last group is explained by these participants having their reactogenicity events reported as AEs. The AEs considered related to vaccination were reported by 19 participants (4.5%) and 21 participants (10.4%) in the original vaccine group and original placebo/vaccine group, respectively. These AEs were all nonserious. The most commonly reported preferred term (PT) in this SOC in the original vaccine group and original placebo/vaccine group was injection site pain (1.7% and 8.4%, respectively).

Two male participants had abnormal troponin I values at baseline (&gt;50-100 ng/L), at day 4 after dose 2 one male reported &gt;35-50 ng/L and one female&gt;17-34 ng/L. At day 4 after dose 3 one male and one female reported &gt;35-50 ng/L, and one male reported a troponin I level of &gt;35-50 ng/L. No participants reported levels &gt;100 or &gt;200 ng/L. No participant in the troponin group with elevated troponin I levels at baseline or after study vaccination reported symptoms of potential myocarditis/pericarditis.

MIS-C cases are also a target for this report; however, no such cases were reported in this study.

The presented safety data are in line with previous reported results. No new safety concern was identified in this report.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The efficacy data provided are in agreement with other available data. among children below 5 years, who received 3 doses of 3 µg Original Comirnaty, the IR was lower in the cross-over arm than in original active arm, showing, that recent vaccination protected better than vaccination with the same vaccine longer time ago. This observation shows the importance of the level of circulating antibodies, which is constantly decreasing with time since vaccination.

The presented safety data are in line with previous reported results. No new safety concern was identified.
