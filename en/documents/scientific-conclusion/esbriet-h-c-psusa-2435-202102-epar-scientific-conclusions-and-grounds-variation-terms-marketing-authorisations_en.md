## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pirfenidone, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of the available data on from post-marketing reports the PRAC considers a causal relationship between Stevens Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis and pirfenidone is considered at least a  reasonable  possibility.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product  information  of  products  containing pirfenidone should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pirfenidone the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pirfenidone is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
