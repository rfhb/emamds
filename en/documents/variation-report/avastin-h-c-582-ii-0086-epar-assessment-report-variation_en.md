## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Lung cancer has been among the most common cancers in the world for several decades. The 2012 worldwide estimates of cancer incidence and mortality by GLOBOCAN, indicate a total of 1.8 million new lung cancer cases and 1.6 million lung cancer related deaths, accounting for 13.0% of all cancer cases (except non-melanoma skin cancers) and 19.4% of all cancer deaths (except non-melanoma skin cancers). Furthermore, lung cancer incidence rates were two-fold higher in males compared to females (1,241,601 and 583,100, respectively). In 2013, the estimated number of lung cancer related deaths is 159,480 in the United States (Siegel et al 2013) and 269,610 in the European Union (Malvezzi et al 2013).

The two most prevalent sub-types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, which is frequently further subdivided into non-squamous carcinoma (including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other cell types) and squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma accounting for approximately 15% to 25% of all NSCLC (~230,000 to 380,000 cases) (Brambilla et al, WHO 2014 and Schrump et al, Principles and Practice of Oncology 2011).

Adenocarcinoma (40% of lung cancers) is the most common type of lung cancer, and is also the most frequently occurring in non-smokers as reported in United States (US) data (American Cancer Society 2013).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

NSCLC is associated with high mortality rates as &gt;70% of the patients are diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease (Molina et al 2008) [stages III and IV according to the American joint committee on cancer staging (AJCC)].

In NSCLC, the first oncogenic driver mutations that were amenable to anti-cancer treatment were 'activating' mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Lynch et al. 2004; Paez et al. 2004). The incidence of activating EGFR mutated NSCLC is approximately 40% in East Asian populations and approximately 10% in Western populations (Mansuet-Lupo et al. 2014).

According to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, first-line treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib, should be prescribed to patients with tumours bearing an activating (sensitising) mutation.

## About the product

Avastin contains bevacizumab, a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody which bind to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the key driver of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and thereby inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors, Flt 1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2), on the surface of endothelial cells. Neutralising the biological activity of VEGF regresses the vascularisation of tumours, normalises remaining tumour vasculature, and inhibits the formation of new tumour vasculature, thereby inhibiting tumour growth.

Avastin was initially authorised in the EU on 12 January 2005 for the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. It is currently approved in combination with other medicines to treat metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum (mCRC), metastatic breast cancer (mBC), Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), advanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC), epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal cancer and metastatic carcinoma of the cervix (see SmPC section 4.1 for full detailed indications).

As part of the present variation, the applicant applied for the following indication:

Bevacizumab, in combination with erlotinib, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activating mutations.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Bevacizumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not to be a significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2 1 *), the ERA of bevacizumab   may consist of a justification for not submitting any ERA studies as proteins  are not expected to pose a significant risk to the environment.

In the current application IMS Health marketing data for Europe for the period 2004-2014 was used to refine the predicted environmental concentration in surface water (PECsw) for Tarceva. In terms of absolute values, the average European PECsw for Tarceva had the highest value at 0.00212 μg/l in 2010 and the highest maximum single-country PECsw is 0.00451 μg/l (Luxembourg). Thus, all usebased surface water PECs for Tarceva during the past decade, are well below the action limit of 0.01 μg/l. These PECs were derived without factoring in human metabolism or sewage works removal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the ERA submitted by the Applicant in 2010, erlotinib is not readily or inherently biodegradable. Further, in sediment/water systems it is only removed through formation of NERs (NonExtractable Bound Residues), and not through biodegradation. Adsorption during sewage treatment is not sufficiently high to make a significant transfer to the soil compartment likely through landspreading of surplus sludge.

Erlotinib showed limited chronic toxicity to the surface water model organisms algae, daphnia and fish, with the lowest NOEC (No Observed Effect Concentration) of these three organism groups being 0.52 mg/l for fish; hence, the surface water PNEC (Predicted No Effect Concentration) is 52 μg/l. Similarly, erlotinib was not highly toxic to sediment-dwelling midge larvae, oligochaetes or nematodes, with the lowest organic carbon corrected chronic sediment NOEC of 250 mg/kg. Lastly, erlotinib was not toxic to activated sludge micro-organisms with a NOEC of 1000 mg/l nominal concentration.

Erlotinib is not considered to be a persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substance as it does not fulfil the Bioaccumulation criterion (BCF &lt;2000). It is, however, persistent due to its non inherent biodegradability and a whole system DT50 of 86 days. Erlotinb is also toxic according to the CMR classification as it causes mammalian embryolethality, however it is not toxic based on chronic aquatic ecotoxicity.

No new environmental fate and effect studies have been submitted for Tarceva in the current application.

## 2.2.2. Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects

According to the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2 1 *), in the case of products containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA justifying the lack of ERA studies may be submitted.  As bevacizumab is a protein (monoclonal antibody) the lack of ERA studies is acceptable.

The PECsw value for elotinib was below the action limit of 0.01 μg/l and thus a Phase II ERA was not required. The Applicant has nevertheless submitted chronic toxicity tests with algae (OECD 201), daphnia (OECD 211) and fish (OECD 210).  All risk PEC/PNEC characterisation ratios are well below 1. Therefore, no significant risks to the environmental compartments of concern (sewage treatment plants, surface water, groundwater and sediment) have been identified. In addition, erlotinib is not considered a PBT substance.

With regard to erlotinib, the applied indication does not represent an expansion of the patient population in comparison to the already approved indication for erlotinib. The use of erlotinib is therefore not expected to increase significantly.

In conclusion the use of bevacizumab in combination with erlotinib, in this extension of indication of Avastin, is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

No specific pharmacokinetics (PK) studies were conducted to support this application.

The  MAH  submitted  a  list  of  all  available  studies  providing  PK  and  PK-drug  drug  interaction  for bevacizumab however three studies pertinent to the current application are summarised below.

- Study JO19907: Phase II study of first-line carboplatin-paclitaxel (CP) with or without bevacizumab in Japanese patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC (Niho et al 2012).

After stratification for disease stage, performance status, and gender, patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 3-weekly (q3w) cycles of 15 mg/kg intravenous (IV) bevacizumab with 200 mg/m 2  paclitaxel and area under the curve (AUC) + 6 mg/mL/min (AUC6) carboplatin (bevacizumab + CP) or CP alone.

The  study  was  conducted  in  two  steps.  Step  1  was  performed  to  evaluate  the  tolerability  of bevacizumab + CP in Japanese patients. In Step 2, eligible patients were randomly assigned to the two treatment arms. Serum samples for bevacizumab concentrations were collected at different time points from patients in the bevacizumab + CP treatment arms.

PK  parameters  for  bevacizumab  were  assessed  in  51  Japanese  patients  with  non-squamous  NSCLC who received bevacizumab + CP. PK analyses showed that bevacizumab had a mean CL of 2.92 ± 0.56 mL/day/kg, a mean half-life of 11.3 ± 2.1 days, mean V1 of 46.51 ± 6.79 mL/kg, a mean AUCinf of 5,314 ± 1,013 μg · day/mL and a mean residence time (MRT) of 16.3 ± 3.0 days.

## -  Study  NCT00043823  (OSI2486S):  Phase  I/II  study  evaluating  bevacizumab  in  combination  with erlotinib for patients with recurrent NSCLC (Herbst et al. 2005)

This  was  a  single-arm  trial  carried  out  at  two  centres  in  the  United  States  that  investigated  the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of combining bevacizumab (7.5 or 15 mg/kg q3w) with erlotinib (100 or 150 mg orally [po] daily [qd]) in patients with non-squamous NSCLC (Stage IIIB/IV) who were previously treated with ≥ 1 chemotherapy regimen. Patients were not selected on the basis of EGFR mutation status.

In Phase I of the study, 3 patients were treated in each of the first two cohorts (Cohort 1, 7.5 mg/kg bevacizumab q3w with 100 mg erlotinib po qd; Cohort 2, 15 mg/kg bevacizumab q3w with 100 mg erlotinib  po  qd);  6  patients  were  treated  in  Cohort  3  (15  mg/kg  bevacizumab  q3w  with  150  mg erlotinib  po  qd).  In  the  absence  of  dose-limiting  toxicities,  Phase  II  of  the  study  was  expanded  to include an additional 28 patients in Cohort 3, ensuring that 34 patients were treated at the protocoldefined Phase II dose established in Phase I (15 mg/kg bevacizumab q3w and 150 mg/day erlotinib). Plasma samples for erlotinib concentrations and serum samples for bevacizumab concentrations were collected at different time points.

Cmax  was  achieved  approximately  4  hours  after  oral  administration  of  both  100  and  150  mg  daily erlotinib.  Cmax  and  AUC0-24  increased  with  dose.  The  AUC0-24  for  150  mg  daily  erlotinib  was  26% higher than for the 100 mg dose. Plasma clearance values were comparable for 100 and 150 mg/d erlotinib (173 ± 200 L/d vs 184 ± 130 L/d); elimination half-life (t½) values were 1.25 and 0.92 days, respectively.  Minimum  steady-state  concentration  (Css  min)  measured  from  days  8  to  147  was  also similar for each dose.

For Bevacizumab, the mean terminal half-life (t½) was 22.1 ± 14 days; the AUC0-N was 5.0 ± 2.0 day · μg/mL. The clearance (CL), volume of distribution of the central compartment (Vc), and steady state volume  of  distribution  (Vss)  were  3.2  ±  1.0  mL/kg/d,  36.8  ±  7.9  mL/kg,  and  77.4  ±  25  mL/kg, respectively.  The  Cmax  was  396  ±  76  μg/mL  which  increased  to  517  ±  82  μg/mL  on  day  64  after

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

multiple dosing.

Study OSI3364G (BETALUNG): Phase III, study evaluating the efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with erlotinib compared with erlotinib alone for treatment of advanced NSCLC after failure of standard first-line chemotherapy

This  was  a  multicentre,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind,  randomized  Phase  III  study.  Patients  with advanced  NSCLC  who  had  experienced  clinical  or  radiographic  progression  during  or  after  standard first-line  chemotherapy  or  chemoradiotherapy  were  randomized  to  receive  150  mg/day  erlotinib  po plus  placebo,  or  150  mg/day  erlotinib  +  15  mg/kg  bevacizumab  q3w,  until  disease  progression  or unmanageable toxicity. Plasma samples for erlotinib concentrations and serum samples for bevacizumab concentrations were collected at different time points.

The  PK  substudy  did  not  meet  its  prespecified  patient  enrolment  goal  of  at  least  17  PK-evaluable patients  in  each  treatment  group.  Although  17  patients  in  each  arm  were  enrolled  into  the  PK substudy,  only  12  patients  in  the  erlotinib  +  placebo  group  and  10  patients  in  the  erlotinib  + bevacizumab groups were evaluable for PK.

The average (CV%) peak concentration of erlotinib in the presence and absence of bevacizumab was 1491 ng/mL (53%) and 1890 ng/mL (45%), respectively. The average Tmax was 5.2 and 3.5 hours and the  average  AUC  was  23.4  and  31.5  hr  ·  μg/mL  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  bevacizumab, respectively. Overall, erlotinib in combination with bevacizumab had a lower Cmax, a later Tmax, and a lower overall exposure compared with erlotinib with placebo.

Trough concentrations (Ctrough) for bevacizumab were similar to the observed Ctrough values measured in previous bevacizumab PK studies that used the same dosing regimen (e.g., Study AVF0757g), and were also similar to Ctrough values predicted using simulations from population PK modeling (Lu et al. 2008).

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The  PK  of  Bv  have  been  extensively  characterized  in  multiple  clinical  studies  with  doses  from  1  to 20 mg/kg administered at a frequency ranging from weekly to q3w in patients with various tumour types including NSCLC.

There are no mechanistic reasons that suggest EGFR mutation status would affect the PK of Bv, and so no  studies  have  been  performed  to  address  this.  Because  the  clearance  mechanism  of  Bv  is  not considered  to  be  associated  with  the  EGFR  mutation  status  of  patients'  tumours,  the  PK  of  Bv  in patients with activating EGFRmut + NSCLC is expected to be consistent with the PK described by PopPK modelling.

These findings support the Bv dosing strategy proposed for patients with activating EGFRmut+ NSCLC, in which Bv is administered based on body weight-adjusted dose (15 mg/kg) q3w.

The PK of Erl has also been extensively characterized and thus not further addressed in this document.

## Exploration of Influence of Racial/Ethnic Factors

Data from two studies in Caucasians and Japanese patients; JO19907 and JO16564 (Yamamoto et al. 2008),  support  the  similarity  in  exposure  for  both  Bv  and  Erl  across  racial/ethnic  groups.  Overall findings from Study JO19907 suggested that the PK of Bv in Japanese patients appeared similar to that reported in predominantly Caucasian patients treated with Bv + CP in Study AVF0757g (see EPAR for variation EMEA/H/C/582/II/09). Study JO16564 characterized the PK of Erl in Japanese patients and the results demonstrated that the Erl PK profile in Japanese patients to be similar to that observed in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Caucasian patients.

So far there has not been any indication of a treatment difference as function of ethnicity. With regard to erlotinib, the activating mutation is the main determinant of treatment effect regardless of ethnic origin.  Studies  OPTIMAL,  EURTAC  and  ENSURE  clearly  demonstrate  this  (see  Tarceva  EPAR).  Thus, based  on  current  knowledge,  it  is  expected  that  the  effect  of  Erl+Bv  observed  in  the  Japanese population in study JO25567 could be extrapolated to a European population.

## Population PK Analyses for Bevacizumab and Erlotinib

The PK of Bv has been characterized previously in patients with solid tumours (i.e., colorectal cancer [CRC], hormone refractory prostate cancer [HRPC], metastatic breast cancer [mBC], or NSCLC) from eight clinical trials in which Bv was administered either as a single agent or in combination with various chemotherapies.    These  data  comprise  the  'Reference  PopPK  Model'  provide  a  reference  model  for additional popPK analyses of data from other patient populations across various tumour types.

Although race was evaluated in the Reference PopPK Analysis, patient numbers were too low across the  race  categories  to  conclude  whether  a  significant  difference  in  Bv  exposure  was  observed.    An external  analysis  compared  the  results  of  Study  JO19907  against  the  Reference  PopPK  Model,  and confirmed that the PK of Bv from Japanese patients with NSCLC in Study JO19907 was similar to the predominantly  Caucasian  patients  included  in  this  model.  This  result  is  consistent  with  published results  of  PK  analyses  for  therapeutic  monoclonal  antibodies  that  support  that  race  (Japanese  and others) is not a covariate associated with PK when body weight is taken into account.

## Exploration of Bevacizumab-Erlotinib Pharmacokinetic Interaction

The  PK  of  the  combination  of  Bv  and  Erl  was  studied  in  a  Phase I/II  trial  in  patients  with  NSCLC (Study NCT00043823/OSI2486s). The results from  this  study  showed  that  combining  Bv  (15 mg/kg q3w) and Erl (150mg/day) was well tolerated and active in NSCLC.  These results, together with the results from Study OSI3364g, a phase III study where a PK sub-part of the study showed no clinically significant difference in the PK parameters of Erl or its metabolite OSI-420 in the presence or absence of Bv, were used to support the dose justification of Bv and Erl in Study JO25567.

Bv and Erl do not share clearance pathways.  Thus, it is not expected that Bv would have any direct effect  on  exposure  of  Erl  or  its  metabolites,  and  similarly,  Erl  would  not  be  expected  to  alter  Bv exposure. Erl is metabolized primarily via the CYP3A4 pathway and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2, and the pulmonary isoform CYP1A1. Agents known to inhibit or induce CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 function may alter the PK of Erl.  However, the metabolism of Bv is primarily via proteolytic catabolism throughout the body and not via cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathways.  Therefore, Bv would not be expected to alter Erl disposition.  Furthermore, Bv is not a cytokine modulator; therefore, it is not expected that any indirect or direct effect of Bv on CYP-450 enzyme levels would lead to alterations of the exposure of  Erl  or  its  metabolites.    In  addition,  there  is  no  known  mechanism  that  would  suggest  that  the mutated EGF receptor would affect the clearance of Bv.

## 2.3.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Based on the data submitted, it is expected that the effect of Erl+Bv observed in the Japanese population in study JO25567 could be extrapolated to a European population. The Population PK model for Erl indicates no clinical significant relationship between predicted apparent clearance and ethnicity and the PK-DDI data available for Bv given in combination with Erl do not suggest a potential for a PKDDI between Bv and Erl.

## EGFR mutation testing

EGFR status was determined prior to study screening at each medicinal institution, using cells derived from paraffin embedded sections, pleural fluid, bronchial lavage or transbronchial brushing followed by analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The assay methods used and EGFR mutation status of patients  were  recorded  at  inclusion  into  the  study.  For  patients  enrolled  in  Study  JO25567,  EGFR testing  was  performed  at  three  major  reference  laboratories  that  are  certified  by  an  international standard  for  clinical  testing  laboratories  (ISO  15189)  and  maintain  qualification  by  The  College  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

American Pathologists, and in addition conduct testing according to Japanese Good Laboratory Practice and Good Clinical Practice.

## Treatments

Erlotinib 150 mg tablet was to be taken once daily before breakfast with 1 glass (approximately 200 mL) of water, every day.

Bevacizumab: 15 mg/kg intravenous drip infusion was performed on Day 1 of each cycle (1 cycle is assumed  to  be  21  days).  When  administering,  the  preceding  cycle  period  must  have  ended (administration on the 22 to 25 day counting from the preceding administration day, excluding cases in which administration was delayed due to an adverse event).

## Objectives

## Primary Objective

To  compare  the  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  of  erlotinib  plus  bevacizumab  combination  therapy (Erl+Bv group) with Erlotinib monotherapy (Erl group) based on blinded review by an IRC, to minimize any potential bias in the assessment of the primary endpoint.

## Secondary Objectives

To  compare  the  Erl+Bv  group  and  Erl  group  with  respect  to  each  of  the  following  items:  Overall survival  (OS),  tumour  response  (response  rate,  disease  control  rate,  and  duration  of  response), improvement of symptoms and QOL based on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for patients with Lung cancer (FACT-L), safety profile.

## Exploratory Objectives

Measurement  of  serum  angiogenic  factor,  ligands,  etc.,  measurement  of  gene  polymorphism, measurement of plasma VEGF, gene expression analysis using tumour tissue, measurement of protein, and measurement of proteomics.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoint

Progression free survival (PFS) defined as the period from registration in the study until the date of confirmation of progressive disease (PD) or the date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first.

## Secondary endpoints

- Overall survival (OS) defined as the period from registration in the study until death irrespective of the cause

-  Response  rate  defined  as  the  percentage  of  patients  whose  best  overall  response  is  complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).

- Disease control rate defined as the percentage of patients whose best overall response is CR, PR or stable disease (SD), according to RECIST

- Duration of response (DOR) defined as the period from first report of response (CR or PR, whichever status was recorded first) until PD was confirmed or death (whichever occurs first).

- Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using FACT-L including 5 low-order scales: 1. Feeling of physical health, 2. Feeling of social health, 3. Feeling of mental health, 4. Feeling of functional health, and 5. Lung cancer-related items.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

From past findings on patients with NSCLC who are positive for EGFR gene mutation, the median PFS of Erlotinib used alone was set at 13 months. Out of consideration for the anticipated additional effect of bevacizumab, HR was set at 0.7, and when supposing a one-sided significance level of 20% and a power of 80%, the required number of PFS events is 89. When setting the registration period at 12.5 months and the study period at 28 months, and taking into consideration the number of discontinued / dropout patients, the number of patients required to accumulate 89 events is 150 patients in the 2 groups (75 patients in each group).

In order to increase the precision of the estimated value, even if 89 events are observed in the early stages, observation will be continued during the 28-month study period, and even more events are to be accumulated. In addition, if the target number of events is not reached within the study period, the study period (follow-up period) will be extended until at least 89 events are observed.

## Randomisation

Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to the Erl+Bv group or Erl group at a ratio of 1:1 using the dynamic allocation method, based on the stratification factors shown below.

Stratification factors:

- 1) Gender: Female vs. male
- 2) Clinical stage: IIIB vs. IV vs. post-operative recurrence
- 3) Smoking status: Non or Former light smoker vs. Other
- 4) EGFR gene mutation type: Exon19del vs. L858R

## Blinding (masking)

Study JO25567 was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

The FAS was the main analysis set for the analysis of efficacy. In addition, as reference, efficacy was analysed using the per protocol set (PPS) as well.

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival function, the median PFS and the 95% confidence interval of the same was calculated, and the 2 groups were compared using the log-rank test. The confidence interval was calculated based on the Greenwood method.

In addition, the hazard ratio of PFS in the Erl+Bv group compared to that of the Erl group was shown using a proportional hazard model.

The estimate and the 95% confidence interval were calculated for response rate and disease control rate. The Clopper-Pearson method was used to calculate the confidence interval.

Overall survival and duration of response was analysed similarly to PFS.

QOL Evaluation was carried out in accordance with the FACT-L scoring manual. With respect to the total score and each subscale score, the statistics at each time point were calculated, and the changes over time were summarized. Similar summarization was carried out regarding changes in scores from baseline.

In  the  safety  analysis  population,  the  incidence  of adverse  events  /  adverse  drug  reactions  and  the 95% confidence interval were estimated.

Number of subject(%)

The most common later lines of therapy were other EGFR TKI's, pemetrexed, docetaxel, carboplatin, cisplatin and bevacizumab. It is noted that bevacizumab was used more commonly by patients in the Erl arm than the Erl+Bv arm. More than three quarters of patients received second-line therapy in both treatment arms. Third-line of treatment was received by 63.6% and 56.0% of patients in the Erl arm and Erl+Bv arm, respectively. Fourth and later lines of treatment were used by more patients in the Erl arm (53.2%; n=41) compared to the Erl+Bv arm (37.3%, n=28).

## Numbers analysed

Of 154 randomized patients, 2 patients (Erl+Bv group) were discontinued before the start of administration due to pulmonary artery thrombosis and increased pleural effusion, so the number of patients who were administered the investigational drug at least once (safety analysis population) was 152 patients (Erl+Bv group: 75 patients, Erl group: 77 patients).

- Study OSI3364g: A Phase III, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with erlotinib compared with erlotinib alone for treatment of advanced NSCLC after failure of standard first-line chemotherapy.

Patients with advanced NSCLC who had experienced clinical or radiographic progression during or after standard first-line  chemotherapy  or  chemo-radiotherapy  were  randomized to receive either Erl  (150 mg daily orally) plus placebo or Erl (150 mg daily orally) plus Bv (15 mg/kg IV q3w), until disease progression  or  unmanageable  toxicity.    All  patients  were  followed  for  survival  until  death,  loss  to follow-up, or study termination.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Erl+Bv relative to Erl monotherapy, as  measured  by  OS.    Secondary  objectives  were  PFS,  ORR,  duration  of  response,  safety  and pharmacokinetics  (PK).    The  possible  relationship  between  exploratory  biomarkers  including  EGFR mutations and efficacy outcomes was also investigated.

A total of 636 (317 in the Erl+Pl arm, 319 in the Erl+Bv arm) patients were enrolled into this study. In the subgroup of 25 patients with activating EGFRmut+ tumours (13 in the Erl+Pl arm, 12 in the Erl+Bv arm), some differences were apparent between the two arms; a lower proportion of females, ECOG PS 0 and 'never smokers' and the higher proportion of patients ≥ 65 years in the Erl+Pl arm; see Section 3.1 for details.  Overall, 64% of patients were Caucasian.

The results of the primary analysis showed a similar OS in both treatment arms (stratified HR 0.970; 95% CI 0.80, 1.18; p = 0.7583).  The median OS was 9.2 months (95% CI 7.85, 11.60) in the Erl+Pl arm vs 9.3 months (95% CI 7.39, 11.47) in the Erl+Bv arm.  One year survival rates were also similar in the two arms (42.1% in the Erl+Bv arm vs 40.7% in the Erl+Pl arm).

With respect to PFS, the risk of disease progression or death was reduced by 38% in the Erl+Bv arm compared to the Erl+Pl arm (stratified HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.52, 0.75; log-rank p-value = &lt;0.0001). The  median  PFS  was  1.7  months  Erl+Pl  vs  3.4  months  Erl+Bv.    The  ORR  was  12.6%  with  Erl+Bv compared  with  6.2%  for  Erl+Pl.    For  patients  with  an  objective  response,  the  median  duration  of response was 9.7 months in the Erl+Bv arm vs 8.4 months in the Erl+Pl arm.

In  the  activating  EGFRmut+  subgroup  of  25  patients  (13  Erl+Pl  vs  12  Erl+Bv),  the  observed unstratified HR for OS was 0.47 (95% CI 0.11, 2.00); the KM estimated median OS was 20.2 months in the Erl+Pl arm and not reached in the Erl+Bv arm.  Compared with Erl+Pl, treatment with Erl+Bv resulted in a 39% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (unstratified HR: 0.61; 95%CI 0.21, 1.78), which is consistent with the HR observed in the ITT population.  The median PFS was 11.0 months in Erl+Pl arm vs 17.1 months in Erl+Bv arm.

Study BO20571: A Phase II study of erlotinib in combination with bevacizumab versus chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in first-line advanced NSCLC patients

This  was  an  open-label,  multicentre,  randomized,  2-arm  study  in  patients  with  advanced  nonsquamous NSCLC without prior systemic chemotherapy for stage IIIB/IV or recurrent disease.

Patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to either Erl+Bv or chemotherapy + Bv (CT+Bv) using the following stratification factors: region (Western Europe vs Eastern Europe vs other region), smoking status (current smoker vs past smoker vs never smoked), gender and tumour histology (adenocarcinoma vs other histology).  In the Erl+Bv arm, Erl was given orally at a dose of 150 mg daily and Bv at 15 mg/kg IV q3w until disease progression.  Patients in the CT+Bv arm received four to six cycles of a standard platinum-containing regimen (gemcitabine/cisplatin or carboplatin/paclitaxel) plus Bv (15 mg/kg q3w IV).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  primary  efficacy  parameter  was  PFS  (RECIST  version  1.0)  with  tumour  assessments  scheduled every 6 weeks for the first 8 cycles and then every 12 weeks thereafter.

This  study  was  terminated  prematurely  as  results  from  the  first  interim  analysis  (data  cut-off  17 September 2008) indicated inferior PFS for patients in the Erl+Bv arm compared with the CT+Bv arm (HR 2.17; 95% 0.88; 5.34) which was confirmed in an updated interim analysis (data cut-off 6 January 2009; HR 2.05; 95% CI [1.11; 3.77]).  The duration of follow-up was extended in order to observe more  events,  specifically  for  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  EGFRmut+  tumours  for  whom  a  longer duration of OS was expected.  The efficacy results presented for patients with activating EGFRmut+ tumours are based on the final analysis.

A  total  of  124  (61  CT+Bv  vs  63  Erl+Bv)  patients  were  enrolled  into  this  study.    The  EGFRmut+ subgroup  comprised  24  patients  (11  CT+Bv  vs  13  Erl+Bv).    The  median  age  was  58  years  in  the CT+Bv  arm  and  60  years  in  the  Erl+Bv  arm.    In  the  overall  activating  EGFRmut+  population,  the majority  (83%)  was  Asian,  men  and  women  were  equally  distributed  and  all  patients  had  good performance  status  at  baseline  (ECOG  PS  0  or 1).    Adenocarcinoma  (88%)  was  the  predominant histologic type reported.  Overall, the study arms were generally well balanced except that the Erl+Bv arm had more past/current smokers than the CT+Bv arm (46% vs 27%, respectively).

At the final analysis, 73% (8/11) of patients in the CT+Bv arm vs 69% (9/13) in the Erl+Bv arm had experienced a PFS event.  Relative to the CT+Bv arm, the risk of disease progression or death was reduced by 60% in the Erl+Bv arm (HR 0.40, 95%CI 0.13-1.19]).  The KM-estimated median was 11.0 in the CT+Bv arm and 16.4 months in the Erl+Bv arm.

## Study SAKK 19/05: Bevacizumab and erlotinib as first-line therapy in advanced non-squamous nonsmall-cell lung cancer (stage IIIB/IV) followed by platinum-based chemotherapy at disease progression: A multicenter phase II trial.

Knowledge  of  EGFR  status  was  not  required  at  study  entry.    Patients  were  scheduled  to  receive erlotinib  (150  mg  po  daily)  plus  bevacizumab  (15  mg/kg  q3w  IV)  until  disease  progression  or unacceptable toxicity.  Upon  disease  progression,  patients  received  6  cycles  of  a  standard  platinumcontaining regimen (gemcitabine [1250 mg/m2]/cisplatin [80 mg/m 2 ] or gemcitabine [1250 mg/m 2 ]/carboplatin [AUC 5]).

The primary endpoint for the study was IRC assessed disease stabilization rate (DSR; defined as CR, PR or SD) after 12 weeks of Erl+Bv treatment according to RECIST version 1.0.  Secondary endpoints included  DSR  at  6  and  18  weeks,  objective  response,  best  ORR,  AE,  time  to  progression,  time  to treatment failure and QoL.  Overall survival was assessed for both treatment phases.

QoL  was  assessed  using  the  Lung  Cancer  Symptom  Scale  (LCSS),  with  the  addition  of  one  global indicator to assess patients' estimation of overall treatment burden.

Of the 101 evaluable patients, 12 (12%) had activating EGFR mutation tumours (exon 19 deletion or exon  21  L858R).    In  the  overall  evaluable  population  of  101  patients,  the  majority  had  stage  IV disease  (86%)  with  adenocarcinoma  being  the  most  common  cancer  histologic  type  (89%).    The median  age  of  patients  was  65  years  (range  32-80  years)  and  most  of  the  patients  were former/current smokers (67%).  The gender distribution was balanced (52.5% women vs 47.5% men) and all patients had good functional status at baseline (ECOG PS 0 [52.5%] or 1 [47.5%]).

In the 12 patients with activating EGFR mutation tumours, the DSR at 12 weeks was 83.3% (10/12). Of the 10 patients with at least SD at 12 weeks, one patient had CR, five patients had a PR and four patients had SD.  The median TTP was 11.1 months (95% CI 1.3 - 15.4 months) and the median OS was not reached.  One-year and 2-year OS rates were 83% and 71%, respectively.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

No dose response study was conducted to support this extension of indication which is considered acceptable as there is no rationale for a change in dose based on EGFR mutation status. The tolerability of concomitant use of erlotinib 150 mg/day and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg/3 weeks was confirmed in previous studies (NCT00043823 and OSI2950g).

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Overall, the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the pivotal study are considered adequate. The inclusion criteria clearly define the patient population. Patients with T790M mutation of exon 20 were excluded. Furthermore, it seems that patients with symptomatic as well as asymptomatic progression were eligible. However, no patients with ECOG PS of 2 or higher were included in the pivotal study. This is reflected in the SmPC, Section 5.1. The posology as proposed for the study is considered tolerable and in line with current practice.

The objectives are considered clinically relevant. The primary endpoint was PFS by IRC, which is acceptable in a first-line setting.  Secondary endpoints included OS, tumour response and QoL.

The sample size, with &gt;70 patients in each group, is acceptable. The level of power (80%) is considered low, but acceptable and in accordance with the ICH guideline E9. However, the level of significance (one-sided alfa=20%) may be considered low, but not unusual in phase II studies. The risk of a false-positive result is considerably higher compared to standard alfa = 5% in phase III studies.

The MAH has used dynamic allocation, which is less preferred as discussed in the CHMP guideline on adjustment for baseline covariates (EMA/295050/2013). Nevertheless, it is considered reasonable for this specific study in order to avoid small strata. It seems unlikely that a selection bias could have had any impact on the patient allocation. This is supported by the fact that the deterministic part of the algorithm was never used, and it seems also unlikely that the individual sites would have had knowledge about all other sites in order to predict the next patient's allocation. The stratification factors are few and reasonable.

During the conduct of the study the protocol was amended 12 times. None of these are considered critical.

The majority of the patients are female, and the median age is 67 years in both groups. The mean Brinkman index is higher in the Erl + Bv group, meaning that these patients had a higher consumption of cigarettes but the groups seem to be well-balanced with regard to smoking status (non-smoker, former, other).

There is a difference in terms of initial date of diagnosis to the first day of administration, and also with regard to the period from the date of diagnosis of recurrence to the first day of administration. Patients in the Erl group seem to have a longer period from diagnosis to treatment. However, sensitivity analyses show that these differences did not have any major effect on the primary endpoint.

The included patients were solely Japanese. This may raise some concerns regarding the validity and generalizability of the results to a Western population. However, there is robust scientific evidence to support the claim that EGFR activating mutations (exon 19 deletions and L858R) in tumours of Asian and Caucasian NSCLC patients are sufficiently similar to justify extrapolation of the results from the Japanese study JO25567 to Caucasians. The effect of bevacizumab in different ethnic groups has been investigated in several clinical trials. So far there has not been any indication of a treatment difference depending on ethnicity. Studies OPTIMAL, EURTAC and ENSURE have previously demonstrated that the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

EGFR mutations is the main driver of treatment effect, thus, allowing an extrapolation between Japanese (Asians) and Caucasians patients.

Distribution  of  exon  19  deletion  and  exon  21  L858R  seems  to  be  well  balanced  between  treatment arms, and a sensitivity analysis excluding these patients from the PFS analysis, indicate that the HR and the 95%CI remain unchanged. Thus, these patients do not seem have any impact on the overall PFS estimate.

The currently validated testing to identify patients, for whom first-line treatment with erlotinib is considered appropriate, is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations. In this context, the cobas EGFR Mutation Test, based on PCR analysis of DNA extracted from patient tumour tissue, has been validated through CEmarking in the EU. This test is also approved by the FDA. The results from the concordance study WO29921 confirmed that there is concordance between the three main assay types (PNA-LNA PCRClamp, PCR Invader, and Cycleave) used in study JO25567 and the cobas test.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

Study JO25567 met its primary endpoint. The primary endpoint, PFS by IRC, shows a clear difference in  favour  of  the  Erl+Bv  group.  The  median  PFS  is  16.0  months  vs.  9.7  months.  The  HR  is  0.54 (95%CI:  0.36;  0.79).  The  difference  is  both  statistically  and  clinically  significant.  Treatment  with Erl+Bv provides a longer period without progression, thus, prolonging the time to second-line therapy. However, having in mind that the population represents the same population as one would expect in a clinical  setting  and  in  a  phase  III  study  with  the  same  primary  endpoint,  there  is  a  reasonable biological  rationale  for observing  the  difference  in  PFS.  The  p-value  for  the  HR  is  highly  statistically significant.

PFS by exon 21 L858R mutation and exon 19 deletion are in line with the overall estimate. However, the difference in PFS in patients with exon 21 L858R is not statistically significant. This is mainly due to small numbers.

The subgroup analysis shows that the point estimate for all the different subgroups is below 1, and thus in line with the overall estimate. However, due to small number of patients in some subgroups, wide  confidence  intervals  are  observed,  but  no  firm  conclusion  can  be  drawn  with  regard  to  these subgroups.

Looking at PFS by mutation status, patients with exon 19 deletion seems to have a greater effect of Erl+Bv. There has been some discussion in the scientific community whether the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs differs  between  exon  19  deletion  and  exon  21  L858R  mutation.  There  seems  to  be  some evidence/indications  that  exon  19  deletion  might  the  associated  with  longer  PFS  (Jackman  et  al. (2006), Riely et al. (2006), Sun et al. (2011)).

It is well-known that skin rash due treatment with erlotinib is associated with good response. It may be  somewhat  problematic  to  interpret  the  data  since  both  groups  are  treated  with  erlotinib.  With regard  to  PFS  the  addition  of  Bv  to  Erl  does  not  have  any  major  detrimental  effect  on  the  good response associated with skin rash. There seems to be an advantage of adding Bv to Erl with regard to response rates. Patients with Grade &gt; 2 rash seems to have higher response rates and much higher disease  control.  The  addition  of  Bv  to  Erl  does  not  seem  to  have  a  detrimental  effect  on  the  good response associated with skin rash in patients treated with Erl. In the primary endpoint PFS by IRC, patients were censored due to unconfirmed PD, withdrawal or continuation at data cut-off, and there are no apparent differences between treatment arms. Furthermore, the PFS by investigator supports PFS by IRC. Thus, the censoring of patients in the two treatment groups do not seem to have any major impact on the overall results, and do not seem to be biased.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With  regard  to  the  secondary  endpoints,  there  seems  to  be  no  difference  in  OS  between  the  two groups. The OS data is still considered immature at present due to the limited number of deaths. At the cut-off date of 7 November 2014 there were 27 deaths in each arm (36.0% of the patients in the Erl  +  Bv  arm  vs.  35.1%  in  the  Erl  arm).  HR  was  1.04  (95%  CI  0.61;  1.77).  Based  on  the  further updated OS data (cut-off 28 October 2015) there seems to be no detrimental effect of bevacizumab on OS. However, data are still not mature. In addition, the multitude of additional lines of treatment and anti-cancer agents used (e.g. patients in the Erl-arm could also receive Bv) makes the interpretation of the OS data even more uncertain.

However, the MAH should submit mature OS data from Study JO25567 by June 2018, as an imposed post authorisation efficacy study to the marketing authorization as the initial efficacy assessment is based on surrogate endpoints. In addition, the MAH should discuss any further outcome data on the combination of bevacizumab + erlotinib in this indication (e.g. data from the ongoing ACCRU study, NCT number NCT01532089) (see Annex II).

A slight difference in favour of the Erl+Bv group with regard to overall response is observed, but the actual difference in number of patients is very small. Although one would expect a significant increase in response rate by the addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib, this was not observed. However, the response rate in both groups is considered high (64% in erl vs. 69% in Erl+Bv). But more importantly the duration of response was 13.3 months in Erl+Bv group compared to 9.3 months in erl group. This difference is considered clinically relevant and correlates very well with PFS data. Thus, it seems that the effect of erlotinib is maintained for a longer time with the addition of bevacizumab, and this is of clinical importance in a disease with a very aggressive course. The observed difference in PFS is clinically highly relevant, the point estimate is robust, and the study has met its primary endpoint. The observed median PFS in the Erl group is in line with previous findings.

With  regard  to  QoL,  there  seems  to  be  no  clinically  significant  difference  between  the  two  groups. Thus,  apparently  the  addition  of  Bv  to  Erl  do  not  seem  to  have  a  detrimental  effect  on  the  QoL. However, since study JO25567 is an open-label study, the reliability of these data is questionable.

Three supportive studies are presented; OSI3364g, BO20571 and SAKK 19/05. The SAKK 19/05 study is  not  randomized. Only  OSI3364g is a phase III double-blinded study. All studies were in first-line except for OSI3364g, which was in second-line setting. None of the supportive studies conducted a prospective EGFR mutation testing. Gender and smoking status were the only common stratification factors  in  the  randomized  studies.  With  regard to PFS,  the  observed  results  support  the  findings  in study JO25567. However, a direct comparison is not possible, due to several differences between the studies. Nonetheless, it is encouraging to see supportive evidence from these studies.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Study JO25567 met its primary endpoint. The primary endpoint, PFS by IRC, shows a clear difference in favour of the Erl+Bv group. The difference is both statistically and clinically significant. Treatment with Erl+Bv provides a considerable longer period without progression, thus, prolonging the time to second-line  therapy.  There  seems  to  be  no  detrimental  effect  of  bevacizumab  +  erlotinib  on  OS, however, data are not mature yet. In addition, the multitude of additional lines of treatment and anticancer agents used (e.g. patients in the Erl-arm could also receive Bv) makes the interpretation of the OS data even more uncertain.

The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

Post authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to address the uncertainty regarding the survival advantage of bevacizumab in combination with erlotinib compared to erlotinib alone in the first-line

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment  of  patients  with  non-squamous  NSCLC  harbouring  EGFR  activating  mutations,  the  MAH should submit mature overall survival data for study JO25567 (due date: Q2 2018)

In addition, the MAH should discuss any further outcome data on the combination of bevacizumab + erlotinib in this indication (e.g. data from the ongoing ACCRU study, NCT number NCT01532089) (due date: Q4 2018).

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

Because of differences in trial designs (including studies with different comparator regimens compared with Study JO25567) and in order to be able to assess safety in patients of different ethnicity/race, it was not considered clinically meaningful to provide pooled integrated displays of the safety data from the  pivotal  Study  JO25567  compared  with  the  key  supporting  studies  BO20571,  AVF3671g,  and OSI3364g.  However, where feasible and appropriate, side-by-side displays of safety data from the different studies are presented for ease of comparison and identification of common characteristics of the safety profile across studies that employed a combination arm of bevacizumab and erlotinib.

Pivotal dataset from Study JO25567 is based on the clinical data cutoff date of 31 March 2014, which is an update from the cutoff date of 30 June 2013 of the primary CSR to provide an additional 9 months of safety follow-up.

Defined as actual total dose recelved for the total treatment duratlon / planned total dose to be admlnlstered for the total treatment duratlon. (Expressed as a percent).

Statistlcs reterring to patlent's Indivildual mean doses.

The median duration of erlotinib exposure in the Erl+Bv arm is 431 days in study JO25567. A similar number of patients in both groups had a dose reduction to 100 mg erlotinib. The exposure to Erl+Bv may be considered adequate to allow evaluation of the safety profile.  Few patient continued treatment beyond 18-20 months. Otherwise, a comparable number of patients are exposed to study treatment throughout the study duration.

Includes AEs starting during or up to 28 days after stopping treatment (for all studies),and AESls starting any time during or up to 6 months after stopping treatment (other than in study J025567).

## Grade ≥ 3 AEs

There is a considerable difference in the overall number of patients experiencing a Grade ≥ 3 AEs; 68 (90.7%) in the Erl+Bv group vs. 41 (53.2%) in the Erl group in Study JO25567. There are slightly more infections in the Erl+Bv group, but no clear pattern is observed. There are considerable more patients  experiencing  hypertension  in  the  Erl+Bv  group,  which  is  expected.  As  it  will  be  discussed later,  there  are  very  few  discontinuations  due  to  hypertension.    Dermatitis  acneiform  is  more commonly seen in the Erl+Bv group. There are slightly more hepatobiliary disorders in the Erl group. An updated analysis with clinical cutoff of date of 31 March 2014 did not show any relevant changes or differences.

An overview of Grade ≥3 AEs with a ≥2% higher incidence in the Erl+Bv group than in the Erl group showed an excess of AEs in the Erl+Bv arm, primarily driven by a large difference in hypertension. Only one Grade 5 AE occurred (drowning), and it was observed in the Erl group. Seven Grade 4 AEs were observed in the Erl group compared to 1 in the Erl+Bv group. The incidence of Grade 3 AEs is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

higher in the Erl+Bv group, and seems to be explained by the higher exposure to bevacizumab.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events Deaths

In Study JO25567, the only AE leading to death seen during the clinical trial was one patient (1.3%) in the Erl arm who died due to drowning during the clinical trial period. No patient in the Erl+Bv group died  due  to  an  AE.  The  patient  in  the  Erl  group  was  a  67  year-old  female  and  the  drowning  event occurred on Day 40 since start of erlotinib administration. Although unknown whether the death was an  accident  or  suicide,  the  investigator  assessed  that  the  causal  relationship  with  erlotinib  was 'unlikely related.'

The primary cause of PD-related deaths was not recorded. With regard to non-PD related deaths, there were only 3 cases: in the Erl+Bv group one patient died of pneumocystis pneumonia, in the Erl group one patient died due to drowning and one patient died due to thrombosis.

## Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)

The overall incidence of SAEs was 25.3% vs. 24.7%, in Erl+Bv group and Erl group respectively. There is a tendency to more infections in the Erl+Bv arm, but no apparent pattern could be observed. One case of cancer (pancreatic cancer) was observed in the Erl+Bv group. On the other hand two cases of neoplasms (lipoma and nasal cavity cancer) were observed in the Erl group. No conclusions can be drawn based on these few cases.  Eight cases of hepatobiliary disorders were observed in the Erl group compared to 0 in the Erl+Bv group. 5 out of 8 were classified as 'hepatic function abnormal'.

Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety

## Blood pressure

In  Study  JO25567,  hypertension  (including  increase  in  blood  pressure)  as  an  AE  was  seen  in  59 patients (78.7%) in the Erl + Bv arm and 11 patients (14.3%) in the Erl arm.  Throughout the clinical trial  period,  diastolic  blood  pressure  tended  to  be  somewhat  higher  in  the  Erl + Bv  arm,  but  with systolic  blood  pressure,  no  marked changes in median values were seen in either arm at any point during the clinical trial period.

## Body weight

Decrease in body weight as an AE was seen in 33 patients (44.0%) in the Erl + Bv arm and 19 patients (24.7%) in the Erl arm.  No marked changes were seen in either arm at any point during the clinical trial period.

## Other vital signs

No marked changes were seen in either arm at any point during the clinical trial period with respect to any of the other vital signs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other studies

In Study BO20571, vital signs (weight, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure and pulse rate) were  summarized  for  the  overall  safety  analysis  population  (absolute  values  and  changes  from baseline) and these data did not raise any safety concerns.

In  Study  AVF3671g,  clinically  significant  abnormalities  for  vital  signs,  physical  findings,  and  other observations related to safety were reported as AEs and summarized as the appropriate AE category.

In Study OSI3364g, vital signs were taken at baseline and every 3 weeks during infusion. Each of the groups  showed  a  slight  increase  from  baseline  in  mean  diastolic  and  systolic  blood  pressures.  The mean diastolic blood pressure among Erl + Bv patients was approximately 1-3 mmHg higher than that among  Erl + Pl patients, and  the mean  systolic  blood  pressure  among  Erl + Bv patients  was approximately  5-10  mmHg  higher  than  that  among  Erl + Pl  patients.    These  observations  were consistent with the AE reporting of blood pressure increased under the MedDRA system organ class term of Investigation) in 6 patients (1.9%) in the Erl + Bv arm versus in 1 patient (0.3%) in Erl + Pl arm and of hypertension in 79 patients (25.2%) in the Erl + Bv arm versus in 27 patients (8.6%) in the Erl + Pl arm.

## Safety in special populations

Male patients have a higher incidence of AEs than females, however, no differences in the AE pattern is observed between males and females. With regard to 'age', there seems to be higher incidence of SAE in  elderly  (&gt;75  years)  in  the  Erl+Bv  group.  This  difference  was  not  observed  in  the  Erl  group. However, the number of patients over 75 years is low in both groups.

With  regard  to  ECOG,  patients  with  PS  0  experienced  more  Grade&gt;=3  AEs  in  Erl+Bv  group,  while patients  with  ECOG  PS  1  experienced  more  Grade  ≥3  AEs  in  the  Erl  group.  The  main  drivers  are hypertension and proteinuria. Both AEs are known AESIs related to the use of bevacizumab.

With regard to AE profile as function of smoking, no clinically relevant differences could be observed.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Overall, the pharmacokinetics drug-drug interaction (PK-DDI) data available to date for bevacizumab given in combination with erlotinib (described below) do not suggest a potential for a PK-DDI between bevacizumab  and  erlotinib.    Therefore,  safety  concerns  are  not  expected  from  pharmacokinetic interaction between bevacizumab and erlotinib.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

In  Study  JO25567,  discontinuation  of  one  component  of  study  treatment  did  not  necessitate discontinuation of both drugs. The higher proportion of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment in the Erl+Bv arm (Erl: 18.2% vs. Erl+Bv: 45.3%) was primarily driven by proteinuria and hemorrhagic events (epistaxis and haemorrhoidal haemorrhage).

There were no new safety findings, but a considerable number of patients in the Erl+Bv withdrew from Bv  because  of  AEs.  However,  patients  in  the  Erl+Bv  arm  received  a  median  of  15.5  cycles  of bevacizumab,  which  is  considered  a  relatively  high  exposure.  Having  this  in  mind,  the  observed difference in withdrawal rate must somewhat be expected.

In the Erl+Bv group there was 34 AEs that led to the discontinuation of bevacizumab. Twenty-one of the 34 AEs are resolved or resolving. The unresolved events were related to proteinuria.

There are more AEs leading to discontinuation in patients older than 65 years. However, there is no difference in AE pattern between age groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There seems to be more AEs in elderly patients, but the AEs pattern is comparable between different age groups.

## Adverse Events that Led to Dose Modification or Interruption

A  total  of  27  patients  (36.0%)  in  the  Erl+Bv  group  experienced  an  AE  leading  to  withholding  of bevacizumab.  The  AEs  were  both  AESIs  related  to  bevacizumab  and  erlotinib.  A  similar  number  of patients in both groups experienced an AE that led to erlotinib dose reduction. Slightly more patients (44(57.1%) vs. 51(68%)) in the Erl+Bv group experienced an AE that led to withholding of erlotinib.

Overall, there are more dose modifications and interruptions in the Erl+Bv group. However, this may also be expected when combining these two treatments.

The  main  reasons  for  dose  interruption  in  the  Erl+Bv  group  were  hypertension,  proteinuria,  rash, dermatitis,  haemoptysis,  periodontal  disease  and  paronychia.  None  of  the  events  of  proteinuria resolved  and  only  80%  of  the  events  of  hypertension  resolved.  The  majority  of  the  rest  of  AEs resolved.

The  most  common  AEs  leading  to  erlotinib  dose  modification  or  interruption  were  skin  and  nail disorders. These AEs were most likely to stay unresolved with sequalae. However, these AEs can be treated in the clinical setting and often patients continue treatment.

## Post marketing experience

Bevacizumab  in  combination  with  intravenous  5-fluorouracil-based  chemotherapy  for  the  first-line treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum was approved in the United States on 26 February 2004 and in the EU on 12 January 2005. The total number of patients exposed to  bevacizumab  in  the  postmarketing  setting,  across  indications,  from  the  International  Birth  Date (IBD) up to 25 February 2015 is estimated to be approximately 2,048,911 patients.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Duration of safety follow-up in the pivotal and supporting studies was until resolution or up to 28-30 days after the last dose of study treatment. The duration of safety follow-up is considered acceptable.

All  the  common  AEs  are  well-known  and  clinically  manageable.  Exposure  adjusted  incidence  of dermatitis and paronychia show that in the case of paronychia it seems that the addition of Bv to Erl leads to an increased incidence. The Applicant has reflected this in the SmPC.

The overall number of patients with Grade ≥3 AEs is  higher in the Erl+Bv group. There are slightly more infections in the Erl+Bv group, but no clear pattern is observed. There are considerable more patients experiencing hypertension in the Erl+Bv group, which is expected, however, there are very few  discontinuations  due  to  hypertension.    Other  common  AEs  are  paronychia  and  dermatitis acneiform,  which  mostly  are  associated  with  erlotinib,  but  seems  to  occur  more  frequently  in  the Erl+Bv group. Hypertension, proteinuria, epistaxis and decreased weight, which are mainly associated with bevacizumab, are also seen frequently in the Erl+Bv group.

The incidence of all grade AESI for  Bv  and  Erl  show some clear differences. There are considerably more bleedings, hypertension and proteinuria in the Erl+Bv group. With regard to AESI related to Erl there are no major differences between the two groups. Thus, the main differences are driven by AESI related to bevacizumab. Both erlotinib and bevacizumab are associated with GI perforation. However, the combination of these two products do not seem to increase the number of GI perforation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Most Grade ≥ 3 AESI are related to hypertension, proteinuria and rash. No events of GI perforation, PRLS,  wound  healing  complications  and  CHF  are  observed.  Very  few  events  of  ATE  and  VTE  are observed.

Rash is a  well-known AESI that is associated with good response to erlotinib. No major differences were  seen  in  the  overall  number  of  AEs,  SAEs  and  in  treatment  discontinuation.  The  addition  of bevacizumab to erlotinib does not seem to have a detrimental effect with regard to this prognostic AESI.

The  addition  of  erlotinib  to  bevacizumab  seems  to  lead  to  an  increased  number  of  haemorrhagic events. However, most of the bleeding events were Grade 1-2 epistaxis, and in most cases the event was  manageable  and  did  not  lead  to  discontinuation  of  bev.  Only  two  Grade  3  AEs  haemorrhagic events  were  observed  in  the  Erl+Bv  group.  The  bleeding  events  did  not  have  any  major  clinical implications. In addition, this fact should be seen in light of the higher exposure to study treatments in the Erl+Bv group.

Concerning hypertension, only 2 events led to treatment discontinuation, which reflects the fact that this event is clinically manageable. The majority of the hypertension AEs had a peak severity of Grade ≥3. The Applicant has revised the SmPC to reflect the findings in study JO25567. Patients with prior hypertension  are  at  increased  risk  of  developing  proteinuria.  Eleven  (11)  patients  discontinued treatment and 6 patients experienced a peak severity of Grade ≥ 3 proteinuria. With regard to AESI related to Erl there are no major differences between the two groups. Thus, the main differences are driven  by  AESIs  related  to  bevacizumab.  No  events  of  GI  perforation,  PRLS,  wound  healing complications and CHF are observed. Very few events of ATE and VTE are observed. This is reassuring. No AESIs led to death.

The  majority  of deaths across  all  studies  were  due  to  disease  progression.  In  the  pivotal  Study JO25567: No patients died in the Erl + Bv arm due to an AE. The only AE leading to death seen during this clinical trial was one patient (1.3%) in the Erl arm who died due to drowning during the clinical trial period.

The incidence of SAEs was similar between the Erl + Bv and Erl treatment arms (Erl: 24.7% vs. Erl + Bv: 25.3%) in Study JO25567.

Male patients seem to have more AEs, but the AE profile is comparable between genders. There are too few patients over 75 years to draw any conclusion. A divergent picture is observed with regard to ECOG score between the two groups, but the main drivers are hypertension and proteinuria, which are known AESIs related to bevacizumab.

Overall, the AEs leading to dose modification or interruption are well-known AESIs related to Bv or Erl. The unresolved AEs are well-known and well-characterised, and reflected in the SmPC. These AEs are often clinically manageable.

There were no new safety findings, but a considerable number of patients in the Erl+Bv withdrew from Bv  because  of  AEs.  However,  patients  in  the  Erl+Bv  arm  received  a  median  of  15.5  cycles  of bevacizumab,  which  is  considered  a  relatively  high  exposure.  Having  this  in  mind,  the  observed difference in withdrawal rate must somewhat be expected. In the Erl+Bv group there was 34 AEs that led to the discontinuation of bevacizumab. Twenty-one of the 34 AEs are resolved or resolving. The unresolved events were related to proteinuria.

Overall, males seem to have more AEs, but the AE profile is comparable between genders. There are too few patients over 75 years to draw any conclusion. A divergent picture is observed with regard to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ECOG score between the two groups, but the main drivers are hypertension and proteinuria, which are known AESIs related to bevacizumab.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

There  were  no  new  safety  findings,  but  the  incidence  rate  for  some  of  these  AEs  and  the discontinuation rate was higher  in the combination group. The reason(s) for this high incidence rate is most likely due to longer exposure to study treatments in the Erl+Bv group. No imbalance in deaths was observed in the pivotal study, in the Erl+Bv arm vs Erl arm. The safety findings are in general clinically manageable and do not give rise to any major concern.

| Bleeding/ Hemorrhage | EU SPC section 4.4: Patients treated with Avastin have an increased risk of haemorrhage, especially tumour-associated haemorrhage. Avastin should be discontinued permanently in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 bleeding during Avastin therapy (NCI-CTCAE v.3) (see section 4.8). Patients with untreated CNS metastases were routinely excluded from clinical trials with Avastin, based on imaging procedures or signs and symptoms. Therefore, the risk of CNS haemorrhage in such patients has not been prospectively evaluated in randomised clinical trials (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CNS bleeding, and Avastin treatment discontinued in cases of intracranial bleeding. There is no information on the safety profile of Avastin in patients with congenital bleeding diathesis, acquired coagulopathy or in patients receiving full dose of anticoagulants for the treatment of thromboembolism prior to starting Avastin treatment, as such patients were excluded from clinical trials. Therefore, caution should be exercised before initiating therapy in these patients. However, patients who developed venous thrombosis while receiving therapy did not appear to have an increased rate of Grade 3 or above bleeding when treated with a full dose of warfarin and Avastin concomitantly (NCI-CTCAE v.3). | None proposed                           |
| Pulmonary hemorrhage | EU SPC section 4.4: Patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with Avastin may be at risk of serious, and in some cases fatal, pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis.

|                                | CTCAE (version 3.0)]) proteinuria may be related to the dose. Monitoring of proteinuria by dipstick urinalysis is recommended prior to starting and during therapy. Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) was seen in up to 1.4% of patients treated with Avastin. Therapy should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) (NCI-CTCAE v.3).

There is no information on the effect of Avastin in patients with uncontrolled hypertension at the time of initiating therapy. Monitoring of blood pressure is generally recommended during therapy. In most cases hypertension was controlled adequately using standard antihypertensive treatment appropriate for the individual situation of the affected patient. The use of diuretics to manage hypertension is not advised in patients who receive a cisplatin- based chemotherapy regimen. Avastin should be permanently discontinued if medically | None proposed                           |

| Congestive heart failure    | EU SPC section 4.4: Reactions consistent with CHF were reported in clinical trials. The findings ranged from asymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction to symptomatic CHF, requiring treatment or hospitalisation. Caution should be exercised when treating patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as pre- existing coronary artery disease, or congestive heart failure with Avastin. Most of the patients who experienced CHF had metastatic breast cancer and had received previous treatment with anthracyclines, prior radiotherapy to the left chest wall or other risk factors for CHF were present. In patients in AVF3694g who received treatment with anthracyclines and who had not received anthracyclines before, no increased incidence of all Grade CHF was observed in the anthracycline + bevacizumab group compared to the treatment with anthracyclines only. CHF Grade 3 or higher reactions were somewhat more frequent among patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy than in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. This is consistent with results in patients in other studies of metastatic breast cancer who did not receive concurrent anthracycline treatment (NCI- CTCAE v.3). | None proposed                           |

From a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study GOG-0240), GI perforations (all grade) were reported in 3.2% of patients, all of whom had a history of prior pelvic radiation The occurrence of these events varied in type and severity, ranging from free air seen on the plain abdominal X-ray, which resolved without treatment, to intestinal perforation with abdominal abscess and fatal outcome. In some cases underlying intra-abdominal inflammation was present, either from gastric ulcer disease, tumour necrosis, diverticulitis, or chemotherapy-associated colitis. Fatal outcome was reported in approximately a third of serious cases of gastrointestinal perforations, which represents between 0.2%- 1% of all Avastin treated patients. In Avastin clinical trials, gastrointestinal fistulae (all grade) have been reported with an incidence of up to 2% in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer, but were also reported less commonly in patients with other types of cancer. GI-vaginal Fistulae in study GOG-0240 In a trial of patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, the incidence of GI-vaginal fistulae was 8.3% in Avastin treated patients and 0.9% in control patients, all of whom had a history of prior pelvic radiation. The frequency of GI-vaginal fistulae in the group treated with Avastin + chemotherapy was higher in patients with recurrence within the field of prior radiation (16.7%) compared with patients with recurrence outside the field of prior radiation (3.6%).

| Fistula (other than gastrointestinal) | EU SPC section 4.4: Non-GI Fistulae (see section 4.8) Patients may be at increased risk for the development of fistulae when treated with Avastin. Permanently discontinue Avastin in patients with tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula or any Grade 4 fistula [US National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE v.3)]. Limited information is available on the continued use of Avastin in patients with other fistulae. In cases of internal fistula not arising in the gastrointestinal tract, discontinuation of Avastin should be considered. EU SPC Section 4.8 Non-GI Fistulae (see section 4.4) Avastin use has been associated with serious cases of fistulae including reactions resulting in death. From a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (GOG- 240), 1.8% of Avastin treated patients and 1.4% of control patients were reported to have had non-gastrointestinal vaginal, vesical, or female genital tract fistulae. Uncommon ( ≥ 0.1% to < 1%) reports of fistulae that involve areas of the body other than the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. bronchopleural and biliary fistulae) were observed across various indications. Fistulae have also been reported in post-marketing experience. Reactions were reported at various time points during treatment ranging from one week to greater than 1 year from initiation of Avastin, with most reactions occurring within the first 6 months of therapy. | None proposed                           |

Intra-abdominal inflammatory process may be a risk factor for gastrointestinal perforations in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, therefore, caution should be exercised when treating these patients. Prior radiation is a risk factor for GI perforation in patients treated for persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with Avastin and all patients with GI perforation had a history of prior radiation. Therapy should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation. Labelled in section 4.8 of the EU SPC. | None proposed                           |

Caution should be exercised when Avastin and intravenous bisphosphonates are administered simultaneously or sequentially. Invasive dental procedures are also an identified risk factor. A dental examination and appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to starting the treatment with Avastin. In patients who have previously received or are receiving intravenous bisphosphonates invasive dental procedures should be avoided, if possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | None proposed                           |

Serious wound healing complications, including anastomotic complications, with a fatal outcome have been reported. Therapy should not be initiated for at least 28 days following major surgery or until the surgical wound is fully healed. In patients who experienced wound healing complications during therapy, treatment should be withheld until the wound is fully healed. Therapy should be withheld for elective surgery. Necrotising fasciitis, including fatal cases, has rarely been reported in patients treated with Avastin. This condition is usually secondary to wound healing complications, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula formation. Avastin therapy should be discontinued in patients who develop necrotising fasciitis, and appropriate treatment should be promptly initiated.

|                                      | Eye disorders Individual cases and clusters of serious ocular adverse reactions have been reported following unapproved intravitreal use of Avastin compounded from vials approved for intravenous administration in cancer patients. These reactions included infectious endophthalmitis, intraocular inflammation such as sterile endophthalmitis, uveitis and vitritis, retinal detachment, retinal pigment epithelial tear, intraocular pressure increased, intraocular haemorrhage such as vitreous haemorrhage or retinal haemorrhage and conjunctival haemorrhage. Some of these reactions have resulted in various degrees of visual loss, including permanent blindness. Systemic effects following intravitreal use A reduction of circulating VEGF concentration has been demonstrated following intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. Systemic adverse reactions including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial thromboembolic reactions have been reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors. |                                         |
| Embryo-fetal development disturbance | Text in SPC Section 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during (and up to 6 months after) treatment. Pregnancy There are no clinical trial data on the use of Avastin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity including malformations (see section 5.3). IgGs are known to cross the placenta, and Avastin is anticipated to inhibit angiogenesis in the foetus, and thus is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. In the postmarketing setting, cases of foetal abnormalities in women treated with bevacizumab alone or in combination with known embryotoxic chemotherapeutics have been observed (see section 4.8). Avastin is contraindicated in pregnancy. Section 4.8 of the EU SPC: Foetal abnormalities are labeled as an adverse reaction observed in the postmarketing setting.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable as the changes are limited and considered to have no impact on the legibility of the package leaflet.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Study  JO25567  showed  a  clinically  and  statistically  significant  difference  in  favour  of  Erl+Bv  in  the treatment of non-squamous NSCLC in terms of PFS. Treatment with Erl+Bv provides a considerably longer period without progression (median PFS 16.0 months for Erl+Bv versus 9.7 months for Erl).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Based on the updated OS (cut-off 28 October 2015) there seems to be no detrimental effect of Bv on OS. However, due to the multitude of additional lines of treatment and anti-cancer agents used, the OS data is difficult to interpret. In addition, the data are still not mature at this time point, and thus the Applicant is asked to provide mature OS post-approval (see Annex II condition).

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The overall  number  of  patients  with  Grade  ≥3  AEs  is  higher  in  the  Erl+Bv  group  (41(53%)  vs.  68 (91%)). There are considerably more patients experiencing hypertension in the Erl+Bv group, which is expected, however, there are very few discontinuations due to hypertension.  Other common AEs are paronychia and dermatitis acneiform, which are mainly associated with erlotinib, but seem to occur more frequently in the Erl+Bv group. Hypertension, proteinuria, epistaxis and decreased weight, which are mainly associated with bevacizumab, are also seen frequently in the Erl+Bv group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The addition of erlotinib to bevacizumab seems to lead to an increased number of haemorrhagic events (mostly epistaxis). Eight cases of hepatobiliary disorders were observed in the Erl group compared to 0 in the Erl+Bv group. 5 out of 8 were classified as 'hepatic function abnormal'.

Finally,  discontinuations  due  to  adverse  events  are  considerably  more often observed in  the  Erl+Bv group.  More  than  one  third  of  the  withdrawals  in  the  Erl+Bv  group  are  due  to  proteinuria  and haemorrhage. There are also more dose modifications and interruptions in the Erl+Bv group.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Patients with EGFR-mutated non-squamous NSCLC are often faced with rapid progression and death. The  use  of  TKI  targeted  at  EGFR  activating  mutations  has  prolonged  PFS  and  OS.  The  addition  of bevacizumab to erlotinib in the first-line setting seems to prolong PFS even more. Thus, the time to second-line therapy is extended considerably. This is considered of clinical relevance.

The  combination  of  erlotinib  and  bevacizumab  leads  to  more  AEs,  discontinuations  and  dose modifications of treatment. However, the toxicity was generally manageable with dose modification or interruptions. No patient in the Erl+Bv group died due to a treatment-related AE.

## Benefit-risk balance

Overall,  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  erlotinib  in  the  treatment  of EGFR-mutated non-squamous NSCLC patients is considered positive due to the clinically relevant PFS gain, which outweighs the toxicity.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Study JO25567 met its primary endpoint. The primary endpoint, PFS by IRC, shows a clear difference in favour of the Erl+Bv group. The difference is both statistically and clinically significant. Treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with  Erl+Bv  provides  a  longer  period  without  progression,  thus,  prolonging  the  time  to  second-line therapy. The p-value for the HR is highly statistically significant.

PFS by exon 21 L858R mutation and exon 19 deletion are in line with the overall estimate.

The subgroup analysis of PFS shows that the point estimate for all the different subgroups is below 1. Looking at PFS by mutation status, patients with exon 19 deletion seems to have a greater effect of Erl+Bv. There has been some discussion in the scientific community whether the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs differs between exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R mutation. There seems to be some evidence that exon 19 deletion might the associated with longer PFS.

With regard to the secondary endpoints, there is no difference in OS between the two groups. The OS data is considered immature at present due to insufficient follow-up. A slight difference in favour of the Erl+Bv  group  with  regard  to  overall  response  is  observed,  but  the  actual  difference  in  number  of patients  is  very  small.  The  MAH  will  provide  mature  OS  data  from  study  JO25567  (see  Annex  II condition).

Although response rate was quite similar between treatment arms (64% in Erl vs. 69% in Erl+Bv) the duration  of  response  was  13.3  months  in  Erl+Bv  group  compared  to  9.3  months  in  Erl  group.  This difference is considered clinically relevant and correlates very well with PFS data. Thus, it seems that the effect of erlotinib is maintained for a longer time with the addition of bevacizumab, and this is of clinical  importance  in  a  disease  with  a  very  aggressive  course.  The  observed  difference  in  PFS  is clinically  relevant,  the  point  estimate  is  robust,  and  the  study  has  met  its  primary  endpoint.  The observed median PFS in the Erl group is in line with previous findings.

There  were  no  new  safety  findings,  but  the  incidence  rate  for  some  of  these  AEs  and  the discontinuation rate was higher in the combination group. The reason(s) for this high incidence rate is most likely due to longer exposure to study treatments in the Erl+Bv group. No imbalance in deaths was observed in the pivotal study, in the Erl+Bvarm vs Erl arm. The safety findings are in general clinically manageable and do not raise major concern.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

The MAH should submit mature overall survival data for study JO25567 and discuss any further outcome data on the combination of bevacizumab + erlotinib in NSCLC patients with EGFR activating mutations (e.g. data from the ongoing ACCRU study, NCT number NCT01532089) by December 2018.

## 4. Recommendations
