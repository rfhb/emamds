## 1 Introduction

The  need  for  new  antibacterial  agents  is  greater  than  ever  because  of  the  emergence  of  multidrug resistance  in  common  pathogens  and  the  rapid  emergence  of  new  infections.  Bacterial  resistance  is associated  with  treatment  failures,  increased  mortality,  and  increased  costs.  Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate S.  aureus (GISA) and glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (VRE  or  GRE)  are  of  particular  concern.  In  addition,  resistance  of  gram-negative  bacteria  to  all approved antimicrobials is emerging. Despite the need for new antimicrobial agents, the development of these agents is declining.

Tigecycline, a member of the glycylcycline class of antimicrobial agents, carries a glycylamido moiety attached to the 9-position of minocycline. As a bacteriostatic agent, it inhibits the growth of multiple resistant gram-positive, gram-negative, anaerobic, and atypical bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum β -lactamase producers . Tigecycline remains vulnerable to  the  chromosomally-encoded  multidrug  efflux  pumps  of  Proteeae  and Pseudomonas  aeruginosa . Consequently,  tigecycline does  not  demonstrate  significant in  vitro activity  against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and  demonstrates  only  moderate in  vitro activity  against  microorganisms  belonging  to Proteeae ( Proteus spp., Providencia spp.and Morganella morganii ).

Due to the mechanism of action, the antibacterial activity of tigecycline is not expected to be affected by mechanisms that confer specific resistance to beta-lactam drugs, glycopeptides, quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid or other agents potentially useful against Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacterial species.

The claimed indications were

-  Complicated  skin  and  skin  structure  infections,  including  those  with  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
-  Complicated intra-abdominal infections

The approved indications are:

-  Complicated skin and soft tissue infections1
-  Complicated intra-abdominal infections

Posology: An initial dose of 100 mg is followed by 50 mg every 12 hours by the intravenous route.

## 2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

## Composition

Tygacil contains tigecycline as the active substance. It is presented as a sterile, lyophilised powder for solution  for  infusion.  The  product  is  supplied  in  single  dose  type  I  glass  vials  sealed  with  rubber stoppers and each vial contains 53 mg of tigecycline. The product is intended to constitute with 5.3 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5 % dextrose injection to achieve a concentration of 10 mg / ml of Tigecycline. The 6 % overage facilitates withdrawal and administration of the labeled quantity (50 mg

1 For the sake of consistency within the EU, the CHMP agreed that the proper denomination of the indication should be 'complicated skin and soft tissue infections'(cSSTI) instead of 'complicated skin and skin structure infections'  (cSSSI).    Although  acknowledging  the  difference  in  the  exact  meaning  of  the  two  wordings,  the indication is denoted henceforth as cSSTI.

/  5  ml).  The reconstituted solution should be immediately added to a 100 ml IV bag of solution for infusion (or other suitable infusion container).

## Active Substance

Tigecycline is an analogue of minocycline, which is a semi-synthetic tetracycline. It is a t-butylglycyl substituted naphthacenecarboxamide freebase and its chemical name is (4S,4aS,5aR,12aS)-9-[2-(tertbutylamino)acetamido]-4,7-bis(dimethylamino)-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12a-octahydro-3,10,12,12a tetrahydroxy-1,11-dioxo-2-naphthacenecarboxamide.

Tigecycline is an orange-coloured odourless crystalline powder. It is slightly hygroscopic and highly ionic throughout the entire pH range. In general, tigecycline is less soluble in organic solvents than in water,  due  its  ionic  and  hydrophilic  nature.  When  the  free  base  is  dissolved  in  water,  it  is  mostly present as zwitterions with a resulting pH around 8.

The structure of the active substance has been characterized by using several spectroscopic techniques including: UV-VIS, mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS and MS/MS), FT-IR and 1H-NMR and C13-NMR.  .

## · Manufacture

All synthetic steps of the manufacture of tigecycline have been described in detail and appropriate in process  controls  have  been  established  to  ensure  that  the  active  substance  is  consistently  produced within the proposed specifications.

The levels of the impurities in active substance are supported by the results of toxicological studies and appropriate specifications have been set.

## · Specification

The active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  assay,  identification,  impurities,  water  content, residue on ignition, specific rotation, pH, residual solvents, microbial limits, bacterial endotoxins and heavy metalsThe corresponding analytical methods have been adequately described. At the time of the opinion there were some minor issues concerning aspects of the analytical validation that remained unresolved and will be addressed as post approval commitments.

## · Stability

Three  batches  of  the  active  substance  manufactured  in  accordance  with  the  manufacturing  process described were evaluated in stability studies . Samples were stored for up to 12 months at 5°C and up to 6 months at 25°C/ 60% RH. Photostability testing was also performed on the same batches. Data from supporting stability studies on two pilot scale batches of tigecycline have also been presented. Samples were stored for up to 24 months at 5°C and 25°C / 60 % RH and up to 6 months at 40°C / 75 % RH. The following stability indicating parameters were tested: description, strength (HPLC), purity and  water.  Tests  for  specific  optical  rotation,  microbial  purity  and  bacterial  endotoxines  have  been added to the stability protocol for the commercial batches.

In all cases the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the active substance.

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The key characteristics  of  the  active  substance  were  taken  into  account  for  the  development  of  the finished product..

Due to the poor gastrointestinal permeability and low bioavailability of tigecycline the development of an  oral  dosage  form  was  not  feasible.  Tigecycline  was  found  to  be  stable,  when  protected  from moisture,  oxygen  and  heat,.  Therefore,  a  lyophilised  product  has  been  developed  for  reconstitution with  commonly  used  intravenous  diluents  such  as  0.9%  sodium  chloride  injection  or  5%  dextrose injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  finished  product  is  manufactured  by  lyophilising  an  aqueous  solution  of  the  active  substance without the use of any excipients. The compatibility of the rubber closure with the lyophilisate and with the reconstituted solution has been sufficiently demonstrated.

During early drug development, different strengths of the product were developed. However, only the 50 mg strength was selected for Phase III clinical studies and commercial development

## · Manufacture of the Product

The  manufacturing  process  is  a  standard  process  for  this  kind  of  formulation  and  consists  of  the following main steps: compounding of the bulk product, sterile filtration, vial filling and lyophilisation.  All  critical  process  parameters  have  been  identified  and  controlled  by  appropriate  in process  controls.  The  validation  report  from  three  production  scale  batches  demonstrates  that  the process  is  reproducible  and  provides  a  drug  product  that  complies  with  the  in-process  and  finished product specifications.

## · Product Specification

The  specification  for  the  finished  product  at  release  and  shelf  life  includes  tests  for  appearance, identification,  purity,  uniformity  of  dosage  units,  water  content,  pH,  residual  methylene  chloride, particulate  matter,  bacterial  endotoxins,  headspace  oxygen  content,  sterility  and  reconstitution  time. All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. At the time of the opinion there were some minor issues concerning aspects of the analytical validation that remained unresolved and will be addressed as post approval commitments.

Batch analysis data from several batches including 3 primary stability and 3 process validation batches have been presented. All batches met the test  limits  as  defined  in  the  release  specification  and  test methodology valid at the time of batch release.

## · Stability of the Product

Stability studies were performed on 3 pilot scale batches of powder for infusion according to the ICH requirements . Samples were stored at 5ºC, 25 o C/60 % RH and 30 o C/70 % RH for up to 12 months and in 40 o C/75 % RH for up to 6 months. Supportive stability data have also been provided for two pilot scale  batches  stored  at  5ºC  and  25 o C/60 % RH for up to 36 months, at 40ºC/75%RH for up to 6/8 months  and  at  51ºC  for  up  to  2  months.  The  parameters  tested  were:  physical  appearance  and description, strength, purity, pH, water content, particulate matter, bacterial endotoxins and sterility. In all  cases  the  stability  results  presented  were  satisfactory  and  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  for  the commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SPC.

In addition compatibility studies have been conducted for the product according to the recommended preparation and storage conditions for the intravenous solution intended to be administered through a Y-site. These studies demonstrate that the product remains within the established acceptance criteria, when used as specified in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of Tygacil is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. There are no major deviations from EU and ICH requirements. The active substance is well characterised and documented. It is moisture, oxygen, light and heat sensitive, however the proposed formulation addresses all these issues and the stability  data  provided  demonstrate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is  chemically stable  for  the  proposed  shelf  life.  The  packaging  material  is  commonly  used  and  well  documented. The  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  is  a  standard  process  that  has  been  adequately described. The pharmaceutical particulars of the SPC have been adequately discussed.

## 3 Non-clinical aspects

## Pharmacology

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Primary pharmacodynamics ( in vitro/in vivo )

Tigecycline is a glycylcycline antibiotic derived from the tetracycline group, that acts by inhibiting protein synthesis at the level of the bacterial ribosome. Tigecycline shows higher binding affinity than tetracyclines,  being  active  against  bacterial  strains  with  either  mechanism  of  tetracycline  resistance (efflux and ribosomal protection). The fact that tigecycline overcomes most of the known tetracycline resistance  mechanisms  is  interpreted  as  a  result  of  steric  hindrance  due  to  the  large  substituent  at position  9.  Tigecycline  showed  a  number  of  differences  between  the  in vitro/in  vivo antibacterial activity with respect to the tetracycline group that could be attributed to the specific interaction with a different region of the ribosomal A-site. Since mutational resistance to tetracyclines at the A-site is considered extremely rare, it is unlikely that mutational resistance to tigecycline will arise at the Asite.  Tigecycline is able to inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells, which may have some  toxicological  relevance.  However,  in  this  respect  tigecycline  resembles  classical  tetracyclines and some other antimicrobial drugs inhibiting prokaryotic protein synthesis. In addition, the in vitro data show that tigecycline is active against microorganisms harbouring some tetracycline determinants of resistance.

The in vitro activity of tigecycline was tested against a wide range of microorganisms, and especially on those involved in infections for the claimed indications. Susceptibility studies show MIC90 values of ≤ 2 µg/ml for many clinically relevant aerobic pathogens. Based on in vitro studies, it would appear that tigecycline has bacteriostatic activity , it  is  more active against Gram-positive cocci than against Gram-negative  bacilli,  it  has  decreased  activity  against  the  Proteeae,  and  lacks  of  activity  against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ;  being  most  of  these  species  implicated  in  complicated  intra-abdominal infection. Tigecycline is also active against the antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus , penicillin-resistant S . pneumoniae , and vancomicin-resistant enterococci and against gram-negative producing ESBLs. A number of isolates of clinical pathogens have been shown to be less susceptible or resistant, such as some strains of B. fragilis, S. maltophilia and B. cepacia .

A comprehensive in vivo testing  program  was  designed  to  validate  the  hypothesis  that  the in vitro activity  of  tigecycline  would  translate  to  broad  spectrum in vivo activity,  including  more  than  60 different bacterial strains and several animal model diseases (intraperitoneal infection, pneumonia and endocarditis).  Tigecycline  AUC  values  in  the  range  of  4  to  9.5  µg·h/ml  were  efficacious  against  a wide variety of microorganisms in these animal models. A mean daily AUC value of 6.1µg.h/ml was obtained following a maintenance regimen of tigecycline 50 mg q 12 hours (1-hour infusion) from a Phase I clinical trial data.

## · Safety pharmacology

The potential of tigecycline to alter cardiovascular, respiratory and CNS systems was examined as part of the safety pharmacology dossier.

## Effects on central nervous system

The CNS safety pharmacology study conducted in rats with single IV (bolus) dosages of 5, 15 or 30 mg/kg showed no significant effects on CNS function.  .

Intravenous bolus administration of tigecycline at dosages  of 10  mg/kg  o  greater  produced prolongation of thiopental-induced sleeping time and death following thiopental pre-treatment in mice. This issue could be explained by the fact that tigecycline is known to release histamine at high doses. Increased  histamine  levels  are  known  to  decrease  blood  pressure,  which  at  the  same  time  is  also reduced  following  the  administration  of  an  anesthetic  dose  of  thiopental.  Consistent  with  this hypothesis,  pre-treatment  with  antihistamines  was  related  to  mortality  prevention.  Thus,  tigecycline and thiopental together may have an additive or synergistic effect, which could be responsible for the additional  hypotension  and  deaths  observed after IV administration of thiopental and high doses of tigecycline.

Antihistamines prevented mortality, but did not clearly reverse effects on sleeping time, suggesting that central histaminergic neurons may be involved. There are no clinical observations suggesting that any interactions of tigecycline occur with hypnotics.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Respiratory effects

The respiratory safety pharmacology study conducted in rats with single IV(bolus) dosages of 5,15 or 30mg/kg showed no significant effects on respiratory function.

Bronchoconstriction and hypotension occurred at dose of 30 mg/kg in immobilised guineapigs.  . Pretreatment with H1 and H2 histamine antagonists suppressed the increase in bronchoresistance induced by bolus administration of ≥ 10 mg/kg of tigecycline, but did not affect the decrease in mean arterial blood pressure. The ability of tigecycline to decrease mean arterial blood pressure could be attributed to released histamine acting at H3 receptors, which is evident particularly after iv bolus injection but these data would need to be confirmed .

## Cardiovascular effects

Regarding cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies, no cardiovascular effects were observed after a 0.5-hour  infusion  of  5  mg/kg  (2.5  times  the  highest human dose) in dogs, whereas a dosage of 12 mg/kg (6 times the highest human dose) resulted in transient, non-life-threatening changes in heart rate and  blood  pressure  but  no  effects  on  ECG (including  QT  interval).  There  were  also  no  significant effects  on  ECG  (including  QT  interval) in  dogs  at  the  highest  dosage  of  20  mg/kg  (10  times  the highest human dose) administered as an IV bolus in the 2-week toxicology study. These findings were consistent with results from clinical trials,

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

There were no pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies conducted in animals. However, adequate information  on  possible  interactions  with  other  medicinal  products  is  included  in  the  SPC  (section 4.5).

## Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of tigecycline has been comprehensively described in animal species used for safety evaluation, especially rats and dogs.  Both species share many similarities, the dog being the closest species to human in terms of both pharmacokinetics and metabolism.

## · Absorption and Distribution

Tigecycline is not absorbed systemically after oral administration in rats and monkeys.

The pharmacokinetics of tigecycline was characterized by a low to moderate CLT, a moderate to high Vdss,  and  short  (1-4  hours,  rat)  to  long  (8  hours,  dog  and  14  hours,  monkey)  t 1/2 values.  Linear kinetics was maintained over a large range of doses. Repeat, daily IV administration of tigecycline to rats and dogs for 13 weeks resulted in only small increases in AUC values (&lt; 2-fold) compared with AUC values  after  a  single  dose,  similar  to  that  observed  in  humans  after  the  14-day  IV  course  of therapy.  The large Vdss is consistent with the results from the tissue distribution studies in rats in which [ 14 C] tigecycline was widely distributed to most tissues (the highest exposures seen in bone, bone marrow, thyroid gland, salivary gland, kidney, and spleen).

Tigecycline  was  found  to  accumulate  in  skin  and  uveal  tract  of  pigmented  rats,  suggesting  that tigecycline and/or its metabolites have an affinity for melanin. However, this is a common property of several  drugs  including  tetracyclines,  and  is  believed  to  have  no  toxicological  significance  per  se. Regarding accumulation in bone, taking into account the limited duration of the intended clinical use and  the  lack  of  interactions  reported  in  the  literature,  interaction  with  bisphosphates  is  considered negligible.

Tigecycline crossed the placenta and was excreted in the milk of lactating rats although exposure was minimal in nursing pups. Low levels of radioactivity were recovered in brain.

At therapeutic concentrations, plasma protein binding of tigecycline in humans was moderate (from 71% to 89%).

## · Metabolism ( in vitro/in vivo ) and Excretion

Tigecycline was minimally metabolised in the animal species tested, consistent with that observed in humans. Consistent with rat and dog data, the 4-epimer of tigecycline (a non-enzymatic epimerization

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

product)  was  also  the  most  abundant  tigecycline-derived  component  detected  in  human  serum  and urine. The major metabolic pathways for tigecycline in humans were glucuronidation (M7: tigecycline glucuronide  metabolite,  approximately  12  %,  and  its  epimer  M6)  and  amide  hydrolysis  of  the  tbutylaminoacetylamino  side  chain  (M9:  N-acetyl-9-  aminominocycline,  approximately  3  %  and  its epimer M8, approximately 10% of the administered tigecycline dose). Thehuman metabolites (M7 and M9), have not been observed in rats and dogs, but are present in mice and rabbits. Further studies showed that tigecycline and its epimer as well as M3, M7 and its epimer M6 were detected in both species,  mice  and  rabbits,  but  M9  and  its  epimer  M8  were  only  observed  in  rabbits,although quantitative  information  on  the  individual  metabolites  was  not  provided.  This  limitation  on  the metabolic profile could pose a concern on toxicity assessment, mainly in relation to the genotoxicity potential. This issue has remained as a commitment.

The pharmacokinetics of 4-epimer of tigecycline (both a synthetic impurity and degradation product present in tigecycline drug product) was evaluated in rats following a dosage of 6 mg/kg/day for 4 days of tigecycline containing 0.8 % of 4-epimer (concentration range present in various batches of tigecycline  used  during  the  toxicology  program).  The  pharmacokinetics  of  9-aminominocycline,  a minor metabolite of tigecycline (formed by the loss of the t-butylaminoacetic acid group (M3a) from the TBAAA side chain) is known since a series of studies were previously conducted to support the registration of minocycline.

No significant inhibition was observed on cytochrome P450 CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8 and CYP1A2 isozymes. However, mechanism based inhibition of CYP450 isoenzymes has not assessed but the potential for tigecycline to inhibit  CYP 450 isoenzymes by mechanism  based inhibition remains as a post approval commitment .

.

The  excretion  of  tigecycline  was  similar  in  animals  and  humans  with  the  predominant  mode  of excretion being the faeces, via the bile.

## Toxicology

- Single dose toxicity

The estimated LD50 for tigecycline following intravenous administration ranged from 100-150 mg/kg in mice to 100 mg/kg in rats.

- Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Repeated-dose toxicity studies of 2-weeks and 13-weeks were conducted in male and female rats and dogs with tigecycline. Separate studies were performed in each species to examine the reversibility of tigecycline -induced adverse effects after 2 weeks of daily IV dosing, followed by a 3-week recovery period.  A  histamine-type  reaction,  characterised  by  clinical  signs  of  an  anaphylactoid  reaction including oedema/swelling, laboured breathing, salivation and vocalization, was observed following IV administration at dosages ≥ 20 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥ 5 mg/kg/day in dogs.

Adverse findings were generally dose related in species, as well as their incidence and severity. There were no sex-related differences in toxicity in either species.

Target  organs  for  tigecycline-induced  toxicity  in  the  two-week  toxicity  studies  are  bone  marrow, kidney, thymus, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, spleen and bone (discolouration) at exposures of 8.1 and 9.8 times the human daily dose (based on AUC ) in rats and dogs, respectively.The evaluation of  the  toxicity  was  hampered  by  the  low  number  of  animals  used  in  the  GLP  studies  conducted  in dogs.

Toxicity  to  the  bone  marrow  in  both  rats  and  dogs  manifested  as  hypoplasia,  decreases  in  RBC parameters and reticulocytes, decreased platelet count and increased platelet volume, and decreases in neutrophils,  monocytes,  eosinophils,  and  lymphocytes.  Thymic  and  lymphoid atrophy  was  noted microscopically  for  both  species.  Extramedullary  hematopoiesis  in  splenic  red  pulp  was  reduced  in treated rats with tigecycline, resulting in a reduced spleen weight.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Renal  toxicity  was  evidenced  by  cortical  tubular  degeneration  (rats  and  dogs),  increased  tubular basophilia (rats), tubular single cell necrosis (rats), granular casts in the kidney (rats), and increases in serum BUN and creatinine (dogs). In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, tigecycline resulted in erosion of the glandular stomach mucosa in rats and villous atrophy and crypt degeneration in the small intestine of dogs at dosages of 50 and 20 mg/kg/day, respectively. Yellow bone discoloration was noted in rats, a  known  finding  for  the  tetracycline  class.  In  spite  of  the  known  hepatic  toxicological  liability  in animals of tetracyclines, after IV administration of tigecycline for up to 13 weeks, the liver appeared not  to  be  significantly  affected  in  either  species  based  on  histopathological  examination  and  serum liver enzymes.

Further  observations  included  macroscopic  (pale  foci)  and  microscopic  (myocardial  inflammation, degeneration/necrosis, and/or mineralization) heart lesions in rats at the highest dosage (70 mg/kg/day) because of histamine release which led to myocardial ischemia. The no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs)  in  the  2-  and  13-week  rat  toxicology  studies  were  5  mg/kg/day  and  2  mg/kg/day, respectively.  The  NOAELs  in  the  2  and  13-week-week  dog  studies  were  5  and  1.5  mg/kg/day, respectively.

The toxicokinetics of tigecycline were evaluated as part of toxicity studies in rats, rabbits and dogs. Exposure to tigecycline increased with the dose in all species. Although there was an indication of sex-related differences in exposure in rats, there were no sex-related differences in exposure in dogs. Exposure  ratios  ranged  from  0.4  to  6.5  for  rats  and  from  0.7  to  2.8  for  dogs.  The  most  relevant exposure  ratios  to  the  clinical  use  duration  (up  to  14  days)  were  1.2  and  2.8  in  rats  and  dogs, respectively.

## · Genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo (with toxicokinetics)

Tigecycline  did  not  induce  mutations  in  bacterial  or  mammalian  cells  in  vitro,  nor  did  it  cause clastogenic  activity in  vivo or in  vitro .However,  it  emerges  from  pharmacokinetic  studies  that  M9 metabolite is not present in mouse, and M7 exposure has not been quantified. Genotoxicity of these two metabolites had not been adequately addressed, and therefore further genotoxic testing regarding M7  and  M9  metabolites  was  considered  necessary,  as  a  follow-up  measure.    The  Applicant  has committed to conduct an in vitro assay to detect point mutations and another to detect chromosomal aberration (according to the ICHS2A and ICHS2B Guidelines).

## · Carcinogenicity

No  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  conducted  since  the  duration  of  the  therapeutic  regimen proposed with tigecycline is 14 days.

## · Reproductive and developmental studies

Tigecycline was evaluated in fertility, peri/post-natal and developmental toxicity studies in rats and a developmental toxicity study in rabbits. In rats, decreases in parental body-weight gains were used to establish the NOAEL levels for F0 males and females at 1 and 4 mg/kg/day, respectively.  There were no effects on time to mating, mating or fertility indices, conception rate, pre- or post-implantation loss, numbers of corpora lutea or live and dead foetuses, or percent resorptions.  The NOAEL for fertility was 12 mg/kg/day for both sexes. With respect to rat foetal development, there were no effects on foetal sex ratio or on the incidences of foetuses or litters with major malformations or minor external or visceral anomalies. Foetal weights in the 12 mg/kg/day group were reduced compared to controls, with observations of reduced /delayed ossification of the pubic, ischial, and supraoccipital bones and increased incidences of rudimentary 14th rib.

The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in the rat (F1 litters) was 4 mg/kg/day, based on the reduction in  foetal  weight  at  this  dosage.  The  developmental  toxicity  of  tigecycline  was  also  investigated  in rabbits dosed IV on days 6 through 18 (inclusive, 13 days) of pregnancy at dosages of 0, 0.25, 1, or 4 mg/kg/day.  The  administration  of  4  mg/kg  was  associated  with  foetal  loss.  The  maternal  and developmental toxicity NOAELs were 1 mg/kg/day and 4 mg/kg/day, respectively.   There was no indication  of  a  teratogenic  effect  of  tigecycline  in  the  rat  or  rabbit.  From  results  obtained  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

perinatal/postnatal  toxicity  study  conducted  in  rats,  the  maternal  NOAEL  was  established  at  1 mg/kg/day, and for foetal and offspring (F1 generation) development, the NOAEL was 12 mg/kg/day. A slight dose-dependent increase in the length of gestation was observed for the tigecycline-treated groups. Distribution studies performed with radiolabeled tigecycline showed that it readily crosses the rat placenta and associates with foetal bone

## · Local tolerance

## Irritation potential

Local irritation following IV injection was observed in rats given 30 and 70 mg/kg/day. Macroscopical  changes  at  the  injection  site  were  observed  with  a  dose  of  30  mg/kg/day  and microscopic changes at a dose level of 5 mg/kg/day. There were no tigecycline-related injection site lesions  in  dogs  administered  tigecycline  IV  for  2  or  13  weeks  at  dosages  up  to  20mg/kg/day. Concentrations of the administered tigecycline solution (30 and 70 mg/ml) were high at the dosages used in these studies compared with 1.2 mg/ml, the highest concentration administered in humans.

## Sensitisation potential

Tigecycline was administered by IV or IP to mice in a sensitization phase and IV rats in a challenge phase  to  assess  the  antigenic  potential  using  the  passive  cutaneous  anaphylaxis  (PCA)  assay. Tigecycline  showed  no  antigenic  potential.  In  a  single-dose  study  with  guinea  pigs,  animals  at  3 mg/kg IV had adverse clinical signs consistent with an anaphylactoid reaction and histamine release, which precluded an antigenicity study with this species

## Phototoxicity

Tigecycline caused no cutaneous or ocular responses following IV administration in rats at 70 mg/kg followed by UVR exposure of both the eyes and skin at 5 minutes and 2 hours after its administration.

## · Other toxicity studies

## Immunotoxicity

Since tigecycline showed toxicity towards bone marrow, lymph nodes, and the production of red and white blood cells at high doses, it would be expected to be immunotoxic.  As immunotoxicity studies were not conducted, the Applicant was requested to conduct an immune function study (e.g. TDAR with KLH as an antigen) as a follow up measure and has agreed to carry it out. Therefore, this issue remains as a post-authorisation commitment and should be included in the Risk Management Plan.

## Impurities

The level of structurally-identified impurities and/or degradants, such as 4-epimer, 9aminominocycline,  and  others  impurities  identified  by  their  relative  retention  time,  which  may  be present in commercial supplies, were qualified with appropriate studies according to ICH guidelines for impurities in new drug substances. The minocycline impurity in tigecycline needs no qualification since it is an antibiotic approved for serious infections. However, no genotoxicity studies have been performed aimed to evaluate three degradation products of tigecycline (RRT 0.55, 1.25, 1.67). The Applicant has agreed to conduct two in vitro studies to detect both point mutations and chromosomal aberrations, as requested as a follow up measure.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The environmental risk assessment of tigecycline followed primarily the draft of guidelines related to this issue. From the results obtained, it is concluded that tigecycline for injection is of no immediate risk to the environment and no proposals for labelling provisions are necessary to reduce any potential environmental risks.

## Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

Overall,  most  of  the  toxicological  effects  of  tigecycline,  with  the  possible  exception  of  bone discolouration,  are  likely  to  be  reversible  in  humans  upon  cessation  of  dosing  based  on  recovery studies in rats and dogs. Basically, these findings are qualitatively similar to those known for other tetracyclines.

## 4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

## GCP

The applicant has stated that all clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic data on tigecycline have been obtained from at least 300 healthy subjects (young and elderly),  subjects  with  mild  to  severe  hepatic  disease  and  severe  renal  disease  and  more  than  270 patients with complicated skin and soft tissue infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.

- ADME: Tigecycline is administered IV and therefore has 100% bioavailability.

Following IV administration,  the  steady-state  Cmax  was  866  ng/ml  for  30-minute  infusion  and 634  ng/ml  for  60-minute  infusions.  Tigecycline  serum  concentrations  initially  decline  rapidly while  tigecycline  is  being  distributed  into  the  body's  tissues  with  an  estimated  volume  of distribution  around  600L.  At  therapeutic  concentrations  (0.1  to  1.0 µ g/ml)  the in  vitro protein binding increases with increasing concentrations from 71% to 89%.

The tigecycline serum concentration curves often show secondary peaks occurring approximately 12 to 16 hours after administration. Enterohepatic recirculation of tigecycline and a redistribution of  tigecycline  from  the  various  tissues  have  been  proposed  across  the  dossier  to  address  the 'secondary  peaks' phenomenon,  redistribution being the most  likely explanation for the fluctuation observed.

Tigecycline  concentrations  exhibit  a  multi-phasic  decline,  with  the  final  elimination  phase generally occurring beyond 24 hours (t1/2 of 24 to 48 hours; CV 50%-83%). Following a 100-mg loading dose followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for 5 days, steady-state conditions are met by treatment Day 3. Tigecycline shows to be dose dependent with an accumulation AUC ratio about 1.3. The clinical half-life of tigecycline is above 13 hours.

On average, it is estimated that less than 20% of tigecycline is metabolised before excretion. In healthy male volunteers, following the administration of 14 C-tigecycline, unchanged tigecycline was the primary 14 C-labelled material recovered in urine and faeces, but a glucuronide, an Nacetyl metabolite and a tigecycline epimer were also present. The recovery of the total radioactivity in faeces and urine following administration of 14 C-tigecycline indicates that 59 % of the dose is eliminated by biliary/faecal excretion, and 33 % is excreted in urine. Overall, the primary route of elimination for tigecycline is biliary excretion of unchanged tigecycline. Glucuronidation and renal excretion of unchanged tigecycline are secondary routes.

Cholestasis  is  a  clinical  condition  that  may  be  frequently  associated  to  cIAI.  The  potential influence of cholestasis on tigecycline excretion is subject to further studies to be finalised after the  marketing  authorisation  has  been  granted.  Meanwhile  a  cautionary  statement  is  included  in section 4.4 of the SPC.

-  Special  populations:  With  regard  to  weight,  gender,  age  and  impaired  renal  function,  the pharmacokinetics of tigecycline is not clinically significant altered. The only significant covariates in the population PK analyses were creatinine clearance, weight and gender; Tigecycline exposure after  one  single  dose  is  higher  among  females  than  males,  and  in  elderly  subjects  higher  than young subjects. All this data are included in section 5.2 of the SPC. The recommended Tygacil dose  for  patients  with  severe  hepatic  insufficiency  (Child  Pugh  C)  is  a  100-mg  loading  dose followed  by  25  mg  every  12  hours.  A  decrease  in  the  loading  dose  is  not  recommended.  The volume of distribution in subjects with hepatic insufficiency was observed to be reduced by only

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

28% compared with healthy subjects with a corresponding increase of 23% in Cmax. Given the importance of quickly providing efficacious concentrations of drug when initiating antimicrobial therapy, the first dose should remain the same.

-  Interactions:  Due  to  negligible  metabolism  and  moderate  protein  binding,  pharmacokinetic interactions  of  clinical  relevance  are  not  expected.  Two  single  dose  interaction  studies  with warfarin  and  digoxin  were  performed  and  apparently  tigecycline  did  not  affect  exposure  to digoxin, and  vice  versa. In  the  warfarin  interaction  study,  concomitant  administration  of tigecycline resulted in a 68% increase in Rwarfarin AUC and 29% increase in S-warfarin AUC, suggesting inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, respectively. This is however, inconsistent with in vitro studies  in  human  liver  microsomes,  which  suggested  a  low  potential  for  inhibition  of CYP450 isoenzymes. In any case, available data does not suggest that this interaction may result in  significant  International  Normalised  Ratio (INR) changes. However, as Tigecycline has been reported to prolong both PT and aPTT, the SPC (sections 4.4 and 4.5) now includes statements about the potential safety implication of tigecycline in this respect.Subject to post authorisation commitment the applicant will further investigate the potential for mechanism-based inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 by tigecycline.

## Pharmacodynamics

Tigecycline  is  a  broad-spectrum  primarily  bacteriostatic  antibiotic,  a  member  of  the  glycylcycline class of antimicrobial agents.  It is a synthetic derivative of minocycline. The bacterial ribosome is the target for the tetracyclines.  Binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit at the A-site blocks entry of aminoacyl transfer RNA molecules into the ribosome, preventing incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains. Glycylcyclines interact also directly with another region of the 30S A-site.

Tigecycline evades the Tet(A-E) efflux pumps, which account for most acquired resistance to tetracycline and minocycline in Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp.; also the Tet(K) pumps, which occur widely in staphylococci conferring resistance to tetracycline though not minocycline ordoxycycline. In addition, tigecycline binds to bacterial ribosomes that have been modified by the Tet(M) protein, a mechanism that compromises all available tetracyclines, and which is frequent in Gram-positive cocci and Neisseria spp. Evasion of the tet(M) is probably because tigecycline attaches to the ribosome in a different orientation from classical tetracyclines. Tigecycline remains vulnerable to the chromosomally-encoded multidrug efflux pumps of Proteeae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ..

Consequently, tigecycline  exhibits  decreased  activity  against  microorganisms  belonging  to  Proteeae ( P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri and Morganella morganii ) and no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa .

The issue of resistance linked to changes in the A-site has been adequately addressed. Within the risk management plan specific attention is paid to the potential for developing resistance.

The MIC breakpoints (BP) were discussed and agreed with EUCAST in accordance with the standard operating  procedure  adopted  by  EMEA,  EUCAST  and  the  European  Pharmaceutical  Industry (EFPIA).

The  clinical  breakpoints  and  comments  on  the  antibacterial  spectrum  of  activity  are  delineated  in section  5.1  of  the  SPC.    There  is  limited  in  vivo  experience  with  infections  caused  by  enterococci although polymicrobial intraabdominal infections respond to treatment with tigecycline. For anaerobes there is seemingly an absence of correlation between in vitro data and clinical outcome and so no BP has been assigned to anaerobic bacteria.

Some  microorganisms  raise  particular  concern,  i.e.  Enterobacteriaceae  such  as Klebsiella spp ., Enterobacter spp. , and Serratia marcescens and other Gram-negative organisms such as Acinetobacter baumannii ,  for  some  of  which decreased susceptibility was observed in clinical trials while  patients  were  on  therapy.  Also,  there  seems  to  be  some  strains  of  anaerobes  with  decreased susceptibility  to  tigecycline,  i.e.  the  MIC  distributions  for  organisms  of  the  genera Bacteroides and Clostridium are wide and may include values in excess of 2 mg/L tigecycline, which is also mentioned in section 5.1 of the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An in  vitro surveillance  study  (T.E.S.T.)  is  anticipated  to  run  through  2007-2008  in  600-800  sites worldwide. Furthermore, a specific surveillance study aimed at monitoring emerging resistance in the European Union after the introduction of tigecycline in clinical practise will be conducted as part of a post authorisation commitment. Updated information on the prevalence of resistance as well as further insight into the mechanisms of resistance to tigecycline will be submitted within subsequent PSURs.

The effect of tigecycline on the oropharyngeal and intestinal flora in healthy adults was minor and as could  be  expected  from  the  antibacterial  spectrum.  The  number  of Bacteroides isolates  in  the oropharyngeal  microflora  was  increased  and  did  not  return  to  baseline  levels  at  the  end  of  study period.  Also, the number of Bifidobacterium in  the  intestinal microflora was decreased and did not return to baseline levels at the end of study period.  Of note, none of the subjects were colonized by C . difficile whereas the number of Bacteroides isolates in the intestinal microflora was not affected. The remaining intestinal flora returned to normal by the end of the study period.

The issue of potential antagonism between tigecycline (bacteriostatic) and bactericidal antibiotics is addressed in a statement in section 4.5 of the SPC, indicating that in in vitro studies no antagonism was shown. No clinical data is available on this issue.

The dosage regimen recommended provides low Cmax and, according to the volume of distribution, extensive  tissue  penetration.    In  the  PK/PD  modelling  based  on  phase  2  data  and  additional  data collected from the phase 3 studies, results are of limited value, partially due to the low MIC range tested and the limited number of isolates available for the modelling. Since tigecycline is bacteriostatic against bacteria causing cSSTIs and cIAIs it is of concern whether adequate and maintained levels are obtained with the dosage regimen recommended, which is particularly relevant for immunocompromised  patients.  Given  the  extensive  volume  of  distribution  of  tigecycline,  it  is speculated that levels in tissue would be higher than those in serum. However, no adequately validated PK/PD modelling exploring exposure-response in terms of tissue (instead of serum) AUC/MIC ratio is available. Consequently, a warning has been included in section 4.4.to alert physicians on the use of monotherapy with tigecycline in patients presenting with perforation of intestines and/or with incipient sepsis/septic shock.  Also, section 5.2. of the SPC addresses the Cmax and AUC reached in serum.

## Clinical efficacy

The clinical development program for the claimed indications comprises a Phase 2 study (3074A1200-US) and 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies (3074A1-300-US/CA and 3074A1-305-WW) for complicated skin and skin soft tissue infection (cSSTI), and for complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) there is one Phase 2 study (3074A1-202-US) and two other pivotal Phase 3 studies (3074A1-301-WW and 3074A1-306-WW).

## · Dose response studies

The Applicant has presented two phase 2 studies for the claimed indications (for cSSTI: Study 200 and for cIAI: Study 202). Study 200 was a randomized, open-label, comparison study of hospitalized subjects  with  complicated  Skin  and  Soft  Tissue  infections  in  which  160  patients  received  either tigecycline 25 or 50 mg twice daily with an initial dose of 50 or 100 mg, respectively. The clinical data  from  this  study indicated  a  trend  toward  a  dose-related  clinical  cure  response  (67%  and  74%, respectively)  and  dose-related  pathogen  eradication  (56%  and  70%).  Also  dose-safety  relationships appeared  evident  for  the  adverse  events  (AEs)  of  nausea  (22%  and  35%)  and  vomiting  (13%  and 18%).  Since  tigecycline  is  intended  for  use  in  complicated  infections,  efficacy  was  favoured  in benefit/risk -balance, and the greater dosage schedule (50 mg twice daily with an initial dose of 100 mg) was used in all consecutive clinical Phase II and III trials.

Study  202  was  a  phase  2,  multicenter,  open-label  study  in  hospitalized  subjects  with  complicated intra-abdominal  infections  in  which  111  subjects  received  an  initial  IV  loading  dose  of  100  mg  of tigecycline followed by 50 mg every 12 hours. Treatment continued for at least 5 days but not more than 14 days. There were no comparator or placebo groups.

Overall, it  appears  that  the  choice  of  the  dosage  regimen  for  phase  3  studies  is  based  on pharmacokinetic considerations as well as tolerability. The safety profile in these phase 2 studies is consistent  with  that  seen  in  the  larger  database  of  phase  3  clinical  trials.  However,  it  should  be highlighted  that  one  case  of Clostridium difficile associated  colitis  has  been  reported  in  Study  202. Apparently, this was the only one serious case reported of this adverse event for subjects in Phase 2 and 3 trials.

- Main studies

## Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI)

## Methods

Two pivotal  phase  3  trials  (studies  301  and  306)  have  been  submitted  in  support  of  the  indication complicated  intra-abdominal  infections.  Study  301  was  carried  out  in  the  Western  hemisphere,  and 306  in  worldwide.  The  study  protocols  were  similar  in  all  essential  points.  Both  phase  3  were multicenter, double-blind (third-party unblinded) studies in which 1568 hospitalised patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(approximately  800  patients per trial)  with  complicated  intra-abdominal  infections  who  were candidates  for  or  had  received  a  laparotomy,  laparoscopy,  or  percutaneous  drainage  of  an  intraabdominal abscess were randomized.

## Key inclusion criteria were the followings:

1. Hospitalized male or female subjects, at least 18 years of age.
2. Candidate for, or had, a laparotomy, laparoscopy, or percutaneous drainage of an intra-abdominal abscess.
3. Complicated intra-abdominal infection, such as:
- a. An intra-abdominal abscess.
- b. An intra-abdominal abscess (including liver and spleen) that developed in a postoperative subject who received more than 48 hours but not more than 5 days of a nonstudy antibiotic and an intraabdominal culture was obtained from the infected site.
- c.  Appendicitis complicated by perforation (grossly visible) and abscess or periappendicular abscess.
- d. Perforated diverticulitis complicated by abscess formation or faecal contamination.
- e. Complicated cholecystitis with evidence of perforation or empyema.
- f. Perforation of the large or small intestine with abscess or fecal contamination.
- g. Purulent peritonitis or peritonitis associated with faecal contamination.
- h.  Gastric  or  duodenal  ulcer  perforation  with  symptoms  lasting  at  least  24  hours  before operation.
- i. Traumatic bowel perforation with symptoms lasting at least 12 hours before operation.

4. No more than 1 dose of an antibiotic (single broad-spectrum agent or 1 dose of each antibiotic in a combination regimen such as metronidazole, ampicillin,gentamicin) after the baseline intra-abdominal culture was obtained from the infected site.

## Main exclusion criteria are as follows:

1. Anticipated length of antibiotic therapy less than 5 days.
2. Subjects suspected preoperatively to have had a diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, simple  cholecystitis,  gangrenous  cholecystitis  without  rupture,  simple  appendicitis,  acute suppurative cholangitis, pancreatic abscess, or infected necrotizing pancreatitis.
3. Neutropenia  with  absolute  neutrophil  count  less  than  1000/mm3.  Subjects  with  neutrophil counts as low as 500/mm3 were permitted if the investigator thought the reduction was due to the acute infectious process.
4. Intra-abdominal  infection  known  to  be  caused  by  1  or  more  bacterial  pathogens  not susceptible  to  both  of  the  study  drugs  (e.g. P.  aeruginosa,  Proteus  mirabilis )  and  in  the investigator's opinion required treatment with an additional antibacterial agent.
5. Presence of hepatic disease:
- a. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels more than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) values.
- b. Bilirubin more than 3 times ULN, unless isolated hyperbilirubinemia was directly related to the acute process.
- c. Acute hepatic failure or acute decompensation of chronic hepatic failure.

Subjects  were  stratified  at  randomization  according  to  Acute  Physiologic  and  Chronic  Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores ( ≤ 15, or &gt; 15 but &lt; 31). Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either tigecycline (an initial 100-mg dose, followed by 50 mg twice a day) or imipenem/cilastatin (200 to 500 mg, dose based on body weight and calculated creatinine clearance) every 6 hours via intravenous administration for up to 14 days.

The  comparator  group  in  both  trials  was  imipenem/cilastatin  that  was  chosen  based  on  its  use worldwide for therapy of cIAI. The total daily dose of imipenem/cilastatin in cIAI was at the lower range of that acceptable for severely ill subjects.

The  primary  efficacy variable was  the clinical response  in two  co-primary  populations,  the microbiologically-modified ITT (m-mITT) and the microbiologically evaluable (ME) populations. In

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

both trials, the objective was to show the non-inferiority of tigecycline vs. imipenem/cilastatin using a delta of 15% (absolute) at the test-of-cure (TOC) assessment.

## Results

Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the treatment groups in each study,  excepting  differences  in  ethnic  origin.  Infection  type,  etiology  of  disease,  and  comorbid conditions were comparable between treatment groups in each study.

In study 301, 39% of subjects were white and 61% were of other ethnic origin (primarily Hispanic). Most of the subjects (88%) in study 306 were white. Approximately 8% (safety population, pooled data of studies 301 and 306) of subjects were older than 75 years.

The  most  common  type  of  infection  was  complicated  appendicitis  (51.4%),  followed  by  other diagnoses less commonly reported such as complicated cholecystitis (13.5%), intra-abdominal abscess (10%),  perforation  of  intestine  (10%),  and  gastric  or  duodenal  ulcer  perforation  less  than  24  hours (4.9%).  Of  these  patients,  76.1%  had  associated  diffuse  peritonitis  (surgically-apparent  peritonitis). Most  patients  in  both  studies  had  APACHE  scores  &lt;  15  (3.5%).  The  number  of  patients  with concurrent  bacteraemia  was  limited  (6.4%).  The  number  of  immunocompromised  patients  was  also limited. Consequently, the limited data on relevant subpopulations (patients with diagnoses other than complicated appendicitis, patients with bacteraemia and with APACHE score &gt; 15) and severely ill patients is stated in section 4.4 of the SPC.

In study 301, 75 (9.1%) subjects received concomitant antibiotics during the on-therapy phase of the study: 44 (10.7%) tigecycline-treated subjects and 31 (7.5%) imipenem/cilastatin-treated subjects. As for study 306, 52 (6.4%) subjects received concomitant antibiotics during the on-therapy phase of the study: 31 (7.7%) tigecycline-treated subjects and 21 (5.1%) imipenem/cilastatin-treated subjects.

ME  subjects  in  the  2  treatment  groups  had  similar  clinical  diagnoses.  Almost  half  (43.6%)  of  all infections were diagnosed as complicated appendicitis.

## Clinical response

For the primary efficacy analysis results are presented by APACHE score. As the number of patients in  the  strata  &gt;  15  is  small,  the  overall,  unadjusted  difference  has  been  highlighted  in  the  following figures.

In study 301, the cure / failure /completed numbers of the patients in the ME population were 199 / 48 /  247  for  tigecycline  and  210  /  45  /  255  for  the  reference  therapy.  The  95%  CI  for  the  difference between treatments at TOC was:-9.0, 5.4. In the m-mITT population, the cure/ failure/ indeterminate/ completed  numbers  were  227/  63/  19/  309  for  tigecycline  and  244/  55/  13/  312  for  the  reference therapy. The 95% CI for the difference between treatments at TOC was:-11.8, 2.3.

Based on the results, tigecycline has been shown to be non-inferior to imipenem/cilastatin in terms of clinical response at TOC in both the m-mITT and ME populations as the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference between treatments is within the predefined non-inferiority margin of -15%.

## Microbiological response

One hundred ninety (190) patients in study 301, and 153 in study 306 were excluded from the ME population due to the fact that the isolates were not susceptible to the study drugs.

In  study  301  the  percentage  of  eradications  at  the  subject  level  at  TOC  in  the  ME  population  was 80.6% in the tigecycline group vs. 82.4% in the imipenem/cilastatin group, 95% CI for the unadjusted difference: -9.0, 5.4. The rates of persistence were 15.8% vs. 16.5%. In the m-mITT population the figures for eradication were 73.5% and 78.2%, respectively. The unadjusted difference in eradication rates  was  -4.7%  (95%  CI,  -11.8,  2.3).  As  for  persistence,  the  percentages  were  16.8%  for  the tigecycline  group  vs.  16.7  %  in  the  imipenem/cilastatin  group.  The  percentage  of  patients  with indeterminate response in the m-mITT population was 5.5% (tigecycline) and 3.8% (imipenem/cilastatin). As for superinfection, these figures were 4.2% and 1.3%, respectively.

In  study  306,  the  percentage  of  eradication  at  the  subject  level  at  TOC  in  the  ME  population  was 91.3% in the tigecycline group vs. 89.9% in the imipenem/cilastatin group (95% CI for the unadjusted difference: -4.0, 6.8). As for persistence, the percentages were 7.9% vs. 10.1%. Within the m-mITT population, infections were eradicated in 86.6% of tigecycline subjects and 84.6% of imipenem/cilastatin subjects at TOC. The difference in eradication rates was 2% (95% CI, -3.7, 7.7, unadjusted). As for persistence, the percentages were 9.9% for the tigecycline group vs. 11.3% in the imipenem/cilastatin  group.  The  percentage  of  patients  with  indeterminate  response  in  the  m-mITT population was 2.8% (tigecycline) and 4.1% (imipenem/cilastatin). As for superinfection, these figures were 0.6% and 0.0%, respectively.

At the test-of-cure assessment, the difference in eradication rates among ME subjects (pooled data) with  monomicrobial  infections  was  2.6%  (92.8%  in  the  tigecycline  group  and  90.2%  in  the imipenem/cilastatin  group).  Among  those  with  polymicrobial  infections,  the  difference  was  -1.2% (82.5% in the tigecycline group and 83.7% in the imipenem/cilastatin group). When adjusted for type of infection, the difference in eradication rates between the 2 treatment groups was 0.7% (95% CI, 3.3%,  4.8%).  In  the  m-mITT  population,  the  difference  in  eradication  rates  of  patients  with monomicrobial infections at the test-of-cure assessment was -0.4% (85.1% in the tigecycline group and  85.4%  in  the  imipenem/cilastatin  group).  Among  those  with  polymicrobial  infections,  the difference was -1.7% (77.2% in the tigecycline group and 78.9% in the imipenem/cilastatin group). When adjusted for type of infection, the difference in eradication rates between the 2 treatment groups was -1.1% (95% CI, -5.4%, 3.2%).

In the m-mITT population of studies 301 and 306 Escherichia species (mainly E. coli )  followed by Bacteroides species and Streptococcus species were the baseline pathogens most frequently isolated.

To a lesser extent, other isolates found were Enterococcus species, Klebsiella species and Staphylococcus species. No vancomycin resistant enterococci were isolated in these trials.

The pooled results of the microbiological response at the pathogen level at TOC within the ME population is summarised in table below.

Subjects  treated  with  tigecycline  who  had  isolates  deemed  to  have  developed  indeterminate  or resistant susceptibility to tigecycline as defined by the provisional breakpoints, were determined in the cIAI studies. No isolates demonstrated the development of decreased susceptibility to tigecycline in study  301.  In  study  306,  2  subjects  in  the  study  were  identified  with  isolates  deemed  to  have developed  indeterminate  or  resistant  susceptibility  to  tigecycline,  as  defined  by  the  per-protocol provisional  breakpoints.  The  subjects  are  listed  in  the  following  table  along  with  their  isolates, corresponding MIC values, and clinical response to tigecycline therapy.

##  Subgroup analysis

In the analysis of clinical response by clinical diagnosis, the highest rates of clinical cure were achieved in complicated cholecistytis and gastric and duodenal perforation. In general, these analyses can be considered consistent with the main analysis of clinical response although they should be interpreted with caution due to limited size of patient groups. Additional exploratory analyses for clinical failures were performed and again, although they should be interpreted with caution, it seems that the most consistent independent predictors for failure were APACHE II score and geographic region, although the last factor can be explained by differences in age, APACHE II scores and higher rates of complicated diverticulitis and lower rates of appendicitis and complicated cholecystitis. Immunocompromised patients were excluded from pivotal clinical trials. This is highlighted in section 4.4 of the SPC.

## Complicated Skin and Soft Tissue Infections (cSSTI)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

Two  pivotal  phase  3  trials  (study  300  and  305)  have  been  submitted  in  support  of  the  indication complicated skin and skin structure infection. Study 300 was carried out in the Western hemisphere, and 305 in worldwide. The Study Protocols were similar in all essential points. Both phase 3 studies were  multicenter, multinational, double blind (third-party unblinded) in which  1129  patients (approximately 500 patients per trial) were randomised to receive either tigecycline (an initial dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours, iv) or vancomycin/aztreonam (1 gram of vancomycin iv followed by 2 g of aztreonam iv administered every 12 hours) for up to 14 days.

## Key inclusion criteria were:

1. Hospitalized male and female subjects, 18 years of age or older.
2. Anticipated need for intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy of 5 days' duration or longer.
3.  Subjects known or suspected to have a cSSTI, including cSSTI that involved deep soft tissue, or required significant surgical intervention or that was associated with a significant underlying disease state  that  complicated  response  to  treatment  (such  as  diabetes  mellitus,  peripheral  vascular  disease (PVD), peripheral neuropathy, or lower venous insufficiency. This included clinical entities such as 1 of the following:
- a. Infected ulcers that had developed signs of erythema, swelling, tenderness, pus, or warmth.
- b. Burns (less than 5% body surface area, nonfull-skin thickness). In study 300 subjects with burns up to 25% of body surface area (nonfull-skin thickness) could be enrolled at selected study centers.
- c. Major abscess (not treatable through surgery alone).
- d.  Deep  or  extensive  cellulitis,  either  associated  with  an  underlying  disease  state  or  greater than 10 cm in width or length.
- e. Peripheral IV catheter sites with documented purulent drainage, provided that the catheter line was removed.
- f. Infected human or animal bites.
4. Subjects with 2 of the following indicators of infection:
- a. Drainage and/or discharge.
- b.  Fever:  body  temperature  higher  than  37.8°C  (100°F)  oral,  37.9°C  (100.2°F)  axillary, 38.2°C  (100.8°F)  tympanic,  or  38.4°C  (101.0°F)  rectal  (core),  within  24  hours  before enrolment.
- c. Erythema.
- d. Swelling and/or induration.
- e. Localized warmth.
- f. Pain and/or tenderness to palpation.
- g. White blood cell count greater than 10,000/mm3.
5.  Subjects  who  had  not  received  more  than  2  doses  of  any  nonstudy  antibacterial  drug  after  the original culture of the infected site had been obtained, except for subjects who were considered prior antibiotic failures.
6. For subjects who were considered therapeutic failures for prior antibiotic therapy with another agent at  entry,  a  Gram  stain  or  baseline  culture  of  the  infected  site  showing  a  potential  pathogen  was obtained before the first dose of study drug was administered. Once a subject began treatment with study drug, no other concomitant antibiotics could be given.

## Main exclusion criteria were as follows:

1. Infected  diabetic  foot  ulcers  or  decubitus  ulcers  where  the  infection  was  present  for  longer than  1  week  or  chronically  infected  ulcers  in  subjects  who  could  not  be  compliant  with measures necessary for chronic wound healing.
2. Necrotizing fasciitis or gangrene.
3. An  uncomplicated  skin  and/or  skin  structure  infection  (eg,  simple  abscesses,  folliculitis, impetiginous lesions, furunculosis, superficial cellulitis).
4. Subjects with suspected or known infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa . However, subjects in whom  the  initial  wound  culture  showed  evidence  of  infection  with Pseudomonas aeruginosa could continue to receive study drug at the investigator's discretion if the subject was showing signs of substantial and continuous clinical improvement on a daily basis.
5. Osteomyelitis contiguous to the infected site.
6. Crepitant cellulitis (gas gangrene).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

7. Presence of any of the following laboratory findings:
- a. Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 1000/mm3).
- b. Presence of hepatic disease:
- i.  Aspartate  aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transferase (SGOT) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) values.
- ii. Bilirubin values greater than 3 times the ULN.
- iii.  Subjects  with  acute  hepatic  failure  or  acute  decompensation  of  chronic  hepatic failure.

The  comparator  group  in both trials was  vancomycin/aztreonam.  This  is  justified based on vancomycin broad activity against aerobic gram-positive pathogen whereas aztreonam provides broad activity  against  gram-negative  pathogens,  including  some  strains  of P.  aeruginosa .  The  use  of vancomycin  for  treating  infections  caused  by  gram-positive  cocci  susceptible  to  methicillin  is questionable. Currently, the empirical use of vancomycin against gram-positive infections is driven by the knowledge  of  local prevalence patterns and/or for the presence of certain risk factors. Consequently,  whether  the  use  of  a  beta-lactam  would  have  rendered  similar  or  different  results  if compared  with  tigecycline  remains  unknown.  However,  from  the  data  submitted  and  indirect comparisons with data from other drugs in the same indication it seems that tigecycline performs well in cSSTI due to methicillin-susceptible S. aureus .

The primary efficacy outcome was the clinical response (cure or failure) for the clinically evaluable (CE) and the clinical response (cure or failure/indeterminate) for the clinical modified intent-to-treat (c-mITT) populations at the test-of-cure (TOC) assessment (which took place at least 12 days but not more than 92 days after the last dose of study drug). In both trials, the objective was to show the noninferiority of tigecycline vs. vancomycin/aztreonam using a delta of 15% (absolute) at the test-of-cure (TOC) assessment.

## Results

Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the treatment groups in each study, excepting differences in ethnic origin. In study 300, 53% of subjects were white and 38% were of  other  ethnic  origin  (primarily  Hispanic).  More  than  80%  of  subjects  in  study  305  were  white. Approximately 7% of subjects were 75 years or older (safety population, pooled data of studies 300 and  305).  The  treatment  groups  (pooled  data,  CE  population)  were  comparable  in  terms  of  their clinical diagnoses, although comorbid conditions between the two studies differed, i.e. in study 305, 11.2% of subjects in the tigecycline arm (12.7% in vancomycin/aztreonam arm) had diabetes mellitus as a comorbid condition compared to 29.1% (29.3% in vancomycin/aztreonam arm) in study 300. In study 305, 4.5% of subjects in the tigecycline arm (5.6% in V/A arm) had peripheral vascular disease as a comorbid condition compared to 9.5% (8.1% in V/A arm) in study 300.

About half of all infections were diagnosed as deep soft tissue infections involving cellulitis covering more  than  10  cm  in  area  (where  anatomically  applicable).  Approximately  27.9%  of  subjects  were diagnosed with major abscesses. Limited numbers of patients with co-morbid factors such as diabetes mellitus (20%), peripheral vascular disease (7%) and with bacteraemia (3%) were enrolled. Patients with severe underlying disease, such as immunocompromised, patients with decubitus ulcer infection or  patients  that  had  infections  requiring  longer  than  14  days  of  treatment  (e.g.  necrotizing  fasciitis) were not enrolled.  Few patients with diabetic foot infections (5%) were enrolled. Consequently, the limited  data  on  relevant  subpopulations  (patients  with  diabetic  foot  infection,  with  decubitus  ulcer infection,  patients  with  wound  infection  and  patients  with  bacteraemia)  and  severely  ill  patients  is stated in section 4.4 of the SPC.

## Clinical response

In study 300, the cure / failure /completed numbers of the patients in the CE population were 165 / 34 /  199  for  tigecycline  and  163  /  35  /  198  for  the  reference  therapy.  The  95%  CI  for  the  difference between treatments at TOC was: -7.4, 8.6. In the c-mITT population, the cure/ failure/ indeterminate/ completed  numbers  were  209/  48/  20/  277  for  tigecycline  and  200/  46/  14/  260  for  the  reference therapy. The 95% CI for the difference between treatments at TOC was: -9.0, 6.1.

The two following tables summarise the clinical response in the CE and in the c-mITT populations.

Tigecycline was statistically noninferior to vancomycin/aztreonam.

Using  the  criteria  for  non-inferiority  of  15%,  tigecycline  has  been  shown  to  be  non-inferior  to vancomycin/aztreonam in terms of clinical response at TOC in both the CE and c-mITT populations as the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference between treatments lies within the predefined -15% margin. However, a trend favouring the comparator arm is seen in study 305. In analysis of pooled data (studies 300 and 305) the 95% CI for the difference in cure rates between treatments was -6.8, 2.7 in the CE population and -7.1, 2.8 in the c-mITT population.

## Microbiological response

The number (%) of subjects who were microbiologically evaluable for analysis is fairly low (study 300: 39% vs. 39,2% and 305: 59.6% vs. 54.6%.). One hundred and sixty-nine patients in study 300 and 124 in study 305 were excluded from the ME population due to the fact that the isolates were not susceptible to the study drugs.

In study 300 the percentage of eradication at the subject level in the m-mITT population at TOC was 72.6%  (135/186)  of  subjects  in  the  tigecycline  group  and  73.1%  (125/171)  of  subjects  in  the vancomycin/aztreonam group. The 95% CI for the difference was -0.5 (-10.3, 9.3). For persistence these figures were 18.3% (34/186) in the tigecycline group and 19.3% (33/171) in the vancomycin/aztreonam group. The rates of indeterminate responses were 6.5% on tigecycline vs. 3.5% on comparator. Superinfection was slightly higher in the vancomycin/aztreonam group (4.1%) than in the  tigecycline  group  (2.7%).  Within  the  ME  population,  infections  were  eradicated  in  78.3%  of tigecycline subjects and 77.0% of vancomycin/aztreonam subjects at the test-of-cure assessment. The between-group  difference  in  eradication  rates  was  1.3%  (95%  CI,  -0.4,  13.0)  at  the  test-of-cure assessment.

In study 305, the percentage of eradication at the subject level in the m-mITT population at TOC was 79.4%  (166/209)  of  subjects  in  the  tigecycline  group  and  84.2%  (171/203)  of  subjects  in  the vancomycin/aztreonam  group.  The  95%  CI  of  the  difference  was  -4.8  (-12.7,  3.1).  For  persistence these were 16.3% (34/209) of subjects in the tigecycline group and 10.8% (22/203) of subjects in the vancomycin/aztreonam group. The rates of indeterminate responses were 1.9% on tigecycline vs. 3.0% on comparator. Superinfection was higher in the tigecycline group (2.5%) than in the vancomycin/aztreonam group (2.0%). Within the ME population, infections were eradicated in 84.8% of tigecycline subjects and in 93.2% of vancomycin/aztreonam subjects at the test-of-cure assessment. The between-group difference in eradication rates was -8.5% (95% CI, -16.0, -1.0) at the test-of-cure assessment.

In study 305, the comparison of the percentage of patients for whom eradication was reached at TOC shows  that  a  higher  rate  of  patients  in  the  vancomycin/aztreonam  group  achieved  this  endpoint  in polymicrobial infections (79.7% vs. 94.0%, 95% CI for the adjusted difference: -15.0, -1.0) within the ME  population.  In  the  m-mITT  population,  these  figures  were  85.2%  vs.74.7%,  95%  CI  for  the adjusted  difference:-12.0,  3.0.  In  analysis  of  pooled  data  (studies  300  and  305)  the  95%  CI  for  the adjusted difference in eradication rates between treatments was -8.7, 3.1 in the m-mITT population and -10.2, 2.1 in the ME population.

The microbiological response at the pathogen level in the m-mITT population shows that in study 300 the total number of S. aureus isolated was 106 in the tigecycline group vs. 95 in the comparator one. The  percentage  of  eradication  was  73.6%  vs.  78.9%,  respectively.  Of  the  total  number  of  isolates, there were 43 MRSA on tigecycline and 39 MRSA on the comparator. The percentage of eradication was 67.4% vs. 82.1%. For non MRSA the percentages of eradication were similar. The same figures in study 305 were as follows: the total number of S. aureus isolates was 119 on tigecycline and 104 on comparator study drugs; the percentages of eradication were 80.7% vs. 85.6%; for MRSA the number in each group was 13 isolates and the respective percentages of eradication were 76.9% and 46.2%. In the ME population the percentage of eradication at TOC for MRSA in study 300 was 72.7% (16/22) on tigecycline vs. 80.8% (21/26) on comparator. The same figures in study 305 are 88.9% (8/9) and 57.1%  (4/7),  respectively.  In  the  case  of  MSSA,  eradication  rates  in  study  300  at  TOC  (ME population) was 91.1% (41/45) on tigecycline and 81.4% (35/43) on comparator. In study 305 these were as follows: 87.8% (79/90) and 96.1% (74/77) respectively.

As  for S.  pyogenes ,  in  study  300  the  percentage  of  eradication  at  TOC  (ME  population)  in  the tigecycline arm was 87.5% (6/7) vs. 75.0% (6/8) in the comparator. In study 305, the percentage of eradication at TOC (ME population) was 96.0% (24/25) in the tigecycline arm and 100% (19/19) in the comparator.

No  vancomycin  resistant  enterococci  (VRE)  were  isolated  in  the  population  recruited  in  the  two pivotal studies.

Subjects  treated  with  tigecycline  who  had  isolates  deemed  to  have  indeterminate  or  resistant susceptibility to tigecycline as defined by the provisional breakpoints were determined in the cSSTI  studies.  No  isolates  demonstrated  the  development  of  decreased  susceptibility  to  tigecycline during these studies.

-  Subgroup analyses

This  was  performed  on  pooled  data  (clinical  response)  in  the  CE  population  to  evaluate  the consistency  of  tigecycline  cure  rates.  No  significant  interactions  with  treatment  were  identified, although the amplitude of the 95% confidence intervals is wide for some of the categories within the different subgroups (age ≥ 75 years, Asian ethnic origin, clinical diagnosis of infected ulcers and burns, presence of Peripheral Vascular Disease, ClCR &lt; 30 ml/min, diabetes and baseline bacteraemia). As a consequence it is difficult to draw adequate conclusions based on these results. Immunocompromised patients were excluded from pivotal clinical trials. These aspects are addressed in section 4.4 of the SPC.

## Supportive studies

Three  (3)  studies  (3074A1-307-WW,  -309-WW,  and  -310-WW)  are  currently  being  conducted  in subjects with serious infections caused by known resistant pathogens (RP). Interim data are included from 1 of the ongoing RP studies that specifically enrols cSSTI subjects with MRSA or other resistant pathogens (3074A1-307-WW). This was a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized (3:1) study to evaluate tigecycline and linezolid for the treatment of selected serious infections in subjects with VRE and to evaluate tigecycline and vancomycin for the treatment of selected serious infections in subjects with MRSA . For  this  interim  analysis  (28  May 2004 data cut-off), 5 VRE subjects and 24 MRSA  subjects  have  been  enrolled  in  the  modified  intent-to-treat  (mITT)  population.  Efficacy evaluations were performed at the end of treatment and at 12 to 37 days after the last dose of study drug for the Test-of-Cure assessment, unless the subject was deemed a clinical failure. Any subject who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug  was  included  in  the  evaluation  for  safety.  No  formal statistical  analysis  was planned or conducted. In summary, tigecycline showed moderate efficacy in subjects  with  MRSA,  curing  62.5%  and  66.7%  of all  infection  types at  the  test-of-cure  assessment within the ME and m-mITT co-primary populations. In subjects with complicated skin and soft tissue infections, tigecycline cured 83.3% and 75.0% of infections in subject groups.

## Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A total  of  2797  subjects,  including  1415  subjects  treated  with  tigecycline  and  1382  treated  with  a comparator received at least 1 dose of tigecycline in the phase 3 clinical trials. In these studies patients were treated with the proposed dosage (100 mg IV followed by 50 mg every 12 hours). The mean duration of therapy was 7 to 8 days for both the total tigecycline and comparator groups. More men than  women  were  enrolled  (approximately  62%  vs  38%,  respectively).  The  age  distribution  was similar between the 2 treatment groups, with an overall mean age of 47 years. Approximately 19% of subjects were age 65 or older; about 8% were aged 75 years or older. About 65% of the subjects were white, 7% black, and the remainder Asian and others. The demographic and baseline characteristics were similar for the tigecycline and comparator subjects (p &gt; 0.05).

## Adverse events

Of these patients 76.6% on tigecycline and 71.1% on comparator reported one or more AEs (p&lt;0.001). The adverse events most commonly reported in patients on tigecycline in phase 3 clinical trials were nausea (33.5%  vs. 19.9%), vomiting (22.3%  vs. 13.4%)  and  diarrhoea (12.9%  vs. 11.9%). Significantly more subjects on tigecycline reported nausea, vomiting, infection, anorexia, dyspepsia, large intestine perforation, jaundice, increased activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), Prothrombin Time (PT) prolonged, amylase increased, BUN increased, bilirubinemia, hypoproteinemia, and pneumonia.

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were defined as that AE 'that was not present when the active  (treatment)  phase  of  the  study  began  and  was  not  a  chronic  condition  that  was  part  of  the subject's medical history, or was present at the start of the study or as part of the subject's medical history but its severity or frequency increased during the active phase of the study'. The Company has presented the incidence of TEAE reported in ≥ 2% of patients treated in phase 3 clinical trials (pooled data).

TEAEs  were  reported  by  71.6%  subjects  in  the  tigecycline  group  and  by  67.4%  subjects  in  the comparator  group  (p=0.017).  The  most  common  drug-related  TEAEs  in  patients  treated  with tigecycline were nausea at 20.4% (12.9% mild; 6.6% moderate; 0.8% severe) and vomiting at 13.5% (8.3%  mild;  4.5%  moderate;  0.6%  severe).  Discontinuation  from  tigecycline  was  most  frequently associated with nausea (1.3%) and vomiting (1.0%). The Applicant was requested to further elaborate on  the  cause  of  the  gastrointestinal  adverse  effects,  in  particular  to  discuss  to  which  extent gastrointestinal symptoms may be due to vestibular toxicity. In this regard, it is likely that the cause of these adverse events is tigecycline's direct effect on the gastrointestinal system rather than vestibular toxicity. No conclusions can be made about the use of prophylactic antiemetic therapy because of the small  number  of  patients  who  received  prophylactic  antiemetic  medications  before  tigecycline administration. As a consequence, no recommendation on whether to use antiemetics is made in the SPC. Food seems to improve the gastrointestinal tolerability and therefore, if confirmed, this should be mentioned in the SPC. However, this was no formally assessed in the clinical trials of tigecycline and no recommendation is made in the SPC on this issue.

Clostridium  difficile -associated  diarrhoea  and  colitis  caused  by  overgrowth  of  toxin-producing clostridia,  have  rarely  been  reported  with  the  administration  of  oral  or  parenteral  tetracyclines.  No cases of pseudomembranous colitis were reported in patients on tigecycline in phase 3 clinical trials but  one  case  of Clostridium  difficile -associated  diarrhoea,  considered  as  serious,  was  reported  in  a phase 2 clinical trial.

Hypersensitivity reactions have rarely been reported with tetracyclines and include a wide variety of symptoms (e.g., rash, dermatitis, urticaria, pruritus, anaphylaxis, fever, headache, arthralgia…). Some TEAEs compatible with hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients on tigecycline. This fact may be complicated by the known histamine-release potential of tetracyclines. Allergic reaction was a drug-related treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) reported infrequently ( ≥ 0.2% and &lt;2%) in patients receiving tigecycline. These allergic reactions characterized as rash and/or pruritus and/or generalized redness. One SAE report involved a 'possible allergic reaction' occurring in a 49-year old patient enrolled in the RP study. On the 6 th day of therapy during the infusion, the patient experienced a 'possible allergic reaction' characterized as tachycardia (HR in 120s), with shaking, chills, fever to 103.4 degrees Fahrenheit, and hypotension to '80s/40s.' The events were managed with intravenous fluids/volume expanders, packed RBC and platelet transfusions, and diphenhydramine. These events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

may have been due  to  a  septic  episode.  Additionally,  the  timing  of  the  event  (6th  day  of  therapy) complicates causality assessment.

According  to  clinical  evaluation,  possible  histamine  release  does  not  appear  likely  to  be  a  clinical safety concern when the drug is infused slowly. However, section 5.3 of the SPC warned about the potential occurrence of histaminergic reactions in animals after rapid iv. bolus injections. Section 4.8 also includes treatment emergent adverse reactions compatible with hypersensitivity such as rash and pruritus.  Hypersensitivity  to  tetracycline  class  of  antibiotics  is  considered  a  contraindication  for tigecycline (section 4.3), given their structural similarity. Finally, hypersensitivity is considered within the  Risk  Management  System  (RMS)  as  an  identified  risk  that  requires  further  evaluation  through pharmacovigilance routine activities.

Photosensitivity, manifested as an exaggerated sunburn reaction on sun-exposed areas of the body, has been described with tetracyclines. These reactions, if they occur, develop at any time from within a few  minutes  up  to  several  hours  after  exposure  to  sun  and  usually  persist  1  or  2  days  after discontinuance of tetracyclines. No cases of photosensitivity or phototoxicity were reported in phase 3 clinical trials with tigecycline. As most patients included in these clinical trials are likely to be treated in hospital it is unlikely that patients were exposed to the sun. Therefore, at present, photosensitivity cannot be ruled out in patients receiving tigecycline. Nevertheless, because of the structural similarity between tigecycline and tetracycline, the SPC addresses photosensitivity as a possible adverse event in section 4.4 of the SPC.

Infections  were  reported  as  TEAE  in  7.0%  of  patients  treated  with  tigecycline  versus  4.2%  on comparators.  This  AE  was  more  frequent  in  patients  included  in  trials  assessing  tigecycline  in complicated intra-abdominal infections (10.2% vs. 5.5 of comparator; p&lt;0.001).

Local reactions to procedure were reported as TEAE in 8.2% of patients treated with tigecycline vs., 8.1% treated with comparators. This was an expected AE, as it is well known that IV administration of tetracyclines  frequently  causes  local  reactions,  especially  when  this  administration  is  prolonged  or when a single vein is used for repeated infusions.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

A total of 188 (13.3%) subjects in the combined tigecycline group and 159 (11.5%) subjects in the comparator group had 1 or more SAEs in all phase 3 studies (300, 305, 301, 306, 307, and 309). The total incidence of SAEs was similar between the 2 treatment groups (p = 0.169). The most frequently reported SAEs in tigecycline-treated subjects were abscess (25 subjects; 1.8%), infection (24 subjects; 1.7%), and healing abnormal (23 subjects; 1.6%). The most frequently reported SAEs in comparatortreated subjects were also abscess (22 subjects, 1.6%) and infection (15 subjects; 1.1%). Significantly more tigecycline-treated subjects (14, 1%) than comparator-treated subjects (3, 0.2%) reported sepsis as an SAE (p = 0.013). Also,  the following SAEs were reported more often in the tigecycline groups (n=1383)  compared  to  the  reference  groups  (n=1375):  hepatic  disorder  (9  vs.  1  cases),  and  renal failure  or  nephropathy  (6  vs.  4  cases).  In  studies  301  and  306  (cIAI),  significantly  more  subjects treated with tigecycline than imipenem/cilastatin reported treatment emergent adverse events such as infections, including pneumonia (301) and sepsis.

One hundred and eleven (111) patients died during phase 3 trials, 67 in tigecycline group and 44 in comparators group. Although the percentage of death was not statistically different between treatment groups more patients treated with tigecycline died in all indications. In phase 3 cSSTI and cIAI trials, there were 32/1383 (2.3%) deaths in tigecycline vs. 22/1375 (1.6%) in the comparator group.  Most of these deaths occurred in patients with intraabdominal infections (26/32). For the patients who died in both groups it was shown that higher age, higher APACHE scores and clinical diagnosis of perforation of  intestine  were  presented.  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  groups  of treatment.  With  regard  to  the  infection  related  deaths,  17/1353  (1.3%)  patients  on  tigecycline  died because of this vs. 8/1375 (0.5) patients in the comparator group.  A total of 21 patients (14 in the tigecycline group and 7 in the comparator group) died because of worsening of the infection. Of these patients, 12 had sepsis (8 tigecycline and 4 comparator), 5 had pneumonia (all tigecycline-treated), and 3 had both sepsis and pneumonia (all in tigecycline).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  tigecycline  group  10  subjects  who  died  has  a  clinical  diagnosis  of  perforated  intestine  or peritonitis  due  to  perforation  of  the  intestine;  in  the  comparator  group,  5  subjects  who  died  were diagnosed with peritonitis due to perforation of the intestine. Peritonitis was considered the cause of death in 2 tigecycline-treated patients. Resistance of the baseline isolates do not contribute to these deaths as for the exception of two P. aeruginosa isolates all of them were susceptible.

As a consequence, there remains a concern of lack of efficacy in severely ill patients with fulminant and rapid disease. This is proposed to be dealt with appropriate SPC wording in sections 4.4 and 4.8. Furthermore, lack of efficacy in severely ill patients is addressed within the risk management plan and updated information on this issue is expected within the PSURS.

There  is  a  known  association  between  pancreatitis  and  tetracyclines.  Since  glycycyclines  are structurally  similar  to  tetracyclines,  certain  adverse  reactions  such  as  pancreatitis  may  be  causally associated with tigecycline.

There  were  3  cases  of  pancreatitis  reported  in  the  tigecycline-treated  subjects  versus  3  cases  of pancreatitis in the comparator-treated subjects (see also Post-Marketing experience below). Of note, increased amylase was reported in a significantly greater number of tigecycline-treated subjects (38; 2.7%) versus the comparator arm (16 subjects; 1.2%) (p = 0.004). This is mentioned in sections 4.4 and  4.8  of  the  SPC.  Acute  pancreatitis  will  be  closely  monitored  not  only  as  per  the  Company's pharmacovigilance  procedures  but  also  a  specific  pancreatitis  questionnaire  to  solicit  follow-up information  from  spontaneous  AE  reports  have  been  created.  Additionally,  more  information regarding pancreatitis may be obtained from the ongoing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) phase 3 clinical trials as well as the ongoing or planned phase 4 post-marketing studies.

## Laboratory findings

More patients treated with comparators had abnormal test results, including: elevated potassium, low phosphorus,  high  SGOT/AST,  high  SGPT/ALT,  and  low  lymphocytes  (p=0.043  to  &lt;0.001). Hepatotoxicity,  a  known  adverse  event  reported  with  tetracyclines,  was  specifically  assessed  in tigecycline clinical trials. The Applicant tried to identify clinical cases that would satisfy the criteria for  'Hy's  Law'  in  the  entire  phase  1  to  3  safety  database.  The  potential  signal  of  hepatotoxicity examined was the combination of significant transaminase elevation (to at least x 3ULN) accompanied by jaundice or by serum total bilirubin elevations, without evidence of biliary obstruction (significant elevation of ALP) (see Clinical White Paper from FDA Working Group, 2000). Six (6) patients on tigecycline and 5 subjects in the comparators including 3 in the imipenem/cilastatin group in the cIAI studies and 2 in the vancomycin/aztreonam group in the cSSTI studies appeared to satisfy the criteria for 'Hy's Law'. Although the number of potential Hy's law cases were numerically low, the rate of reported  LFT  abnormalities  (considered  isolated)  is  consistently  higher  among  tigecycline-treated patients as compared to imipenem in both phase 3 studies carried out in patients with cIAI. This trend is observed for almost every individual parameter (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, and SGPT). Consequently,  this  issue  warrants  further  investigations  and  will  be  addressed  within  subsequent PSURs. The RMS  includes both bilirubinemia and increased Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)/Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) as identified risks that deserve further evaluation. Meanwhile, both adverse reactions are mentioned in section 4.8 of the SPC.

There  was  increase  in  coagulation  parameters  (INR,  Prothrombin  Time  and  activated  Partial Thromboplastin  Time)  in  tigecycline  group  when  compared  to  comparator  group.  It  is  known  that certain tetracyclines diminish prothrombin activity and that could imply an increase in bleeding risk in patients. In order to exclude this risk the majority of the reported TEAEs that may indicate bleeding (e.g.,epistaxis, haemorrhage, anaemia) were reviewed and these TEAEs were no more frequent in the tigecycline group. This is mentioned in section 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the SPC.  In addition, Prothrombin Time  (PT)  and  Partial  Thromboplastin  Time  (PTT)  prolongation  are  included  within  the  RMS  as identified risks that deserve further evaluation.

Increases in the mean BUN/urea in the absence of a consistent increase in the mean creatinine values were observed in patients on tigecycline. These findings, frequently reported with tetracycline class antibiotics,  are  not  usually  of  clinical  importance  in  patients  with  normal  renal  function  but  further deterioration of renal function has been observed when some tetracyclines are administered to patients with impaired renal function. As most patients receiving tigecycline are likely to be severely ill and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

they are treated with concomitant drugs, there is a risk of azotemia, hyperphosphatemia and acidosis in relation to the use of tigecycline in patients with significantly impaired function. This is mentioned in section 4.4 of the SPC. Increased BUN is also mentioned in section 4.8. Finally, it is also included in the RMP as an identified issue that requires further evaluation.

In animal studies it has been shown, that there is bone-marrow toxicity as class-effect of tetracyclines. Bone marrow suppression was not identified as a safety concern during the clinical trials conducted with tigecycline. However, the primary toxicological determinant of the no observed adverse effect level  (NOAEL)  in  both  rats  and  dogs  in  the  repeat-dose  IV  toxicity  studies  was  bone  marrow myelotoxicity.  Exposures  in  animals  at  the  NOAELs  ranged  from  0.7  to  2.8  times  the  exposure observed in humans at the proposed dosage (100 mg/day) for registration. At high, suprapharmacological doses, tigecycline would be expected to induce some levelof immunocompetence  in  animals  based  on  the  observation  of  lymphoid  depletion/atrophy  of  lymph nodes,  spleen,  and  thymus  in  high-dose  animal  studies.  Since  tigecycline  demonstrated  toxicity towards bone marrow, lymph nodes, and the production of red and white blood cells, an additional non-clinical  study  [a  T-cell  dependent  antibody  response  (TDAR)  immune  function  study  of tigecycline  in  rats  using  keyhole  limpet  hemocyanin  (KLH)  as  an  antigen]  has  been  requested  as  a follow up measure. The RMP will be updated accordingly provided that the results of this study are of relevance for humans.

## Effect of tigecycline on QTc interval

To address the potential effect of tigecycline on the prolongation of the QT interval, standard 12-lead ECGs  were  performed  in  phase  3  clinical  trials  as  per  protocol,  the  log-linear  correction  being considered the primary method of analysis of QT/QTc data. No thorough QTc evaluation has been done in healthy volunteers and therefore a full characterisation of the mean effect of tigecycline on cardiac  repolarisation  still  remains.  The  data  from  phase  III  trials  does  not  suggest  a  relevant proarrhythmic effect of tigecycline. The low potential for drug interactions further reassures this view. These  findings  do  not  suggest  that  subjects  treated  with  tigecycline  are  at  any  increased  risk  for cardiovascular events compared to comparator-treated subjects. However, because of past concerns of cardiovascular  events  including  QTc  prolongation  with  other  antibiotics  and  drug  products,  these events are potential risks requiring further evaluation and are included in the RMP.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Drug-drug  interactions  were  not  reported,  except  for  the  comment  in  study  3074A1-300-US/CA related to prolongation of mean aPTT. Of the 12 subjects in the tigecycline group who were flagged in the  PCI  coagulation  profile,  3  had  anticoagulants  as  concomitant  medications.  No  bleeding  was associated with this increase and none required treatment/intervention.

## Discontinuation due to AES

Regarding discontinuations 12.2% of subjects in the tigecycline group and 10.3% of subjects in the comparator  group  discontinued  study  drug  during  all  phase  3  clinical  trials  (p=0.135).  Sixty-nine (4.9%) tigecycline-treated subjects and 58 (4.2%) comparator treated subjects discontinued study drug primarily because of AEs. The rates for discontinuation primarily because of AEs were similar in both the  tigecycline  and  comparator  treatment  groups  (p=0.414).  Nine  percent  (9.0%)  of  subjects  in  the tigecycline group and 8.7% of subjects in the comparator group withdrew from the study early. Both in the tigecycline group and comparator group other events and failure/refusal to return for a followup visit were the most common reasons for withdrawal. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary reasons for withdrawal (p ≥ 0.05).

## Post marketing experience

At the time of initial submission of the dossier, tigecycline was not marketed in any country. The FDA granted a Marketing Authorisation in June 2005. Three cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported in the post-marketing setting and considered to be tigecycline-related.

## 6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are no unresolved quality issues with a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

## Efficacy

Overall,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  efficacy  of  tigecycline  in  the  claimed  indications  has  been established. The SPC addresses relevant aspects on the representativeness of the population actually enrolled in clinical trials in terms of particular clinical conditions and severity of the disease.

In complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) subjects were stratified at randomization according to Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores ( ≤ 15, or &gt; 15 but &lt;  31).  Subjects  were  randomly  assigned  (1:1)  to  receive  either  tigecycline  (an  initial  100-mg  dose, followed by 50 mg twice a day) or imipenem/cilastatin (200 to 500 mg, dose based on body weight and calculated creatinine clearance) every 6 hours via intravenous administration for up to 14 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The comparator group in both trials was imipenem/cilastatin. The total daily dose of imipenem/cilastatin in cIAI was at the lower range of that acceptable for severely ill subjects. The  primary  efficacy variable was  the clinical response  in two  co-primary  populations,  the microbiologically-modified ITT (m-mITT) and the microbiologically evaluable (ME) populations.

Tigecycline has been shown to be non-inferior to imipenem/cilastatin in terms of clinical response at TOC in both the m-mITT and ME populations as the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference between treatments is within the predefined non-inferiority margin of -15%.

Concerns  were  raised  during  the  CHMP  assessment  about  the  efficacy  in  more  severely  diseased patients and the limited extent to which these patients were investigated. The most common type of infection was complicated appendicitis (51.4%), followed by other diagnoses less commonly reported such  as  complicated  cholecystitis  (13.  %),  intra-abdominal  abscess  (10%),  perforation  of  intestine (10%),  and  gastric  or  duodenal  ulcer  perforation  less  than  24  hours  (4.9%).  Most  patients  in  both studies had APACHE scores &lt; 15 (3.5%). The number of patients with concurrent bacteraemia was limited  (6.4%).  The  number  of  immunocompromised  patients  was  also  limited.  Consequently,  the limited data on relevant subpopulations (patients with diagnoses other than complicated appendicitis, patients with bacteraemia and with APACHE score &gt; 15) and severely ill patients is stated in section 4.4 of the SPC.

Tigecycline does not show significant in vitro activity  against P. aeruginosa and demonstrates only moderate in  vitro activity  against Proteus species  or Providencia species.  The  pharmacodynamic section of the SPC (section 5.1) describes the antibacterial spectrum in vitro and in vivo .

In complicated  skin  and  soft  tissue  infections the  comparator  group  was  vancomycin/aztreonam. The use of vancomycin for treating infections caused by gram-positive cocci susceptible to methicillin is questionable. Currently, the empirical use of vancomycin against gram-positive infections is driven by  the  knowledge  of  local  prevalence  patterns  and/or  for  the  presence  of  certain  risk  factors. Consequently,  whether  the  use  of  a  beta-lactam  would  have  rendered  similar  or  different  results  if compared  with  tigecycline  remains  unknown.  However,  from  the  data  submitted  and  indirect comparisons with data from other drugs in the same indication it seems that tigecycline performs well in cSSTI due to methicillin-susceptible S. aureus .

Tigecycline has been shown to be non-inferior to vancomycin/aztreonam in terms of clinical response at TOC in both the CE and the c-mITT populations as the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference between treatments is within the predefined non-inferiority margin of -15%.

Concerns  were  raised  during  the  CHMP  assessment  about  the  efficacy  in  more  severely  diseased patients  and  the  limited  extent  to  which  these  patients  were  investigated.  Data  is  limited  for  some clinically relevant subgroups, e.g., diabetic foot infection, peripheral vascular ulcer infection, sternal wound, and vascular surgery wound infection. In addition limited numbers of patients with co-morbid factors such as diabetes mellitus (20%), peripheral vascular disease (7%) and with bacteraemia (3%) were enrolled.  Patients  with  severe  underlying  disease,  such  as  immunocompromised,  patients  with decubitus ulcer infection or patients that had infections requiring longer than 14 days of treatment (e.g. necrotizing  fasciitis)  were  not  enrolled.    Consequently,  the  limited  data  on  relevant  subpopulations (patients  with  diagnoses  other  than  cellulites,  patients  with  bacteraemia)  and  severely  ill  patients  is stated in section 4.4 of the SPC.

## Safety

The  Safety  Specification  covers  most  of  the  issues  that  are  considered  relevant  for  the  use  of tigecycline in clinical practice. Within the Pharmacovigilance Plan most of the activities planned are routine  pharmacovigilance  practices.  An  appropriate  risk  management  plan  for  identified  risks associated with the use of tigecycline has been agreed upon.

## Risk-benefit assessment

The  benefits  of  tigecycline  has  been  sufficiently  demonstrated  in  complicated  skin  and  soft  tissue infections  and  in  complicated  intra-abdominal  infections.  Concerns  over  the  severity  of  disease  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients enrolled into clinical trials and concerns over the lack of efficacy in such patients have been raised during the CHMP assessment. Also, concerns on whether the patients enrolled in such trials are representative of the target population in terms of the possible clinical diagnoses were raised. These issues are addressed in the SPC and in follow-up measures where the applicant will provide updated information either in the context of subsequent PSURs or as clinical study reports.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that pharmacovigilance activities (in relation with concerns over lack of efficacy) in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the concerns. No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information with  the  exception  of  a  specific  surveillance  study  for  the  European  Union  aimed  at  monitoring emerging  resistance.  A  paediatric  study  has  also  been  requested  as  a  Follow  Up  measure  to  be completed and submitted post-authorisation

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Tigecycline in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
