## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Kaftrio tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one non-Class I mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Kaftrio should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals with experience in the treatment of CF. If the patient's genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be performed to confirm the presence of at least one CFTR mutation that is responsive based on clinical and/or in vitro data (using a genotype assay) (see section 5.1). Kaftrio should only be used in patients diagnosed with CF. A diagnosis of CF should be made based on diagnostic guidelines and clinical judgement.

There are a limited number of patients who harbour mutations not listed in Table 5 that may be responsive to Kaftrio. In these cases, Kaftrio can be considered when the physician deems the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks and under close medical supervision. This excludes patients with two Class I

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(null) mutations (mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein) as they are not expected to respond to modulator therapy (see sections 4.1, 4.4, and 5.1).

Monitoring of transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin is recommended for all patients prior to initiating treatment, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of liver disease or transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered (see section 4.4).

## Posology

Adults and paediatric patients aged 6 years and older should be dosed according to Table 1.

| Table 1: Dosing recommendations for patients aged 6 years and older   | Table 1: Dosing recommendations for patients aged 6 years and older   | Table 1: Dosing recommendations for patients aged 6 years and older   | Table 1: Dosing recommendations for patients aged 6 years and older   |

The morning and evening dose should be taken approximately 12 hours apart, with fat-containing food (see Method of administration).

## Missed dose

If 6 hours or less have passed since the missed morning or evening dose, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible and continue on the original schedule.

If more than 6 hours have passed since:

- the missed morning dose, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible and should not take the evening dose. The next scheduled morning dose should be taken at the usual time. OR
- the missed evening dose, the patient should not take the missed dose. The next scheduled morning dose should be taken at the usual time.

Morning and evening doses should not be taken at the same time.

## Concomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors

When co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole, erythromycin, verapamil) or strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin, and clarithromycin), the dose should be reduced as in Table 2 (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly patient population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Treatment of patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) is not recommended. For patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the use of Kaftrio should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, it should be used with caution at a reduced dose (see Table 3).

Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but the exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with Kaftrio.

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment (see Table 3) (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2).

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. There is no experience in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor (IVA) in children aged less than 2 years have not yet been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

For oral use. Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole. The tablets should not be chewed, crushed, or broken before swallowing because there are no clinical data currently available to support other methods of administration; chewing or crushing the tablet is not recommended.

Kaftrio should be taken with fat-containing food. Examples of meals or snacks that contain fat are those prepared with butter or oils or those containing eggs, cheeses, nuts, whole milk, or meats (see section 5.2).

Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with Kaftrio (see section 4.5).

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Elevated transaminases and hepatic injury

Cases of liver failure leading to transplantation have been reported within the first 6 months of treatment in patients with and without pre-existing advanced liver disease. Elevated transaminases are common in patients with CF. In clinical studies, elevated transaminases were more frequently observed in patients treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to placebo. In patients taking IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, these elevations have sometimes been associated with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. Assessments of transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin are recommended for all patients prior to initiating treatment, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter (see section 4.2).

For patients with a history of liver disease or transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered.

Interrupt treatment and promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin if a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms of liver injury. Interrupt dosing in the event of ALT or AST &gt;5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST &gt;3 × ULN with total bilirubin &gt;2 × ULN. Closely monitor the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

laboratory tests until the abnormalities resolve. Following resolution, consider the benefits and risks of resuming treatment. Patients who resume treatment after interruption should be monitored closely.

In patients with pre-existing advanced liver disease, IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA should be used with caution and only if the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Treatment of patients with moderate hepatic impairment is not recommended. For patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the use of IVA/TEZ/ELX should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, it should be used with caution at a reduced dose (see Table 3).

Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2).

## Depression

Depression (including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) has been reported in patients treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX, usually occurring within three months of treatment initiation and in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders (see section 4.8). In some cases, symptom improvement was reported after dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. Patients (and caregivers) should be alerted about the need to monitor for depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, unusual changes in behaviour, anxiety, or insomnia and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present.

## Paediatric population

In young children (aged 2-5 years) treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX behavioural changes have been reported, which occurred usually within the first two months of treatment initiation. In some cases, symptom improvement was reported after treatment discontinuation.

## Renal impairment

There is no experience in patients with severe renal impairment/end-stage renal disease therefore caution is recommended in this population (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Mutations unlikely to respond to modulator therapy

Patients with a genotype consisting of two CFTR mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein (i.e., two Class I mutations) are not expected to respond to Kaftrio treatment.

## Clinical studies comparing IVA/TEZ/ELX to TEZ/IVA or IVA

No clinical study has been conducted to directly compare IVA/TEZ/ELX to TEZ/IVA or IVA in patients not harbouring F508del variants.

## Patients after organ transplantation

IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone organ transplantation. Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for interactions with commonly used immunosuppressants.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rash events

Rash events typically occur during the first month of therapy. Most events were mild to moderate in severity and in rare cases, rash was associated with additional symptoms such as fever or facial swelling. In the majority of cases, administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX was continued and the rash resolved without treatment. Children have a higher incidence rate compared to adults. The incidence of rash events was also higher in females compared to males, particularly in females taking hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.8). A role for hormonal contraceptives in the occurrence of rash cannot be excluded. For patients taking hormonal contraceptives who develop rash, interrupting treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA and hormonal contraceptives should be considered. Following the resolution of rash, it should be considered if resuming IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA without hormonal contraceptives is appropriate. If rash does not recur, resumption of hormonal contraceptives can be considered (see section 4.8).

## Elderly

Clinical studies of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA did not include sufficient number of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether response in these patients is different from younger adults. Dose recommendations are based on the pharmacokinetic profile and knowledge from studies with tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA) in combination with IVA, and IVA monotherapy (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Interactions with medicinal products

## CYP3A inducers

Exposure to IVA is significantly decreased and exposures to ELX and TEZ are expected to decrease by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, potentially resulting in the reduced efficacy of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA; therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## CYP3A inhibitors

Exposures of ELX, TEZ and IVA are increased when co-administered with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. The dose of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA should be adjusted when used concomitantly with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see section 4.5 and Table 2 in section 4.2).

## Cataracts

Cases of non-congenital lens opacities without impact on vision have been reported in paediatric patients treated with IVA-containing regimens. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use, exposure to radiation) a possible risk attributable to treatment with IVA cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in paediatric patients initiating treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (see section 5.3).

## Excipients with known effect

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

ELX, TEZ and IVA are substrates of CYP3A (IVA is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A). Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers may result in reduced exposures and thus reduced IVA/TEZ/ELX efficacy. Co-administration of IVA with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased IVA area under the curve (AUC) by 89%. ELX and TEZ exposures are also expected to decrease during co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers; therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.4).

Examples of strong CYP3A inducers include:

- rifampicin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum )

## CYP3A inhibitors

Co-administration with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased ELX AUC by 2.8-fold and TEZ AUC by 4.0- to 4.5-fold. When co-administered with itraconazole and ketoconazole, IVA AUC increased by 15.6-fold and 8.5-fold, respectively. The dose of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA should be reduced when coadministered with strong CYP3A inhibitors (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.4).

Examples of strong CYP3A inhibitors include:

- ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole
- telithromycin and clarithromycin

Simulations indicated that co-administration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors fluconazole, erythromycin and verapamil, may increase ELX and TEZ AUC by approximately 1.9- to 2.3-fold. Co-administration of fluconazole increased IVA AUC by 2.9-fold. The dose of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA should be reduced when co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.4).

Examples of moderate CYP3A inhibitors include:

- fluconazole
- erythromycin

Co-administration with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of ELX, TEZ and IVA. Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA (see section 4.2).

## Ciprofloxacin

ELX/TEZ/IVA was not evaluated for concomitant use with ciprofloxacin. However, ciprofloxacin had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of TEZ or IVA and is not expected to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of ELX. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary during concomitant administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX with ciprofloxacin.

## Potential for interaction with transporters

In vitro studies showed that ELX is a substrate for the efflux transporters P-gp and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) but is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Exposure to ELX is not expected to be affected significantly by concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact.

In vitro studies showed that TEZ is a substrate for the uptake transporter OATP1B1 and efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP. TEZ is not a substrate for OATP1B3. Exposure to TEZ is not expected to be affected significantly by concomitant inhibitors of OATP1B1, P-gp, or BCRP due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact. However, exposure to M2-TEZ (TEZ metabolite) may be increased by inhibitors of P-gp. Therefore, caution should be used when P-gp inhibitors (e.g., ciclosporin) are used with IVA/TEZ/ELX.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In vitro studies showed that IVA is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or P-gp. IVA and its metabolites are substrates of BCRP in vitro . Due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact, co-administration of BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter exposure of IVA and M1-IVA, while any potential changes in M6-IVA exposures are not expected to be clinically relevant.

## Medicinal products affected by ELX, TEZ and/or IVA

## CYP2C9 substrates

IVA  may  inhibit  CYP2C9;  therefore,  monitoring  of  the  international  normalised  ratio  (INR)  during co-administration of warfarin with IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA is recommended. Other medicinal products for which exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal products should be used with caution.

## Potential for interaction with transporters

Co-administration of IVA or TEZ/IVA with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin AUC by 1.3-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by IVA. Administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used concomitantly with digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index such as ciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus and tacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used.

ELX and M23-ELX inhibit uptake by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro . TEZ/IVA increased the AUC of pitavastatin, an OATP1B1 substrate, by 1.2-fold. Co-administration with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA may increase exposures of medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters, such as statins, glyburide, nateglinide and repaglinide. When used concomitantly with substrates of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used. Bilirubin is an OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate. In study 445-102, mild increases in mean total bilirubin were observed (up to 4.0 µmol/L change from baseline). This finding is consistent with the in vitro inhibition of bilirubin transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 by ELX and M23-ELX.

ELX and IVA are inhibitors of BCRP. Co-administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX, and IVA may increase exposures of medicinal products that are substrates of BCRP, such as rosuvastatin. When used concomitantly with substrates of BCRP, appropriate monitoring should be used.

## Hormonal contraceptives

IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA has been studied with ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel and was found to have no clinically relevant effect on the exposures of the oral contraceptive. IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA is not expected to have an impact on the efficacy of oral contraceptives.

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of ELX, TEZ, or IVA in pregnant women. Animal studies do not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of IVA/TEZ/ELX during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

Limited data show that ELX, TEZ, and IVA are excreted in human milk and have been quantified in plasma of breastfed newborns/infants of treated women. There is insufficient information on the effects of IVA/TEZ/ELX in newborns/infants. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from IVA/TEZ/ELX therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

There are no data available on the effect of ELX, TEZ and IVA on fertility in humans. TEZ had no effects on fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at clinically relevant exposures. ELX and IVA had an effect on fertility in rats (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA has a minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Dizziness has been reported in patients receiving IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA as well as IVA (see section 4.8). Patients experiencing dizziness should be advised not to drive or use machines until symptoms abate.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions experienced by patients aged 12 years and older who received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA were headache (17.3%), diarrhoea (12.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (11.9%) and aminotransferase increased (10.9%).

Serious adverse reactions of rash experienced by patients aged 12 years and older were reported in 1.5% patients treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (see section 4.4).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Transaminase elevations

In study 445-102, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt;8, &gt;5, or &gt;3 × the ULN was 1.5%, 2.5% and 7.9% in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.5% and 5.5% in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of adverse reactions of transaminase elevations was 10.9% in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients and 4.0% in placebo-treated patients.

During the open-label studies, some patients discontinued treatment due to elevated transaminases. Postmarketing cases of treatment discontinuation due to elevated transaminases have been reported (see section 4.4).

## Rash events

Studies in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients above 12 years of age showed an incidence of rash events (e.g., rash, rash pruritic) of 10.9% (study 445-102) compared to 6.5% in placebo-treated patients. The paediatric population showed a higher incidence rate (see section Paediatric population for further details). The incidence of rash events by patient sex was 5.8% in males and 16.3% in females in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients and 4.8% in males and 8.3% in females in placebo-treated patients. In patients treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX, the incidence of rash events was 20.5% in females taking hormonal contraceptive and 13.6% in females not taking hormonal contraceptive (see section 4.4).

Overall, rash events typically occur during the first month of therapy. Most events were mild to moderate in severity, and in rare cases, rash was associated with additional symptoms such as fever or facial swelling. In the majority of cases, administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX was continued and the rash resolved without treatment.

## Increased creatine phosphokinase

In study 445-102, the incidence of maximum creatine phosphokinase &gt;5 × the ULN was 10.4% in IVA/TEZ/ELX- and 5.0% in placebo-treated patients. The observed creatine phosphokinase elevations were generally transient and asymptomatic and many were preceded by exercise.

## Increased blood pressure

In study 445-102, the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 3.5 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, respectively for IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients (baseline: 113 mmHg systolic and 69 mmHg diastolic) and 0.9 mmHg and 0.5 mmHg, respectively for placebo-treated patients (baseline: 114 mmHg systolic and 70 mmHg diastolic).

The proportion of patients who had systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg on at least two occasions was 5.0% and 3.0%, respectively in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients compared with 3.5% and 3.5%, respectively in placebo-treated patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The safety data of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in studies 445-102, 445-103, 445-104, 445106, 445-111, and 445-124 and was evaluated in 272 patients between 2 to less than 18 years of age. The safety profile is generally consistent among paediatric and adult patients.

During study 445-106 in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt;8, &gt;5, and &gt;3 × ULN were 0.0%, 1.5%, and 10.6%, respectively. No IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients had transaminase elevation &gt;3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt;2 × ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations (see section 4.4).

During study 445-111 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt;8, &gt;5, and &gt;3 × ULN were 1.3%, 2.7%, and 8.0% respectively. No IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients had transaminase elevation &gt;3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt;2 × ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations (see section 4.4).

## Rash

While studies in patients above 12 years of age showed an incidence rate of 10.9% (study 445-102), patients between 6 and 11 years of age had an incidence rate of 24.2% (study 445-106). During study 445-111 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, 15 (20.0%) subjects had at least 1 rash event, 4 (9.8%) females and 11 (32.4%) males.

## Lenticular opacity

One patient had an adverse event of lenticular opacity.

## Behavioural changes

Most cases of behavioural changes have been reported in younger children aged 2-5 years.

## Other special populations

With the exception of sex differences in rash, the safety profile of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA was generally similar across all subgroups of patients, including analysis by age, baseline percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) and geographic regions.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No specific antidote is available for overdose with IVA/TEZ/ELX. Treatment of overdose consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products, ATC code: R07AX32

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Mechanism of action

ELX and TEZ are CFTR correctors that bind to different sites on the CFTR protein and have an additive effect in facilitating the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR to increase the amount of CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface compared to either molecule alone. IVA potentiates the channel open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface.

The combined effect of ELX, TEZ and IVA is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increased CFTR activity as measured by CFTR mediated chloride transport.

## CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing mutant CFTR

The chloride transport response of mutant CFTR protein to IVA/TEZ/ELX was determined in Ussing chamber electrophysiology studies using a panel of FRT cell lines transfected with individual CFTR mutations. IVA/TEZ/ELX increased chloride transport in FRT cells expressing select CFTR mutations.

The in vitro CFTR chloride transport response threshold was designated as a net increase of at least 10% of normal over baseline because it is predictive or reasonably expected to predict clinical response. For individual mutations, the magnitude of the net change over baseline in CFTR-mediated chloride transport in vitro is not correlated with the magnitude of clinical response.

In CF, the presence of one CFTR mutation responsive to IVA/TEZ/ELX based on in vitro data in FRT cells, will likely result in a clinical response.

Table 5 lists CFTR mutations included in the indication for treatment with Kaftrio. The occurrence of CFTR mutations listed in this table should not be used in lieu of a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, nor as a sole determinant for prescribing purposes.

There are people with CF harbouring two rare, nonF508del CFTR mutations not listed in Table 5. Provided that they do not harbour two Class I (null) mutations (mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein) (see section 4.1), they may respond to treatment. In these cases, Kaftrio can be considered when the physician deems the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks and under close medical supervision.

The individual diagnosis of CF should be based on diagnostic guidelines and clinical judgement as considerable variability exists in phenotype for patients harbouring the same genotype.

- ⁎ Mutations supported by clinical data.
- † Mutations supported by Real-World data in ≥ 5 patients.
- ‡  Complex/compound mutations where a single allele of the CFTR gene has multiple mutations; these exist independent of the presence of mutations on the other allele.

Non-annotated mutations are included based on the FRT assay in which a positive response is indicative of a clinical response.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Effects on sweat chloride

In study 445-102 (patients with an F508del mutation on one allele and a mutation on the second allele that predicts either no production of a CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that does not transport chloride and is not responsive to other CFTR modulators [IVA and TEZ/IVA] in vitro ), a reduction in sweat chloride was observed from baseline at week 4 and sustained through the 24-week treatment period. The treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to placebo for mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -41.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -44.4, -39.3; P &lt; 0.0001).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study 445-103 (patients homozygous for the F508del mutation), the treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA for mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline at week 4 was -45.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -50.1, -40.1; P &lt; 0.0001).

In study 445-104 (patients heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele with a gating defect or residual CFTR activity), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 8 for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group was -22.3 mmol/L (95% CI: -24.5, -20.2; P &lt; 0.0001). The treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to the control group (IVA group or TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA group) was -23.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.1, -20.1; P &lt; 0.0001).

In study 445-106 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline (n=62) through week 24 (n=60) was -60.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -63.7, -58.2) * . The mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 12 (n=59) was -58.6 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.1, -56.1).

* Not all participants included in the analyses had data available for all follow-up visits, especially from week 16 onwards. The ability to collect data at week 24 was hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Week 12 data were less impacted by the pandemic.

In study 445-116 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation), treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA resulted in reduction in sweat chloride through week 24, as compared to placebo. The LS mean treatment difference for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group versus placebo for absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -51.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -55.3, -47.1; nominal P &lt; 0.0001).

In study 445-124 (patients aged 6 years and older with a qualifying nonF508del , IVA/TEZ/ELXresponsive CFTR mutation [see Table 6]), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 compared to placebo was -28.3 mmol/L (95% CI: -32.1, -24.5 mmol/L; P &lt; 0.0001).

## Cardiovascular effects

## Effect on QT interval

At doses up to 2 times the maximum recommended dose of ELX and 3 times the maximum recommended dose of TEZ and IVA, the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects was not prolonged to any clinically relevant extent.

## Heart rate

In study 445-102, mean decreases in heart rate of 3.7 to 5.8 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline (76 bpm) were observed in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in patients with CF was demonstrated in six phase 3 studies. Patients enrolled in these studies were homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation with minimal function (MF), a gating defect, or residual CFTR activity on the second allele. Study 445-124 enrolled patients who had at least one qualifying nonF508del, IVA/TEZ/ELX-responsive CFTR mutation (see Table 6).

Study 445-102 was a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients who had an F508del mutation on one allele and an MF mutation on the second allele. CF patients eligible for this study were required to either have Class I mutations that predicted no CFTR protein being produced (including nonsense mutations, canonical splice mutations and insertion/deletion frameshift mutations both small (≤3 nucleotide) and non-small (&gt;3 nucleotide)), or missense mutations which results in CFTR protein that does not transport chloride and is not responsive to IVA and TEZ/IVA in vitro . The most frequent alleles with minimal function assessed in the study were G542X , W1282X , R553X , and R1162X ; 621+1G→T , 17171G→A , and 1898+1G→A ; 3659delC , and 394delTT ; CFTRdele2,3 ; and N1303K , I507del , G85E , R347P , and R560T . A total of 403 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 26.2 years) were randomised and dosed to receive placebo or IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. Patients had a ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90%. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 61.4% (range: 32.3%, 97.1%).

Study 445-103 was a 4-week, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study in patients who were homozygous for the F508del mutation. A total of 107 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 28.4 years) received TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA during a 4-week open-label run-in period and were then randomised and dosed to receive either IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA or TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA during a 4-week double-blind treatment period. Patients had a ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90%. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline, following the run-in period was 60.9% (range: 35.0%, 89.0%).

Study 445-104 was an 8-week, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study in patients who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele with a gating defect (Gating) or residual CFTR activity (RF). A total of 258 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 37.7 years) received either IVA (F/Gating) or TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA (F/RF) during a 4-week open-label run-in period and patients with the F/R117H genotype received IVA during the run-in period. Patients were then randomised and dosed to receive either IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA or remained on the CFTR modulator therapy received during the run-in period. Patients had a ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90%. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline, following the run-in period, was 67.6% (range: 29.7%, 113.5%).

Study 445-106 was a 24-week open-label study in patients who were homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation. A total of 66 patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean age at baseline 9.3 years) were dosed according to weight. Patients weighing &lt;30 kg at baseline were administered two IVA 37.5 mg/TEZ 25 mg/ELX 50 mg tablets in the morning and one IVA 75 mg tablet in the evening. Patients weighing ≥30 kg at baseline were administered two IVA 75 mg/TEZ 50 mg/ELX 100 mg tablets in the morning and one IVA 150 mg tablet in the evening. Patients had a ppFEV1 ≥40% and weighed ≥15 kg at screening. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 88.8% (range: 39.0%, 127.1%).

Study 445-116 was a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean age at baseline 9.2 years) who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation. A total of 121 patients were randomised to receive either placebo or IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. Patients who received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA weighing &lt;30 kg at baseline were administered two IVA 37.5 mg/TEZ 25 mg/ELX 50 mg tablets in the morning and one IVA 75 mg tablet in the evening. Patients weighing ≥30 kg at baseline were administered two IVA 75 mg/TEZ 50 mg/ELX 100 mg tablets in the morning and one IVA 150 mg tablet in the evening. At screening, patients had a ppFEV1 ≥70% [mean ppFEV1 at baseline of 89.3% (range: 44.6%, 121.8%)], LCI2.5 result ≥7.5 [mean LCI2.5 at baseline of 10.01 (range: 6.91, 18.36)], and weighed ≥15 kg.

Study 445-124 was a 24-week, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study in patients aged 6 years and older. Patients who had at least one qualifying nonF508del , IVA/TEZ/ELXresponsive CFTR mutation (see Table 6) and did not have an exclusionary (other IVA/TEZ/ELXresponsive) mutation were eligible for the study.

A total of 307 patients were enrolled and dosed according to age and weight. Patients ≥6 to &lt;12 years weighing &lt;30 kg at baseline (n=31) were administered ELX 100 mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h. Patients ≥6 to &lt;12 years weighing ≥30 kg at baseline were administered ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h. Patients ≥12 years at baseline were administered ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h. Patients had a ppFEV1 ≥40% and ≤100% and aged 6 years or older at screening. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 67.7% (range: 34.0%, 108.7%).

Patients in these studies continued on their CF therapies (e.g., bronchodilators, inhaled antibiotics, dornase alfa and hypertonic saline), but discontinued any previous CFTR modulator therapies, except for study medicinal products. Patients had a confirmed diagnosis of CF.

Study CFD-016 was an observational, retrospective study evaluating Real-World clinical outcomes in patients aged 6 years and older. Patients had at least one IVA/TEZ/ELX-responsive mutation and did not have an F508del mutation. A total of 422 patients were evaluated with a total of 82 IVA/TEZ/ELXresponsive nonF508del mutations represented. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 74.15%.

In studies 445-102, 445-103, 445-104, 445-106, and 445-124 patients who had lung infection with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status, including but not limited to Burkholderia cenocepacia , Burkholderia dolosa , or Mycobacterium abscessus , or who had an abnormal liver function test at screening (ALT, AST, ALP, or GGT ≥3 × ULN, or total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN), were excluded. Patients in studies 445-102 and 445-103 were eligible to roll over into a 192-week open-label extension study (study 445-105).

Patients in studies 445-104, 445-106, 445-116, and 445-124 were eligible to roll over into separate openlabel extension studies.

## Study 445-102

In study 445-102 the primary endpoint was mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through week 24. Treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to placebo resulted in statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 of 14.3 percentage points (95% CI: 12.7, 15.8; P &lt; 0.0001) (see Table 7). Mean improvement in ppFEV1 was observed at the first assessment on day 15 and sustained through the 24-week treatment period. Improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, baseline ppFEV1, sex, and geographic region.

A total of 18 patients receiving IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA had ppFEV1 &lt;40 percentage points at baseline. The safety and efficacy in this subgroup were consistent to those observed in the overall population. The mean treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA- compared to placebo-treated patients for absolute change in ppFEV1 through week 24 in this subgroup was 18.4 percentage points (95% CI: 11.5, 25.3).

* A pulmonary exacerbation was defined as a change in antibiotic therapy (IV, inhaled, or oral) as a result of 4 or more of 12 pre-specified sino-pulmonary signs/symptoms.

† Estimated event rate per year was calculated based on 48 weeks per year.

Study 445-103

In study 445-103 the primary endpoint was mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at week 4 of the double-blind treatment period. Treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA resulted in a statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

10.0 percentage points (95% CI: 7.4, 12.6; P &lt; 0.0001) (see Table 8). Improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, sex, baseline ppFEV1, and geographic region.

See Table 8 for a summary of primary and key secondary outcomes in the overall trial population.

In a post-hoc analysis of patients with (N=66) and without (N=41) recent CFTR modulator use, an improvement in ppFEV1 of 7.8 percentage points (95% CI: 4.8, 10.8) and 13.2 percentage points (95% CI: 8.5, 17.9), respectively was observed.

Treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA resulted in statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 from baseline of 3.7 percentage points (95% CI: 2.8, 4.6; P &lt; 0.0001) (see Table 9). Overall improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, sex, baseline ppFEV1, geographic region, and genotype groups (F/Gating or F/RF).

See Table 9 for a summary of primary and secondary outcomes in the overall trial population.

In a subgroup analysis of patients with an F/Gating genotype, the treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (N=50) compared with IVA (N=45) for mean absolute change in ppFEV1 was 5.8 percentage points (95% CI: 3.5, 8.0). In a subgroup analysis of patients with an F/RF genotype, the treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (N=82) compared with TEZ/IVA in

combination with IVA (N=81) for mean absolute change in ppFEV1 was 2.0 percentage points (95% CI: 0.5, 3.4). The results of the F/Gating and the F/RF genotype subgroups for improvement in sweat chloride and CFQ-R respiratory domain score were consistent with the overall results.

Study 445-105

Study 445-105 was a 192-week open-label extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. Patients who rolled over from studies 445-102 (N=399) and 445-103 (N=107) received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA.

In study 445-105 patients from the control arms in the parent studies showed improvements in efficacy endpoints consistent with those observed in subjects who received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in the parent studies. Patients from the control arms as well as patients who received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in the parent studies, showed sustained improvements. Secondary efficacy endpoints are summarised in Table 10.

†  For subjects who were randomised   to the IVA/TEZ/ELX group, the Cumulative TC Efficacy Period includes data from the parent studies through 192 weeks of treatments in study 445-105 (N=255, including 4 patients that did not rollover into study 445-105). For subjects who were randomised to the Placebo or TEZ/IVA group, the Cumulative TC Efficacy Period includes data from 192 weeks of treatments in study 445-105 only (N=255).

## Study 445-124

The safety and efficacy of IVA/TEZ/ELX in 307 patients with CF aged 6 years and older without an F508del mutation but with a qualifying IVA/TEZ/ELX-responsive CFTR mutation were evaluated (study 445-124).

In study 445-124 the primary endpoint of efficacy was mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through week 24. Secondary endpoints were absolute change in sweat chloride, CFQ-R respiratory domain score, growth parameters (BMI, weight), and number of PEx. See Table 11 for a summary of primary and secondary efficacy outcomes.

## Study CFD-016

Study CFD-016 included 422 homozygotic non -F508del CF patients harbouring at least one IVA/TEZ/ELX-responsive CFTR mutation based on in vitro FRT data. After a median follow-up of 1.31 year, the mean change in ppFEV1 was 4.53% (95% CI: 3.5, 5.56). Almost all subgroups according to CFTR mutation that included ≥5 patients showed an improvement in ppFEV1 over that time, except for the subgroup with R74W.

## Paediatric population

Paediatric patients aged 6 to &lt;12 years

## Study 445-106

In study 445-106 the primary endpoint of safety and tolerability was evaluated through 24 weeks in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years. Secondary endpoints were evaluation of pharmacokinetics and efficacy.

See Table 12 for a summary of secondary efficacy outcomes.

## Study 445-107

Study 445-107 is a 192-week, two-part (part A and part B), open-label extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in patients who completed study 445-106. Efficacy endpoints were included as secondary endpoints. The final analysis of this study was conducted in 64 paediatric patients aged 6 years and older. With 192 additional weeks of treatment, sustained improvements in ppFEV1, SwCl, CFQ-R RD score, and LCI2.5 were shown, consistent with the results observed in the study 445-106.

## Study 445-116

In study 445-116 treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years resulted in statistically significant improvement through 24 weeks in the primary endpoint (LCI2.5). The LS mean treatment difference for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group versus placebo for the absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through week 24 was -2.26 (95% CI: -2.71, -1.81; P &lt; 0.0001).

## Study 445-124

In study 445-124 the safety and efficacy of IVA/TEZ/ELX in patients with CF aged 6 years and older without an F508del mutation were evaluated. A post-hoc efficacy analysis was conducted in 31 patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

aged 6-12 years, of whom 23 patients received IVA/TEZ/ELX. The mean change (SD) from baseline was 10.2% (16.2) for ppFEV1 and -37.7 (18.8) mmol/L for sweat chloride.

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in one or more subset of the paediatric population in cystic fibrosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of ELX, TEZ and IVA are similar between healthy adult subjects and patients with CF. Following initiation of once-daily dosing of ELX and TEZ and twice-daily dosing of IVA, plasma concentrations of ELX, TEZ and IVA reach steady state within approximately 7 days for ELX, within 8 days for TEZ, and within 3-5 days for IVA. Upon dosing IVA/TEZ/ELX to steady state, the accumulation ratio is approximately 3.6 for ELX, 2.8 for TEZ and 4.7 for IVA. Key pharmacokinetic parameters for ELX, TEZ and IVA at steady state in patients with CF aged 12 years and older are shown in Table 13.

## Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of ELX when administered orally in the fed state is approximately 80%. ELX is absorbed with a median (range) time to maximum concentration (tmax) of approximately 6 hours (4 to 12 hours) while the median (range) tmax of TEZ and IVA is approximately 3 hours (2 to 4 hours) and 4 hours (3 to 6 hours), respectively. ELX exposure (AUC) increases approximately 1.9- to 2.5-fold when administered with a moderate-fat meal relative to fasted conditions. IVA exposure increases approximately 2.5- to 4.0-fold when administered with fat-containing meals relative to fasted conditions, while food has no effect on the exposure of TEZ (see section 4.2).

As exposures of ELX were approximately 20% lower after administration of the IVA/TEZ/ELX granules relative to the reference IVA/TEZ/ELX tablet, the formulations are not considered interchangeable.

## Distribution

ELX is &gt;99% bound to plasma proteins and TEZ is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, in both cases primarily to albumin. IVA is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin, and also to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and human gamma-globulin. After oral administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, the mean (±SD) apparent volume of distribution of ELX, TEZ and IVA was 53.7 L (17.7), 82.0 L (22.3) and 293 L (89.8), respectively. ELX, TEZ and IVA do not partition preferentially into human red blood cells.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Biotransformation

ELX is metabolised extensively in humans, mainly by CYP3A4/5. Following oral administration of a single dose of 200 mg 14 C-ELX to healthy male subjects, M23-ELX was the only major circulating metabolite. M23-ELX has similar potency to ELX and is considered pharmacologically active.

TEZ is metabolised extensively in humans, mainly by CYP3A4/5. Following oral administration of a single dose of 100 mg  14 C-TEZ to healthy male subjects, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ were the three major circulating metabolites of TEZ in humans. M1-TEZ has similar potency to that of TEZ and is considered pharmacologically active. M2-TEZ is much less pharmacologically active than TEZ or M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ is not considered pharmacologically active. Another minor circulating metabolite, M3-TEZ, is formed by direct glucuronidation of TEZ.

IVA is also metabolised extensively in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that IVA is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4/5. M1-IVA and M6-IVA are the two major metabolites of IVA in humans. M1-IVA has approximately one-sixth the potency of IVA and is considered pharmacologically active. M6-IVA is not considered pharmacologically active.

The effect of the CYP3A4*22 heterozygous genotype on TEZ, IVA and ELX exposure is consistent with the effect of co-administration of a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is not clinically relevant. No doseadjustment of TEZ, IVA or ELX is considered necessary. The effect in CYP3A4*22 homozygous genotype patients is expected to be stronger. However, no data are available for such patients.

## Elimination

Following multiple dosing in the fed state, the mean (±SD) apparent clearance values of ELX, TEZ and IVA at steady state were 1.18 (0.29) L/h, 0.79 (0.10) L/h and 10.2 (3.13) L/h, respectively. The mean (SD) terminal half-lives of ELX, TEZ and IVA following administration of the IVA/TEZ/ELX fixed-dose combination tablets are approximately 24.7 (4.87) hours, 60.3 (15.7) hours and 13.1 (2.98) hours, respectively. The mean (SD) effective half-life of TEZ following administration of the IVA/TEZ/ELX fixed-dose combination tablets is 11.9 (3.79) hours.

Following oral administration of 14 C-ELX alone, the majority of ELX (87.3%) was eliminated in the faeces, primarily as metabolites.

Following oral administration of 14 C-TEZ alone, the majority of the dose (72%) was excreted in the faeces (unchanged or as the M2-TEZ) and about 14% was recovered in urine (mostly as M2-TEZ), resulting in a mean overall recovery of 86% up to 26 days after the dose.

Following oral administration of 14 C-IVA alone, the majority of IVA (87.8%) was eliminated in the faeces after metabolic conversion.

For ELX, TEZ and IVA there was negligible urinary excretion of unchanged medicine.

## Hepatic impairment

ELX alone or in combination with TEZ and IVA has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15). Following multiple doses of ELX, TEZ and IVA for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9) had an approximately 25% higher AUC and a 12% higher Cmax for ELX, 73% higher AUC and a 70% higher Cmax for M23-ELX, 20% higher AUC but similar Cmax for TEZ, 22% lower AUC and a 20% lower Cmax for M1-TEZ, and a 1.5-fold higher AUC and a 10% higher Cmax for IVA compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. The effect of moderately impaired hepatic function on total exposure (based

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

on summed values of ELX and its M23-ELX metabolite) was 36% higher AUC and a 24% higher Cmax compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8).

## Tezacaftor and ivacaftor

Following multiple doses of TEZ and IVA for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function had an approximately 36% higher AUC and a 10% higher Cmax for TEZ, and a 1.5-fold higher AUC but similar Cmax for IVA compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics.

In a study with IVA alone, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function had similar IVA Cmax, but an approximately 2.0-fold higher IVA AUC0-∞ compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics.

## Renal impairment

ELX alone or in combination with TEZ and IVA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30 mL/min] or in patients with endstage renal disease.

In human pharmacokinetic studies of ELX, TEZ and IVA, there was minimal elimination of ELX, TEZ and IVA in urine (only 0.23%, 13.7% [0.79% as unchanged medicine] and 6.6% of total radioactivity, respectively).

Based on population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, exposure of ELX was similar in patients with mild renal impairment (N=75; eGFR 60 to less than 90 mL/min) relative to those with normal renal function (N=341; eGFR 90 mL/min or greater).

In population PK analysis conducted in 817 patients administered TEZ alone or in combination with IVA in phase 2 or phase 3 studies indicated that mild renal impairment (N=172; eGFR 60 to less than 90 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (N=8; eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min) did not affect the clearance of TEZ significantly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Gender

The pharmacokinetic parameters of ELX (244 males compared to 174 females), TEZ and IVA are similar in males and females.

## Race

Race had no clinically meaningful effect on ELX exposure based on population PK analysis in whites (N=373) and non-whites (N=45). The non-white races consisted of 30 Blacks or African Americans, 1 with multiple racial background and 14 with other ethnic background (no Asians).

Very limited PK data indicate comparable exposure of TEZ in whites (N=652) and non-whites (N=8). The non-white races consisted of 5 Blacks or African Americans and 3 Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders.

Race had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of IVA in whites (N=379) and non-whites (N=29) based on a population PK analysis. The non-white races consisted of 27 African Americans and 2 Asians.

## Elderly

Clinical trials of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA did not include sufficient number of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether response in these patients is different from younger adults (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Paediatric population

ELX, TEZ and IVA exposures observed in phase 3 studies as determined using population PK analysis are presented by age group in Table 14. Exposures of ELX, TEZ and IVA in patients aged 2 to less than 18 years are within the range observed in patients aged 18 years and older.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Elexacaftor

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.

## Fertility and pregnancy

The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for fertility findings was 55 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on summed AUCs of ELX and its metabolite) in male rats and 25 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ELX and its metabolite) in female rats. In rat, at doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), degeneration and atrophy of seminiferous tubules are correlated to oligo-/aspermia and cellular debris in epididymides. In dog testes, minimal or mild, bilateral degeneration/atrophy of the seminiferous tubules was present in males administered 14 mg/kg/day ELX (15 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ELX and its metabolite) that did not resolve during the recovery period, however without further sequelae. The human relevance of these findings is unknown.

ELX was not teratogenic in rats at 40 mg/kg/day and at 125 mg/kg/day in rabbits (approximately 9 and 4 times, respectively, the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ELX and its metabolite [for rat] and AUC of ELX [for rabbit]) with developmental findings being limited to lower mean foetal body weight at ≥25 mg/kg/day.

Placental transfer of ELX was observed in pregnant rats.

## Tezacaftor

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction and development. Placental transfer of TEZ was observed in pregnant rats.

Juvenile toxicity studies in rats exposed during postnatal day 7 to 35 (PND 7-35) showed mortality and moribundity, even at low doses. Findings were dose related and generally more severe when dosing with tezacaftor was initiated earlier in the postnatal period. Exposure in rats from PND 21-49 did not show toxicity at the highest dose which was approximately two times the intended human exposure. Tezacaftor and its metabolite, M1-TEZ, are substrates for P-glycoprotein. Lower brain levels of P-glycoprotein activity in younger rats resulted in higher brain levels of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ. These findings are likely not relevant for the indicated paediatric population of 2 years of age and older, for whom P-glycoprotein expression levels are equivalent to levels observed in adults.

## Ivacaftor

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.

## Fertility and pregnancy

The NOAEL for fertility findings was 100 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of IVA and its metabolites) in male rats and 100 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of IVA and its metabolites) in female rats.

In the pre- and post-natal study IVA decreased survival and lactation indices and caused a reduction in pup body weights. The NOAEL for viability and growth in the offspring provides an exposure level of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

approximately 3 times the systemic exposure of IVA and its metabolites in adult humans at the MRHD. Placental transfer of IVA was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits.

## Juvenile animal studies

Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal day 7 through day 35 at IVA exposure levels of 0.21 time the MRHD based on systemic exposure of IVA and its metabolites. This finding has not been observed in foetuses derived from rat dams treated with IVA on gestation days 7 to day 17, in rat pups exposed to IVA through milk ingestion up to postnatal day 20, in 7-week-old rats, nor in 3.5- to 5-month-old dogs treated with IVA. The potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown (see section 4.4).

## Ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

Combination repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs involving the co-administration of ELX, TEZ and IVA to assess the potential for additive and/or synergistic toxicity did not produce any unexpected toxicities or interactions. The potential for synergistic toxicity on male reproduction has not been assessed.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Kaftrio granules are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in paediatric patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who have at least one non-Class I mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Kaftrio should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals with experience in the treatment of CF. If the patient's genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be performed to confirm the presence of at least one CFTR mutation that is responsive based on clinical and/or in vitro data (using a genotype assay) (see section 5.1). Kaftrio should only be used in patients diagnosed with CF. A diagnosis of CF should be made based on diagnostic guidelines and clinical judgement.

There are a limited number of patients who harbour mutations not listed in Table 5 that may be responsive to Kaftrio. In these cases, Kaftrio can be considered when the physician deems the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks and under close medical supervision. This excludes patients with two Class I

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(null) mutations (mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein) as they are not expected to respond to modulator therapy (see sections 4.1, 4.4, and 5.1).

Monitoring of transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin is recommended for all patients prior to initiating treatment, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of liver disease or transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered (see section 4.4).

## Posology

Paediatric patients aged 2 to less than 6 years should be dosed according to Table 1.

The morning and evening dose should be taken approximately 12 hours apart, with fat-containing food (see Method of administration).

## Missed dose

If 6 hours or less have passed since the missed morning or evening dose, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible and continue on the original schedule.

If more than 6 hours have passed since:

- the missed morning dose, the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible and should not take the evening dose. The next scheduled morning dose should be taken at the usual time.

## OR

- the missed evening dose, the patient should not take the missed dose. The next scheduled morning dose should be taken at the usual time.

Morning and evening doses should not be taken at the same time.

## Concomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors

When co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole, erythromycin, verapamil) or strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin, and clarithromycin), the dose should be reduced as in Table 2 (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

## Special populations

## Hepatic impairment

Treatment of patients aged 2 to less than 6 years with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) is not recommended. For patients aged 2 to less than 6 years with moderate hepatic impairment, the use of Kaftrio should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, it should be used with caution at a reduced dose (see Table 3).

Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but the exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with Kaftrio.

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment (see Table 3) (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2).

The evening dose of the ivacaftor granules should not be taken. | Should not be used |

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. There is no experience in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of Kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor (IVA) in children aged less than 2 years have not yet been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

For oral use. The entire contents of each sachet of granules should be mixed with one teaspoon (5 mL) of age-appropriate soft food or liquid and the mixture completely consumed. Food or liquid should be at room temperature or below. Each sachet is for single use only. Once mixed, the product has been shown to be stable for one hour, and therefore should be ingested during this period. Some examples of soft food or liquids include pureed fruits or vegetables, yogurt, water, milk, or juice. A fat-containing meal or snack should be consumed just before or after dosing.

Kaftrio should be taken with fat-containing food. Examples of meals or snacks that contain fat are those prepared with butter or oils or those containing eggs, cheeses, nuts, whole milk, or meats (see section 5.2).

Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with Kaftrio (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Elevated transaminases and hepatic injury

Cases of liver failure leading to transplantation have been reported within the first 6 months of treatment in patients with and without pre-existing advanced liver disease.

Elevated transaminases are common in patients with CF. In clinical studies, elevated transaminases were more frequently observed in patients treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to placebo. In patients taking IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, these elevations have sometimes been associated with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. Assessments of transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin are recommended for all patients prior to initiating treatment, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter (see section 4.2).

For patients with a history of liver disease or transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered.

Interrupt treatment and promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin if a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms of liver injury. Interrupt dosing in the event of ALT or AST &gt;5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST &gt;3 × ULN with total bilirubin &gt;2 × ULN. Closely monitor the laboratory tests until the abnormalities resolve. Following resolution, consider the benefits and risks of resuming treatment. Patients who resume treatment after interruption should be monitored closely.

In patients with pre-existing advanced liver disease, IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA should be used with caution and only if the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Treatment of patients with moderate hepatic impairment is not recommended. For patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the use of IVA/TEZ/ELX should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, it should be used with caution at a reduced dose (see Table 3).

Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2).

## Depression

Depression (including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) has been reported in patients treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX, usually occurring within three months of treatment initiation and in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders (see section 4.8). In some cases, symptom improvement was reported after dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. Patients (and caregivers) should be alerted about the need to monitor for depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, unusual changes in behaviour, anxiety, or insomnia and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

In young children (aged 2-5 years) treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX behavioural changes have been reported, which occurred usually within the first two months of treatment initiation. In some cases, symptom improvement was reported after treatment discontinuation.

## Renal impairment

There is no experience in patients with severe renal impairment/end-stage renal disease therefore caution is recommended in this population (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Mutations unlikely to respond to modulator therapy

Patients with a genotype consisting of two CFTR mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein (i.e., two Class I mutations) are not expected to respond to Kaftrio treatment.

## Clinical studies comparing IVA/TEZ/ELX to TEZ/IVA or IVA

No clinical study has been conducted to directly compare IVA/TEZ/ELX to TEZ/IVA or IVA in patients not harbouring F508del variants.

## Patients after organ transplantation

IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA has not been studied in patients with CF who have undergone organ transplantation. Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See section 4.5 for interactions with commonly used immunosuppressants.

## Rash events

Rash events typically occur during the first month of therapy. Most events were mild to moderate in severity and in rare cases, rash was associated with additional symptoms such as fever or facial swelling. In the majority of cases, administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX was continued and the rash resolved without treatment. Children have a higher incidence rate compared to adults. The incidence of rash events was also higher in females compared to males, particularly in females taking hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.8). A role for hormonal contraceptives in the occurrence of rash cannot be excluded. For patients taking hormonal contraceptives who develop rash, interrupting treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA and hormonal contraceptives should be considered. Following the resolution of rash, it should be considered if resuming IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA without hormonal contraceptives is appropriate. If rash does not recur, resumption of hormonal contraceptives can be considered (see section 4.8).

## Elderly

Clinical studies of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA did not include sufficient number of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether response in these patients is different from younger adults. Dose recommendations are based on the pharmacokinetic profile and knowledge from studies with tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA) in combination with IVA, and IVA monotherapy (see section 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Interactions with medicinal products

## CYP3A inducers

Exposure to IVA is significantly decreased and exposures to ELX and TEZ are expected to decrease by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, potentially resulting in the reduced efficacy of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA; therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## CYP3A inhibitors

Exposures of ELX, TEZ and IVA are increased when co-administered with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. The dose of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA should be adjusted when used concomitantly with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see section 4.5 and Table 2 in section 4.2).

## Cataracts

Cases of non-congenital lens opacities without impact on vision have been reported in paediatric patients treated with IVA-containing regimens. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use, exposure to radiation) a possible risk attributable to treatment with IVA cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in paediatric patients initiating treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (see section 5.3).

## Excipients with known effect

## Lactose

This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Medicinal products affecting the pharmacokinetics of ELX, TEZ and/or IVA

## CYP3A inducers

ELX, TEZ and IVA are substrates of CYP3A (IVA is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A). Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers may result in reduced exposures and thus reduced IVA/TEZ/ELX efficacy. Co-administration of IVA with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased IVA area under the curve (AUC) by 89%. ELX and TEZ exposures are also expected to decrease during co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers; therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.4).

Examples of strong CYP3A inducers include:

- rifampicin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum )

## CYP3A inhibitors

Co-administration with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased ELX AUC by 2.8-fold and TEZ AUC by 4.0- to 4.5-fold. When co-administered with itraconazole and ketoconazole, IVA AUC increased by 15.6-fold and 8.5-fold, respectively. The dose of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA should be reduced when coadministered with strong CYP3A inhibitors (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.4).

## Examples of strong CYP3A inhibitors include:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole
- telithromycin and clarithromycin

Simulations indicated that co-administration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors fluconazole, erythromycin and verapamil, may increase ELX and TEZ AUC by approximately 1.9- to 2.3-fold. Co-administration of fluconazole increased IVA AUC by 2.9-fold. The dose of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA should be reduced when co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and section 4.4).

Examples of moderate CYP3A inhibitors include:

- fluconazole
- erythromycin

Co-administration with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of ELX, TEZ and IVA. Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA (see section 4.2).

## Ciprofloxacin

ELX/TEZ/IVA was not evaluated for concomitant use with ciprofloxacin. However, ciprofloxacin had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of TEZ or IVA and is not expected to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of ELX. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary during concomitant administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX with ciprofloxacin.

## Potential for interaction with transporters

In vitro studies showed that ELX is a substrate for the efflux transporters P-gp and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) but is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Exposure to ELX is not expected to be affected significantly by concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact.

In vitro studies showed that TEZ is a substrate for the uptake transporter OATP1B1 and efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP. TEZ is not a substrate for OATP1B3. Exposure to TEZ is not expected to be affected significantly by concomitant inhibitors of OATP1B1, P-gp, or BCRP due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact. However, exposure to M2-TEZ (TEZ metabolite) may be increased by inhibitors of P-gp. Therefore, caution should be used when P-gp inhibitors (e.g., ciclosporin) are used with IVA/TEZ/ELX.

In vitro studies showed that IVA is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or P-gp. IVA and its metabolites are substrates of BCRP in vitro . Due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact, co-administration of BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter exposure of IVA and M1-IVA, while any potential changes in M6-IVA exposures are not expected to be clinically relevant.

## Medicinal products affected by ELX, TEZ and/or IVA

## CYP2C9 substrates

IVA  may  inhibit  CYP2C9;  therefore,  monitoring  of  the  international  normalised  ratio  (INR)  during co-administration of warfarin with IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA is recommended. Other medicinal products for which exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal products should be used with caution.

## Potential for interaction with transporters

Co-administration of IVA or TEZ/IVA with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin AUC by 1.3-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by IVA. Administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used concomitantly with digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index such as ciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus and tacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used.

ELX and M23-ELX inhibit uptake by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro . TEZ/IVA increased the AUC of pitavastatin, an OATP1B1 substrate, by 1.2-fold. Co-administration with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA may increase exposures of medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters, such as statins, glyburide, nateglinide and repaglinide. When used concomitantly with substrates of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used. Bilirubin is an OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate. In study 445-102, mild increases in mean total bilirubin were observed (up to 4.0 µmol/L change from baseline). This finding is consistent with the in vitro inhibition of bilirubin transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 by ELX and M23-ELX.

ELX and IVA are inhibitors of BCRP. Co-administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX, and IVA may increase exposures of medicinal products that are substrates of BCRP, such as rosuvastatin. When used concomitantly with substrates of BCRP, appropriate monitoring should be used.

## Hormonal contraceptives

IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA has been studied with ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel and was found to have no clinically relevant effect on the exposures of the oral contraceptive. IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA is not expected to have an impact on the efficacy of oral contraceptives.

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of ELX, TEZ, or IVA in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of IVA/TEZ/ELX during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

Limited data show that ELX, TEZ, and IVA are excreted in human milk and have been quantified in plasma of breastfed newborns/infants of treated women. There is insufficient information on the effects of IVA/TEZ/ELX in newborns/infants. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from IVA/TEZ/ELX therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

There are no data available on the effect of ELX, TEZ and IVA on fertility in humans. TEZ had no effects on fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at clinically relevant exposures. ELX and IVA had an effect on fertility in rats (see section 5.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA has a minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Dizziness has been reported in patients receiving IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA as well as IVA (see section 4.8). Patients experiencing dizziness should be advised not to drive or use machines until symptoms abate.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions experienced by patients aged 12 years and older who received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA were headache (17.3%), diarrhoea (12.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (11.9%) and aminotransferase increased (10.9%).

Serious adverse reactions of rash experienced by patients aged 12 years and older were reported in 1.5% patients treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (see section 4.4).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 4 reflects adverse reactions observed with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA, and IVA monotherapy. Adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class and frequency: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare (&lt;1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Transaminase elevations

In study 445-102, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt;8, &gt;5, or &gt;3 × the ULN was 1.5%, 2.5% and 7.9% in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.5% and 5.5% in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of adverse reactions of transaminase elevations was 10.9% in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients and 4.0% in placebo-treated patients.

During the open-label studies, some patients discontinued treatment due to elevated transaminases. Postmarketing cases of treatment discontinuation due to elevated transaminases have been reported (see section 4.4).

## Rash events

Studies in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients above 12 years of age showed an incidence of rash events (e.g., rash, rash pruritic) of 10.9% (study 445-102) compared to 6.5% in placebo-treated patients. The paediatric population showed a higher incidence rate (see section Paediatric population for further details). The incidence of rash events by patient sex was 5.8% in males and 16.3% in females in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients and 4.8% in males and 8.3% in females in placebo-treated patients. In patients treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX, the incidence of rash events was 20.5% in females taking hormonal contraceptive and 13.6% in females not taking hormonal contraceptive (see section 4.4).

Overall, rash events typically occur during the first month of therapy. Most events were mild to moderate in severity, and in rare cases, rash was associated with additional symptoms such as fever or facial swelling. In the majority of cases, administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX was continued and the rash resolved without treatment.

## Increased creatine phosphokinase

In study 445-102, the incidence of maximum creatine phosphokinase &gt;5 × the ULN was 10.4% in IVA/TEZ/ELX- and 5.0% in placebo-treated patients. The observed creatine phosphokinase elevations were generally transient and asymptomatic and many were preceded by exercise.

## Increased blood pressure

In study 445-102, the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 3.5 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, respectively for IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients (baseline: 113 mmHg systolic and 69 mmHg diastolic) and 0.9 mmHg and 0.5 mmHg, respectively for placebo-treated patients (baseline: 114 mmHg systolic and 70 mmHg diastolic).

The proportion of patients who had systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg on at least two occasions was 5.0% and 3.0%, respectively in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients compared with 3.5% and 3.5%, respectively in placebo-treated patients.

## Paediatric population

The safety data of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in studies 445-102, 445-103, 445-104, 445106, 445-111, and 445-124 and was evaluated in 272 patients between 2 to less than 18 years of age. The safety profile is generally consistent among paediatric and adult patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During study 445-106 in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt;8, &gt;5, and &gt;3 × ULN were 0.0%, 1.5%, and 10.6%, respectively. No IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients had transaminase elevation &gt;3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt;2 × ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations (see section 4.4).

During study 445-111 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt;8, &gt;5, and &gt;3 × ULN were 1.3%, 2.7%, and 8.0% respectively. No IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients had transaminase elevation &gt;3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt;2 × ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations (see section 4.4).

## Rash

While studies in patients above 12 years of age showed an incidence rate of 10.9% (study 445-102), patients between 6 and 11 years of age had an incidence rate of 24.2% (study 445-106). During study 445-111 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, 15 (20.0%) subjects had at least 1 rash event, 4 (9.8%) females and 11 (32.4%) males.

## Lenticular opacity

One patient had an adverse event of lenticular opacity.

## Behavioural changes

Most cases of behavioural changes have been reported in younger children aged 2-5 years.

## Other special populations

With the exception of sex differences in rash, the safety profile of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA was generally similar across all subgroups of patients, including analysis by age, baseline percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) and geographic regions.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No specific antidote is available for overdose with IVA/TEZ/ELX. Treatment of overdose consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products, ATC code: R07AX32

## Mechanism of action

ELX and TEZ are CFTR correctors that bind to different sites on the CFTR protein and have an additive effect in facilitating the cellular processing and trafficking of CFTR to increase the amount of CFTR

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

protein delivered to the cell surface compared to either molecule alone. IVA potentiates the channel open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface.

The combined effect of ELX, TEZ and IVA is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increased CFTR activity as measured by CFTR mediated chloride transport.

## CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing mutant CFTR

The chloride transport response of mutant CFTR protein to IVA/TEZ/ELX was determined in Ussing chamber electrophysiology studies using a panel of FRT cell lines transfected with individual CFTR mutations. IVA/TEZ/ELX increased chloride transport in FRT cells expressing select CFTR mutations.

The in vitro CFTR chloride transport response threshold was designated as a net increase of at least 10% of normal over baseline because it is predictive or reasonably expected to predict clinical response. For individual mutations, the magnitude of the net change over baseline in CFTR-mediated chloride transport in vitro is not correlated with the magnitude of clinical response.

In CF, the presence of one CFTR mutation responsive to IVA/TEZ/ELX based on in vitro data in FRT cells, will likely result in a clinical response.

Table 5 lists CFTR mutations included in the indication for treatment with Kaftrio. The occurrence of CFTR mutations listed in this table should not be used in lieu of a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, nor as a sole determinant for prescribing purposes.

There are people with CF harbouring two rare, nonF508del CFTR mutations not listed in Table 5. Provided that they do not harbour two Class I (null) mutations (mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein) (see section 4.1), they may respond to treatment. In these cases, Kaftrio can be considered when the physician deems the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks and under close medical supervision.

The individual diagnosis of CF should be based on diagnostic guidelines and clinical judgement as considerable variability exists in phenotype for patients harbouring the same genotype.

- ⁎ Mutations supported by clinical data.
- † Mutations supported by Real-World data in ≥ 5 patients.
- ‡  Complex/compound mutations where a single allele of the CFTR gene has multiple mutations; these exist independent of the presence of mutations on the other allele.

Non-annotated mutations are included based on the FRT assay in which a positive response is indicative of a clinical response.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Effects on sweat chloride

In study 445-102 (patients with an F508del mutation on one allele and a mutation on the second allele that predicts either no production of a CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that does not transport chloride and is not responsive to other CFTR modulators [IVA and TEZ/IVA] in vitro ), a reduction in sweat chloride was observed from baseline at week 4 and sustained through the 24-week treatment period. The treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to placebo for mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -41.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -44.4, -39.3; P &lt; 0.0001).

In study 445-103 (patients homozygous for the F508del mutation), the treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA for mean

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline at week 4 was -45.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -50.1, -40.1; P &lt; 0.0001).

In study 445-104 (patients heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele with a gating defect or residual CFTR activity), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 8 for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group was -22.3 mmol/L (95% CI: -24.5, -20.2; P &lt; 0.0001). The treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to the control group (IVA group or TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA group) was -23.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.1, -20.1; P &lt; 0.0001).

In study 445-106 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline (n=62) through week 24 (n=60) was -60.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -63.7, -58.2) * . The mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 12 (n=59) was -58.6 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.1, -56.1).

* Not all participants included in the analyses had data available for all follow-up visits, especially from week 16 onwards. The ability to collect data at week 24 was hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Week 12 data were less impacted by the pandemic.

In study 445-116 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation), treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA resulted in reduction in sweat chloride through week 24, as compared to placebo. The LS mean treatment difference for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group versus placebo for absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -51.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -55.3, -47.1; nominal P &lt; 0.0001).

In study 445-111 (patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -57.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.3, -54.6).

In study 445-124 (patients aged 6 years and older with a qualifying nonF508del , IVA/TEZ/ELXresponsive CFTR mutation [see Table 6]), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 compared to placebo was -28.3 mmol/L (95% CI: -32.1, -24.5 mmol/L; P &lt; 0.0001).

## Cardiovascular effects

## Effect on QT interval

At doses up to 2 times the maximum recommended dose of ELX and 3 times the maximum recommended dose of TEZ and IVA, the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects was not prolonged to any clinically relevant extent.

## Heart rate

In study 445-102, mean decreases in heart rate of 3.7 to 5.8 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline (76 bpm) were observed in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in patients with CF was demonstrated in seven phase 3 studies. Patients enrolled in these studies were homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation with minimal function (MF), a gating defect, or residual CFTR activity on the second allele. Study 445-124 enrolled patients who had at least one qualifying nonF508del, IVA/TEZ/ELX-responsive CFTR mutation (see Table 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study 445-102 was a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients who had an F508del mutation on one allele and an MF mutation on the second allele. CF patients eligible for this study were required to either have Class I mutations that predicted no CFTR protein being produced (including nonsense mutations, canonical splice mutations and insertion/deletion frameshift mutations both small (≤3 nucleotide) and non-small (&gt;3 nucleotide)), or missense mutations which results in CFTR protein that does not transport chloride and is not responsive to IVA and TEZ/IVA in vitro . The most frequent alleles with minimal function assessed in the study were G542X , W1282X , R553X , and R1162X ; 621+1G→T , 17171G→A , and 1898+1G→A ; 3659delC , and 394delTT ; CFTRdele2,3 ; and N1303K , I507del , G85E , R347P , and R560T . A total of 403 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 26.2 years) were randomised and dosed to receive placebo or IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. Patients had a ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90%. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 61.4% (range: 32.3%, 97.1%).

Study 445-103 was a 4-week, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study in patients who were homozygous for the F508del mutation. A total of 107 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 28.4 years) received TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA during a 4-week open-label run-in period and were then randomised and dosed to receive either IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA or TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA during a 4-week double-blind treatment period. Patients had a ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90%. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline, following the run-in period was 60.9% (range: 35.0%, 89.0%).

Study 445-104 was an 8-week, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study in patients who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele with a gating defect (Gating) or residual CFTR activity (RF). A total of 258 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 37.7 years) received either IVA (F/Gating) or TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA (F/RF) during a 4-week open-label run-in period and patients with the F/R117H genotype received IVA during the run-in period. Patients were then randomised and dosed to receive either IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA or remained on the CFTR modulator therapy received during the run-in period. Patients had a ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90%. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline, following the run-in period, was 67.6% (range: 29.7%, 113.5%).

Study 445-106 was a 24-week open-label study in patients who were homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation. A total of 66 patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean age at baseline 9.3 years) were dosed according to weight. Patients weighing &lt;30 kg at baseline were administered two IVA 37.5 mg/TEZ 25 mg/ELX 50 mg tablets in the morning and one IVA 75 mg tablet in the evening. Patients weighing ≥30 kg at baseline were administered two IVA 75 mg/TEZ 50 mg/ELX 100 mg tablets in the morning and one IVA 150 mg tablet in the evening. Patients had a ppFEV1 ≥40% and weighed ≥15 kg at screening. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 88.8% (range: 39.0%, 127.1%).

Study 445-116 was a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean age at baseline 9.2 years) who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation. A total of 121 patients were randomised to receive either placebo or IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. Patients who received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA weighing &lt;30 kg at baseline were administered two IVA 37.5 mg/TEZ 25 mg/ELX 50 mg tablets in the morning and one IVA 75 mg tablet in the evening. Patients weighing ≥30 kg at baseline were administered two IVA 75 mg/TEZ 50 mg/ELX 100 mg tablets in the morning and one IVA 150 mg tablet in the evening. At screening, patients had a ppFEV1 ≥70% [mean ppFEV1 at baseline of 89.3% (range: 44.6%, 121.8%)], LCI2.5 result ≥7.5 [mean LCI2.5 at baseline of 10.01 (range: 6.91, 18.36)], and weighed ≥15 kg.

Study 445-111 was a 24-week open-label study in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years (mean age at baseline 4.1 years). A total of 75 patients who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation were enrolled and dosed according to weight. Patients weighing 10 kg to &lt;14 kg at baseline were administered IVA 60 mg/TEZ 40 mg/ELX 80 mg once

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

every morning and IVA 59.5 mg once every evening. Patients weighing ≥14 kg at baseline were administered IVA 75 mg every 12 hours/TEZ 50 mg qd/ELX 100 mg qd.

Study 445-124 was a 24-week, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study in patients aged 6 years and older. Patients who had at least one qualifying nonF508del , IVA/TEZ/ELXresponsive CFTR mutation (see Table 6) and did not have an exclusionary (other IVA/TEZ/ELXresponsive) mutation were eligible for the study.

A total of 307 patients were enrolled and dosed according to age and weight. Patients ≥6 to &lt;12 years weighing &lt;30 kg at baseline (n=31) were administered ELX 100 mg qd/TEZ 50 mg qd/IVA 75 mg q12h. Patients ≥6 to &lt;12 years weighing ≥30 kg at baseline were administered ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h. Patients ≥12 years at baseline were administered ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h. Patients had a ppFEV1 ≥40% and ≤100% and aged 6 years or older at screening. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 67.7% (range: 34.0%, 108.7%).

Patients in these studies continued on their CF therapies (e.g., bronchodilators, inhaled antibiotics, dornase alfa and hypertonic saline), but discontinued any previous CFTR modulator therapies, except for study medicinal products. Patients had a confirmed diagnosis of CF.

Study CFD-016 was an observational, retrospective study evaluating Real-World clinical outcomes in patients aged 6 years and older. Patients had at least one IVA/TEZ/ELX-responsive mutation and did not have an F508del mutation. A total of 422 patients were evaluated with a total of 82 IVA/TEZ/ELXresponsive nonF508del mutations represented. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 74.15%.

In studies 445-102, 445-103, 445-104, 445-106, 445-111, and 445-124 patients continued their CF therapies, but discontinued any previous CFTR modulator therapies, except for study medicinal products. Patients who had lung infection with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status, including but not limited to Burkholderia cenocepacia , Burkholderia dolosa , or Mycobacterium abscessus , or who had an abnormal liver function test at screening (ALT, AST, ALP, or GGT ≥3 × ULN, or total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN), were excluded. In study 445-111, patients who had ALT or AST ≥2 × ULN were also excluded.

Patients in studies 445-102 and 445-103 were eligible to roll over into a 192-week open-label extension study (study 445-105). Patients in studies 445-104, 445-106, 445-116, 445-111, and 445-124 were eligible to roll over into separate open-label extension studies.

## Study 445-102

In study 445-102 the primary endpoint was mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through week 24. Treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to placebo resulted in statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 of 14.3 percentage points (95% CI: 12.7, 15.8; P &lt; 0.0001) (see Table 7). Mean improvement in ppFEV1 was observed at the first assessment on day 15 and sustained through the 24-week treatment period. Improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, baseline ppFEV1, sex, and geographic region.

A total of 18 patients receiving IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA had ppFEV1 &lt;40 percentage points at baseline. The safety and efficacy in this subgroup were consistent to those observed in the overall

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

population. The mean treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA- compared to placebo-treated patients for absolute change in ppFEV1 through week 24 in this subgroup was 18.4 percentage points (95% CI: 11.5, 25.3).

## Study 445-103

In study 445-103 the primary endpoint was mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at week 4 of the double-blind treatment period. Treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA resulted in a statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 of 10.0 percentage points (95% CI: 7.4, 12.6; P &lt; 0.0001) (see Table 8). Improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, sex, baseline ppFEV1, and geographic region.

See Table 8 for a summary of primary and key secondary outcomes in the overall trial population.

In a post-hoc analysis of patients with (N=66) and without (N=41) recent CFTR modulator use, an improvement in ppFEV1 of 7.8 percentage points (95% CI: 4.8, 10.8) and 13.2 percentage points (95% CI: 8.5, 17.9), respectively was observed.

## Study 445-104

In study 445-104 the primary endpoint was within-group mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through week 8 for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group. Treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA resulted in statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 from baseline of 3.7 percentage points (95% CI: 2.8, 4.6; P &lt; 0.0001) (see Table 9). Overall improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, sex, baseline ppFEV1, geographic region, and genotype groups (F/Gating or F/RF).

See Table 9 for a summary of primary and secondary outcomes in the overall trial population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a subgroup analysis of patients with an F/Gating genotype, the treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (N=50) compared with IVA (N=45) for mean absolute change in ppFEV1 was 5.8 percentage points (95% CI: 3.5, 8.0). In a subgroup analysis of patients with an F/RF genotype, the treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (N=82) compared with TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA (N=81) for mean absolute change in ppFEV1 was 2.0 percentage points (95% CI: 0.5, 3.4). The results of the F/Gating and the F/RF genotype subgroups for improvement in sweat chloride and CFQ-R respiratory domain score were consistent with the overall results.

Study 445-105

Study 445-105 was a 192-week open-label extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. Patients who rolled over from studies 445-102 (N=399) and 445-103 (N=107) received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study 445-105, patients from the control arms in the parent studies showed improvements in efficacy endpoints consistent with those observed in subjects who received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in the parent studies. Patients from the control arms as well as patients who received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in the parent studies, showed sustained improvements. Secondary efficacy endpoints are summarised in Table 10.

†  For subjects who were randomised   to the IVA/TEZ/ELX group, the Cumulative TC Efficacy Period includes data from the parent studies through 192 weeks of treatments in study 445-105 (N=255, including 4 patients that did not rollover into study 445-105). For subjects who were randomised to the Placebo or TEZ/IVA group, the Cumulative TC Efficacy Period includes data from 192 weeks of treatments in study 445-105 only (N=255).

## Study 445-124

The safety and efficacy of IVA/TEZ/ELX in 307 patients with CF aged 6 years and older without an F508del mutation but with a qualifying IVA/TEZ/ELX-responsive CFTR mutation were evaluated (study 445-124).

In study 445-124 the primary endpoint of efficacy was mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through week 24. Secondary endpoints were absolute change in sweat chloride, CFQ-R respiratory domain

## Study CFD-016

Study CFD-016 included 422 homozygotic non -F508del CF patients harbouring at least one IVA/TEZ/ELX-responsive CFTR mutation based on in vitro FRT data. After a median follow-up of 1.31 year, the mean change in ppFEV1 was 4.53% (95% CI: 3.5, 5.56). Almost all subgroups according to CFTR mutation that included ≥5 patients showed an improvement in ppFEV1 over that time, except for the subgroup with R74W.

## Paediatric population

Paediatric patients aged 2 to &lt;12 years

## Study 445-106

In study 445-106, the primary endpoint of safety and tolerability was evaluated through 24 weeks in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years. Secondary endpoints were evaluation of pharmacokinetics and efficacy.

## Study 445-107

Study 445-107 is a 192-week, two-part (part A and part B), open-label extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in patients who completed study 445-106. Efficacy endpoints were included as secondary endpoints. The final analysis of this study was conducted in 64 paediatric patients aged 6 years and older. With 192 additional weeks of treatment, sustained improvements in ppFEV1, SwCl, CFQ-R RD score, and LCI2.5 were shown, consistent with the results observed in the study 445-106.

## Study 445-116

In study 445-116 treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years resulted in statistically significant improvement through 24 weeks in the primary endpoint (LCI2.5). The LS mean treatment difference for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group versus placebo for the absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through week 24 was -2.26 (95% CI: -2.71, -1.81; P &lt; 0.0001).

## Study 445-111

In study 445-111 the primary endpoint of safety and tolerability was evaluated through 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints included an evaluation of pharmacokinetics, and efficacy endpoints including

## Study 445-124

In study 445-124, the safety and efficacy of IVA/TEZ/ELX in patients with CF aged 6 years and older without an F508del mutation were evaluated. A post-hoc efficacy analysis was conducted in 31 patients aged 6-12 years, of whom 23 patients received IVA/TEZ/ELX. The mean change (SD) from baseline was 10.2% (16.2) for ppFEV1 and -37.7 (18.8) mmol/L for sweat chloride.

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in one or more subset of the paediatric population in cystic fibrosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of ELX, TEZ and IVA are similar between healthy adult subjects and patients with CF. Following initiation of once-daily dosing of ELX and TEZ and twice-daily dosing of IVA, plasma concentrations of ELX, TEZ and IVA reach steady state within approximately 7 days for ELX, within 8 days for TEZ, and within 3-5 days for IVA. Upon dosing IVA/TEZ/ELX to steady state, the accumulation ratio is approximately 3.6 for ELX, 2.8 for TEZ and 4.7 for IVA. Key pharmacokinetic parameters for ELX, TEZ and IVA at steady state in patients with CF aged 12 years and older are shown in Table 14.

## Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of ELX when administered orally in the fed state is approximately 80%. ELX is absorbed with a median (range) time to maximum concentration (tmax) of approximately 6 hours (4 to 12 hours) while the median (range) tmax of TEZ and IVA is approximately 3 hours (2 to 4 hours) and 4 hours (3 to 6 hours), respectively. ELX exposure (AUC) increases approximately 1.9- to 2.5-fold when

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administered with a moderate-fat meal relative to fasted conditions. IVA exposure increases approximately 2.5- to 4.0-fold when administered with fat-containing meals relative to fasted conditions, while food has no effect on the exposure of TEZ (see section 4.2).

As exposures of ELX were approximately 20% lower after administration of the IVA/TEZ/ELX granules relative to the reference IVA/TEZ/ELX tablet, the formulations are not considered interchangeable.

## Distribution

ELX is &gt;99% bound to plasma proteins and TEZ is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, in both cases primarily to albumin. IVA is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin, and also to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and human gamma-globulin. After oral administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, the mean (±SD) apparent volume of distribution of ELX, TEZ and IVA was 53.7 L (17.7), 82.0 L (22.3) and 293 L (89.8), respectively. ELX, TEZ and IVA do not partition preferentially into human red blood cells.

## Biotransformation

ELX is metabolised extensively in humans, mainly by CYP3A4/5. Following oral administration of a single dose of 200 mg 14 C-ELX to healthy male subjects, M23-ELX was the only major circulating metabolite. M23-ELX has similar potency to ELX and is considered pharmacologically active.

TEZ is metabolised extensively in humans, mainly by CYP3A4/5. Following oral administration of a single dose of 100 mg  14 C-TEZ to healthy male subjects, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ were the three major circulating metabolites of TEZ in humans. M1-TEZ has similar potency to that of TEZ and is considered pharmacologically active. M2-TEZ is much less pharmacologically active than TEZ or M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ is not considered pharmacologically active. Another minor circulating metabolite, M3-TEZ, is formed by direct glucuronidation of TEZ.

IVA is also metabolised extensively in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that IVA is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4/5. M1-IVA and M6-IVA are the two major metabolites of IVA in humans. M1-IVA has approximately one-sixth the potency of IVA and is considered pharmacologically active. M6-IVA is not considered pharmacologically active.

The effect of the CYP3A4*22 heterozygous genotype on TEZ, IVA and ELX exposure is consistent with the effect of co-administration of a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is not clinically relevant. No doseadjustment of TEZ, IVA or ELX is considered necessary. The effect in CYP3A4*22 homozygous genotype patients is expected to be stronger. However, no data are available for such patients.

## Elimination

Following multiple dosing in the fed state, the mean (±SD) apparent clearance values of ELX, TEZ and IVA at steady state were 1.18 (0.29) L/h, 0.79 (0.10) L/h and 10.2 (3.13) L/h, respectively. The mean (SD) terminal half-lives of ELX, TEZ and IVA following administration of the IVA/TEZ/ELX fixed-dose combination tablets are approximately 24.7 (4.87) hours, 60.3 (15.7) hours and 13.1 (2.98) hours, respectively. The mean (SD) effective half-life of TEZ following administration of the IVA/TEZ/ELX fixed-dose combination tablets is 11.9 (3.79) hours.

Following oral administration of 14 C-ELX alone, the majority of ELX (87.3%) was eliminated in the faeces, primarily as metabolites.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Following oral administration of 14 C-TEZ alone, the majority of the dose (72%) was excreted in the faeces (unchanged or as the M2-TEZ) and about 14% was recovered in urine (mostly as M2-TEZ), resulting in a mean overall recovery of 86% up to 26 days after the dose.

Following oral administration of 14 C-IVA alone, the majority of IVA (87.8%) was eliminated in the faeces after metabolic conversion.

For ELX, TEZ and IVA there was negligible urinary excretion of unchanged medicine.

## Hepatic impairment

ELX alone or in combination with TEZ and IVA has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15). Following multiple doses of ELX, TEZ and IVA for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9) had an approximately 25% higher AUC and a 12% higher Cmax for ELX, 73% higher AUC and a 70% higher Cmax for M23-ELX, 20% higher AUC but similar Cmax for TEZ, 22% lower AUC and a 20% lower Cmax for M1-TEZ, and a 1.5-fold higher AUC and a 10% higher Cmax for IVA compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics. The effect of moderately impaired hepatic function on total exposure (based on summed values of ELX and its M23-ELX metabolite) was 36% higher AUC and a 24% higher Cmax compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 4.8).

## Tezacaftor and ivacaftor

Following multiple doses of TEZ and IVA for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function had an approximately 36% higher AUC and a 10% higher Cmax for TEZ, and a 1.5-fold higher AUC but similar Cmax for IVA compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics.

## Ivacaftor

In a study with IVA alone, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function had similar IVA Cmax, but an approximately 2.0-fold higher IVA AUC0-∞ compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics.

## Renal impairment

ELX alone or in combination with TEZ and IVA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30 mL/min] or in patients with endstage renal disease.

In human pharmacokinetic studies of ELX, TEZ and IVA, there was minimal elimination of ELX, TEZ and IVA in urine (only 0.23%, 13.7% [0.79% as unchanged medicine] and 6.6% of total radioactivity, respectively).

Based on population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, exposure of ELX was similar in patients with mild renal impairment (N=75; eGFR 60 to less than 90 mL/min) relative to those with normal renal function (N=341; eGFR 90 mL/min or greater).

In population PK analysis conducted in 817 patients administered TEZ alone or in combination with IVA in phase 2 or phase 3 studies indicated that mild renal impairment (N=172; eGFR 60 to less than 90 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (N=8; eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min) did not affect the clearance of TEZ significantly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Gender

The pharmacokinetic parameters of ELX (244 males compared to 174 females), TEZ and IVA are similar in males and females.

## Race

Race had no clinically meaningful effect on ELX exposure based on population PK analysis in whites (N=373) and non-whites (N=45). The non-white races consisted of 30 Blacks or African Americans, 1 with multiple racial background and 14 with other ethnic background (no Asians).

Very limited PK data indicate comparable exposure of TEZ in whites (N=652) and non-whites (N=8). The non-white races consisted of 5 Blacks or African Americans and 3 Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders.

Race had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of IVA in whites (N=379) and non-whites (N=29) based on a population PK analysis. The non-white races consisted of 27 African Americans and 2 Asians.

## Elderly

Clinical trials of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA did not include sufficient number of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether response in these patients is different from younger adults (see section 4.4).

## Paediatric population

ELX, TEZ and IVA exposures observed in phase 3 studies as determined using population PK analysis are presented by age group in Table 15. Exposures of ELX, TEZ and IVA in patients aged 2 to less than 18 years are within the range observed in patients aged 18 years and older.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Elexacaftor

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.

## Fertility and pregnancy

The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for fertility findings was 55 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on summed AUCs of ELX and its metabolite) in male rats and 25 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ELX and its metabolite) in female rats. In rat, at doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), degeneration and atrophy of seminiferous tubules are correlated to oligo-/aspermia and cellular debris in epididymides. In dog testes, minimal or mild, bilateral degeneration/atrophy of the seminiferous tubules was present in males administered 14 mg/kg/day ELX (15 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ELX and its metabolite) that did not resolve during the recovery period, however without further sequelae. The human relevance of these findings is unknown.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ELX was not teratogenic in rats at 40 mg/kg/day and at 125 mg/kg/day in rabbits (approximately 9 and 4 times, respectively, the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ELX and its metabolite [for rat] and AUC of ELX [for rabbit]) with developmental findings being limited to lower mean foetal body weight at ≥25 mg/kg/day.

Placental transfer of ELX was observed in pregnant rats.

## Tezacaftor

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction and development. Placental transfer of TEZ was observed in pregnant rats.

Juvenile toxicity studies in rats exposed during postnatal day 7 to 35 (PND 7-35) showed mortality and moribundity, even at low doses. Findings were dose related and generally more severe when dosing with tezacaftor was initiated earlier in the postnatal period. Exposure in rats from PND 21-49 did not show toxicity at the highest dose which was approximately two times the intended human exposure. Tezacaftor and its metabolite, M1-TEZ, are substrates for P-glycoprotein. Lower brain levels of P-glycoprotein activity in younger rats resulted in higher brain levels of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ. These findings are likely not relevant for the indicated paediatric population of 2 years of age and older, for whom P-glycoprotein expression levels are equivalent to levels observed in adults.

## Ivacaftor

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.

## Fertility and pregnancy

The NOAEL for fertility findings was 100 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of IVA and its metabolites) in male rats and 100 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of IVA and its metabolites) in female rats.

In the pre- and post-natal study IVA decreased survival and lactation indices and caused a reduction in pup body weights. The NOAEL for viability and growth in the offspring provides an exposure level of approximately 3 times the systemic exposure of IVA and its metabolites in adult humans at the MRHD. Placental transfer of IVA was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits.

## Juvenile animal studies

Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal day 7 through day 35 at IVA exposure levels of 0.21 time the MRHD based on systemic exposure of IVA and its metabolites. This finding has not been observed in foetuses derived from rat dams treated with IVA on gestation days 7 to day 17, in rat pups exposed to IVA through milk ingestion up to postnatal day 20, in 7-week-old rats, nor in 3.5- to 5-month-old dogs treated with IVA. The potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown (see section 4.4).

## Ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor

Combination repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs involving the co-administration of ELX, TEZ and IVA to assess the potential for additive and/or synergistic toxicity did not produce any unexpected toxicities or interactions. The potential for synergistic toxicity on male reproduction has not been assessed.

Kaftrio contains three active substances: ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor. The medicine helps lung cells to work better in some patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an inherited condition in which the lungs and the digestive system can become clogged with thick, sticky mucus.

Kaftrio taken with ivacaftor is for patients aged 6 years and over who have CF, with at least one mutation in the CFTR ( cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ) gene that is responsive to Kaftrio. It is intended as a long-term treatment.

Kaftrio works on a protein called CFTR. The protein is damaged in some people with CF, if they have a mutation in the CFTR gene.

Kaftrio is normally taken with another medicine, ivacaftor. Ivacaftor causes the protein to work better, while tezacaftor and elexacaftor increase the amount of protein at the cell surface.

Kaftrio (taken with ivacaftor) helps your breathing by improving your lung function. You may also notice that you do not get ill as often, or that it is easier to gain weight.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Kaftrio

## Do not take Kaftrio:

- If you are allergic to ivacaftor, tezacaftor, elexacaftor, or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
- Talk to your doctor and do not take the tablets, if this applies to you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor if you have liver problems or have had them previously. Your doctor may need to adjust your dose (see section 4).

- Your doctor will do some blood tests to check your liver before and during treatment with Kaftrio, especially if your blood tests showed high liver enzymes in the past. Liver enzymes in the blood can increase in patients receiving Kaftrio.

Tell your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of liver problems. These are listed in section 4.

- Depression (including suicidal thoughts, changes in behaviours, anxiety, and sleep disorders) has been reported in patients while taking Kaftrio, usually starting within the first three months of treatment. Talk to your doctor straight away if you (or someone taking this medicine) experience any of the following symptoms which may be signs of depression: sad or altered mood, anxiety, feelings of emotional discomfort or thoughts of harming or killing yourself, and/or sleep difficulties (see section 4).

Talk to your doctor if you recognize behavioural changes in your child within the first 2 months of treatment initiation.

- Talk to your doctor if you have kidney problems, or you have previously had them.
