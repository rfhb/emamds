| II/0016 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics Update of section 4.2 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to indicate that the use in children is not recommended, further to the request of the CHMP following the assessment of paediatric data submitted in accordance with Article 45 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended (P45-007). | 24/09/2009          | 23/10/2009                               | no SPC                           | longer In accordance with Article 45 of the Paediatric Regulation 1901/2006, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) submitted available paediatric data. Following the assessment of these paediatric data, the CHMP concluded that, due to the insufficiency of the data, assessment of risk/benefit could not be made with justifications, and an empirical basis for proper dosing instructions did not exist. Therefore, section 4.2 of the Summary of Product Characteristics was updated as follows: \"Use in children There are limited data available on the use of Teslascan in children. The available data do not support safety and efficacy in the paediatric population and therefore such use is not recommended.\" |
| R/0015  | Renewal of the Marketing Authorisation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | product 22/03/2007  | 22/05/2007                               | SPC, Annex II, Labelling, PL     | Based on the CHMP review of the available information and on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit/risk balance, the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the benefit/risk profile of Teslascan continues to be favourable. In the absence of specific safety problems, given the stability of the population exposed to Teslascan, the MAHcan hereby change to a 3- year PSUR cycle. During the renewal procedure, changes were made to the Product                                                                                                                                |
