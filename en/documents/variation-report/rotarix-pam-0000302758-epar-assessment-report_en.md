Assessment Report for Paediatric Studies submitted in accordance with Article 46 of

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. Introduction

On 26 September 2025, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Rotarix, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The ROTA-098 study report is being submitted to comply with the requirements of Article 46 of the paediatric regulation 1901/2006.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study&lt;ies&gt;

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

ROTA-098 (218485), entitled: 'A phase III, open-label, randomised, multicentre, controlled study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) when coadministered with Porcine circovirus (PCV)-free liquid formulation of an oral live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine in healthy Chinese infants.'

In China, under the National Immunization Program (NIP), a 3-dose primary vaccination against poliovirus is currently recommended during the first year of life in a 2, 3 and 4 months of age schedule and a booster vaccine is recommended at 4 years of age. Rotarix should be given in a 2-dose schedule between 6-24 weeks of age with an interval of at least 4 weeks between doses. Till date, there is no data available on the immunogenicity and safety of IPV when co-administered with Rotarix PCV-free, in healthy Chinese infants. The current study is therefore designed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of IPV when it is co-administered with Rotarix PCV-free, compared to administration of the vaccines separately.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study 218485 (ROTA-098) EudraCT: 2022-000708-36

A phase III, open-label, randomised, controlled study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) when co-administered with Porcine circovirus (PCV)-free liquid formulation of an oral live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine in healthy Chinese infants.

## Methods

This assessment is based on Protocol Amendment 1 Final, dated 25 October 2023.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Overall design

ROTA-098 is a Phase III, open-label, randomised, controlled study with 2 groups (see Figure 1 and Table 1).

The study population consisted of healthy male or female participants of Chinese origin, between and including 6-10 weeks (42-76 days) of age, at the time of first study intervention administration. The total duration of the study, per participant, was approximately 3.5 months.

This study was conducted at 5 centres that enrolled participants in China.

The study initiation date was 22 March 2024 (first participant first visit) and study completion date was 01 April 2025 (End of Study). The analyses presented in this report are based on a database lock date of 29 April 2025.

## Study participants

## Inclusion criteria

All participants must satisfy ALL the following criteria at study entry:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Participants' parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) (LAR), who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.
- Written or witnessed/thumb printed informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the participant prior to performance of any study specific procedure.
- Healthy participants as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study.
- A male or female of Chinese origin, between and including, 6 and 10 weeks (42-76 days) of age at the time of study enrolment.
- Born after a gestation period of 36 to 42 weeks inclusive.

## Exclusion criteria

The potential participant MUST NOT be included in the study if ANY exclusion criterion applies:

Medical conditions:

- History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study interventions.
- Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).
- Hypersensitivity to latex.
- History of severe combined immunodeficiency.
- History of seizures or progressive neurological disease.
- Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.
- Uncorrected congenital malformation (such as Meckel's diverticulum) of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose for intussusception (IS).
- History of IS.
- Major congenital defects, or serious chronic illness as assessed by the investigator.
- Any contraindications to IPV.
- Previous confirmed occurrence of rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE).
- History of poliomyelitis.
- Participants with confirmed or suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Prior/Concomitant therapy:

- Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug, vaccine or invasive medical device) other than the study interventions during the period beginning 30 days before the first dose of study interventions (Day -29 to Day 1), or planned use during the study period.
- Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the first dose and ending 30 days after the last dose of study interventions administration*, with the exception of the inactivated influenza vaccine, which is allowed at any time during the study and other licensed routine childhood vaccinations.
- o *In case emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public health threat (e.g., a pandemic) is recommended and/or organized by public health authorities outside the routine immunization program, the time period described above can be reduced if, necessary for that vaccine, provided it is used according to the local governmental recommendations and that the Sponsor is notified accordingly.
- Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs from birth or planned administration at any time during the study period (e.g., infliximab).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products or plasma derivatives from birth or planned administration during the study period.
- Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immunemodifying drugs since birth. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥0.5 milligram/kilogram (kg)/day, or equivalent. Inhaled, intra-articular and topical steroids are allowed.
- Previous vaccination against RV.
- Previous vaccination against poliomyelitis.

## Prior/Concurrent clinical study experience:

- Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the participant has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational intervention (drug, vaccine or invasive medical device).

## Other exclusions:

- Child in care.

- Titer ≥1:8 at 1 month after 3 dose primary schedule of IPV in participants with titer &lt;1:8 pre-vaccination
- Titer ≥4-fold increase in titer 1 month after 3 dose primary vaccination schedule in participants with titer ≥1:8 pre-vaccination.

Note: the 4-fold increase will take into consideration the expected decline in matermal antibodies with estimated half-life of 28 days.

(i.e., with anti-RV IgA Ab concentration &lt;20 U/mL prior the first dose of Rotanix) and developed antiRV IgA Ab concentration ≥20 U/mL at 1 month post Dose 2.

Refer to Section 8 for details on SAEs.

The study includes one confirmatory objective which is to demonstrate the immunological noninferiority of IPV when co-administered with Rotarix PCV-free compared with IPV administered alone.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This primary objective is achieved if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the group difference (Coadministration group minus Staggered group) in seroconversion rate is greater than or equal to -10% for each of the anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 antibodies.

Seroconversion rate for IPV neutralizing antibodies is defined as percentage of participants with:

- o Titer ≥1:8 at 1 month after 3 dose primary schedule of IPV in participants who are seronegative before Dose 1 (titer &lt;1:8 pre-vaccination).
- o ≥4 -fold increase in titer 1 month after 3 dose primary vaccination schedule in participants who are seropositive before Dose 1 (titer ≥1:8 pre -vaccination) after adjusting for maternal antibody decay assuming a half-life of 28 days.

Seroconversion rate for Rotarix is defined as the percentage of participants who were initially seronegative (i.e., with anti-RV IgA Ab concentration &lt;20 U/mL prior the first dose of Rotarix) and developed anti-RV IgA antibodies concentration ≥20 U/mL 1 month post Dose 2.

## Sample size

A maximum of 400 participants (200 in the Co-administration group and 200 in the Staggered group) were to be randomised such that approximately 160 evaluable participants complete the study, in each group for the evaluation of the primary objective assuming that approximately 20% of the enrolled participants will not be evaluable. Participants who withdraw from the study were not be replaced.

The positive conversion rate is defined as the percentage of participants at 1 month post Dose 3 of immunization with:

- Neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer &gt; 1:8 for participants with titer &lt; 1:8 pre-immunization Or
- At least 4 times increase in NAb titer for participants with titer &gt; 1:8 pre-immunization.

The definition of seroconversion used in this protocol differs slightly from the above definition of positive conversion by taking into account the expected decline in maternal antibodies between the pre-vaccination blood sample and the post IPV Dose 3 blood sample. By definition, the seroconversion rate will be at least equal to the positive conversion rate. Therefore, as a worst-case scenario, the observed positive conversion rates are used in the following sample size computations.

The power presented in Table 4 is based on PASS 2019 (one-sided Non-Inferiority Tests for the Difference Between Two Proportions), under the alternative hypothesis of a 96.23% (Polio 1), 93.83% (Polio 2), and 97.60% (Polio 3) seroconversion rate for the Staggered group and a true difference of 0% between the Co-administration group and Staggered group, using Miettinen and Nurminen's Likelihood Score Test of the Difference. Under these conservative assumptions, the overall power is above 90.4% (i.e., global type II error is conservatively computed as the sum of nominal type II errors).

Probability that the lower limit of the 95% CI around group difference in the percentage of participants with anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 antibody seroconversion 1 month post Dose 3 of IPV (Coadministration group minus Staggered group) is greater than or equal to -10% (Protocol Amendment 1 Final, Table 16)

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

## Randomisation to study intervention

Approximately 400 eligible participants were to be randomly assigned (1:1) to the 2 study groups (Coadministration and Staggered). The numbering of Rotarix PCV-free and IPV supplies was to be performed at GSK, using a block scheme randomisation in MATerial EXcellence, a program developed by GSK. Entire blocks were to be shipped to the study centres/warehouse(s). To allow GSK to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment than anticipated in this study and to thus reduce the overall study recruitment period, an over-randomisation of supplies was to be prepared.

## Intervention allocation to the participant

The system's randomisation algorithm used a minimisation procedure accounting for centre and the study as a whole as minimisation factors. Minimisation factors had equal weight in the minimisation algorithm. Once a participant identification number was allocated, the randomisation system determined study group and provided the study intervention number to be used for the first dose. The study intervention number(s) to be used for subsequent dosing was to be provided by the same automated Internet-based system (Source Data Base for Internet Randomisation [SBIR]).

## Blinding and unblinding

The study was conducted in an open-label manner with respect to Rotarix PCV-free and IPV.

## Statistical methods

## Statistical hypotheses

The study includes one confirmatory objective. The non-inferiority margin associated with the objective is provided in Table 5.

## Statistical analyses

## Immunogenicity:

The analysis of immunogenicity were primarily based on the PPS. Within groups assessment for the PPS was repeated by sex and study sites.

Since, more than 5% of the ES participants with immunogenicity results after study intervention were excluded from the PPS and hence, the confirmatory analyses were repeated on the ES, as planned per protocol.

## Primary endpoint analysis

Within groups assessment:

For each group, before Dose 1 and at Visit 7 (1 month post Dose 3 [IPV]) time point:

- Seropositivity (before Dose 1 and at Visit 7) and seroconversion rates for IPV (at Visit 7) and their exact 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed using the method of Clopper and Pearson.
- For participants who were seropositive before Dose 1 of IPV, the expected decline in maternal antibodies was accounted.

Between groups assessments:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The Mittienen and Nurminen 95% CI for the group difference (Co-administration group minus Staggered group) in the seroconversion rate of anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 antibodies at Visit 7 were computed.

## Secondary endpoint analysis

Within groups assessment:

The following calculations was to be performed for each group, 1 month post Dose 2 for Rotarix PCV-free and 1 month post Dose 3 for IPV timepoint:

- Seropositivity (before Dose 1 and 1 month post Dose 2) and seroconversion rates for Rotarix PCV-free (1 month post Dose 2) and their exact 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed using the method of Clopper and Pearson.
- The percentage of participants with anti-poliovirus 1, 2, and 3 neutralizing antibody titers ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:64 and their exact 95% CI for each group at 1 month post Dose 3 were computed.
- GMTs were applicable and their exact 95% CIs were computed.
- The percentage of participants with antiRV IgA antibody concentrations ≥ 90 U/mL and their exact 95% CI for each group at 1 month post Dose 2 were computed.
- The distribution of anti-RV IgA Ab concentrations 1 month post Dose 2 and anti-poliovirus titers 1 month post Dose 3 were displayed using reverse cumulative curves for the PPS.

Between group assessment:

- The asymptotic standardize 95% CI for the difference in the percentage of participants with anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 neutralizing antibody titers ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:64 at Visit 7 between Co-administration group minus staggered group will be computed.
- The 95% CI for the ratio of anti-poliovirus type 1, 2 and 3 Ab GMTs at Visit 7 between Coadministration group over staggered group were computed.

GMC/GMT concentrations/titers below the assay cut-off were given an arbitrary value of half the assay cut-off for the purpose of GMC/GMT calculation. For a given participant and a given immunogenicity measurement time point, missing or non-evaluable measurements were not replaced.

## Safety:

Safety analysis was performed on the ES.

Participants who missed reporting events (solicited/unsolicited AEs or concomitant medications) were to be treated as participants without the events (solicited/unsolicited AEs or concomitant medications, respectively).

Standardized electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) were used for safety data collected. Solicited systemic events were collected using a diary card for the data collection.

The following calculations were to be performed for each group:

- The percentage of doses and participants reporting at least 1 AE (solicited or unsolicited) during the 14-day (Day 1 to Day 14) solicited follow-up period were to be computed, along

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- with exact 95% CI. The same calculations were to be done for AEs (solicited or unsolicited) rated as grade 3 in intensity and for AEs leading to a medically attended visit.
- The percentage of doses over the study and the percentage of participants (by dose and over the study) reporting each individual solicited systemic event were to be computed, over the 14-day (Day 1 to Day 14) solicited follow-up period, following study intervention administration, along with exact 95% CI. The same calculations were to be done for each individual solicited systemic event rated as grade 3 (grade 3 or grade 4 for fever) in intensity and events leading to a medically attended visit. Temperature above specific thresholds were to also be summarized with threshold defined by half degree increment.
- The verbatim reports of unsolicited AEs were to be reviewed by a physician and were to be coded according to MedDRA. Every verbatim term was to be matched with the appropriate Preferred Term. The percentage of participants with unsolicited AEs occurring within 31-day (Day 1 to Day 31) follow-up period after any dose of Rotarix PCV-free with its exact 95% CI was to be tabulated by Preferred Term. The same calculations were to be done for each AE rated as grade 3 in intensity, for AEs leading to a medically attended visit and for AEs causally related to HRV as per the investigator assessment.
- The percentage of participants reporting the occurrence of SAEs (any, related, fatal, fatal related) from Dose 1 of the study intervention up to study end with its exact 95% CI was to be tabulated by study group and by preferred term.
- The percentage of participants reporting the occurrence of SAEs (any, related, fatal, fatal related) within 31-day (Day 1 to Day 31) follow-up period after any dose with its exact 95% CI was to be tabulated by study group and by preferred term.
- SAEs and dropouts due to AEs were to be described in detail.

Anti-RV IgA antibody determination:

The anti-RV antibody concentrations are determined by a validated anti-RV IgA ELISA. Microtiter plates (96-well) are coated with an anti-RV monoclonal antibody. The wells are washed and incubated with (positive wells) or without (negative wells) RV. Following incubation, the plates are washed and serum, standard and control dilutions are incubated in both types of wells (positive and negative). Bound antiRV IgA in the wells are detected by incubation with peroxidase conjugated anti-human IgA polyclonal antibodies. Colour development proportional to the quantity of bound anti-RV IgA occurs in the presence of a chromogen, TetraMethylBenzidine, and measured spectrophotometrically. Specific optical densities are calculated for each sample/control/standard dilution by measuring the difference between positive and negative wells, the use of negative wells allowing to assess non-specific IgA binding. The concentrations of the samples expressed in units per millilitre are calculated relative to the fourparameter logistic function generated from the standard curve.

Anti-IPV type 1, type 2 and type 3 antibodies determination:

The polio microneutralization assay measures neutralizing antibody titers to poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 using 96-well microtiter plates. The principle of the test is that the anti-poliovirus antibodies in a serum sample will bind to the virus and block infection of susceptible cells. Because poliovirus is cytopathic, virus that is not bound by antibody infects and lyses cells. The amount of neutralizing antibody is quantitated as a titer based on the last serum dilution to protect susceptible cell culture wells from poliovirus infection and cytopathic effect.

## Assessor's comment

Study ROTA-098 was a PAM, open label, randomised, controlled, Phase 3 conducted in 5 different sites in China to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) when coadministered with Porcine circovirus (PCV)-free liquid formulation of an oral live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine (referred hereafter as Rotarix PCV-free) in Chinese healthy infants 6-10 weeks of age. The active control group - 'Staggered group' - did not receive concomitant administration of IPV with Rotarix PCV-free, but sequential administrations of both vaccines. The targeted sample size was 200 participants in each group. The total duration of the study, per participant, would be approximately 3.5 months.

In the Co-administration group, participants received Rotarix PCV-free co-administered with IPV at Month 0.5 and Month 1.5, and the third dose of IPV at Month 2.5. In the Staggered group, participants received Rotarix PCV-free at Day 1 and Month 1, and IPV at Month 0.5, Month 1.5, and Month 2.5.

The primary objective was the demonstration of non-inferior neutralising antibody responses (in terms of seroconversion rates) specific to polioviruses 1, 2 and 3 following administration of IPV with Rotarix PCV-free versus IPV alone, at 1 month post Dose 3. To be achieved, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the group difference (Co-administration group minus Staggered group) in seroconversion rate had to be greater than or equal to -10% for each of the anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 antibodies. The non-inferiority margin associated with the primary confirmatory objective for non-inferiority is considered acceptable. Secondary objectives included further characterization of humoral responses to IPV and Rotarix PCV-free vaccinations.

Methods are overall acceptable.

## Results

## Participant flow

## Participant disposition

Refer to Figure 2.

The study enrolled 400 participants (200 participants per group in 1:1 ratio), and 392 participants were randomised and received at least 1 dose of study intervention.

The Exposed set (ES) for safety analysis included 193 participants in the Co-administration group and 199 participants in the Staggered group, respectively.

Of 193 participants in the ES of the Co-administration group, 191 participants (99.0%) received both doses of Rotarix PCV-free and 190 participants (98.4%) received all 3 doses of IPV. All participants (100%) received at least 1 dose of both study interventions. Of the participants that received at least 1 dose, 189 participants (97.9%) completed the study, and 4 participants (2.1%) were withdrawn from the study (see Table 12). Participant's 'migration/moved from the study area' was the most common reason for withdrawal from study (3 participants [1.6%]).

Of 199 participants in the ES of the Staggered group, 192 participants (96.5%) received both doses of Rotarix PCV-free and 188 participants (94.5%) received all 3 doses of IPV.

## Protocol deviations

Important protocol deviations leading to elimination from analyses were reported in 50 participants (25.0%) in the Co-administration group, and 70 participants (35.0%) in the Staggered group, respectively (see Table 13). The most common category of protocol deviations leading to elimination from ES in both the Co-administration and Staggered groups were 'assessment or time point completion' (38 participants [19.0%] and 61 participants [30.5%], respectively), and 'visit completion' (27 participants [13.5%] and 47 participants [23.5%], respectively).

The main reasons for elimination from ES to the PP set for anti-poliovirus vaccination and for Rotarix PCV-free vaccination were also 'out of window treatment administration' followed by 'out of window vist/phone contact 'and biological sample specimen procedures' (refer to Table 8.1.2 and Table 8.1.3 of the CSR).

## Number analysed

Number of participants with available results in the Staggered and Co-administration groups for seroconversion rates for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 neutralizing antibody titers equal or above 1:8, equal to or above 1:64 and Ratio of GMT 1 month post Dose 3 (per Protocol Set for immunogenicity for IPV) was 125 participants and 143 participants respectively.

Number of participants with available results in the Staggered and Co-administration groups for seroconversion rates for anti-RV IgA antibody titers 1 month post Dose 2 (per Protocol Set for immunogenicity for Rotarix PCV-free) was 130 participants and 146 participants respectively.

## Assessor's comment

The proportions of randomised participants that were not evaluable and eliminated for the analysis of the immunogenicity to inactivated poliovirus vaccine (PP set for IPV), i.e., the primary analysis addressing the confirmatory objective, were unexpectedly high with 26% (1-143/193) and 37.2% (1125/199) for the Co-administration group and Staggered group, respectively. These percentages were above the assumption of percentage of non-evaluable enrolled participants for sample size calculation (20%). Comparable proportions of participants were excluded from the PP set for Rotarix-PCV free vaccination.

This high rate of protocol deviations is essentially due to non-compliance of 'out of window treatment administration' and 'out of window visits'. The intervals between administration of dose 1 and dose 2 and of dose 2 and dose 3 were 30 days, with an allowed interval (during special circumstances) of 28 to 60 days which is considered as a wide/quite flexible interval. The interval between administration of dose 3 and blood sampling was to respect a 30-day timing, with an allowed interval of 30-36 days. Furthermore, a higher proportion of protocol deviations was observed in the Staggered group compared to the Co-administration group.

The reasons for these high rates of protocol deviations, particularly of 'out of window treatment administration' although not very stringent, and for this difference in proportions between groups, were not discussed by the MAH.

Because of this high rate of protocol deviations, the sample size of 160 evaluable participants defined to reach the 90% statistical power for the non-inferiority null hypothesis was not reached. This constitutes a major limitation regarding interpretation of the primary endpoint. The findings will present a relatively low strength of evidence to demonstrate the non-inferiority of co-administration versus staggered administration of IPV-Rotarix dosing in healthy Chinese infants receiving 1 st  dose between 6-10 weeks of age.

The primary analysis was also performed on the ES. This is because, as defined in the protocol, sensitivity analyses were to be performed if more than 5% of the ES participants with immunogenicity results after study intervention are excluded from the PPS.

## Recruitment

The first subject was enrolled on 22 March 2024 (first participant first visit) and the last subject completed on 22 October 2024 (last participant last visit). The analyses presented in this report are based on a database lock date of 29 April 2025. The study was conducted in 5 different sites in China.

The percentage of doses and participants reporting at least 1 AE (solicited or unsolicited) during the 14-day follow-up period were to be computed as described in SAP Section 4.5. The same calculations were planned for Grade 3 AEs and AEs leading to medically attended visits. However, the combination of solicited and unsolicited events within the same summary table was not deemed to be clinically

meaningful and therefore these analyses were not performed. All solicited and unsolicited events are summarized in separate tables.

## Changes following study unblinding/database lock and post-hoc analyses

No changes were made following database lock.

## Baseline data

Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between both groups. Overall, the mean (standard deviation) age at first dose was 8.1 (1.3) weeks. The number of female and male participants were comparable in both the Co-administration (92 females [47.7%] and 101 males [52.3%]) and Staggered (96 females [48.2%] and 103 males [51.8%]) groups. The demographic characteristics for the PPS populations were similar to those of the ES population (see Table 8.1.4, 8.1.5 and 8.1.6).

n/% = number/percentage of participants ina given category

Source:Table 8.1.4

N=number of participants

The percentage of participants (per participant) in ES who received concomitant medication (including anti-pyretic drugs) during the 14-day period (Day 1-Day 14) was lower in the Co-administration group (26.4% [15.0%]) compared to the Staggered group (45.2% [23.1%]) (see Table 8.1.7 of the CSR).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence of concomitant medication use during the 31-day period (Day 1-Day 31) following each dose was mostly similar between both groups (see Table 8.1.8 of the CSR).

## Immunogenicity results

Analyses on the immunogenicity endpoint were conducted primarily on the PPS. Immunogenicity summaries were also generated by sex and study sites. More than 5% of the ES participants with immunogenicity results after study intervention were excluded from the PPS and hence, the confirmatory analysis was repeated on the ES.

## Primary objective

The primary objective (confirmatory) was met. In terms of anti-poliovirus serotypes neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates at 1 month post Dose 3 of the IPV study intervention, the Coadministration group was shown to be non-inferior to the Staggered group, as the LL of the 2-sided 95% CI for the group difference (Co-administration group minus Staggered group) in seroconversion rate was greater than or equal to -10% for each of the anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 antibodies.

- At 1 month post Dose 3, the difference in seroconversion rate between the Co-administration group and the Staggered group for anti-poliovirus type 1 neutralizing antibody was 0.10 (LL: 3.14; UL: 3.76).
- At 1 month post Dose 3, the difference in seroconversion rate between the Co-administration group and the Staggered group for anti-poliovirus type 2 neutralizing antibody was -0.70 (LL: 3.86; UL: 2.30).
- At 1 month post Dose 3, the difference in seroconversion rate between the Co-administration group and the Staggered group for anti-poliovirus type 3 neutralizing antibody was 0 (LL: -2.63; UL: 2.99).

The immunological response for IPV in ES was comparable to PPS.

## Assessor's comment

The primary objective was the demonstration of non-inferior neutralising antibody responses (seroconversion rates) specific to polioviruses 1, 2 and 3 following administration of IPV with Rotarix PCV-free versus IPV alone. In the Co-administration group, participants received Rotarix PCV-free coadministered with IPV at Month 0.5 and Month 1.5, and the third dose of IPV at Month 2.5. In the Staggered group, participants received Rotarix PCV-free at Day 1 and Month 1, and IPV at Month 0.5, Month 1.5, and Month 2.5.

Immunogenicity data specific to polioviruses 1, 2, and 3 at 1 month post Dose 3 to address the primary objective were available for n=143 and n=125 participants in the Co-administration group and in the Staggered group respectively (PP set for IPV).

The primary (confirmatory) objective was met but, as mentioned above, without sufficient statistical power. Nevertheless, and consistent with previous findings, immunogenicity data of anti-poliovirus neutralising antibodies (in terms of both SRC and GMTs) suggest overall similar immune responses when co-administrated versus single administration (Staggered administration group). The reverse cumulative distribution curves for anti-poliovirus neutralizing antibody titres 1 month post Dose 3 confirm these findings (see below, secondary objectives and Figures 8.2.6 of the CSR). The humoral responses for IPV in ES was comparable to PPS.

## Secondary objectives

Regarding the IPV immunogenicity secondary objective (Table 15),

For anti-poliovirus serotype 1 neutralizing Ab titer at 1 month post Dose 3 of IPV:

- GMTs were 1374.44 (95% CI: 1148.21, 1645.25) in the Co-administration group and 1369.71 (95% CI: 1140.65, 1644.78) in the Staggered group. The GMT ratio (Coadministration/Staggered) was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.30).

## Assessor's comment

At 1 month post Dose 3 of IPV administration, an increase in the immune response in terms of antipoliovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 neutralizing antibody titers compared to baseline was observed for IPV both in the Co-administration group and Staggered group. Anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 neutralizing antibody GMTs at 1 month post Dose 3 of IPV in the Co-administration and Staggered groups were within similar ranges. The humoral responses for IPV in ES was comparable to PPS.

Regarding the secondary objective Rotarix PCV-free immunogenicity (Table 16),

- The seroconversion rate (the percentage of participants who were initially seronegative [i.e., with anti-RV IgA Ab concentration &lt;20 U/mL prior the first dose of Rotarix] and developed anti-RV IgA Ab concentration ≥20 U/mL at 1 month post Dose 2), was 90.4% (95% CI: 84.4, 94.7) in the Coadministration group and 78.5% (95% CI: 70.4, 85.2) in the Staggered group.
- Anti-RV IgA Ab GMCs at 1 month post Dose 2, anti-RV IgA Ab GMC was 222.15 (95% CI: 165.98, 297.34) in the Co-administration group and 160.59 (95% CI: 114.49, 225.25) in the Staggered group.
- Percentage of participants with antiRV IgA Ab concentrations ≥90 U/mL at 1 month post Dose 2 was 68.5% (95% CI: 60.3, 75.9) in the Co-administration group and 63.8% (95% CI: 55.0, 72.1) in the Staggered group.

The immunological response for Rotarix PCV-free in ES was comparable to PPS (Table 8.2.2.3 of CSR).

## Assessor's comment

At 1 month post Dose 2 of Rotarix PCV-free administration, an increase in the immune response in terms of anti-RV IgA antibody concentration compared to baseline was observed for Rotarix PCV-free both in the Co-administration group and Staggered group.

A trend for higher seroconversion rate was observed in the Co-administration group (90.4% [95% CI: 84.4, 94.7]) as compared to in the Staggered group (78.5% [95% CI: 70.4, 85.2]). This trend was less pronounced in terms of anti-RV IgA antibody GMC, with overlapping 95% CI (GMC of 222.15 [95% CI: 165.98, 297.3] in the Co-administration group and of 160.59 [95% CI: 114.49, 225.2] in the Staggered group). The humoral response for Rotarix PCV-free in ES was comparable to PPS.

## Safety results

The analysis of safety was performed on the ES. Compliance in completing the solicited systemic AE information following Dose 1 and Dose 2 administration in the Co-administration group was 100%. Compliance in completing the solicited systemic AE information following Dose 1, Dose 2, Dose 3, and Dose 4 administration in the Staggered group was 99.0%, 100%, 99.5%, and 99.5%, respectively.

## Solicited systemic events

During the 14-day (Day 1-Day 14) follow-up period, the solicited systemic events reported (per participant) after dose 1 and dose 2 of the study interventions (both Rotarix PCV-free and IPV), are presented below:

- Fever was the most frequently reported solicited systemic event in both the Co-administration and Staggered groups (21.8% of participants and 48.2% of participants, respectively). Majority of the participants had fever &lt;38.5°C.
- Cough/runny nose was the most frequently reported solicited systemic event that led to medically attended visits in both the Co-administration and Staggered groups (10.9% of participants and 18.8% of participants, respectively).
- Grade 3 solicited systemic events were reported in a small percentage of participants in both the Co-administration group (ranging between 0.0% of participants to 3.6% of participants) and the Staggered group (ranging between 0.0% of participants to 3.0% of participants). The duration of each solicited systemic event was mostly similar between the Coadministration and Staggered groups. The median duration (per dose) for solicited systemic events ranged between 1.0 day to 5.0 days in both groups. Per dose, the median duration was highest for cough/runny nose (5.0 days) in Co-administration group, and loss of appetite (3.5 days) in Staggered group.

A total of 16 solicited systemic events (8%) in the Co-administration group and 9 solicited systemic events (2%) in the Staggered group were ongoing after the 14-days solicited period (see Table 8.3.4 of the CSR). Most of these events were cough/runny nose (9 events in the Co-administration group and 7 events in the Staggered group) with the median duration of 25.0 days in the Co-administration group and 21.0 days in the Staggered group. As of EoS, all these events were resolved.

## Unsolicited AEs

During the 31 days (Day 1-Day 31) follow-up period, the unsolicited AEs collected after each dose of Rotarix PCV-free study intervention, are presented below:

- Unsolicited AEs were reported in 38.3% of participants in the Co-administration group and 33.2% of participants in the Staggered group.
- Unsolicited AEs reported in ≥5% of participants in either Co -administration group or Staggered group were pyrexia, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection and cough.
- Pneumonia and cough were the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs that led to medically attended visits (6.2% and 5.2% of participants, respectively, in the Co-administration group, and 6.0% and 0.0% of participants, respectively, in the Staggered group).
- Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported in 2 participants (1.0%) of the Co-administration group and 1 participant (0.5%) of the Staggered group. The Grade 3 unsolicited AEs reported among

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

participants of Co-administration group were diarrhoea, pertussis, and pneumonia. The Grade 3 unsolicited AEs reported among participants of Staggered group were bronchitis, and myocardial injury.

- None of the reported non-serious unsolicited AEs were considered causally related to Rotarix PCV-free study intervention by the investigator in participants of Co-administration groups. Nine non-serious unsolicited AEs reported in 8 participants (4.0%) were considered causally related to Rotarix PCV-free study intervention by the investigator in participants of Staggered group.

## Serious adverse events

An overview of safety of Rotarix PCV-free and IPV in terms of SAEs reported during the entire study period is provided below:

- SAEs were reported in 15.5% of participants in the Co-administration group and 15.1% of participants in the Staggered group. Pneumonia and febrile infection were the most frequently reported SAEs in both the Co-administration group (8.3% and 2.6%, respectively) and the Staggered group (8.5% and 2.0%, respectively).
- One SAE of diarrhoea reported in the Co-administration group was considered causally related to study intervention by the investigator. None of the SAEs reported among participants of Staggered group during the study were considered causally related to study intervention by the investigator.

## Deaths

There were no fatal AEs reported among participants of both Co-administration and Staggered groups.

## Discontinuation of study intervention/withdrawal from study due to AEs

An overview of events leading to discontinuation of study intervention or withdrawal from the study is provided below:

One participant from Co-administration group was withdrawn from the study due to an SAE (sepsis). The same participant also experienced unsolicited AE of upper respiratory tract infection. Both the SAE and the other unsolicited AEs were assessed as not related to study intervention by the investigator. One participant from Staggered group experienced a solicited systemic event of vomiting that led to withdrawal from study.

## Assessor's comment

Safety analysis was performed on the ES and included n=193 participants in the Co-administration group and n=199 participants in the Staggered group, respectively. The demographic characteristics between the two study groups were overall comparable.

Follow-up for AEs was limited to approximatively 1 month for each of the 3 doses of IPV and RotarixPCV free in both study groups.

Solicited systemic AEs and unsolicited AEs frequencies in the Co-administration group were overall comparable to the Staggered group. Duration and severity were overall comparable between the 2 groups and no unexpected safety events were collected. No related SAEs were observed in both groups. No fatal AEs were reported.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the data collected and the descriptive analysis, the tolerability and reactogenicity data from the ROTA-098 study indicated that Rotarix PCV-free vaccine has an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile in both Co-administration and Staggered groups. The Co-administration of Rotarix PCV-free and IPV did not raise any safety concerns. These findings confirm other the previous studies regarding the Co-administration of Rotarix PCV-free with hexavalent vaccines which contain the similar IPV, and for which the results are already reflected in the current SmPC.

## Discussion on clinical aspects

Study ROTA-098 was a PAM, open label, randomised, controlled, Phase 3 conducted in 5 different sites in China to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) when coadministered with Porcine circovirus (PCV)-free liquid formulation of an oral live attenuated human rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix PCV-free) in Chinese healthy infants 6-10 weeks of age. The active control group - 'Staggered group' - did receive sequential administrations of Rotarix PCV-free followed by IPV vaccines. The targeted sample size was 200 participants in each group. The total duration of the study, per participant, would be approximately 3.5 months.

The primary objective was the demonstration of non-inferior neutralising antibody responses (in terms of seroconversion rates) specific to polioviruses 1, 2 and 3 following administration of IPV with Rotarix PCV-free versus IPV alone, at 1 month post Dose 3 (Per protocol Set [PPS]). To be achieved, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the group difference (Co-administration group minus Staggered group) in seroconversion rate had to be greater than or equal to -10% for each of the anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 antibodies. Secondary objectives included further characterization of humoral responses to IPV and Rotarix PCV-free vaccinations.

In the Co-administration group, participants received Rotarix PCV-free co-administered with IPV at Month 0.5 and Month 1.5, and the third dose of IPV at Month 2.5. In the Staggered group, participants received Rotarix PCV-free at Day 1 and Month 1, and IPV at Month 0.5, Month 1.5, and Month 2.5.

Immunogenicity data specific to polioviruses 1, 2, and 3 at 1 month post Dose 3 to address the primary objective were available for n=143 (74.1% of the randomised participants) and n=125 (62.8% of the randomised participants) participants in the Co-administration group and in the Staggered group respectively (PP set for IPV). The conservative sample size determination for 90% statistical power (assuming 20% of exposed participants would not be evaluable) was not reached. Indeed, insufficient participant compliances in respecting predefined acceptable scheduled timepoints/time-windows for immunisation and/or visits did impact the statistical power and precision of estimates. The reasons for these high rates of protocol deviations, particularly of 'out of window treatment administration' (although not very stringent), and for this difference in proportions between groups, were not discussed by the MAH. Because more than 5% of the ES participants with immunogenicity results after study intervention were excluded from the PPS, the primary analysis was also performed on the ES.

The primary (confirmatory) objective was met but, as mentioned above, without sufficient statistical power. Nevertheless, and consistent with previous findings, immunogenicity data of anti-poliovirus neutralising antibodies (in terms of both SRC and GMTs) suggest overall similar immune responses when co-administrated versus single administration (Staggered group). Regarding humoral response to Rotarix PCV-free, a trend for higher seroconversion rate was observed in the Co-administration group (90.4% [95% CI: 84.4, 94.7]) as compared to in the Staggered group (78.5% [95% CI: 70.4, 85.2]). This trend was less pronounced in terms of anti-RV IgA antibody GMC, with overlapping 95% CI (GMC

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of 222.15 [95% CI: 165.98, 297.3] in the Co-administration group and of 160.59 [95% CI: 114.49, 225.2] in the Staggered group).

The safety/reactogenicity data were collected in n=193 and n=199 participants of the Coadministration group and the Staggered group respectively and indicated that Rotarix PCV-free vaccine has an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile in both Co-administration and Staggered groups. The coadministration of Rotarix PCV-free and IPV did not raise any safety concerns. The safety profile is in line with the frequencies reported in current section 4.8.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

In light of the study findings and their limited strength of evidence, there is no request to update section 4.5 of the SmPC as the Co-administration of IPV (included in tetra/hexavalent vaccines) with Rotarix is already described. The results of this study can be considered in line with the wording of the current SmPC.
