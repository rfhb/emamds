## Steps taken after granting the Marketing Authorisation

For procedures finalised after 01 July 2004 please refer to module 8B.

- On  10  September  1999,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  to  the  EMEA  one application for a Type I variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95 of  10  March  1995,  as  amended.  The  scope  of  this  variation  was  to  move  the  site  and responsibility  for  the  final  batch  release  in  the  European  Union  from  Usiphar,  Compiègne  in France,  to  Hoechst  Marion  Roussel  Deutschland  GmbH,  Frankfurt  am  Main,  Germany. On 20 September 1999, the EMEA issued a positive notification for this Type I variation which required  amendments  to  Annex  II  (General  Conditions  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation)  and Annex IIIB (Package Leaflet) of the Commission Decision. A Commission Decision was issued on 08 Dec 1999.
- On 20 October 1999, due to the reporting of 16 potential cases of pancytopenia and 9 cases of serious skin reactions, the Marketing Authorisation Holder requested an update of the Summary of  Product  Characteristics  and  Package  Leaflet  through  an  Urgent  Safety  Restriction  (USR) procedure  in  accordance  with  article  1(2)  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95  as amended.  The  scope  of  the  procedure  was  to  introduce  new  information  regarding  the association  of  leflunomide  with  other  DMARDs,  the  monitoring  of  the  patients  being  treated with leflunomide and the washout procedures to be performed in case of occurrence of serious hematological or cutaneous reactions. The changes were introduced in the Indications, Contraindications,  Special  warnings  and  Precautions  for  use  and  Undesirable  effects  sections  of  the SPC.  The  Patient  Leaflet  was  modified  accordingly.  The  USR  procedure  was  finalised  on 21 October 1999. The EMEA issued a Public Statement to inform the health professionals and the patients of this new information
- In  follow  up  to  the  USR,  on  5  November  1999,  the  MAH  submitted  a  Type  II  variation  in accordance  with  European  Commission  regulation  (EC)  No  542/95  of  10  March  1995,  as amended, to update the Summary of Product Characteristics and as a consequence the Package Leaflet  to  reflect  the  new  information  provisionally  introduced  through  the  USR.  The  CPMP adopted  a positive opinion on the application  on  18  November  1999.  The  respective Commission decision was issued on 24 March 2000.
- On 28 April 2000, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA one application for a Type I variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95 of 10 March 1995, as amended. The scope of this variation was to introduce a change in the manufacturing process of the active substance. On 30 May 2000, the EMEA issued a positive notification for this Type I variation, which did not require any amendments to the Commission Decision.
- On 10 May 2000, the Marketing Authorisation Holder notified the EMEA of its intention to introduce  changes  to  aspects  of  the  Package  Leaflet  not  connected  to  the  Summary  of  the Product  Characteristics,  in  accordance  with  Article  10(3)  of  Council  Directive  92/27/EEC  of 31  March  1992.  On  17  May  2000,  the  EMEA  issued  a  positive  notification.  The  European Commission amended the Decision on 04 July 2000.
- On 16 June 2000, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA one application for a Type I variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95 of 10 March 1995, as amended.

- On 20 July 2000, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA one application for  a  Type  I  variation  in  accordance  with  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95  of 10  March  1995,  as  amended.  The  scope  of  this  variation  was  to  change  the  name  of  the Marketing Authorisation Holder from Hoechst Marion Roussel Deutschland GmbH to Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH (name change due to a merger with Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer). This change resulted in two consequential changes (in the name of the manufacturer of the active substance and of the  manufacturer of the medicinal product).  In addition the MAH took the opportunity to update the pharmacotherapeutic / ATC code to reflect the final WHO assignment and  to  amend  minor  linguistic  errors  within  the  product  literature.  On  25  August  2000,  the EMEA issued a positive notification for this Type I variation which required amendments to Annex  I  (Summary  of  the  Product  Characteristics),  Annex  II  (General  Conditions  of  the Marketing Authorisation)  and  Annex  III  (Labelling  and  Package  Leaflet)  of  the  Commission Decision. A Commission Decision was issued on 15 Nov 2000.
- On  28  February  2001,  due  to  the  reporting  of  296  cases  with  hepatic  reactions  including 129 serious cases (amongst these serious cases 2 cases of liver cirrhosis and 15 cases of liver failure, 9 with fatal outcome), the Marketing Authorisation Holder requested an update of the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet through an Urgent Safety Restriction (USR)  procedure  pursuant  to  article  1(2)  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95  as amended.  The  scope  of  the  procedure  was  to  strengthen  the  information  regarding  the  liver monitoring of patients being treated with leflunomide, the association of leflunomide with other hepatotoxic medications and the washout procedures to be performed in case of occurrence of serious  adverse  reactions.  The  recommendations  reinforce  the  fact  that  it  is  essential  that monitoring  recommendations  should  be  strictly  adhered  to  and  that  Arava  should  only  be prescribed by specialists experienced in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The changes were introduced  to  the  Indications,  Posology  and  method  of  administration,  Contra-indications, Special warnings and Special Precautions for use and Undesirable effects sections of the SPC. The Patient Leaflet was modified accordingly. The USR procedure was finalised on 1 March 2001. The EMEA issued a Public Statement to inform the health professionals and the patients of this new information.
- On  28  February  2001,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  to  the  EMEA  an application for a Type I variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 542/95 of  10  March  1995,  as  amended.  The  procedure  started  on  28  February  2001.  The  Marketing Authorisation Holder applied to demonstrate compliance with Commission Directive 1999/82/EC  and  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  minimising  the  risk  of  transmitting  animal spongiform  Encephalopathy  agents  via  medicinal  products.  On  28  March  2001  the  EMEA approved this variation, which did not require any amendments to the Commission Decision.
- On 9 March 2001, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA one application for  a  Type  II  variation  in  accordance  with  Commission   Regulation   (EC)  No   542/95  of 10   March   1995,  as  amended.  The  scope  of  this  variation  was  to  introduce  changes  in  the Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SPC)  and  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  in  the  following  area, following  the  introduction  of  an  Urgent  Safety  Restriction  on  1 March 2001  to  include  new special warnings and special precaution for use with regard to serious liver injuries including fatal cases; to include additional undesirable effects related to serious liver injuries (hepatitis, jaundice/cholestasis and very rarely, severe liver injury such as hepatic failure and acute hepatic necrosis that may be fatal). The Commission Decision was issued 31 July 2001.
- On 8 August 2001, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA (in accordance with Council Directive No: 92/27/EEC of 31 March 1992), its intention to introduce changes to aspects  of  the  Package  Leaflet  not  connected  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics. The  scope  of  this  notification  relates  to  a  change  of  name  and  address  of  the  Local Representative for Arava in France (Annex IIIB).

The Marketing Authorisation Holder applied to change one of the manufacturing sites for the manufacturing process for the medicinal product.
