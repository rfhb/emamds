| II/0014   | Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to optimize the instructions with regard to the timing of the loading dose of prasugrel in patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention based on data from TADF (ACCOAST) Study and ALKK PCI registry (Study B008). C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 21/11/2013   | 18/12/2013   | SmPC                   | The TADF (ACCOAST) study showed that there was no benefit in non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients with elevated troponin who received a 30 mg loading dose prior to coronary angiography followed by a 30 mg loading dose at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to patients who received the conventional 60 mg loading dose at the time of the PCI. On the contrary, the experimental pre- treatment regimen was associated with a significantly increased risk of TIMI major bleedings compared to the conventional regimen. The higher rate in the pre-treatment group was driven by the non-CABG-related bleedings in the PCI-only group during the first 7 days following the first loading dose. The German registry study showed that at least in some regions of Europe it is common practice to administer the loading dose of prasugrel prior to coronary angiography in an unstable angina (UA)/NSTEMI population. Even if this did not appear to increase the bleeding rate compared to patients receiving the loading dose after coronary visualisation in this particular study, it is a somewhat worrying finding given the similarities of the used front-loading regimen with the experimental arm in the TADF study. Consequently, the changes to the SmPC were introduced to reflect the results of the TADF study to inform the healthcare providers on increased risk of serious bleeding in UA/NSTEMI patients undergoing PCI when prasugrel is administered prior to diagnostic coronary angiography.   |

In TRITON, for every 1000 patients treated with prasugrel, there were 22 fewer patients with MI, and 5 more with non-CABG-related TIMI major haemorrhages, compared with patients treated with clopidogrel. The TRILOGY study showed the relative safety of the 5 mg MD in those patients at increased risk of bleeding (although TRILOGY did not show superior efficacy of prasugrel versus clopidogrel in the ACS-MM population). Thus, the overall benefit/risk profile for prasugrel is favorable, particularly given that prasugrel achieved significant superiority over clopidogrel, an active comparator already demonstrated to be safe and effective in the setting of ACS managed by PCI (CURE 2001; PCI- CURE Mehta et al. 2001). The CHMP concluded that the safety profile for prasugrel remains unchanged. Based upon the data that have become available since the granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance of prasugrel remains positive.

| II/0012 | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include the data from the completed pharmacodynamic study (TAEH) regarding the use of prasugrel in patients previously receiving clopidogrel. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 30/05/2013 | 13/11/2013 | SmPC | In order to provide more data on switching between clopidogrel and prasugrel, the pharmacodynamic data from 276 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were analysed. Switching from an initial loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel or placebo administered upon presentation to the hospital prior to coronary angiography to a 60 mg loading dose of prasugrel administered at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention, resulted in a similar increased inhibition of platelet aggregation for the 72 hour                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The subject of these studies was the use of 5 mg prasugrel in patients > 75 years old and patients < 60 kg. The first two studies evaluated the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data and the third one evaluated the efficacy and safety of 5 and 10 mg of prasugrel during 30 months. The conclusion is that the use of 5 mg prasugrel in patients aged > 75 years or with a weight of < 60 kg is effective and safe. |

The three adverse drug reactions (ADRs), namely: hypersensitivity including angioedema, thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura and thrombocytopaenia were included in section 4.8 and hypersensitivity including angioedema and modification of wording of thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura were included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. In parallel, a new signal associated with prasugrel was detected in EudraVigilance database. This signal concerned reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients receiving prasugrel, including in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to clopidogrel. Therefore, based on these reports it was agreed to strengthen the wording so that angioedema is listed in sections 4.4 and 4.8 with a specific mention of the possibility of this reaction in patients who experienced an angioedema with clopidogrel and that the initiation of treatment with prasugrel in patients who previously experienced angioedema or other hypersensitivity reactions with clopidogrel should be performed with extreme caution and under medical supervision. PL was updated to reflect the changes to the SmPC.
