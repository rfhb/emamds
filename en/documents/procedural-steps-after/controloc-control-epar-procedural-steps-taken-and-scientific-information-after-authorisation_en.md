|                    | Update of sections 4.4 in order to add a warning on 'Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs)' based on post-marketing experience. In addition, the MAH proposes to update section 4.5 of the SmPC to introduce information regarding Drug-Laboratory Interactions. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes and to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

There was a peak in SCAR cases in 2018 (45 total, with 10 cases that resulted in death or were life- threatening). Since then, case numbers have been lower, with less reactions resulting in either death and/or being life-threatening. There were only 19 cases reported in 2021, with 2 events that resulted in death or were considered life-threatening. In the FAERS database, there were 721 cases cumulatively over 5 PTs (AGEP, DRESS, SJS, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and TEN). In the Vigibase database, there were 565 cases reported over 5 PTs (subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, TEN, DRESS, AGEP, and SJS). A warning on SCARs was added to 4.4. of the SmPC accordingly. False positive results in urine THC screenings in patients receiving pantoprazole were reported in the literature. It was added to 4.5 of the SmPC to consider a confirmatory method in these cases.

Of the 97 cases of hypocalcaemia reported, 85 cases (87%) also included the event of hypomagnesemia. The remaining 12 cases which did not report hypomagnesemia as an additional event were confounded by the patient's medical history and/or other concomitant medications. 32 cases out of 97 cases (33%) contained the event of hypokalaemia as well as hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesemia.

| containing the PT 'hypocalcaemia' in patients who were treated with Takeda PPIs (Dexlansoprazole, Lansoprazole and Pantoprazole). The existing warning regarding Hypomagnesaemia in Section 4.4. is proposed to be adapted accordingly. adding also that Hypomagnesaemia may lead to hypocalcaemia and/or hypokalaemia and that hypomagnesaemia associated hypocalcaemia and/or hypokalaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 2. To update section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to add DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) with the frequency 'unknown' based on a comprehensive review of the global safety database for all cases containing the PT 'Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms' on all PPIs that are currently marketed by Takeda (i.e. lansoprazole, pantoprazole sodium, pantoprazole magnesium and dexlansoprazole). The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the last QRD template (version 10.1), to update the list of local representatives and to implement editorial corrections to the PI. The requested grouped work-sharing procedure proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to   | cessation of PPI use and recurrence of the event upon re- challenge, strengthened the causal association. 2. 69 (72 events) cases of DRESS were identified with patients on pantoprazole. The cases reported with pantoprazole amounted to 69% of cases of DRESS identified with Takeda PPIs. 67 (97%) of those cases were classified as serious, 2 (3%) were considered non-serious. There were no cases of positive rechallenge for pantoprazole. However, re-challenge tests to ascertain the link between DRESS and any drug is particularly problematic, as reintroduction of the culprit drug in patients may result in fatality. This would explain why so few cases of re-challenge for this PT have been recorded. A postulated mechanism in the literature such as hapten, prohapten, and the p- i concept may play roles in the pathogenesis of these reactions. 48% of reported DRESS events appeared within 2 to 6 weeks following treatment with pantoprazole (and/or lansoprazole), which is consistent with the recognized pathophysiology of the disease. Pantoprazole have a significant number of reports for DRESS. DRESS is an established important identified risk documented umbrella term of SCAR in the pantoprazole RMP.

|           | Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. The Worksharing Applicant (WSA) proposed the update of section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to add an interaction between pantoprazole and methotrexate following the assessment of cases of interaction and published literature in FUMs 13, 12, 12, 18, 13. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. Furthermore, the WSA used this opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 9. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the   |            |            | and PL                           | literature it was shown that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. Current evidence supporting reduced methotrexate elimination in patients receiving PPIs is primarily based on studies conducted in patients receiving high dose treatment, which is usually carried out in a specialist medical setting. Nevertheless, considering the evidence available to date a mention of these facts was added to 4.5 of the SmPC of OTC pantoprazole.   |

| WS/0122     | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of section 4.8 of the SPC to add Agranulocytosis, Pancytopenia, Hypomagnesaemia, Taste disorders and Gynaecomastia as new adverse drug reactions based on post-marketing data and literature references. Section 4 of the PL is updated accordingly. Furthermore the MAH took the opportunity to bring the Product Information in line with QRD template vs. 7.3.1. and to update the list of local representatives. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 20/10/2011   | 05/12/2011 | SmPC and PL | Following post marketing surveillance data section 4.8. of the SPC was updated: Agranulocytosis, taste disorder and gynaecomastia were listed as rare side effects. Pancytopenia was added as a very rare side effect and hypomagnesaemia was listed as a side effect of not known frequency. The evidence with regard to hypomagnesaemia in short term use was not deemed sufficient to add an additional safety warning in 4.4. of the SPC for the OTC which are indicated for short-term use only. |
