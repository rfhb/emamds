* Instead of four 250 mg sachets, one full 1 000 mg sachet can be mixed with 36 mL of water or apple juice. This mixture should be administered with a syringe, according to the administered dose volume detailed in Table 5.

Recommended dose of Sephience oral powder in sachet by body weight for patients 2 years and older and weighing 16 kg or more

## The recommended dose is 60 mg/kg/day.

For maintenance doses greater than or equal to 1 000 mg, the calculated daily dose should be rounded to the nearest multiple of 250 mg or 1 000 mg, as appropriate. For instance, a calculated dose of 1 251 to 1 374 mg should be rounded down to 1 250 mg corresponding to 1×250 mg sachet and 1×1 000 mg sachet. A calculated dose of 1 375 to 1 499 mg should be rounded up to 1 500 mg corresponding to 2×250 mg sachets and 1×1000 mg.

## Missed dose

A missed dose should be taken as soon as possible. The normal dosing schedule should be resumed the following day.

## Discontinuation of treatment

In the pivotal Phase 3 clinical study, a threshold of 15% or greater reduction in blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels was utilised for determination of response.

No controlled efficacy and safety data are available in patients who do not experience a reduction of 15% or greater reduction in blood Phe levels after receiving sepiapterin for 14 days.

The determination of responsiveness for a patient with PKU and the discontinuation of the medicinal product is at the discretion of the treating physician.

## Special populations

## Elderly

The safety and efficacy of Sephience in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. Caution should be exercised when prescribing in patients 65 years of age and older.

## Renal impairment

The safety and efficacy of Sephience in patients with renal impairment have not yet been established. No data are available (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

The safety and efficacy of Sephience in patients with hepatic impairment have not yet been established. No data are available (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

In the Phase 3 clinical studies of Sephience, some paediatric patients experienced hypophenylalaninaemia including some patients with multiple low blood Phe levels (see section 4.8).

## Method of administration

## Oral use.

Sephience should be administered once daily with a meal, using mg/kg dosing.

Sephience oral powder comes in individual sachets of 250 mg or 1 000 mg and should be mixed in water, apple juice, or a small amount of soft food such as apple sauce and jams.

Sephience is intended for long-term use.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patients weighing less than 16 kg

Sephience should be mixed with water or apple juice (9 mL for each 250 mg sachet; 36 mL for each 1 000 mg sachet), and a portion of this mixture corresponding to a required dose should be administered orally via an oral dosing syringe. The preparation should be mixed well for at least 30 seconds until uniform and free of lumps, before drawing into the dosing syringe. Once mixed, the dose should be administered immediately. If not administered immediately, the liquid mixture can be administered within 6 hours or 24 hours, when stored at room temperature (below 25 °C) or in a refrigerator (2 °C - 8 °C), respectively. The preparation should be mixed once again for at least 30 seconds, before administration. The syringe should be rinsed with additional water or juice (at least 15 mL) to remove any residual and swallowed immediately.

## Patients weighing 16 kg or more

Sephience should be mixed with water or apple juice (9 mL for each 250 mg sachet; 20 mL for each 1 000 mg sachet) or soft foods (2 tablespoons total). The preparation should be mixed well for at least 30 seconds with water or apple juice and for at least 60 seconds with soft foods until uniform and free of lumps. Once mixed,  administer the dose immediately. If not administered immediately, the liquid and soft food mixtures can be administered within 6 hours or 24 hours when stored at room temperature (below 25 °C) or in a refrigerator (2 °C - 8 °C), respectively. The liquid mixture and soft food mixtures should be mixed once again for at least 30 seconds and 60 seconds, respectively, before administration. The container should be rinsed with additional water or juice (at least 15 mL) to remove any residual and swallowed immediately.

## Administration via enteral feeding tube

Sephience oral powder may be administered via an enteral feeding tube 6 Fr or 8 Fr after mixing with water. The manufacturer's instructions for the feeding tube should be followed prior to administering the medicinal product. For instructions on preparation of Sephience before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Dietary intake

Patients treated with Sephience should undergo regular clinical assessments to align with their health care provider on appropriate dietary Phe intake (such as monitoring of blood Phe and tyrosine levels and nutritional intake).

## Concomitant use with dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitors

Co-administration of sepiapterin with DHFR inhibitors (e.g. trimethoprim, methotrexate, pemetrexed, pralatrexate, and trimetrexate) may require more frequent monitoring of blood Phe levels (see section 4.5).

## Long-term safety data

Long-term safety data in patients with PKU are limited (see section 4.8 for adverse reactions evaluated to date for sepiapterin).

## Excipients with known effect

## Sodium content

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially ' sodium-free ' .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Isomalt content

Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Sepiapterin reductase (SR) inhibitors

Orally administered sepiapterin is quickly absorbed and rapidly and extensively converted by SR and carbonyl reductase to 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2), which is then unidirectionally converted to BH4 by DHFR. Co-administration of a SR inhibitor is expected to have minimal effect on biotransformation of sepiapterin due to the compensatory effect of carbonyl reductase. Normal blood Phe levels were reported in patients with SR deficiency. Neverthless, caution and more frequent monitoring of blood Phe are recommended when Sephience is co-administered with SR inhibitors, such as sulphasalazine or sulphamethoxazole.

## DHFR inhibitors

DHFR mediates the conversion of BH2 to BH4, inhibition of DHFR could potentially result in lower BH4 concentration. However, the impact on sepiapterin concentration is expected to be minimal due to the existence of multiple pathways for the elimination. Caution and more frequent monitoring of blood Phe are required in patients  when sepiapterin is co-administered with a DHFR inhibitor, such as trimethoprim, methotrexate, pemetrexed, pralatrexate, and trimetrexate (see section 4.4).

## Vasodilatory medicinal products

Caution is recommended during concomitant use of Sephience with medicinal products that cause vasodilation by affecting nitric oxide (NO) metabolism or action, including classical NO donors (e.g. glyceryl trinitrate [GTN], isosorbide dinitrate [ISDN], sodium nitroprusside [SNP], and molsidomin), phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil), and minoxidil. In animal studies, BH4 administered orally in combination with a PDE-5 inhibitor had no effect on blood pressure.

## Levodopa

Caution should be exercised when prescribing Sephience to patients receiving treatment with levodopa to monitor neurological disorders such as exacerbation of convulsion, increased excitability and irritability, seizures, and exacerbation of seizures.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy, and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are is a limited amount of data from the use of sepiapterin in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with sepiapterin in pregnant women .

As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Sephience during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether sepiapterin/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Sephience therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility

No clinical studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted for sepiapterin. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Sephience has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

As presented in the table below, the most frequent adverse reactions were: upper respiratory tract infection (19.8%); headache (15.3%); diarrhoea (14.9%); followed by abdominal pain (12.2%); faeces discoloured (4.5%) and hypophenylalaninaemia (2.7%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The selection of adverse reactions to sepiapterin was based on evidence from clinical trials. The frequency of adverse reactions, as presented below in the tabulated list, was calculated based on pooled data from the 2 pivotal clinical studies in patients with PKU (study PTC923-MD-003-PKU and study PTC923-MD-004-PKU). These data included 222 patients who were exposed to sepiapterin up to 60 mg/kg/day of which: 15 (6.8%) were &lt; 2 years old, 25 (11.3%) were 2 to &lt; 6 years old, 46 (20.7%) were 6 to &lt; 12 years old, 55 (24.8%) were 12 to &lt; 18 years old, and 81 (36.5%) were ≥ 18 years old, and the median duration of treatment (in weeks) was 34.286.

Adverse reactions are listed below (Table 6) by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC). Within each SOC adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000); and not known (cannot be estimated from available data).

| Metabolism and nutrition disorders | Common      | Hypophenylalaninaemia             |

* Grouping of 3 MedDRA Preferred Terms: Abdominal pain, Abdominal pain upper, Abdominal discomfort.

## Paediatric population

Overall, in PKU clinical studies, sepiapterin was well tolerated in paediatric patients. Frequency, type, and severity of adverse reactions in all age groups of paediatric patients were consistent with those in adults. Long-term safety data are limited.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No specific antidote is available for overdose with Sephience. Treatment of overdose with Sephience should consist of supportive medical care including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, Various alimentary tract and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX28

## Mechanism of action

Sepiapterin is a natural precursor of the enzymatic co-factor BH4, a critical co-factor for phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Sepiapterin acts as a dual pharmacological chaperone (sepiapterin and BH4 each with its own binding affinity to variant PAH), including PAH variants commonly found in PKU and known to be insensitive to BH4, to improve the activity of the defective PAH enzyme, achieving a high concentration of BH4 intracellularly. By enhancing the conformational stability of misfolded PAH enzyme and increasing the intracellular concentrations of BH4, sepiapterin is able to effectively reduce blood Phe levels.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy of sepiapterin was evaluated in three clinical studies in patients with PKU.

Study 1 (PTC923-MD-003-PKU) was a 2-part, global, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical study of 157 patients of all ages with PKU.

Part 1 of the study tested for responsiveness to sepiapterin, with 14 days of open-label treatment with sepiapterin followed by a minimum of 14 days of sepiapterin washout. Further, 73.1% (114/156) of study participants demonstrated a ≥ 15% reduction in blood Phe levels in response to sepiapterin. The dose of sepiapterin in patients ≥ 2 years of age was 60 mg/kg/day.

Subjects were instructed to continue their usual diet without modification.

Patients ≥ 2 years of age who experienced a ≥ 15% reduction in blood Phe levels were classified as responsive and continued into Part 2 (n=110). After the washout period from Part 1, patients were randomised equally to either sepiapterin 20 mg/kg/day for Weeks 1 and 2, 40 mg/kg/day for Weeks 3 and 4, 60 mg/kg/day for Weeks 5 and 6 (n=56), or placebo (n=54) for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy was assessed by the mean change in blood Phe levels from baseline to Weeks 5 and 6 in the sepiapterin-treated group as compared to the mean change in the placebo group in patients who demonstrated a ≥ 30% reduction in blood Phe levels during Part 1. In Part 2, demographics were well balanced between the 2 treatment arms (Table 7). The median age at the time of informed consent was 14 years (range: 2-54), and participants, in terms of race, were predominantly white (91.8%). More than half (65.5%) of the 110 participants had PKU diagnosed at birth, and the majority (82.7%) had ' biochemically defined ' non-classical PKU.

* Baseline is the average of Day -1 and Day 1 blood Phe levels in Part 2.

** Blood Phe concentrations were based on average values during Weeks 5 and 6.

LS means, standard errors, confidence intervals, and p values were from an MMRM with change in blood Phe from baseline to post-baseline assessments as the response variable, and fixed effects for treatment, baseline blood Phe, baseline Phe stratum, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction.

Similar responses were observed in the population of patients with classical PKU (cPKU), with a 69% reduction in blood Phe at Week 6 in subjects receiving sepiapterin (n=6) versus an increase of 3% after placebo (n=9).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study 2 (PKU-002) was a Phase 2, randomised, double-crossover, open-label, active-controlled, proof-of-concept clinical study of sepiapterin in patients with PKU.

The study consisted of 6 sequence groups of 4 patients per group for a total of 24 patients. Each sequence group was randomised to receive 7-day treatments of sepiapterin 60 mg/kg/day, sepiapterin 20 mg/kg/day, and sapropterin dihydrochloride 20 mg/kg/day, in random order followed by a 7-day washout after each treatment. Preliminary efficacy was assessed by the reduction in blood Phe concentrations. Results of the primary efficacy weekly mean analysis demonstrated that treatment with sepiapterin resulted in a decrease in blood Phe concentrations relative to baseline that was statistically significant for all treatments (n=24). A greater proportion of patients receiving sepiapterin treatment, regardless of dose, experienced plasma Phe reductions of at least 10%, 20%, and 30% compared with patients receiving sapropterin 20 mg/kg/day. More patients receiving sepiapterin 60 mg/kg/day achieved normalised plasma Phe concentrations (&lt; 120 μmol/L) and blood Phe within the target range (≤ 360 μmol/L) compared with sap ropterin 20 mg/kg/day. In subjects with cPKU, treatment with sepiapterin (60 mg/kg/day) resulted in a significant decrease in blood Phe concentration relative to baseline.

Study 3 (PTC923-MD-004-PKU) is an ongoing, Phase 3, multicentre, open-label clinical study to assess the safety and dietary Phe tolerance during long-term treatment with sepiapterin in patients with PKU. One hundred sixty-nine (169) patients received treatment with sepiapterin 7.5 mg/kg/day in participants 0 to &lt; 6 months of age, 15 mg/kg/day in participants 6 to &lt; 12 months of age, 30 mg/kg/day in participants 12 months to &lt; 2 years of age, or 60 mg/kg/day in participants ≥ 2 years of age. Interim data indicate that daily sepiapterin administration is associated with an approximately 2.3-fold increase in mean daily Phe consumption (27.6 mg/kg/day at baseline versus 62.5 mg/kg/day at Week 26) while maintaining Phe levels &lt; 360 μmol/L . The majority of subjects reached at least a 15% (76.7% of participants) or 30% (67.4% of participants) reduction in blood Phe (Figure 1).

Note: Baseline is defined as the average of daily dietary Phe consumption (mg/kg/day) at Month 1. The RDA is 0.8 g protein/kg, which is equivalent to approximately 40 mg/kg/day of Phe. Blood Phe levels baseline is the mean of the pre-assessment period Week 1 -2. 1 g of protein is equivalent to approximately 50 mg of Phe.

These data indicate that sepiapterin treatment may allow liberalisation of the highly restrictive diet that patients with PKU must adhere to.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects with history of allergies or adverse reactions to synthetic BH4 were excluded from the clinical studies.

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Sephience in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in HPA (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Following oral administration, sepiapterin is quickly absorbed, and the peak plasma concentrations occur in approximately 1 to 3 hours and decline to below the limit of quantitation (0.75 ng/mL) rapidly (generally by 12 hours). Maximum plasma sepiapterin concentration (Cmax) was approximately 2.80 ng/mL following the 60 mg/kg/day dose for 7 days with a high-fat high-calorie diet. No accumulation of sepiapterin was observed following repeated dosing.

Plasma sepiapterin is metabolised extensively to form the pharmacologically active metabolite BH4. The apparent terminal half-life for BH4 is approximately 5 hours. Both BH4 Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours postdose (AUC0-24h) increased with the dose, while the increase was less than dose proportional when the sepiapterin dose was above 20 mg/kg. There is no accumulation of BH4 following repeated doses of sepiapterin up to 60 mg/kg for 7 days.

## Effect of food

When sepiapterin was administered with a low-fat, low-calorie meal in the dose range of 20 to 60 mg/kg, BH4 exposures were 1.69- to 1.72-fold higher for Cmax and 1.62- to 1.73-fold higher for AUC0-24h compared to administration under fasted conditions. When sepiapterin was administered with a high-fat, high-calorie meal, BH4 exposures were 2.21- to 2.26-fold higher for Cmax and 2.51- to 2.84-fold higher for AUC0-24h compared to administration under fasted conditions.

Sepiapterin can be taken with any meal at any time of the day at the same time every day.

## Distribution

Binding of sepiapterin or BH4 to plasma protein is low, and the majority of sepiapterin and BH4 in plasma are free to exert pharmacological effects. In vitro studies show that sepiapterin is bound (mean 15.4%) to plasma protein in the presence of 0.1% dithiothreitol in the concentration range of 0.1 to 10 μM. BH4 was 41.3% (at 2 μM ), 33.0% (at 5 μM ), and 24.1% (at 15 μM ) bound to protein in human plasma in the presence of 0.5% β -mercaptoethanol.

In healthy subjects, elevated BH4 concentration was observed in the cerebrospinal fluid following repeated sepiapterin oral administration.

## Biotransformation

Sepiapterin is metabolised by SR/carbonyl reductase and DHFR in a 2-step unidirectional process to form BH4. The metabolism of BH4 is presumed to follow the same pathway as endogenous BH4, oxidised while acting as coenzymes for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, such as PAH, tyrosine hydroxylase, tryptophan hydroxylase, and alkylglycerol monooxygenase, and nitric oxide synthase, and some metabolites , like 4α -hydroxy-tetrahydrobiopterin and quinonoid dihydrobiopterin, could be recycled to regenerate BH4 mediated by pterin4α -carbinolamine dehydratase and dihydropteridine reductase.

Extensive metabolism of sepiapterin was observed in human following a single oral dose of 14 C-sepiapterin. The major metabolic pathway involved oxidation/dehydrogenation,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reduction/oxidation, oxidative deamination, dehydration, side chain cleavage, and methylation, etc, alone or in combination.

## Elimination

Following oral administration in healthy human participants, sepiapterin was extensively metabolised with the metabolites excreted primarily in faeces. Plasma sepiapterin declined rapidly following Cmax to below the limit of quantitation, generally by 12 hours post-dose. Plasma BH4 declined mono-exponentially following Cmax. The terminal half-life was approximately 5 hours.

Following a single oral dose of 14 C-sepiapterin to adult healthy subjects, a mean of 6.71% dosed radioactivity was recovered in urine and 26.18% in faeces with the combined total recovery of 32.9% by 240 hours. The majority of those radioactivity was recovered within the first 48 hours post-dose (28.2%). The total renal clearance of radioactivity derived from 14 C-sepiapterin was 1.54 L/h (25.6 mL/min). Formation of volatile metabolites from sepiapterin in the gastrointestinal tract was confirmed in an in vitro study using human intestinal microbiota.

## Special populations

## Age

PKU patients of all ages had been included in the Phase 3 clinical studies. Except for allometric effect on clearance and volume of distribution, no further age effect was identified in the population PK study.

## Ethnicity and race

Higher exposures to BH4 were observed for Asian subjects. In the Japanese ethno-bridging study, 10% to 24% higher AUC0-last and 14% to 29% higher Cmax of BH4 were observed in Japanese compared to non-Japanese subjects at sepiapterin dose range of 20 to 60 mg/kg.

## Renal impairment

The PK and safety of sepiapterin have not been studied in patients with renal impairment.

## Hepatic impairment

The PK and safety of sepiapterin have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.

## Drug interactions

## In vitro studies

In vitro studies indicate that sepiapterin and BH4 are unlikely to be perpetrators of CYP450-mediated metabolism.

In vitro , sepiapterin did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4, or induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4.

## In vivo studies

In healthy subjects, co-administration of sepiapterin (20 mg/kg) with a single dose of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor curcumin (2 g) increased the exposures of BH4 slightly. The overall estimated geometric mean ratios (GMRs) (90% CI) for BH4 Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to time of the last quantifiable measurement (AUC0-last) when sepiapterin was co-administered with curcumin compared to sepiapterin alone were 1.24 (1.15-1.33) and 1.20 (1.13 1.28), respectively. This modest increase is deemed not clinically relevant.

Co-administration of a single dose of sepiapterin at the maximum therapeutic dose of 60 mg/kg with the BCRP substrate rosuvastatin (10 mg) had no effect on the of rosuvastatin. The overall estimated GMRs (90% CI) for rosuvastatin Cmax and AUC0-last when rosuvastatin was co-administered with sepiapterin compared to rosuvastatin alone were 1.13 (1.00-1.28) and 1.02 (0.93-1.13), respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to reproduction and development.

In rats, following repeated oral administration, sepiapterin-related renal tubule degeneration/regeneration, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis were noted as a result of crystal deposition in the papillary collecting tubules. These findings were partially reversible after a 4-week recovery period and no kidney toxicity occurred at BH4 exposure levels 2 times the clinical BH4 exposure levels at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD).

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## Sephience 250 mg oral powder in sachet

## Sephience 1 000 mg oral powder in sachet sepiapterin

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What Sephience is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you take Sephience
3. How to take Sephience
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Sephience
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Sephience is and what it is used for

Sephience contains the active substance sepiapterin, which is a manmade version of a naturally occurring substance required to produce co-factor BH4. This is needed by certain enzymes (proteins) in the body to break down the amino acid Phe into tyrosine.

Sephience is used to treat hyperphenylalaninaemia (high blood levels of Phe) in patients of all ages with phenylketonuria (PKU). Our bodies break down the protein in foods into amino acids. PKU is an inherited disease where people cannot break down the amino acid Phe, causing it to build up in the blood and brain, which can be harmful.

Sepiapterin helps the body break down Phe, which allows it to reduce the harmful excess of phenylalanine in the blood.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Sephience

## Do not take Sephience

- -if you are allergic to sepiapterin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Sephience.

When you are treated with Sephience, your doctor or nurse will test your blood regularly to check your Phe levels.

Long-term safety data in patients with PKU are limited (see section 4 for side effects evaluated to date for Sephience).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other medicines and Sephience

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. In particular , you should tell your doctor if you are using some medicines called ' dihydrofolate inhibitors (DHFR) inhibitors ' that include antibiotics, immunosuppressants and medicines used to treat cancer (e.g. trimethoprim, methotrexate, pemetrexed, pralatrexate, and trimetrexate), medicines that cause dilation of blood vessels (such as glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), molsidomin, minoxidil), or levodopa (used to treat Parkinson's disease) . Using these medicines may require more frequent monitoring of your blood.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. As a precaution it is preferable to avoid use of sepiapterin if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.

## How much Sephience to take

The dose, which depends on your age and weight in kilograms (kg), will be calculated by your doctor who prescribes it for you (or your child). Based on that calculated dose, your doctor will indicate to you how many sachets you should take daily.

The recommended dose is:

- Under 6 months of age: 7.5 mg/kg body weight once a day
- Between 6 and 12 months of age: 15 mg/kg body weight once a day
- Between 12 and 24 months of age: 30 mg/kg body weight once a day

## Adults and children over 2 years of age

The recommended dose is 60 mg/kg body weight once a day.

## How Sephience is taken

Sephience can be mixed in water, apple juice, or soft foods such as apple sauce or jams. The dose is based on age and body weight. Your doctor will tell you:

- Which sachet dose to use (250 mg or 1 000 mg)
- The amount of water, apple juice, or soft foods to be added to Sephience

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The amount you will need to take for your prescribed dose
- If necessary, Sephience may be administered via enteral feeding tube. For details how to do so, please ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
