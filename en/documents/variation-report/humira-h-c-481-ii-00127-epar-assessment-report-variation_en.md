## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, AbbVie Ltd. submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 05 December 2013 an application for a variation including an extension of indication.

This application concerns the following medicinal product:

| Medicinal product:   | International non-proprietary name:   | Presentations:   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|
| Humira               | adalimumab                            | See Annex A      |

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   |                                                                             | Type   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| C.1.6 a)              | Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

The MAH applied for an extension of the indication for the treatment of paediatric subjects with enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), 6 years of age and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant of, conventional therapy. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC.

The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance.

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package leaflet.

The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet.

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decisions P/137/2013 and P/0259/2012 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0259/2012 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Adalimumab  is  a  recombinant,  fully  human  immunoglobulin  (IgG1)  monoclonal  antibody  that  binds specifically to the soluble and transmembrane forms of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and inhibits the binding of TNF-α to its receptors.

Adalimumab is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active juvenile idiopathic arthritis, active and progressive psoriatic arthritis, severe ankylosing spondylitis, moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis, moderate to severe Crohn's disease, and moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC).

The currently approved JIA indication is for the reduction the signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in children 4 years of age and older in the US, for children 2 years and older in the EU, and for children 4 to 17 years of age in Japan.

The MAH is applying for an extension of the indication for Humira as a treatment of ' enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy '.

Targeted disease

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is defined as arthritis of unknown etiology beginning before the age of 16 years, lasting more than 6 weeks and excluding other known conditions. Enthesitis-related arthritis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(ERA) is one of seven categories according to the classification made by the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR). The other categories are systemic JIA, oligoarthritis (persisted and  extended),  polyarthritis  (RF  positive  and  RF  negative),  psoriatic  arthritis  and  undifferentiated arthritis. Approximately 3% to 11% of all JIA cases present as ERA, although the estimates are wide ranging (1.2% to 27.9%). A study in Canada showed that the mean age at diagnosis of JIA (all types) was 6.9 years and the mean age at diagnosis of enthesitis-related JIA was 11.7 years with a difference of 4.8 years.

ERA is defined by the ILAR as, arthritis and enthesitis, or arthritis or enthesitis with at least 2 of the following:

- 1) the presence of or a history of sacroiliac joint tenderness and/or inflammatory lumbosacral pain;
- 2) the presence of human leukocyte antigen-B27 (HLA-B27);
- 3) onset of arthritis in a male over 6 years of age;
- 4) acute (symptomatic) anterior uveitis;
- 5)  history  of  ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS),  ERA,  sacroiliitis  with  inflammatory  bowel  disease,  Reiter's syndrome, or acute anterior uveitis in a first-degree relative.

In addition, the following conditions must not be present in order for a diagnosis of ERA to be made:

- 1) psoriasis (Ps) or a history of Ps in the patient or first-degree relative;
- 2) the presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) RF on at least 2 occasions at least 3 months apart; and
- 3) the presence of systemic JIA in the patient.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

In the Phase 3 Study M11-328, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of adalimumab were evaluated through Week 52 in paediatric subjects at least 6 to &lt;18 years old with active ERA. The influence of concomitant treatment with MTX was also evaluated.

A comparison with previous polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis data was also made.

## Analytical methods

Serum  concentrations  of  adalimumab  and  AAA  were  determined  using  a  validated  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Only serum samples that had adalimumab levels &lt;2.0 µg/mL were selected for AAA concentration measurement.

## Pharmacokinetic data analysis

Pharmacokinetic  data  were  analysed  using  population  modelling  in  NONMEM.  Observed  plasma concentration data were also described with summary statistics.

## Pharmacokinetics in target population

There  were  46  subjects  enrolled  in  Study  M11-328.  A  total  of  31  subjects  were  randomized  to adalimumab and 15 subjects were randomized to placebo treatment group during the Blinded period (Week 0 to Week 12). Three subjects discontinued early from the study before Week 52.

A summary of demographic characteristics is given below (table 1).

Influence of anti-adalimumab antibodies (AAA) on serum concentration of adalimumab

Among 46 subjects who had samples for pharmacokinetic analysis, 5 subjects were AAA+ during the 52-week of the study. Among the 5 subjects classified as AAA+, two received placebo for the first 12 weeks and then adalimumab treatment (one with MTX and one without), three received adalimumab treatment for 52 weeks (one with MTX and two without). The overall AAA+ rate was 10.9% (5/46) in patients treated with adalimumab. In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 13.6% (3/22), compared to 8.3% (2/24) when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate. None of the subjects with an AAA+ sample escaped or terminated early from the study. Adalimumab trough concentrations were below LLOQ in all 5 AAA+ subject when they became AAA+. Two AAAsubjects had at least one adalimumab trough concentration below LLOQ between Week 24 and Week 52.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

Adalimumab is a recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the soluble and transmembrane forms of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and inhibits the binding of TNF-α to its receptors.

Paediatric dosing is supported by a single-use, 40 mg/0.8 mL vial for subcutaneous (SC) administration (for paediatric use only), which is already approved in the EU. The recommended dose of adalimumab in subjects with ERA is 24 mg/m 2  body surface area (BSA) up to a maximum of 40 mg every other week (eow). This dose was shown t be safe and efficacious in paediatric subjects in previous studies in children with pJIA and it is the dose used in Study M11-328, the first randomized, placebo-controlled study of adalimumab in the treatment of paediatric ERA.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The aim of study M11-328 was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ADA given subcutaneously (sc) every other week (eow) as compared to placebo in paediatric subjects with ERA, and to examine the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of ADA following sc administration in this population. There were 46 subjects enrolled (31 subjects randomized to ADA and 15 subjects were randomized to placebo treatment group during the BD (Week 0 to Week 12).

Following the administration of 24 mg/m 2  (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to patients with enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, the mean trough steadystate (values measured at Week 24) serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.8 ± 6.6 μg/mL for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate and 11.8 ± 4.3 μg/mL with concomitant methotrexate.

The development of anti-adalimumab antibodies was associated with trough serum concentration falling below the lower limit of quantitation.

## 2.3.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Serum concentration of adalimumab was seen to increase over the first 12 weeks of dosing and steady state was reached between 12 and 24 weeks consistent with the half-life of adalimumab. At week 24, 36  and  52  the  serum  concentrations  were  comparable.  The  overall  steady  state  concentration  of adalimumab  following  eow  dosing  with  24  mg/m 2 of  adalimumab  was  approximately  10  µg/mL.  In subjects receiving MTX the serum trough concentration of adalimumab was slightly higher, about 30%.

The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab in paediatric subjects with Enthesitis Related Arthritis (ERA) is comparable to that of paediatric subjects with polyarticular JIA (i.e. the dose (4 mg/m² body surface

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

area  up  to  a  maximum  single  dose  of  40  mg  adalimumab  administered  every  other  week  via subcutaneous injection) is considered appropriate from a PK point of view).

Figure 3. Study Design Schematic

<!-- image -->

- ** Subjects who failed to demonstrate improvement in ERA could early escape into the OL period.

*** Each subject was planned to receive a maximum of 144 weeks of OL adalimumab. The OL period is to continue until  Week  156  or  until  a  subject  has  completed  108  weeks  of  treatment  (from  Baseline)  or  adalimumab  has received country and local (if applicable) regulatory approval for ERA, whichever occurs first.

For subjects who completed the blinded period, the OL period began at the Week 12 visit. For subjects who met the criteria for early escape, the OL period began at the Week 4 or Week 8 visit (depending on when the criteria were met). During the OL period, each subject received OL adalimumab eow for a maximum of 144 weeks. Each subject in the study was to have a minimum of 108 weeks of treatment (Baseline to Final Visit) and a maximum of 156 weeks of treatment. If at the time of a subject's Week 108 visit  or  any  subsequent  study  visit  prior  to  Week  156,  adalimumab  received  country  and  local regulatory approval for ERA, that visit was the termination visit for that subject.

## Objectives

The  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  adalimumab  given subcutaneously  (SC)  every  other  week  (eow)  as  compared  with  placebo  in  paediatric  subjects  with enthesitis-related  arthritis  (ERA)  and  to  examine  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  immunogenicity  of adalimumab following SC administration in this subject population .

## Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  percent  change  from  Baseline  to  Week  12  in  the  number  of active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints with loss of passive motion [LOM] + pain and/or tenderness)

Ranked secondary efficacy variables analyzed at Week 12 were:

1. Number of sites of enthesitis
2. Tender joint count (TJC) for 72 joints
3. Swollen joint count (SJC) for 68 joints
4. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Pediatric (Pedi)30 response
5. ACR Pedi50 response
6. ACR Pedi70 response

Other supportive efficacy variables that represent the effect of adalimumab on multiple components of active ERA were assessed during the DB and OL periods of the study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Number and percent change in active joints  with  arthritis  (swelling  not  due  to  deformity  or joints with LOM + pain and/or tenderness) (component of ACR Pedi30) (excludes Week 12 as that was the primary variable)
- Number of sites of enthesitis (excluding Week 12)
- Spondyloarthritis Canadian Research Consortium (SPARCC) enthesitis index
- Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score (MASES)
- TJC for 72 joints (excluding Week 12)
- SJC for 68 joints (excluding Week 12)
- Number of joints with LOM (component of ACR Pedi30)
- Number of digits with dactylitis
- ACR Pedi30/50/70 responses (excluding Week 12)
- Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)
- Inflammation (mean of questions 5 and 6 of the BASDAI)
- BASDAI50
- Physician's global assessment of disease activity (PGA) (component of ACR Pedi30)
- Patient's assessment of total back pain
- Parent's assessment of subject's pain
- High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (component of ACR Pedi30)
- Parent's global assessment of subject's overall well-being (component of ACR Pedi30)
- Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) (component of ACR Pedi30)
- Parent's assessment of subject's eye disease
- Parent's assessment of subject's school attendance

## Sample size

Approximately 45 paediatric patients with ERA were planned to be enrolled. With a total sample size of 45  subjects  (2:1  randomization:  adalimumab  30  subjects,  placebo  15  subjects)  and  an  expected percent change of 70% for adalimumab versus 35% for placebo, assuming common standard deviation (SD) of 33%, the study provided 90% power to detect the treatment difference using a 2-sided 1-way ANOVA with type 1 error level alpha = 5%.

## Randomisation

An  IVRS/IWRS  was  used  to  determine  the  randomization  of  subjects.  Eligible  subjects  were randomized in a 2:1 DB fashion to adalimumab or placebo. Randomization was not stratified by site, because of the small expected number of subjects per site, or by any other stratification factor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Blinding (masking)

The investigator, study site personnel, and the subject remained blinded to each subject's treatment throughout the blinded period of the study. The IVRS/IWRS was to provide access to blinded subject treatment information in the case of medical emergency.

## Statistical methods

The  primary  and  secondary  variables  were  to  be  analysed  for  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population, defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. A Per Protocol (PP) Analysis of the primary and secondary variables was added by Amendment 1 to the Statistical Analysis Plan (dated 20 November 2012) in order to evaluate the impact of major protocol violations on the results of the study. The identification of major protocol deviations was done before unblinding.

In  the  efficacy  analyses,  missing  or  incomplete  data  were  handled  using  last  observation  carried forward (LOCF) as the primary method for continuous variables, nonresponder imputation (NRI) as the primary method for dichotomous variables, and as observed cases and LOCF as sensitivity analyses.

The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  percent  change  from  Baseline  to  Week  12  in  the  number  of active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints with LOM + pain and/or tenderness). The  primary  confirmatory  analysis  was  done  using  an  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  model adjusting for the number of active joints at Baseline at alpha level of 0.05. For subjects who did not have an active joint count at Week 12 or who had escaped early to OL treatment, their last available joint count from the DB period was used.

For the comparison of secondary endpoints between the 2 treatment groups, Fisher's exact test was used for discrete variables, and 1-way ANOVA was used for continuous endpoints. Results in the OL period were reported stratified by the treatment the subject was randomized to in the DB period and overall .

## Recruitment

46 subjects were recruited at 16 study sites in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

## Conduct of the study

Five  subjects  were  judged  to  have  had  major  protocol  deviations,  i.e.,  protocol  deviations  with  a potential impact on the primary variable of the study, and were excluded from the PP analysis set:

- One  subject  (adalimumab)  violated  exclusion  criterion 11: If entering  the  study  on concomitant  MTX  or  SSZ  at  Screening/Baseline,  subject  not  on  stable  dose  of  MTX  (≤  15 mg/m 2  with a maximum of 25 mg/week) or SSZ (≤50 mg/kg/day with a maximum of 3 g/day) for 28 days prior to Baseline.  (Subject 17302 was on MTX 20 mg weekly from Day -16 to Day 28, when the dose was decreased to 17.5 mg.)
- One  subject  (adalimumab)  received  prohibited  concomitant  medication  (opioid  analgesic) during the DB period.
- Two  subject  (both  adalimumab)  violated  inclusion  criterion  4:    Inadequate  response  or intolerance to at least 1 NSAID, either SSZ or MTX; subjects who have a contraindication to SSZ or MTX use may be enrolled.
- One subject (placebo) violated inclusion criterion 3:  At least 3 active joints (swelling not due to deformity or joints with LOM plus pain and/or tenderness AND evidence of enthesitis in at least 1 location [either documented in past or present at Baseline]).  (Subject had only 2 active joints at Baseline.)

- a. P value for differences between treatment groups from Fisher's exact test for categorical data and from 1-way ANOVA for continuous data.
- b. Non-white races were combined for analysis of race.

Note: Percents calculated on non-missing values.

The majority of subjects in the ITT analysis set were male and white, with a mean age of 12.9 years. No statistically significant differences were observed between the placebo and adalimumab groups.

## ERA history

Subjects reported having had symptoms of ERA for a mean of 2.6 years and had been diagnosed with ERA for a mean of 1.9 years prior to Baseline (table 6).

a. P value for differences between treatment groups from 1-way ANOVA.

All  subjects  were  RF  negative  at  Baseline  (table  7).  The  majority  of  subjects  had  central  laboratory testing for HLA-B27 and were found to be HLA-B27 positive. Subjects who had prior results for HLAB27 testing were not required to repeat this genetic test; of the 3 subjects who did not have centrally performed HLA-B27 testing, 2 subjects were positive and 1 subject was negative on local testing. Most subjects were ANA negative at Baseline with the majority of those who were positive demonstrating a low-titer. All ANA positive subjects were anti-ds-DNA negative.

Subjects reported having had symptoms of ERA for a mean of 2.6 years and had been diagnosed with ERA for a mean of 1.9 years prior to Baseline. No statistically significant differences were observed between treatment groups.

The majority of subjects reported prior use of a medication for ERA (Table 8). The most frequently reported  ( ≥ 20%  of  all  subjects)  prior  ERA  medications  were  MTX,  naproxen,  SSZ,  diclofenac,  and ibuprofen.

A total of 63.0% of subjects previously used DMARDs for their ERA, 69.6% previously used NSAIDs, and  45.7%  previously  used  corticosteroids,  with  no  statistically  significant  differences  observed between treatment groups (Table 9). Of these subjects, the average number of different medications previously  used  was  approximately  3  including  at  least  1 prior  DMARD  (MTX  or  SSZ),  with  no statistically significant difference observed between treatment groups.

## Numbers analysed

Total number of analysed patients was 46 in the DB phase (15 patients randomized to PLB arm and 31 to ADA arm) whereas it was 43 in the OL phase (discontinuation of 1 patients in the PLB arm and of two patients in the ADA arm).

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary efficacy endpoint

In  the  ITT  analysis  set  (last  observation  carried  forward  [LOCF]),  a  statistically  significantly  larger decrease  in  mean  percent  change  from  Baseline  to  Week  12  in  the  number  of  active  joints  with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints with LOM + pain and/or tenderness) was observed in subjects in the adalimumab group (-62.6) compared with the placebo group (-11.6, P = 0.039)

A sensitivity analysis using the observed case analysis method, which included only those subjects with an active joint count at Week 12 (excludes early escapers), produced larger decreases in mean percent change  from  Baseline  compared  to  the  ITT  (LOCF)  analysis  in  both  treatment  groups  (-32.1  with placebo versus -83.3 with adalimumab). These changes were also statistically significantly different.

Numerically  superior,  but  not  statistically  significant  results  were  demonstrated  for  the  adalimumab group  compared  to  the  placebo  group  using  the  PP  analysis  set  (LOCF),  which  excluded  significant protocol violators. In this  analysis the placebo group response was higher compared to the primary analysis (ITT [LOCF]) (mean percent change from Baseline -30.2 versus -11.6, respectively), but the response  in the adalimumab  group  was  similar  in both analyses (and -66.0  versus -62.6, respectively).

## Ranked secondary efficacy endpoints

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

While  results  for  number  of  sites  of  enthesitis,  TJC,  SJC,  ACR  Pedi50  response,  and  ACR Pedi70 response  were  numerically  superior  in  favor  of  adalimumab,  none  of  the  ranked  secondary  efficacy variables reached statistical significance at Week 12.  Given the small sample size in this study, the positive trends observed support the efficacy of adalimumab in the ERA patient population.

## Other efficacy variables

Other supportive efficacy variables that represent the effect of adalimumab on multiple components of active  ERA  were  assessed  during  the  12-week  DB  period,  as  well  as  additional  OL  data  available through Week 52. While few of these variables achieved statistical significance in favor of adalimumab at Week 12, the majority demonstrated trends in favor of adalimumab with results being sustained or improving further during the OL period.

## Parent's Assessment of Subject's Eye Disease

Parent's  assessment  of  subject's  eye  disease  was  only  done  for  those  subjects  who  reported  eye disease  in  connection  with  their  ERA  at  a  given  visit.  Three  subjects  (all  randomized  to  placebo) reported a past history of uveitis at Baseline and during the study, 2 of these subjects reported eye disease in connection with their ERA; one at Week 2 and both from Week 8 to Week 52. As very few subjects experienced uveitis through Week 52, no conclusions can be made from this data regarding the  effect  of  adalimumab  on  improvement  in  uveitis  symptoms.  However,  at  Week  52  clinically significant improvement in the parent's assessment of subject's eye disease in terms of the subject's ability to function normally as measured on a VAS was observed for these 2 subjects.

## Parent's Assessment of Subject's School Attendance

No statistically significant differences were observed between groups at any timepoint during the DB period for any analysis of parent's assessment of subject's school attendance.

When looking at days lost since Baseline to Week 12, both groups missed the same mean number of days  from  school  (3.4  days).  When  missing  values  were  included  as  0,  results  were  similar.  When missing  values  were  not  included,  subjects  in  the  adalimumab  group  missed  fewer  days  than  did subjects in the placebo group (3.3 versus 5.4, respectively). An average of 5 days missed from school per year is reported in healthy children and a United Kingdom study reported that children with JIA miss approximately 15 days a year from school, which was similar to other chronic diseases such as asthma. During the OL period, subjects with any exposure to adalimumab lost an average of 7.8 days from school (days lost since Baseline visit) by Week 52 which is approximately half of that reported for children with JIA overall. Results were similar without missing values and with missing values set to 0. Data were similar using as observed analysis (ITT).

## Ancillary analyses

## Comparison of results in subpopulations

Subgroup analysis of the primary efficacy variable was done by age, sex, race, HLA-B27 status, hs-CRP status,  concomitant  DMARD  or  NSAID  use  at  Baseline,  and  BMI.  Statistically  significant  differences were observed within subgroups as follows:

- Male subjects in the adalimumab group had a greater percent decrease in the number of active joints with arthritis than males in the placebo group.
- White  subjects  in  the  adalimumab  group  had  a  greater  percent  decrease  in  the  number  of active joints with arthritis than white subjects in the placebo group.
- HLA-B27  positive  subjects  in  the  adalimumab  group  had  a  greater  percent  decrease  in  the number of active joints with arthritis than HLA-B27 positive subjects in the placebo group.  The 3 subjects who did not have centrally performed HLA-B27 were excluded from this analysis.
- Subjects  with  concomitant  NSAID  use  at  Baseline  in  the  adalimumab  group  had  a  greater percent decrease in the number of active joints with arthritis than subjects with concomitant NSAID use at Baseline in the placebo group.
- Subjects in the adalimumab group who had a healthy weight at Baseline had a greater percent decrease than subjects with a healthy weight at Baseline in the placebo group.

Overall, sample sizes were too small to provide definitive conclusions regarding differences in benefit between  subgroup  categories.  However,  the  following  trends  were  noted  when  comparing  mean percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis for subgroups within the adalimumab group:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Subjects who were 6 to &lt; 9 years old (N = 2) had a higher response (mean percent change 84.9) than older subgroups (-58.9 to -63.4, N = 5 - 12 per subgroup).
- A  higher  response  was  observed  with  adalimumab  among  males  (N  =  22,  mean  percent change -70.4) than females (N = 9, mean percent change -43.7).
- Healthy  weight  (N  =  22)  and  overweight  (N  =  2)  subjects  had  a  higher  response  (mean percent change -68.0 and -71.9, respectively) than underweight subjects (N = 2) and obese subjects (N = 5) (mean percent change -31.9 and -47.3, respectively).

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The  MAH provided 1 clinical  study  (M11-328)  to  support  this  application  for  paediatric  ERA.  It  is  a double-blind placebo controlled study, including patients 6-17 years old with ERA and at least 3 active joints, and with an inadequate response to NSAID and MTX/SSZ. After randomisation 2:1 the subjects were  followed  for  12  weeks,  thereafter  all  subjects  received  OL  adalimumab.  There  was  an  early

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

escape option at week 4 if worsening of disease, and at week 8 if failure to improve. There were in total 3 early escapes in the placebo group and 4 early escapes in the adalimumab group.

The study design was acceptable to the CHMP. It is noted that the chosen primary endpoint is not consistent with the recommendation in the current JIA guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, namely JRA 30 (very similar to PEDI30). ACR PEDI 30 response was a secondary endpoint in this study. During the procedure, the MAH clarified that the percent change in the number of active joints with arthritis was chosen as the primary measure to assess efficacy in Study M11-328 due to the fairly limited paediatric ERA population, and allowed for appropriate powering of the study for the primary endpoint. More than twice the sample size would have  been  required  if  the  study  was  powered  for  ACR  Pedi30  as  the  primary  endpoint.  The  CHMP agreed that the choice of this primary endpoint is understandable due to the fairly limited pediatric ERA population.

Five subjects (4 in the adalimumab group) turned out to be protocol violations. Two of these did not fulfill  inclusion  criterion  4,  inadequate  response  to  NSAID  and  MTX/SSZ.  The  MAH  clarified  that  all included  subjects  had  prior  NSAID  use,  and  that  2  of  the  4  subjects  without  prior  DMARD  use  had contraindications for this.  This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

The adalimumab treated group is older, 24 subjects out of 31 were 12-18 years, as compared to 7 subjects out of 15 in the placebo group. The MAH sufficiently addressed the raised concern of scarce representation  of  patients  aged  6  to  &lt;9  years  reporting  a  literature  review  by  conducting  a retrospective analysis using UK CPRD. Although data on ERA patients were extracted by JIA studied population and numbers were limited using specific terms, overall results support a lower distribution of incidence of ERA patients in age categories 6 to 11 years.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The primary endpoint was the percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with mean percent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the Humira group compared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo group. Improvement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period through Week 52 of the study. Although not statistically significant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), Paediatric ACR 50 response, and Paediatric ACR 70 response.

In the primary ITT analysis, a clinically relevant statistically significant difference was demonstrated, but when 1 subject was excluded from the placebo group, the results for this group improved from -11 to -30.2%, and the difference between the treated and untreated group diminished from 51 to 36%, which  is  not  statistically  significant.  However,  due  to  the  limited  number  of  patients  the  sensitivity analyses  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Exclusion  of  very  few  or  single  patients  might  have  a conspicuous impact on magnitude of effect and statistical significance, and the interpretation should base on the overall pattern rather than individual analyses. With this in mind there is no reason to question  the  consistency  between  primary  and  sensitivity  results  because  of  the  differences  in magnitude of effect as well as in p-values.

Although the primary end point was met, there was no difference in response at all between groups in the dichotomous secondary endpoint ACR PEDI 30%, which is the recommended primary endpoint in the draft guideline for clinical investigations of JIA. This seems to be caused by an unexpectedly good response in the placebo group, 66.7% versus 67.7% in the adalimumab group. This may be considered problematic,  but  on  the  other  hand,  the  PEDI70  result  appeared  consistent  with  primary  endpoint

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

results,  51%  and  26.7% responders in the adalimumab and placebo groups, respectively. The MAH clarified that the greatest difference towards placebo was seen in number of joints with loss of motion, function (CHAQ), and number of arthritis. Although not reaching statistical significance, a substantial number  of  subjects  achieved  at  least  30%  improvement  in  these  parameters.  More  subjective parameters, such as parent´s and physician´s global assessments, showed less degree of improvement.  The  CHMP  also  acknowledged  that  the  higher  difference  between  the  treated  and placebo group observed for ACR Pedi50 and 70, which is due to lower response in the placebo groups, points towards a true treatment effect with adalimumab compared to placebo.

For  the  other  supportive  efficacy  variables,  all  supportive  efficacy  variables  showed  numerical improvement in the adalimumab group, however, none reached statistical significance.

During the procedure, the MAH clarified that the e fficacy of adalimumab for the clinical features, such as arthritis and enthesitis, observed in ERA has been demonstrated in studies of polyarticular JIA in children  and  in  axial  spondyloarthritis  (SpA)  (ankylosing  spondylitis  [AS]  and  non-radiographic  axial SpA [nr-axSpA]), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and non-PsA peripheral SpA in adults. Studies in all of these indications have demonstrated either statistically significant improvements, or trends for improvement, in favor of adalimumab therapy for clinical signs and symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (i.e., swollen and tender joints), enthesitis, physician assessment of disease activity,  health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and laboratory evidence of inflammation.

PK data in the paediatric ERA population were comparable to that observed in paediatric subjects with polyarticular JIA and in adults with AS. Mean serum adalimumab trough concentrations at steady state for  paediatric  subjects  (age  ≥6  to  &lt;18  years)  with  ERA  in  Study  M11-328  were  7.5  -  11.8  μg/mL between Weeks 12 to 24 following doses of 24 mg/m 2  (up to 40 mg) eow. Subjects with polyarticular JIA  had  similar  mean  steady-state  serum  adalimumab  trough  concentrations  of  4.5  -  10.5  μg/mL [Study DE038; age ≥ 4 to &lt; 18 years old; following doses of 24 mg/m 2  (up to 40 mg) eow] and 6.1 8.5 μg/mL [Study M10-444; age ≥ 2 to &lt; 4 years old; following doses of 24 mg/m 2   (up to 20 mg) eow]. Additionally, adult subjects with AS in Study M03-607 had mean trough concentrations of 6.4 8.6 μg/mL between Weeks 12 and 24 following administration of adalimumab 40 mg eow.

Mean serum adalimumab trough concentrations were slightly higher in Study M11-328 for subjects on adalimumab in combination with MTX (9.7 - 11.8 μg/mL, n = 16) compared to adalimumab without MTX  (7.5  -  9.4  μg/mL,  n  =  15).  This  was  consistent  with  previous  adalimumab  studies,  including polyarticular  JIA  and  adult  AS.  Additionally,  the  rate  of  anti-adalimumab  antibody  positive  (AAA+) subjects was similar across paediatric ERA, polyarticular JIA, and adult AS indications.

In order to demonstrate a consistent relationship between serum adalimumab trough concentrations and clinical response in paediatric subjects with JIA, an exposure-response analysis was conducted by the MAH to compare the percent change from Baseline in the number of active joints with arthritis, to that  in  Study  DE038  (paediatric  subjects  with  polyarticular  JIA).  For  each  study,  all  subjects  with available data for adalimumab trough concentrations and efficacy were included in the analysis. The time point selected for comparison was the end of the placebo-controlled, DB period in Study M11-328 (Week 12), and the end of the open-label lead-in (OL-LI) phase in Study DE038 (Week 16, with PK sampling at either Week 12 or Week 16). The results showed that improvement in percent change from  Baseline  in  the  number  of  active  joints  with  arthritis  was  similar  in  paediatric  ERA  and polyarticular JIA subjects categorized into comparable trough concentration categories.

The CHMP was also of the opinion that the baseline disease activity characteristics highlight that the enrolled subjects had moderately active disease and that the sought indication should include the word \"active\". The MAH therefore agreed to update the indication as follows: 'Humira is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see section 5.1)'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The applicant has demonstrated a clinically relevant effect on the percent change of active joints in patients  with  ERA.  In  the  primary  ITT  analysis,  a  statistically  significant  effect  difference  between treated  and  untreated  patients  was  demonstrated  (-62.6  vs  11.6  %,  p=0.039).  PK  data  in  children with ERA was similar to children with polyarticular juvenile arthritis (approved indication).

The paediatric disease enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) has many similarities to ankylosing spondylitis (AS), afflicting the adult population. In fact, one of the classification criteria is history of this disease in adult first degree relatives. Humira has demonstrated effect in AS and has been used in this indication since 2006. An important feature of both AS and ERA is enthesitis, and it is noted that adalimumab showed  effect  on  enthesitis  and  MASES  enthesitis  index  toward  12  weeks  in  studies  on  these indications.

Extrapolation  from  approved  indications  was  discussed  and  the  MAH  pointed  to  the  similar  clinical features  and  common  manifestations  of  other  indications  such  as AS,  non-radiographic  axial Spondyloarthritis and Psoriatic arthritis, of which AS is the most important, where adalimumab has a well-documented effect.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## 2.5.1. Introduction

The mechanism of action of TNF antagonists, including adalimumab, is inhibition of an immunologically active cytokine, episodes of infections, malignancies, central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease, immunologic reactions and lupus-like illness were specifically evaluated as AEs of special interest. Congestive heart failure (CHF) has also been an event specifically examined in studies with TNF antagonists and was also evaluated as an AE of special interest.

## Patient exposure

In  the  study  M11-328  interim  CSR  (R&amp;D/12/735)  a  total  of  46  paediatric  subjects  with  ERA  were randomized and all subjects received ≥1 dose of study drug. Of the 46 patients treated with study drug, 7 subjects early escaped during the DB period and continued in the OL period (3 subjects from the placebo treatment arm and 4 subjects from the adalimumab treatment arm). In total 3 subjects early escaped at week 4, 4 subjects early escaped at week 8, and 39 subjects completed the DB period through week12. 43 subjects completed week 52 of the OL period, and 3 subjects discontinued from the study prior to week 52, all the OL period.

## Adverse events

## Study period Double blind period

The overview of TEAEs during the DB period and at any time after the first injection of adalimumab is presented in Table 33.

No deaths or fatal AEs occurred through Week 52 of the study. During the DB period, most subjects (63.0%)  reported  ≥  1  TEAE;  of  these,  a  greater  percentage  of  subjects  who  received  adalimumab reported  at  least  1  AE  (67.7%)  compared  with  subjects  who  received  placebo  (53.3%).  The proportions of subjects who reported at least 1 AE that was considered related to study drug by the Investigator were similar.

During the DB period, 1 subject in the adalimumab treatment group reported 2 SAEs (abdominal pain upper and headache) which were considered possibly related to study drug by the Investigator. Among

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  adalimumab  at  any  time  during  the  study,  the  majority (93.5%) experienced at least 1 AE and 47.8% reported an AE that was considered by the Investigator to be at least possibly related to study drug from the first dose of adalimumab onwards.

During  the  DB  period,  a  greater  percentage  of  subjects  who  received  adalimumab  (21/31,  67.7%) reported  at  least  1  AE  compared  with  subjects  who  received  placebo  (8/15,  53.3%).  The  most frequently reported AEs (reported by ≥2 subjects in any treatment group) included upper respiratory tract  infection,  headache,  gastroenteritis,  injection  site  pain,  nausea,  ALT  increased,  abdominal  pain upper, and syncope.

Nine subjects in the adalimumab treatment group reported possibly or probably related AEs compared to 4 subjects in the placebo group.

All AEs were considered mild or moderate in severity by the Investigator and most subjects (n = 16) reported AEs that  were considered by the  Investigator to be not related or probably not related to study drug.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Entire study including open label period

Among subjects who received at least 1 dose of adalimumab at any time during the study including the open label period, the majority experienced at least 1 AE (43/46, 93.5%).

Of  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  (reported  by  ≥  3  subjects),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, and pharyngitis were reported in &gt; 10% of subjects.

Three subjects who had received only adalimumab throughout the study reported at least 1 severe AE (blood pressure increased and weight increased [in the same subject] and juvenile arthritis [worsening of  ERA,  2  subjects]).  Twenty-two  subjects  reported  AEs  that  were  considered  possibly  or  probably related to study drug by the Investigator.

Three subjects prematurely discontinued due to AEs, all during the OL period (Ps; juvenile arthritis [worsening of ERA] and pain; and injection site pain and injection site pruritus).

## Other Adverse events reported in the study:

- Infections: During the DB period, a greater proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group reported at  least  1  treatment-emergent  infection  (9/31,  29.0%)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (3/15, 20.0%).

Infections  reported  in  2  or  more  subjects  included  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  gastroenteritis, cystitis,  and paronychia. All other infections during the DB period were reported by no more than 1 subject  each.  Among  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  adalimumab  at  any  time  during  the study,  37  out  of  46  subjects  (80.4%)  reported  at  least  1  treatment-emergent  infection.  The  most frequently reported infections were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, and pharyngitis with all other infections being reported by no more than 3 subjects each. All infections were considered by the Investigator to be mild or moderate in severity and all were nonserious events with the exception of 1 subject (appendicitis requiring hospitalization, OL period). Among subjects who received at least1 dose of adalimumab at any time during the study, 23 infections were considered by the Investigator to be possibly (20 events) or probably related (3 events) to study drug. One subject reported a parasitic infection (acarodermatitis, placebo group, DB  period) considered by the Investigator to be not related to study drug.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Vasculitis: One subject experienced a non-serious event of treatment-emergent cutaneous vasculitis (OL period), which was considered possibly related to study drug by the Investigator.

- Worsening or new onset psoriasis (Ps): One subject experienced a non-serious event of new onset Ps (OL period), which was considered possibly related to study drug by the Investigator.

- Liver event: One subject experienced a non-serious liver event (hepatocoellular injury, adalimumab group, DB period). The event was considered not related to study drug by the Investigator.

-  Injection  site  reaction:  During  the  DB  period,  3  subjects  in  the  adalimumab  group  reported  an injection site reaction compared to 1 subject in the placebo group. Among subjects who received at least 1 dose of adalimumab, 5 subjects (10.9%) reported an injection site reaction. All injection site reactions  were  considered  by  the  Investigator  as  mild  in  severity  and  all  were  probably  or  possibly related to study drug with the exception of 1 event.

While 3 subjects had CTCAE toxicity grade ≥3 hematology or clinical chemistry value during the study, all resolved by Week 52 and were considered not clinically meaningful. Mean changes from Baseline to final vital signs values were overall small and not clinically significant and shifts from normal to high or low final vital signs values were infrequent and not clinically meaningful.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

No deaths were reported during the study

Five subjects reported a total of 8 SAEs.

Two subjects had events that were considered by the Investigator to be possibly related to study drug (abdominal pain upper and headache in 1 subject in the DB period and appendicitis in 1 subject in the OL period). The subject who experienced abdominal pain upper and headache in the DB period also experienced juvenile arthritis (worsening of ERA) and pain (OL period), both of which were considered not related by the Investigator.

The remaining 3 subjects had events that were considered probably not or not related to study drug by the  Investigator  (musculoskeletal  chest  pain  and  concussion  [OL  period]  and  juvenile  arthritis [worsening of ERA; posttreatment from OL period]).

One  SAE  was  considered  severe  by  the  Investigator  (juvenile  arthritis  [worsening  of  ERA];  post treatment from OL period); all other SAEs were considered mild or moderate in severity.

One  subject,  a  13-year-old  white  male  who  was  randomized  to  the  adalimumab  group,  was hospitalized due to abdominal pain upper and headache on Day 67 (DB period), both intermittent but lasting  20  days.  Both  events  were  considered  mild  and  possibly  related  to  study  drug  by  the Investigator. The Investigator reported \"psychosomatic, gastroenteritis\" as an alternative cause of the events.  On Day 220 (Day 138 of the OL period), the subject reported juvenile arthritis (worsening of ERA) and pain, requiring hospitalization. Both events were considered moderate in intensity and not related to study drug by the Investigator. Both events were ongoing as of Day 317. The Investigator reported  \"natural  progression  of  disease\"  as  an  alternative  cause  of  the  events.  The  subject prematurely discontinued from the study as a result of the juvenile arthritis (worsening of ERA) and pain.

One subject, a 13-year-old white male who was randomized to the adalimumab group, experienced appendicitis  on  Day  242  (Day  158  of  the  OL  period).  He  was  hospitalized  and  underwent  an appendectomy.  The  event  lasted  10  days,  and  was  considered  by  the  Investigator  as  moderate  in severity and to be possibly related to study drug. The Investigator reported \"possibly related infection, histology  floride  ulcerous-phlegmonous  appendicitis  and  periappendicitis,  purulent  serositis\"  as  an alternative cause of the event.

One subject, a 14-year-old white female randomized to the placebo group who early escaped to OL adalimumab at Week 8, was hospitalized due to musculoskeletal chest pain on Day 77 (Day 23 of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

OL period). The event lasted 15 days, was considered by the Investigator as moderate in severity and probably not related to study drug. The Investigator reported \"probable enthesitis\" as an alternative cause of the event

One subject, a 13-year-old white female randomized to the placebo group, sustained a concussion on Day 309 (Day 250 of the OL period) and was hospitalized. The event lasted 4 days, was considered by the  Investigator  as  moderate  in  severity  and  not  related  to  study  drug.  The  Investigator  reported \"accident\" as an alternative cause of the event.

One subject, a 15-year-old white female randomized to the adalimumab group, was hospitalized for juvenile arthritis (worsening of ERA) on Day 299 (32 days post-treatment). The event was intermittent over  8  days  and  was  considered  by  the  Investigator  as  severe  and  not  related  to  study  drug.  The Investigator reported \"worsening of ERA\" as an alternative cause of the event.

## Laboratory findings

For subjects who received at least 1 dose of adalimumab at any time during the study, the majority of haematology and chemistry parameters demonstrated infrequent shifts from Baseline to the Week 52 visit.

Shifts in haematocrit (normal to high in 9 subjects) and platelets (high to normal in 12 subjects) most likely represent normalization of systemic inflammation in study subjects.

Shifts  from  abnormal  normal  in  8  subjects)  and  BUN  (high  to  normal  in  9  subjects)  and  shifts  in albumin from normal to high in 9 subjects and from high to normal in 7 subjects were not clinically meaningful.

Review  of  the  specific  laboratory  values  for  these  parameters  revealed  all  values  were  Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade &lt;3 throughout the study without clinically significant abnormalities.

Three  subjects  had  at  least  1  clinically  significant  (CTC  for  AEs  [CTCAE]  toxicity  grade  ≥3) haematology  or  clinical  chemistry  value  (white  blood  cell  count  [WBC],  lymphocyte,  ALT  and triglyceride values in adalimumab subjects, and neutrophil counts in a placebo subject). All of these abnormalities returned to grade &lt;3 while continuing treatment with study drug.

Ten subjects had at least 1 potentially clinically significant liver function test (LFT) value. One of these subjects (in the adalimumab group) experienced an elevation in ALT &gt;5 × ULN (upper limit of normal), which  returned  to  &lt;3  ×  ULN  at  the  next  visit.  All  other  subjects  had  mildly  elevated  LFT  values (generally maximum values ≤ 3 × ULN) that were mostly transient.

Mean changes from Baseline to final vital sign values were overall small and not statistically significant between treatment groups.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Three subjects prematurely discontinued due to AEs, all during the OL period (Ps; juvenile arthritis [worsening of ERA] and pain; and injection site pain and injection site pruritus). The events reported were consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab.

## Post marketing experience

Humira is approved since 2003 and is currently approved in the EU for active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The safety profile in children is well characterised and the main adverse events in children are infections.

A total of 42,630 patients have been treated with adalimumab in AbbVie sponsored clinical studies and registries with an estimated subject exposure of 43,225.9 patient years (PYs AE rates across approved indications for events of special interest to those that were reported in Study M11-328 are compared in Table 33.

## 2.5.2. Discussion on clinical safety

All subjects received at least 143 days of ADA treatment, with a maximum exposure to ADA of 385 days.

The most common AEs are those frequently observed with ADA treatment, the majority (86.9%) of reported AEs were mild-moderate in severity and only a minority was severe (6.5%).

The AEs by SOC most commonly reported according to severity grade and clinical interest are: gastrointestinal disorders (mild 28.3%, moderate 2.2%); general disorders and administration site conditions (mild 28.3, moderate 4.3%); infections and infestations (mild 58.7, moderate 21.7%); nervous system disorders (mild 23.9; moderate 4.3%); investigations (mild 13.0, severe 2.2).

In particular, infections and infestations were reported in 80.4% of patients with the most common being gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection. All infections during DB as well as OL phases were moderate or mild in severity, with the exception of 1 serious event of appendicitis requiring hospitalization during the OL phase.

There are no deaths reported during the study. 2/5 subjects reported in all 3 SAEs, possibly related to study drug. In one case two SAE (abdominal pain upper and headache) as possibly related to study drug, and in another case report appendicitis was regarded as possibly related to study drug.

Changes in laboratory findings were not clinically significant and overall reflect ADA safety profile.

Few patients prematurely discontinued study drugs, the majority complete the treatment period.

A total of 42,630 patients have been treated with adalimumab in the MAH's sponsored clinical studies and registries with an estimated subject exposure of 43,225.9 patient years (PYs). Safety data for Study M11-328 were comparable to already approved indications and no new safety signals were identified in the paediatric ERA population with the rate of overall adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and severe AEs similar to rates observed in clinical trials for other indications. The rate of overall infections was higher in the paediatric ERA population compared to other indications with the most frequently reported infections those commonly observed in the general population including upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, and pharyngitis. In addition, the rate of serious infections is within the range observed in approved indications. There were no deaths or AEs of malignancy, opportunistic infection, tuberculosis (TB), lupus-like syndrome, hematological disorders (including pancytopenia), or demyelinating disease reported through Week 52.

In controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 6.1% of Humira-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. Most ALT elevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of Humira in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to &lt;4 years.

Long -term data for the adalimumab-treated ERA population will be available through the OL extension of Study M11-328 (as described in the RMP).

## 2.5.3. Conclusions on clinical safety

Adalimumab was generally well tolerated during the study M11-328. The most reported common AEs were upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, and pharyngitis.

The safety profile observed was consistent with previous clinical trials for adalimumab.

During the procedure, the MAH has provided data supporting safety of adalimumab in other related indications, such as Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), non-radiographic axial Spondyloarthritis and Psoriatic arthritis. This approach is considered acceptable, since it is acknowledged that there are significant clinical similarities between these diseases and ERA. In fact, one of the classification criteria is history of AS in adult first degree relatives.

Long -term data for the adalimumab-treated ERA population will be available through the OL extension of Study M11-328 (as described in the RMP).

## 2.5.4. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

## 2.6.1. PRAC advice

The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan.

## PRAC Advice

Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 10.3, the PRAC considers by consensus that the risk management system for adalimumab (Humira) in the treatment of enthesitisrelated arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy is acceptable.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated ( addition, deletion). The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

Section 4.1 Therapeutic indications

[…]

## Juvenile idiopathic arthritis

Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis

Humira in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, in children and adolescents patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Humira can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. (for the efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1). Humira has not been studied in children patients aged less than 2 years.

## Enthesitis-related arthritis

Humira is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see section 5.1).

Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Enthesitis-related arthritis

The recommended dose of Humira for patients with enthesitis-related arthritis 6 years of age and older is 24 mg/m² body surface area up to a maximum single dose of 40 mg adalimumab administered every other week via subcutaneous injection. The volume for injection is selected based on the patients' height and weight (Table 1). Humira has not been studied in patients with enthesitis-related arthritis aged less than 6 years.

## Section 4.8 Undesirable effects

Humira was studied in 8,152 8,198 patients in pivotal controlled and open label trials for up to 60 months or more. These trials included rheumatoid arthritis patients with short term and long standing disease, polyarticular   juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis) as well as axial spondyloarthritis ( ankylosing spondylitis and , axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative

colitis and psoriasis patients. The data in Table 2 is based on tThe pivotal controlled studies involv ed ing 5,312 343 patients receiving Humira and 3,133 3,148 patients receiving placebo or active comparator during the controlled period and spontaneous reporting.

The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events during the doubleblind, controlled portion of pivotal studies was 6.1% for patients taking Humira and 5.8 5.7 % for control treated patients.

## Malignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders

No malignancies were observed in 203 249 paediatric patients   aged 2 to 17 years with an exposure of 605.3 655.6 patient years during Humira trials in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related arthritis ) patients. In addition, no malignancies were observed in 192 paediatric patients with an exposure of 258.9 patient years during a Humira trial in paediatric patients with Crohn's disease.

## Hepato-biliary events

In controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.7% of Humira-treated patients and 1.6% of control-treated patients.

In controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with  plaque Psoriasis with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of Humira-treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients.

In the JIA trial the few transaminase elevations were small and similar in the placebo and adalimumab exposed patients, and mostly occurred in combination with methotrexate.

In controlled Phase 3 trials of Humira in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 4 to 17 years and enthesitis-related arthritis who were 6 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 6.1% of Humira-treated patients and 1.3% of control-treated patients. Most ALT elevations occurred with concomitant methotrexate use. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the Phase 3 trial of Humira in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 2 to &lt;4 years.

## Section 5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties

## Enthesitis-related arthritis

The safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in a multicenter, randomised, double-blind study in 46 paediatric patients (6 to 17 years old) with moderate enthesitis-related arthritis. Patients were randomised to receive either 24 mg/m 2  body surface area (BSA) of Humira up to a maximum of 40 mg, or placebo every other week for 12 weeks. The doubleblind period is followed by an open-label (OL) period during which patients received 24 mg/m 2  BSA of Humira up to a maximum of 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 192 weeks. The primary endpoint was the percent change from Baseline to Week 12 in the number of active joints with arthritis (swelling not due to deformity or joints with loss of motion plus pain and/or tenderness), which was achieved with mean percent decrease of -62.6% (median percent change -88.9%) in patients in the Humira group compared to -11.6% (median percent change -50.0%) in patients in the placebo group. Improvement in number of active joints with arthritis was maintained during the OL period through Week 52 of the study. Although not statistically significant, the majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement in secondary endpoints such as number of sites of enthesitis, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), Pediatric ACR 50 response, and Pediatric ACR 70 response.

## Immunogenicity

Formation of anti-adalimumab antibodies is associated with increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab. There is no apparent correlation between the presence of anti-adalimumab antibodies and the occurrence of adverse events.

Patients in rheumatoid arthritis studies RA Studies I, II and III were tested at multiple time points for anti-adalimumab antibodies during the 6 to 12 month period. In the pivotal trials, anti-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adalimumab antibodies were identified in 5.5% ( 58/1053 ) of (5.5%) patients treated with adalimumab, compared to 0.5% ( 2/370 ) (0.5%)   on placebo.  In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 12.4%, compared to 0.6% when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate.

In patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis who were 4 to 17 years , anti, adalimumab antibodies were identified in 15.8% ( 27/171 ) of patients subjects (15.8%)   treated with adalimumab. In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 25.6% ( 22/86 ) (25.6%), compared to 5.9% ( 5/85)   (5.9%)   when adalimumab was used as add-on to methotrexate.

In patients with enthesitis-related arthritis, anti-adalimumab antibodies were identified in 10.9% (5/46) of patients treated with adalimumab. In patients not given concomitant methotrexate, the incidence was 13.6% (3/22), compared to 8.3% (2/24) when adalimumab was used as addon to methotrexate.

Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

In patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to &lt;4 years old or aged 4 and above weighing &lt;15 kg dosed with Humira adalimumab 24 mg/m 2 , the mean trough steady-state serum adalimumab concentrations was 6.0 ± 6.1 µg/ml (101% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate Humira monotherapy and 7.9 ± 5.6 µg/ml (71.2% CV) with concomitant methotrexate.

Following the administration of 24 mg/m 2   (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) who were 4 to 17 years the mean trough steady-state (values measured from Week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was 5.6 ± 5.6 µg/mL (102% CV) for adalimumab without concomitant methotrexate Humira monotherapy and10.9 ± 5.2 µg/mL (47.7% CV) with concomitant methotrexate .

The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

Editorial changes have also been made to section 4.1, 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC.

No user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet (PL) has been performed. As the changes proposed in this variation are deemed not to be substantial, further readability testing is not considered to be required.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The applicant has demonstrated a clinically relevant effect on the percent change of active joints in patients  with  ERA.  In  the  primary  ITT  analysis,  a  statistically  significant  effect  difference  between treated  and  untreated  patients  was  demonstrated  (-62.6  vs  11.6  %,  p=0.039).  PK  data  in  children with ERA was similar to children with polyarticular juvenile arthritis (approved indication).

The paediatric disease enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) has many similarities to ankylosing spondylitis (AS), afflicting the adult population. In fact, one of the classification criteria is history of this disease in adult first degree relatives. Humira has demonstrated effect in AS and has been used in this indication since 2006. Extrapolation from approved indications was discussed and the MAH pointed to the similar clinical  features  and  common  manifestations  of  other  indications  such  as  AS,  non-radiographic  axial

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Spondyloarthritis and Psoriatic arthritis, of which AS is the most important, where adalimumab has a well-documented effect.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The key secondary endpoints did not reach statistical significance, however the CHMP noted that in most cases the adalimumab group showed a slight improvement in response of variable size.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Adalimumab was generally well tolerated during the study M11-328. The most reported common AEs were upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis, and pharyngitis.

The safety profile observed was consistent with previous clinical trials for adalimumab.

The  MAH  has  provided  data  supporting  safety  of  adalimumab  in  other  related  indications,  such  as Ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS),  non-radiographic  axial  Spondyloarthritis  and  Psoriatic  arthritis.  This approach  is  considered  acceptable,  since  it  is  acknowledged  that  there  are  significant  clinical similarities between these diseases and ERA.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

No  new  safety  concerns  were  observed  in  the  pivotal  study.  Long  term  safety  data  for  the adalimumab-treated ERA population is limited, but will become available through the OL extension of Study M11-328 (as described in the RMP).

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The  current  therapeutic  arsenal  for  the  targeted  population  is  limited,  among  TNF-blockers  only etanercept is approved for this condition in children aged 12 years and older. The importance of having access  to  adalimumab  for  the  treatment  of  children  with  ERA  is  acknowledged.  No  signals  have emerged that would raise suspicion of particular risks in the ERA population. It is recognized that data is limited due to the low number of subjects, but the safety profile of Humira is well characterized both in the adult and the paediatric population. Humira is approved for the use in children aged 2 years and older and the CHMP concluded that the ERA and the pJIA populations are comparable from a safety perspective.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

In one pivotal study a clinically relevant effect, difference in terms of per cent change in the number of active joints has been demonstrated. Although secondary endpoints were not met slight differences in response favouring Adalimumab over placebo were observed at week 12.  Moreover, the difference between  Adalimumab  and  placebo  group  in  terms  of  PEDI  70  at  week  12  consistently  support  the clinical  relevant effect of the primary endpoint. Importantly, the efficacy is further supported by the fact  that  Humira  has  a  well-documented  effect  in  AS,  which  can  be  regarded  as  the  corresponding disease in adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No  signals  have  emerged  that  would  raise  suspicion  of  particular  risks  in  the  ERA  population.  It  is recognized that data is limited due to the low number of subjects, but the safety profile of Humira is well characterized both in the adult and the paediatric population and long term safety data for the adalimumab-treated ERA population will become available through the OL extension of Study M11-328 (as described in the RMP).

In  summary,  a  clinically  relevant  effect  of  Adalimumab  has  been  demonstrated  for  the  primary endpoint  in  the  dedicated  ERA  pivotal  study  which  is  further  supported  by  the  corresponding  well documented effect in AS. No safety issues have emerged, and the safety profile of Humira in paediatric use  is  well  characterized  through  trials,  registry  data  and  post  marketing  experience  from  the  pJIA indication.

The benefit-risk balance of adalimumab for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy, is considered positive.

## 4. Recommendations

The application for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and older is approvable since other concerns and major objections have all been resolved.

## Final  Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   |                                                                             | Type   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| C.1.6 a)             | Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | II     |

Extension of Indication to include the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The package leaflet is updated in accordance.
