1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

This Phase III trial is a multicenter, randomized, double- blind, double-dummy, active-controlled study of maribavir compared to valganciclovir for the treatment of asymptomatic Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in HSCT recipients. This study was conducted in post-HSCT recipients with a first episode of asymptomatic post- transplant CMV infection. Overall, the CHMP agrees that the results have no impact on the approved indication, as well as on the SmPC. However, it is requested by the Committee that TEAEs such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia in maribavir-treated patients should be closely monitored during the post-marketing period and that these cases, including the assessment of causality, should be discussed in the upcoming PSURs. The same applies to further evaluate if there could be a correlation between fluctuations in immunosuppressant drug levels and increased |

Finally, the CHMP also required that cases of renal impairment after treatment with maribavir as well as cases with immunosuppressant drug level increased and acute GVHD should be continued to be closely monitored and to be discussed in the upcoming PSURs. The RMP version 2.0 was considered acceptable by the CHMP.   |
