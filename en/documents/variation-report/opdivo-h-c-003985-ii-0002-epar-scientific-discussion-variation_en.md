## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma EEIG submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 6 July 2015 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected     |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, II, IIIA and IIIB |

Extension of Indication to include treatment as monotherapy of locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC after prior chemotherapy in adults based on study CA209057. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Further, SmPC section 4.8 has been revised with updated combined clinical trial exposure numbers to reflect inclusion of studies in non-squamous NSCLC and advanced melanoma. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to align the annexes with the latest QRD template version 9.1 and to implement minor editorial changes. A revised RMP version 3.0 was provided as part of the application.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decisions P/0064/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0064/2014 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

In the EU, the clinical development program in NSCLC was the subject of 2 Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Scientific Advices with final advice letters received in January 2012 and July 2012, respectively. The questions were focused on the design of the 2 Phase 3 clinical studies (studies CA209017

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in SQ NSCLC, and CA209057 in NSQ NSCLC), with regard to target population, comparator and endpoints. The outcome of the advice will be further discussed in the context of the results of these 2 studies.

## 1.2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product

The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CHMP and the evaluation teams were:

Rapporteur:

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Opdivo (nivolumab) is a highly specific programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor. The PD-1 receptor is a key regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown to control tumour-specific inhibition of T-cell responses to tumours. Engagement of the PD-1 co-inhibitory receptor on activated T cells through programmed death ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) results in inhibition of T-cell proliferation, survival and cytokine secretion.

Opdivo is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody (HuMAb) that potentiates in vitro T-cell responses through dual ligand blockade of PD-L1 and PD-L2, and does not mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 by malignant cells or other cells, including immune cells, allows multiple tumour types to evade immune-mediated destruction. Nivolumab potentiates T cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands.

## Problem statement

Lung cancer has been among the most common cancers in the world for several decades. The 2012 worldwide estimates of cancer incidence and mortality by GLOBOCAN, indicate a total of 1.8 million new lung cancer cases and 1.6 million lung cancer related deaths, accounting for 13.0% of all cancer cases (except non-melanoma skin cancers) and 19.4% of all cancer deaths (except non-melanoma skin cancers). Furthermore, lung cancer incidence rates were two-fold higher in males compared to females (1,241,601 and 583,100, respectively). In 2013, the estimated number of lung cancer related deaths is 159,480 in the United States (Siegel et al 2013) and 269,610 in the European Union (Malvezzi et al 2013).

The two most prevalent sub-types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, which is frequently further subdivided into non-squamous carcinoma (including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other cell types) accounts for approximately 75% to 85% of all NSCLC and squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma accounting for approximately 15% to 25% of all NSCLC (~230,000 to 380,000 cases) 12 .

Tobacco use is the most important risk factor for lung cancer, with up to 80% of lung cancer patients reporting a history of tobacco use. Approximately 10% to 30% of NSQ NSCLC occurs in patients with a never smoker history and show a correlation with the presence of an activating EGFR mutation or other genetic alteration 3 .

In addition to the high mortality associated with NSCLC, a high proportion of patients experience severe morbidity as a result of local and metastatic spread of disease.

In treatment-naive NSCLC patients, platinum-based chemotherapy continues to be the standard of care. Overall, the prognosis for previously treated NSCLC after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy is poor for all histological subtypes, including NSQ NSCLC, and treatment options are limited. In this setting, docetaxel has been a standard treatment for the last 15 years. However, only a small fraction of patients benefit from docetaxel, with historical response rates of 3.3% - 15.5%, median OS of 6 to 10 months and 1-year OS rates of approximately 30 to 40%. Overall, this group of patients only has an overall survival (OS) of about 8 months after progression from platinum agents. Patients with tumours that have mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are candidates for target-therapy agents. However, once resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) occurs, the patients who have EGFR mutations or ALK translocations will have a rapid disease progression.

Therefore, NSQ NSCLC remains a disease with high burden and unmet medical need, and new agents that have meaningful clinical efficacy in this subtype are required.

The proposed and recommended indication is as follows: Opdivo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior chemotherapy in adults.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Nivolumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the 'Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use' (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), nivolumab is exempt from preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment.

## 2.2.2. Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

No new clinical pharmacology studies are included in this submission.

An update to the nivolumab PPK and E-R analyses was performed to enable an assessment of the potential effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on nivolumab PK and to assess exposure-response in the SQ and NSQ NSCLC population from the CA209017 and CA209057 studies.

Additionally, an integrated immunogenicity analysis across the solid tumour patient population was performed to assess the effect of immunogenicity on the safety and efficacy of nivolumab.

Dose and schedule of nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks), is the same as already approved for nivolumab monotherapy in adults with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC or advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma.

## Methods

The population pharmacokinetic analysis dataset included subjects from the following 9 studies, for whom nivolumab serum concentration data were available (N=1,314): three Phase 1 studies (MDX1106-01, ONO-4538-01, and MDX1106-03), three Phase 2 studies (CA209010, ONO-4538-02, and CA209063), and three Phase 3 studies (CA209037, CA209017, and CA209057). These studies were selected based on their inclusion in a previous nivolumab PPK analysis, with the addition of data from CA209017 and CA209057 to further characterise the PK of nivolumab in subjects with advanced SQ or NSQ NSCLC.

Nivolumab concentration time data were well described by the previously developed linear, 2-compartment, zero-order input intravenous (IV) infusion model with first-order elimination.

Bioanalytical methods used for quantifying nivolumab serum concentrations in the development program are cross-validated, and hence allowed merging of the exposure data for PPK analysis.

## Absorption

A summary of the individual PK parameter estimates obtained from the final popPK model is provided. No differences were noted in nivolumab CL or exposure in subjects with different tumour types (SQ NSCLC versus NSQ NSCLC versus melanoma), thus tumour type was not found to be a clinically relevant predictor of nivolumab PK.

## Distribution

Mean Vss of all subjects in the popPK analysis was 7.7 L (CV=29.5%).

## Elimination

Mean clearance of nivolumab of all subjects in the popPK analysis was 0.092 L/hour (CV=48%) and elimination half-life (t1/2) 26 days (CV=87%).

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

As indicated with the popPK analysis for the MAH in melanoma and SQ-NSCLC, pharmacokinetics of nivolumab was dose proportional over the dose range 0.1 mg/kg-10 mg/kg and no unexpected accumulation was observed.

## Special populations

Nivolumab concentration time data were well described by the previously developed linear, 2-compartment, zero-order input intravenous (IV) infusion model with first-order elimination. Consistent with previous findings, WT, sex, ECOG, and eGFR were covariates on nivolumab PK parameters. In addition, baseline

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

serum albumin appeared to be a covariate for CL and cell type/ histology was found to influence VC. The magnitude of the effect of covariates on CL, accounting for uncertainty, was within the ±20% boundaries for all covariates, except body weight and serum albumin. With dosing of nivolumab on an mg/kg basis, nivolumab exposure was comparable across the range of body weight (34-162 kg), justifying the dosing per body weight.  Baseline serum albumin appears to be a potentially important covariate for CL, as a decrease in baseline serum albumin from the median to the 5th percentile value (4 g/dL and 3 g/dL, respectively) isassociated with a &gt;20% (29.8%) increase in CL. Thus, both body weight and serum albumin appear to be clinically relevant covariates on nivolumab PK. No differences were noted in nivolumab CL or exposure in subjects with different tumour types (SQ NSCLC versus NSQ NSCLC versus melanoma).

## 2.3.3. Pharmacodynamics

Exposure response analyses for efficacy and safety were conducted using data from completed studies in patients with advanced or metastatic NSQ NSCLC (MDX1106-03 and CA209057). PopPK model-predicted time-averaged steady-state concentration (Cavgss) was used as the measure of nivolumab exposure. Overall survival was used as the efficacy measure, and time to first adverse event leading to discontinuation or death (AE-DC/D) was used as the safety measure.

## Exposure-Response Efficacy Analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The nivolumab E-R relationship of efficacy for this analysis was characterised for OS in 354 previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic NSQ NSCLC in Studies MDX1106-03 (nivolumab doses 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg), and CA209057 (nivolumab 3 mg/kg). The E-R analysis of efficacy was characterised with respect to OS by a Cox proportional-hazards model that incorporated the effects of covariates that may modulate the E-R relationship.

The predictor variables with a significant effect on OS were ECOG status, PD-L1 status, line of treatment, nivolumab CL, body weight, and baseline LDH (95% CI of effect did not include 1).Nivolumab Cavgss and all the other predictor variables evaluated (prior maintenance therapy, EGFR mutation status, smoking status, sex, baseline albumin, baseline tumour size and age) were not a significant predictor of OS (95% CI of effect included 1).

The first sensitivity analysis (excluding the effect of CL) was performed to assess the potential confounding effect of nivolumab CL on the estimated effects of Cavgss. In this analysis, the ECOG status, PD-L1 status, line of therapy, and baseline LDH are still identified as significant predictor of OS (95% CI of effect did not include 1), which is consistent with that found from the full model.After removing CL effect, nivolumab Cavgss and baseline albumin became significant predictor of OS (95% CI of effect did not include 1), and subjects with higher exposure or higher baseline albumin appeared to have better OS. Body weight was not a significant predictor of OS in this model.

The second sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of tumour shrinkage at Week 8 (TSW8) on OS. This variable was not included in the full model, as approximately 25% of subjects did not have tumour shrinkage data available at Week 8 for analysis. In this sensitivity analysis, the effect of TSW8 was significant on OS. Risk of death appeared to be higher in subjects with lower tumour shrinkage at Week 8 and higher baseline tumour size. ECOG status, PD-L1 status, and line of therapy were not significant predictors of OS after including effect of tumour shrinkage.

The third sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of time averaged concentration over the first dosing interval (Cavg1) replacing Cavgss in the full model including the effect of clearance. There was no change in the effect of predictors on OS in this model when compared to the full model, and Cavg1 was not a significant predictor of OS.

## Exposure-Response Analysis for Safety in NSCLC

Assessment of the relationship between nivolumab exposure and safety was performed with data from 648 subjects with SQ and NSQ NSCLC with respect to Adverse events (excluding disease progression) leading to nivolumab discontinuation or death (AE-DC/D). The E-R relationship was characterised by a semi-parametric CPH model, and included assessments of the modulatory effect of covariates on the E-R relationship. The Cavgss was used as the measure of nivolumab exposure. This measure of exposure represents the overall average of nivolumab exposure within each subject. Furthermore, other summary measures of exposure (such as Cminss and Cmaxss) are highly correlated with Cavgss.

The risk of AE-DC/D did not increase with Cavgss produced by doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg nivolumab in NSCLC patients. The risk of AE-DC/D was higher in patients with ECOG &gt; 0 or who received 2 or more previous therapies, relative to patients with ECOG = 0 and those receiving second line therapy. The risk of AE-DC/D increased with decreasing baseline body weight, and serum albumin; and the risk increased with increasing baseline LDH.

## Immunogenicity

A pooled analysis of nivolumab ADA assessments was performed with data available from the following BMS-sponsored studies for NSCLC and melanoma in which ADA was assessed by the current sensitive and drug tolerant assay (ICDIM 140 V1.00/V2.02): CA209037, CA209063, CA209066, CA209017, CA209057 and CA209067 (nivolumab monotherapy arm).

Of 1037 subjects who were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), 128 subjects (12.3%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA. Of those who were ADA positive, only 1 subject (0.1% of the total) was persistent positive, and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 9 subjects (0.9% of the total). The safety profiles of these 9 subjects were examined and determined to be no different than those observed in ADA negative subjects. There were no acute infusion reactions, hypersensitivity events, or new or additional AEs observed in subjects with neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies were not detectable in subsequent ADA assessments in 8/9 of these subjects; one of the subjects with neutralizing ADA had a subsequent assessment that was ADA positive with a lower titer and neutralizing antibody positive.

A total of 9/1037 subjects (0.9%) were positive for neutralizing antibodies. In the majority of the neutralizing ADA-positive subjects, the presence of neutralizing antibodies was transient and did not recur in subsequent samples. The majority of subjects with neutralizing antibodies continued treatment with benefit from therapy. There was no evidence of loss of efficacy in subjects with neutralizing antibodies.

A total of 51 subjects experienced hypersensitivity reactions/infusion reactions and were evaluable for the presence of ADA. Of the 51 evaluable subjects, 48 (94.1%) were negative for nivolumab ADA and 3 subjects (5.9%) were positive for ADA. No association was established between the presence of ADA and hypersensitivity or infusion reactions.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Pharmacokinetics of nivolumab was similar in subjects with different tumour types (SQ NSCLC versus NSQ NSCLC versus melanoma). Body weight was an important covariate of nivolumab pharmacokinetics, justifying dosing based on mg/kg body weight. Further, nivolumab clearance increased with decreasing baseline serum albumin (approximately 30% increase for the median versus 5th percentile of serum albumin values). Although the mechanistic link is not entirely clear, serum albumin has also been shown to affect the clearance of other antibodies.

In full model, the effect of SQ or NSQ NSCLC on CL or VC was within 20 % in comparison to other tumor types. Although the combined effect of the SQ and NSQ histologies is retained in the final model, the impact is not clinically significant. Therefore, the final model-predicted nivolumab exposures (Cmin1, Cminss, Cmaxss and Cavgss) are similar even if SQ/NSQ were included in the final model.

Nivolumab CL, ECOG status, baseline LDH, baseline body weight, PD-L1 expression status (≥1%), line of therapy, and tumour shrinkage at Week 8 were significant predictors of OS in previously treated NSQ NSCLC subjects. Nivolumab clearance was a significant factor. This may be due to the CL of nivolumab being reflective of the disease severity of subjects - serum albumin, ECOG status, baseline LDH were significant factors of nivolumab clearance - and therefore the effect is redistributed among other predictors that are indicative of disease state when CL is excluded from the model. This finding is consistent with previous results, where no relation between nivolumab exposure and observed response in NSCLC and melanoma was apparent.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant discussed the issue of Nivolumab exposure (Cavgss) as a significant predictor of OS in previously treated SQ/NSQ NSCLC subjects, taking into account the potential confounding effect of predictors (CL and Weight) on the estimated effects of Cavgss. The applicant has justified that the parameter estimates were robust, as the correlations between the parameter estimates (e.g., Cavgss, CL and bodyweight) in the full model were all well below 0.9. The correlation coefficient among the parameter estimates of Cavgss, CL and body weight obtained from the full model were less than|0.6|, indicating that the full model was not over-parameterized and that the effects of allcovariates are relatively independent. The effects of Cavgss and CL could both be adequately estimated in the same model, as the analysis dataset includes subjects who received nivolumab over a dose range of 1 to 10 mg/kg, even though most of the data are for subjects who received 3mg/kg. In addition, model evaluation also showed that the Kaplan-Meier curves were in good agreement with the CPH model predictions for different studies and doses, indicating anadequate model performance over a range of exposures.

Risk of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or death was higher in subjects with ECOG &gt;0, line of therapy &gt;2, and increasing baseline LDH and the risk of AE-DC/D increased with decreasing baseline body weight, and baseline serum albumin. All of the factors are either directly or indirectly associated with the overall health status of the patient. Risk of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or death did not increase with Cavgss resulting from nivolumab doses of 1 to 10 mg/kg in SQ and NSQ NSCLC subjects.The results of this analysis are consistent with an earlier analysis of exposure safety analysis in melanoma and SQ NSCLC.

The choice of AE-DC/D as a compiled indicator of safety could have an impact on the lack of significance of Cavgss as predictor of safety. The applicant has submitted the distribution of nivolumab exposure (Cavgss) presented by patients with and without the most common grade 3+ nivolumab-relaed AEs (pneumonitis, fatigue, lymphopenia and diarrhea) showing that there is no marked difference between the exposure distributions. However, the number of subjects with the events are low (N= 4 to 13), and hence not considered adequate for a model-based analysis.

In the time-varying exposure intensity, subjects who remain on study for longer duration of time tend to have lower CL, and therefore have Cavg values higher than the group of all treated subjects. The applicant has justified that the nivolumab exposure-response for safety is flat over the 1 to 10 mg/kg dose range and doses up to 10 mg/kg are well tolerated; the higher Cavg for patients who remain on treatment is not considered to pose a safety risk due to higher exposure. Also, patients with low CL stay on study longer which suggests that they tolerate nivolumab treatment well. Hence, a change in dosing frequency is not considered appropriate based on the benefits of uniform prescribing information for all patients receiving nivolumab.

Nivolumab has low immunogenic potential. Of 1037 subjects who were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), 128 subjects (12.3%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA. Of those who were ADA positive, only 1 subject (0.1% of the total) was persistent positive, and neutralizing antibodies were detected in only 9 subjects (0.9% of the total). The safety profiles of persistent positive or neutralizing positive subjects were no different than those in other subjects. There was no evidence of loss of efficacy in subjects with neutralizing antibodies.

## 2.3.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Pharmacokinetics, exposure response relationship and immunogenicity of nivolumab  has been sufficiently investigated for the extension of the indication of nivolumab 3 mg/mg every 2 weeks for treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous (NSQ) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

## Methods

## Study participants

This study included adult subjects with metastatic or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC after failure of prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy. It also included subjects who had EGFR mutations or ALK (CD246) translocations and may have had disease progression after the use of a TKI and platinum doublet-based chemotherapy.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to those in study CA209017, which included SQ-NSCLC patients; some modifications related to the NSQ-NSCLC population were also made.

## Key inclusion criteria were:

1. Subjects ≥ 18 years of age with advanced Stage IIIB/ Stage IV non-squamous NSCLC or recurrent/ progressive disease.
2. ECOG performance status of ≤ 1
3. Subjects must have had measurable disease
4. Subjects who received study therapy after acceptable prior therapy as specified below:
- a. Subjects who received study therapy as second line of treatment
- i. Subjects must have experienced disease recurrence or progression during or after one prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Continuous or switch maintenance therapy following platinum doublet-based chemotherapy was considered as first-line therapy.

- b. Subjects who received study therapy as third line of treatment:
- i. Subjects who received an EGFR TKI (erlotinib, gefitinib, or experimental) in addition to a platinum doublet-based chemotherapy must have had a tumour with a known activating EGFR mutation.
- ii. Subjects who received an ALK inhibitor (crizotinib or experimental) in addition to a platinum doublet-based chemotherapy must have had a tumour with a known ALK-translocation.
5. An FFPE tumour tissue block or unstained slides of tumour sample (archival or recent) must have been available for biomarker evaluation.

Key exclusion criteria were:

1. Subjects with untreated CNS metastases.
2. Subjects with carcinomatous meningitis.
3. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection with hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus that may have been reactivated.
4. Other active malignancy requiring concurrent intervention.
5. Subjects with previous malignancies
6. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids.
7. Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease.
8. Prior treatment with docetaxel.
9. Subjects with interstitial lung disease that was symptomatic or may interfere with the detection or management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity.

## Treatments

Subjects received one of the following treatments:

Nivolumab group: nivolumab at 3 mg/kg Q2W by IV infusion. Dosing calculations were to be based on the body weight.

Docetaxel group: docetaxel at 75mg/m 2  Q3W by IV infusion. Dosing calculations were to be based on body surface area.

No premedications were recommended for initiation of dosing of nivolumab. Premedication with corticosteroids were to be given to subjects randomised to the docetaxel treatment group per the USPI and SmPC; institutional standard regimens for steroid premedication consistent with (or equivalent to) recommendations contained within the docetaxel label were also allowed.

Dose reductions were not permitted for nivolumab but were permitted for docetaxel for subjects who experienced docetaxel-related events of febrile neutropenia, neutrophils &lt; 500 cell/mm³ for &gt; 7 days, severe or cumulative cutaneous reactions, or other Grade 3/4 non-haematological toxicities during docetaxel treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Dose delays were permitted in both groups. Dose delays of &lt; 6 weeks were permitted, with longer delays allowed for completion of steroid tapers to manage drug-related AEs, or for non-drug- related reasons if approved by the Medical Monitor.

Subjects were treated until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other protocol-defined reasons.

## Objectives

Primary Objective

- -To compare the OS of nivolumab to docetaxel in subjects with non-squamous NSCLC after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy

## Secondary Objectives

- To compare the ORR of nivolumab versus docetaxel
- To compare PFS of nivolumab versus docetaxel
- To evaluate whether PD-L1 expression is a predictive biomarker for OS and ORR
- To  evaluate  the  proportion  of  subjects  exhibiting  disease-related  symptom  improvement  by12 weeks, as measured by the LCSS, in nivolumab and docetaxel treatment groups
- Other exploratory objectives were assessment of safety, PK, health status (using EQ-5D index) characterisation of immunogenicity.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint

- -Overall survival (OS).

Key Secondary endpoints

- -Investigator assessed ORR using RECIST v 1.1.
- -PFS as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 criteria, or death due to any cause.
- -DOR and TTR, as determined by the investigator.
- -OS and ORR based on PD-L1 status at baseline.

Radiographic tumour response were assessed at Week 9 (± 5 days) and every 6 weeks from Week 9 (± 5 days) for the first year of treatment, then every 12 weeks after the first year of treatment until disease progression (or until discontinuation of study therapy in patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression), lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent.

PD-L1 tumour membrane expression levels were evaluated using an automated immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay using a rabbit-ant-human PD-L1 antibody. PD-L1 expression was defined as the percent of tumour cells demonstrating plasma membrane PD-L1 staining in a minimum of 100 evaluable tumour cells per this validated DAKO PD-L1 IHC assay.

## Sample size

The final analysis of OS was planned to take place after 442 deaths were observed among 574 randomised subjects. One interim analysis of OS was planned after at least 380 deaths (86% of total deaths required for final analysis) had been observed.

The OS distribution was assumed exponential for the docetaxel group, while for the nivolumab group, a long-term survival and delayed onset of benefit were assumed, as observed in patients treated with the immuno-oncology drug ipilimumab in recent Phase 3 studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Piecewise mixture model assumptions were as follows: a 4-month delayed separation of curves between docetaxel and nivolumab treatment groups, an exponential distribution for docetaxel (8 month median OS), an 18% 'cure' rate (long-term survival) in the nivolumab treatment group, and an 8 month median OS for 'non-cured' nivolumab subjects. The piecewise mixture distribution for nivolumab had an overall 9.8 months median OS for all randomised nivolumab subjects. HRs between nivolumab and docetaxel group followed the following pattern: Months 0-4: HR=1; Month 6: HR=0.71; Month 12: HR= 0.59; Month 24: HR=0.34; Month 36: HR=0.15. Simulations were performed using Power Analysis &amp; Sample Size Software7 to assess power and timing of interim and final OS analyses.

## Randomisation

Subjects who met all eligibility criteria were randomised by IVRS in a 1:1 ratio to the nivolumab group or the docetaxel group, with stratification by prior use of maintenance vs. no maintenance therapy and second-line vs. third-line therapy. Subjects were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 expression status, and PD-L1 expression status was not a stratification factor.

## Blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study.

## Statistical methods

Discrete variables were tabulated by the frequency and proportion of subjects falling into each category, grouped by treatment (with total). Percentages in the tables were rounded and, therefore, may not always sum to 100%. Continuous variables were summarized by treatment group (with total) using the mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum values.

Time-to-event distributions (i.e., OS, PFS, and DOR) were estimated using K-M techniques.

Median survival time along with 95% CI were constructed based on log-log transformed CI for the survivor function S(t). Rates at fixed time points (e.g., OS at 6 months) were derived from the K-M estimate and corresponding  CI  was  derived  based  on  Greenwood  formula  for  variance  derivation  and  on  log-log transformation applied on the survivor function S(t).

Unless otherwise specified, a stratified log-rank test was performed to test the comparison between time to event distributions (e.g., PFS and OS).

Unless otherwise specified, the stratified HR between 2 treatment groups along with CI was obtained by fitting a stratified Cox model with the treatment group variable as unique covariate.

The difference in rates between the two treatment groups along with their two-sided 95% CI were estimated using the following CMH method of weighting, adjusting for the stratification factors.

The associated odds-ratio was to be derived. P-values from sensitivity analyses were for descriptive purpose only and there were no multiplicity adjustment for these analyses.

OS was compared between the two treatment groups using a two-sided, log-rank test stratified (per IVRS) by  maintenance  vs.  no  maintenance  therapy,  and  second-line  vs.  third-line  therapy.  The  HR  and  the corresponding 100(1α ) % CI (adjusted for the interim) were estimated in a stratified Cox proportional hazards model using randomised group as a single covariate. The OS curves for each treatment group were estimated using the K-M product-limit method. Two-sided, 95% CIs for median OS were constructed based on a log-log transformed CI for the survivor function S(t).

Survival rates at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 months and at 5 years were to be estimated using K-M estimates on the OS curve for each randomised group. Minimum follow-up must have been ≥ time point to generate the rate. For this study report, survival rates at 6 and 12 months were estimated. The associated two-sided 95%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CIs were calculated using the Greenwood's formula for variance derivation and on log-log transformation applied on the survivor function S(t).

PFS for each treatment group was estimated using K-M product limit method and graphically displayed. A two-sided 95% CI for median PFS was constructed based on a log-log transformed CI for the survivor function S(t).

The comparison of PFS distribution was performed using a stratified log-rank test at two-sided, 5% level. In addition, the stratified HRs between treatment groups were provided along with the 95% CI.

PFS rates at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 months and at 5 year were also to be estimated using K-M estimates on the PFS curve for each randomised group. For this study report, the PFS rates at 6 and12 months were estimated. Minimum follow-up was to be longer than or equal to time point to generate the rate. The associated two-sided 95% CIs were calculated using the Greenwood's formula.

ORR was computed in each treatment group along with the exact 95% CI using Clopper-Pearson method. An estimate of the difference in ORRs and corresponding 95% CI were calculated using CMH methodology and adjusted by the same stratification factors as in primary analysis of OS. A by subject listing of BOR and tumour measurements were provided.

The stratified (source: IVRS) odds ratios (Mantel-Haenszel estimator) between the treatment groups was provided along with the 95% CI. ORR was compared between the treatment groups using a two-sided stratified, CMH test, and 5% alpha level.

## Recruitment

The enrolment period was from Nov-2012 until Dec-2013. The last subject was randomised on 31-Dec-2013 and last patient's last visit occurred on 05-Feb-2015, providing a minimum follow-up of 13.2 months. The clinical database lock occurred on 18-Mar-2015.

This study was conducted at 112 sites in 22 countries (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, and US). Of the 582 randomised subjects, 269 (46.2%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were in Europe, 215 (36.9%) were in the US and Canada, and 98 (16.8%) were in the 'rest of world'.

## Conduct of the study

The sponsor independently reviewed safety data during the study. The review was not done by treatment group in order to maintain blinding.

An  independent  data  monitoring  committee  was  utilized  to  provide  oversight  of  safety  and  efficacy considerations, study conduct and risk benefit ratio for the study. The DMC acted in an advisory capacity to BMS.

The DMC met on 16-April 2015 for the formal interim analyses of OS after 413 reported deaths (93.4% of the planned number of events of the final analyses). The DMC confirmed that the pre-specified boundary for significance was crossed, (p&lt;0.0408) and noted that there were no new safety signals that would affect continuation of the study. The DMC recommended that patients who were originally randomised to docetaxel to receive subsequent nivolumab therapy as part of a nivolumab extension phase

Most subjects had a result of prior EGFR driver mutation testing reported by the investigator (72.5%). Of these subjects, 19.4% (82/422 tested) were found to harbour an EGFR mutation. Results of other driver mutation testing reported included: K-RAS gene mutation, MET receptor, and ALK translocation. The K-RAS gene mutational status and the ALK translocation status were known for 31.8% and 45.4% of the subjects, respectively.  Of  these  subjects,  most  were  found  to  be  wildtype  (K-RAS:  123/185  [66.5%],  ALK translocation not detected: 243/264 [92.0%]). Most subjects (&gt; 97%) did not have their MET receptor status reported.

All randomised subjects (except 1 docetaxel subject) had tumour samples collected at pre-study (baseline). Most subjects had a quantifiable PD-L1 status at pre-study (baseline) (78.2%).

## Previous and Subsequent Treatments

Most patients in both treatment groups had not received prior maintenance therapy (60.0% per CRF and 56.4% per IVRS) and were receiving study drug as second-line therapy (88.5% per CRF and 87.5% per IVRS).  There  was  1  subject  in  the  nivolumab  group  who  received  study  drug  as  first-line  therapy (subsequent to neo-adjuvant therapy):

- All subjects received a prior platinum doublet-based therapy.
- Less than 10% of the subjects in each treatment group had received a prior EGFR TKI regimen, and &lt; 1% of subjects had received a prior ALK inhibitor.
- The majority of subjects (62.5%) completed their most recent prior systemic regimen within 3 months and most (82.3%) within 6 months, of randomization.
- Most subjects had prior surgery (72.0%); 47.6% of subjects had received prior radiotherapy.

Subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy was received by 42.1% of nivolumab subjects and 49.7% of docetaxel subjects. The most frequently used subsequent systemic therapy was chemotherapy in both the nivolumab group (37.7%) and the docetaxel group (34.5%). Sixty-six subjects randomised to nivolumab (22.6%)  received  subsequent  treatment  with  docetaxel.  Six  subjects  in  the  docetaxel  group  received subsequent therapy with immunotherapy, 5 of whom received an anti-PD1 pathway agent: MPDL3280A (2 subjects) and EDI4736, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab (1 subject each). Subsequent ALK/EGFR TKIs were received by 11.0% of nivolumab subjects and 22.1% of docetaxel subjects, of which erlotinib was the most common in both groups (6.5% and 17.2%, respectively).

Higher ORRs were observed with nivolumab versus docetaxel across pre-defined expression levels ≥1%, ≥5%, and ≥10%, (range: 30.9% to 37.2% versus 12.2% to 12.8%), with non-overlapping CIs. Median DOR was longer with nivolumab (16.0 months) versus docetaxel (5.6 months) across PD-L1 expression levels.

For patients with no PD-L1 expression, objective response rates were similar, although numerically higher with docetaxel versus nivolumab, with overlapping CIs. Among responders, median DOR was longer with nivolumab (18.3 months) versus docetaxel (5.6 months) for patients with no PD-L1 expression.

Figure 10: The overall response by baseline PD-L1 expression level - CA209057 Risk of early death

<!-- image -->

The higher number of early deaths (i.e within 3 months) compared to docetaxel was of concern during the assessment.  Baseline characteristics were investigated to identify factors that could explain this outcome. - Nivolumab vs docetaxel

In the docetaxel group, the early death (OS≤3 months) subgroup had a higher proportion of subjects with ECOG PS 0 (27.3% docetaxel vs. 8.5% nivolumab), 4 sites with at least 1 lesion (27.3% docetaxel vs. 15.3% nivolumab), and best response of PR or CR to the most recent prior systemic therapy (25.0% docetaxel vs. 13.6% nivolumab), as compared to subjects in the nivolumab early death subgroup (Table 17).

This suggests that, although prognostic factors were balanced between the groups at baseline, subjects with these more favorable disease attributes had a higher likelihood of experiencing a death event in the docetaxel group within the first 3 months of treatment relative to the nivolumab group. Importantly, as mentioned, sample sizes in the early death subgroups are small (OS ≤3 months; n = 59 nivolumab, n = 44 docetaxel) and preclude definitive conclusions.

## - Nivolumab group: early death (OS &lt;3 months vs. OS &gt;6 months)

In the subgroup of nivolumab subjects with early death (OS &lt; 3 months), as compared with the subgroup of nivolumab subjects with no early death, the factors with at least a 10% difference between subgroups included:

- a higher proportion of subjects with ECOG PS of 1 (91.5% vs. 63.6%), region Europe (57.6% vs. 42.6%), ≥5 sites with at least 1 lesion (25.4 vs. 8.7%), completion of most recent therapy &lt; 3 months prior to randomization (78 vs. 55.9%), no prior maintenance therapy (66.1 vs. 54.4%), PD as best response to most recent prior systemic therapy (57.6 vs. 31.3%, prior radiation therapy (54 vs. 44.1%), bone (44.1 vs. 24.1%) or liver (33.9 vs. 23.1%) involvement at baseline.
- a lower proportion of subjects in the US/Canada region (25.4 vs. 40.0%), or best response of PR or CR to the most recent prior systemic therapy (13.6 vs. 29.2%).

The additional post hoc analyses revealed that for nivolumab patients with a baseline PD-L1 expression &lt;10%, the early death rate was around 25%; this death rate is higher than for docetaxel. In contrast, patients with a PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%, nivolumab shows a low overall early death rate (6.1%,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

which is lower than observed with docetaxel 24%).

Note: The proportion of patients by PD-L1 expression cut-offs represents those experiencing an early death. The PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay was not analytically validated at the 10% or 50% expression levels.

## Figure 11: Comparison of the early death rate (OS &lt;3 months) between nivolumab and docetaxel according baseline PD-L1 expression- Study CA209057

At 6 months, the overall survival rates between nivolumab and docetaxel are comparable for the patients group with a baseline PD-L1 expression &lt;10%. The patients group with a PD-L1 expression ≥ 10% shows the largest difference in overall survival (OS &gt;6 Month) between nivolumab and docetaxel (78% vs. 65%) favouring nivolumab.

The death rates and survival for the patient group with unquantifiable PD-L1 are comparable to docetaxel (early death rate 15% vs 17%, OS at six months 62% vs 68%)

Note: The proportion of patients by PD-L1 expression cut-offs represents those not experiencing an early death (&lt;= 6 months, not based on Kaplan-Meier estimates). The PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay was not analytically validated at the 10% or 50% expression levels?

The patients population with PD-L1 expression &lt; 1% at the landmark analyses at 3 months, the curves are slightly in favour of nivolumab run parallel up in favour of nivolumab till 6 months, when they split.

The landmark analyses at 6 months shows that they appear to separate at 7 months. The hazard ratio for overall survival shows a considerable improvement from the start (Hazard ratio (0.91) of the study to 3 months (hazard ratio 0.66) with no further improvement from month 3 to 6.

Additional analyses according to baseline PD-L1 expression were also provided for the comparison of the early death rate (OS &lt; 3 months).

In the nivolumab group, baseline PD-L1 expression levels did not distinguish the early death subgroup. While 41/50 subjects with quantifiable PD-L1 expression in the early death subgroup had &lt;10% PD-L1 expression, most subjects (104/145) with &lt; 10% PD-L1 did not experience early death. This is consistent with the other PD-L1 expression levels (82/108 with &lt; 1% expression and 98/136 with &lt; 5% expression).

In summary, there are differences in early death rates between these patient population (PD-L1 &lt;10%) and the patient population defined by a PD-L1 expression &gt;10%. At 3 months, the OS rate is 72% vs. 90% in favour of the patients with a high PD-L1 expression. Therefore, it is cannot be ruled out that the baseline PD-L1 expression percentage may affect the early death rate.

## -Multivariate analyses.

The applicant performed various post hoc multivariate analyses to predict early death with different cut of values of baseline PD-L1 expression number, 1, 5, 10 and 50%.

The covariates selected in the model included treatment group, PD-L1 expression, and other  relevant baseline prognostic factors such as ECOG PS (0 vs ≥1), time since last prior treatment (&lt; 3 months vs. ≥ 3 months),  and  best  response  to  most  recent  prior  systemic  therapy  (progressive  disease  vs  other). Interactions  between  the  individual  covariate  and  treatment  were  explored  to  determine  whether  any factors had a differential risk for subjects randomised to nivolumab vs. docetaxel.

The additional post hoc analyses showed that there was an association with PD-L1 expression level (e.g. &lt;1%, &lt;5%, &lt;10%, &lt;50%) and ECOG score (e.g. ECOG PS 1). Other factors associated with early death were time since last treatment &lt; 3 months and progressive disease as best response to last treatment. The increased odds of early death was associated with nivolumab treatment among subjects beginning at the &lt;1% PD-L1 expression level when combined with ECOG PS 1.

A summary of the key outcome measures according to baseline PD-L1 expression is presented below.

Despite the limitations of subgroup analysis methodology, the OS HR favoured nivolumab vs. docetaxel for the majority of pre-defined subsets with the exception of the subgroups of never smokers and patients with an EGFR mutation. The analysis of PD-L1 expression in these subgroups indicated that the distribution of PD-L1 expression appeared comparable to the overall population.

An overall numerical improvement in OS was observed in the nivolumab arm compared to docetaxel, except for the patients with a positive EGFR mutation. In the patient population with a positive EGFR mutation, docetaxel showed a numerically favourable ORR, PFS and OS compared to nivolumab.

## Clinical studies in special populations

## Hepatic/renal impairment

Based on data form the pivotal study, OS results in subjects with hepatic impairment (median OS 9.00 months [95% CI 6.31, 18.4]) are smaller in magnitude than those reported for the overall population, but they are considered clinically meaningful.

In subjects with renal impairment, OS (median 18.4 months [95% CI 7.82, NA]) and safety results do not suggest a negative impact of renal impairment.

## Elderly patients

In order to adequately characterise efficacy of nivolumab in this population, the Applicant was requested to provide main efficacy data (OS, PFS, ORR data) from the pivotal study using the following age subgroups: Age &lt;65 years, 65 to 74 years old, 75 to 84 years old and &gt;85 years old (see tables below).

## Supportive study

Main evidence of the effect of nivolumab beyond second line in NSQ NSCLC derives from the Phase 1 study MDX1106-03, which included a cohort of 74 patients with NSQ NSCLC. This study was previously assessed in the original MAA for the SQ NSCLC indication.

A total of 43 NSQ patients (58.1%) from study MDX1106-03 had received ≥3 lines prior to study entry. Additional  baseline  disease  characteristics  indicate  that  this  was  an  advanced  and  heavily  pre-treated population subgroup.

The median OS in patients with NSQ NSCLC was 10.1 months [95% CI: 5.7, 13.7].

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The efficacy of OPDIVO in the treatment of advanced non-squamous NSCLC is based on a single pivotal study (CA209057).This study was a Phase 3, randomised, open-label study of nivolumab vs. docetaxel in adults  with  metastatic  or  recurrent  non-squamous  NSCLC  after  failure  of  prior  platinum  doublet-based chemotherapy. Its design largely resembles that of study CA209017, the phase 3 study which supported the SQ NSCLC indication.

Dose-selection for this application is based on study MDX1106-06, a phase 1, dose-escalating study that assessed tolerability of various nivolumab doses/regimen in several types of solid tumours. This study was already assessed during the original MAA. Specific dose-finding studies have not been submitted for this application which is considered acceptable.

In the pivotal study, docetaxel was used as the comparator, which could be considered the best option for a non-selected population in second-line.

Patients were stratified according to prior maintenance therapy (yes/no) and line of therapy (second or third line of therapy). Stratification by PD-L1 status was not applied because, at the time of study initiation, the value of the PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker was uncertain, and the IHC assay was not verified. Therefore,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

this decision seemed appropriate, although nowadays the use of a validated biomarker is recommended to tailor therapy by identifying responders versus non-responders.

The primary endpoint was OS and the key secondary endpoints were PFS and ORR (both per investigator). OS  and  key  secondary  endpoints  were  also  assessed  based  on  PD-L1  status  at  baseline  (secondary endpoint). From a methodological point of view, the results of the PD-L1 analyses must be regarded with caution,  despite  the  underlying  clear  biological  rationale.  Response  and  progressive  disease  were  both assessed using RECIST v 1.1. criteria.

A total of 24 % of the nivolumab treated patients crossed over to docetaxel. It is considered that docetaxel might still be effective in this patient population and may have contributed to the observed OS improvement in  the  nivolumab  group.  Almost,  no  patients  crossed  over  from  docetaxel  to  nivolumab  or  another immunotherapy.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

Demographic and baseline characteristics were mostly comparable for both treatment groups, with the exception  of  age  (more  elderly  patients  were  randomised  to  the  docetaxel  arm).  In  the  overall  ITT population, races/ethnicities other than white was limited. In addition, the proportion of patient ≥75 years of age included in the pivotal trial is limited and no conclusion can be drawn on the efficacy of nivolumab in this patient population (see section 5.1 of the SmPC).

The study limited the inclusion of patients to those with a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.  The lack of ECOG PS 2 patients can be considered a limitation, since patients with ECOG PS 2 might represent a proportion of the target population. This information has been reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).

All patients had received prior platinum doublet-based therapy and the majority of patients (88.5%) in the overall population received nivolumab as second line treatment. A total of 11.2% of patients had received at least 2 prior lines of treatment and no patients had received ≥3 prior systemic cancer therapies.

The reported protocol deviations do not seem to impact study results.

At the date of the clinical database lock (18-Mar-2015), 43 nivolumab patients continued in the treatment period (none in the docetaxel group). The most frequent reason for discontinuing treatment was disease progression for both groups (194 patients (67.6%) in the nivolumab group, 179 patients (66.8%) in the docetaxel group), followed by drug toxicity in docetaxel patients (n=42, 15.7%) and unrelated AE in the nivolumab group (n=19, 6.6%).

A total of 413 deaths were included in the primary analysis of OS. The minimum follow-up was 13.2 months. The median OS was 12.2 months for the nivolumab group versus 9.36  months for the docetaxel group, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60, 0.89), p 0.0015 (stratified log-rank test). This represents an approximate median gain of 2.8 months for nivolumab over docetaxel. However, the profile  of  the  OS  curve  for  nivolumab,  with  a  crossing  at  approximately  7  months,  jeopardises  the achievement of reliable conclusions from this analysis.  A higher frequency of death during the first 6 months of treatment due to malignant neoplasm progression for nivolumab in comparison to docetaxel treatment was observed. Additional analyses on the patients with an OS&lt; 6 months (occurrence of death dichotomised ≤ 3 months and &gt; 3 to ≤ 6 months) in terms of baseline and disease ch aracteristics, as well as prior lines of therapy (both arms), suggest that nivolumab results in a meaningful gain in OS for those patients who live past the first 3 month interval even those who are labelled &lt;1% PD-L1 expression. A multivariate post-hoc analysis provided by the Applicant suggests that poorer prognostic features and/or aggressive disease, in combination with no/low PD-L1 expression, characterize patients with potential for death within the first 3 months.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The analyses of OS in pre-defined subgroups were conducted. The OS HR favoured nivolumab vs. docetaxel for the majority of pre-defined subsets with the exception of the subgroups of never smokers, patients an EGFR mutation. However the subgroups are small and show a large overlap in confidence intervals, which precludes any definitive conclusion.  Overall, the effect in these subgroups appears to be comparable to the overall population.

The higher frequency of death during the first 6 months of treatment due to malignant neoplasm progression for nivolumab in comparison to docetaxel treatment is still not fully understood. The Applicant provided additional analyses on the patients with an OS&lt; 6 months (occurrence of death dichotomised ≤ 3 months and &gt; 3 to ≤ 6 months) in terms of baseline and d isease characteristics, as well as prior lines of therapy (both arms). From these data, it seems that nivolumab results in a meaningful gain in OS for those patients who live past the first 3 month interval even for those who are labelled as having tumour expression of &lt;1% PD-L1 expression.

Although the MAH claimed that no single factor or group of factors can be identified as predictor of an early death (OS&lt;3 months), it seems reasonable to assume that those patients with a poor prognosis and a more aggressive disease would benefit less because of the delayed effect of immunotherapy on OS. A multivariate analysis provided by the Applicant suggests that poorer prognostic features and/or aggressive disease, in combination with no/low PD-L1 expression, characterise patients with potential for early death within the first 3 months. It is therefore considered appropriate to make all relevant information available in the SmPC to the prescribers, including the baseline characteristics suggestive of a poorer disease that were associated with early death rates in the nivolumab patients group. Furthermore, several factors could be contributing to these  early  deaths,  therefore,  restricting  the  indication  based  on  PD-L1  expression  does  not  seem appropriate since even in patients with a low PD-L1 expression have shown durable responses even though the response rate was considerably lower than for those labelled with a high PD-L1 expression. A similar effect was not identified for the squamous histology subset of NSCLC, which are deemed rapidly progressing patients

The additional analyses provided by the MAH showed that the biological behaviour of the tumour with baseline PD-L1 expression between 1-10% is more comparable to the tumour behaviour of tumours showing no PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 &lt;1%) than with the tumour showing a high PD-L1 expression value (PD-L1 ≥ 10%). Regarding OS benefit and other key efficacy results according to baseline PD-L1 status, it is noted that results in PD-L1 negative/non-quantifiable patients are similar to those seen in the docetaxel patients, with  practically  no  differences  between  this  subset  of  patients  and  those  in  the  docetaxel  group,  with numerically more deaths in nivolumab patients than docetaxel during the first 6 months of treatment. However, PD-L1 positive patients (defined by a cut of valued ≥ 1%, ≥ 5% or ≥ 10%) showed a significant improvement over docetaxel for the ORR, PFS and OS. Additional post-hoc analyses with higher cut-off values (e.g. &lt;50%, ≥ 50%) suggest the same trend. However, considering the post-hoc nature of these analyses and the limited size of some of the subgroups, these results need to be taken with caution.

Based on the Kaplan Meier curves for PFS, more than half of the patients in both treatment arms already showed progressive disease before 3 months of treatment. There was no benefit in terms of PFS as no statistically significant difference between treatment groups could be demonstrated (median PFS estimate of 2.3 months for nivolumab vs. 4.2 months for docetaxel). A late separation of the K-M curves (after 7 months) is also observed, with 1-year PFS rates favouring nivolumab (18.5% for nivolumab vs. 8.1% for docetaxel). Given the PFS curve for nivolumab, median PFS might not be the best measure to assess treatment benefit in terms of PFS. HR and/ or 6 months and 12 months survival rate are considered more informative.

Overall, these findings point out to a delayed effect of nivolumab treatment, which has been previously described for immunotherapy agents such as ipilimumab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subgroup analyses were largely consistent with those from the overall population. In some of the subgroups (e.g. EGFR activating mutations, never smokers of patients with CNS metastases) nivolumab did not show a benefit, however, due to the small numbers of patients, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these data.

The number of patients with renal or hepatic impairment included in the pivotal trial is limited. Although efficacy results seem to be clinically meaningful in these patient subgroups, they need to be taken cautiously due to the small sample size.

The MAH provided specific efficacy data according to the following age subgroups: ≥65 &lt;75, ≥75 &lt;85, and ≥85 years of age. OS results in each subgroup favoured nivolumab, with median OS ranging from 8.57 (≥75) to 13.04 (≥65 and &lt;75) months. With the exception of the ≥75 subgroup, results are in line or slightly better than those for the overall study population.

PFS results were in line with those from the overall population. In addition, ORRs were consistently higher for nivolumab  across  most  of  the  age  subgroups  (except  ≥75  subgroup),  indicating  that  nivolumab  has antitumour activity, regardless of age. In general, the difference in terms of efficacy could be partially explained by the small size of the ≥75 subgroup (n=43).

The main efficacy data in patients with NSQ NSCLC from the supportive study MDX1106-03 (58.1% received ≥ 3 lines of treatment) seem to indicate a somewhat smaller effect size than those seen in the pivotal study (median  OS  10.1[5.7,  13.7]  and  12.19  [9.66,  14.98],  for  MDX1106-03  and  CA209057,  respectively). However, these findings are not totally unexpected in a later disease setting. Furthermore, a deleterious effect is not shown in the more advanced non-SQ population, which is reassuring. Other additional efficacy results available also point to a favourable effect in this population.

## Additional expert consultation

A SAG-O meeting was convened, which took place on 14 January 2016. The following issues were discussed:

## 1. Validity of PD-L1 testing

- a. Whether an optimal cut-off value for the PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 &lt; x%) can be established, such that patients most likely to benefit from treatment can be reliably defined.

A positive association between PD-L1 expression and activity of nivolumab appears to be consistent across trials in the non-SQ NSCLC and melanoma indications, although a number of uncertainties remain in view of the inadequate statistical methodology used to identify optimal cut-offs. Notwithstanding the methodological weaknesses, in the  non-SQ NSCLC indication, PD-L1 expression ≥10% appeared to be associated with higher increase survival for nivolumab v. docetaxel, compared to lower PD-L1 expression. In the melanoma indication, with PD-L1 expression &gt;1% (or perhaps &gt;5%), the addition of ipilimumab did not appear to be associated with longer progression-free survival compared to nivolumab alone.

However, the analyses presented are mainly based on visual exploration of grouped data plots and subgroup analyses using arbitrary cut-off values and intervals. Adequate statistical analyses of the available data are lacking to clarify the relationship between level of PD-L1 expression and activity, as well as the association between  PD-L1  expression  and  clinical  co-variates  including  prognostic  factors.  In  particular,  no comprehensive  estimation  of  cut-off  values  using  conventional  statistical  approaches  (e.g.,  plots  of Martingale residuals; AUC and ROC curves, as appropriate; sensitivity and specificity thresholds; exploration of treatment-covariate interactions such as using the STEPP method; Forrest plots; interaction test) within the  framework  of  multiple  regression  models  for  response  rate  and  time-related  endpoints  has  been presented across available nivolumab trials. Such analyses should be conducted to determine the prognostic importance of PD-L1 expression, and the relationship between PD-L1 expression (and other covariates) and nivolumab (and ipilimumab) activity, and to estimate optimal cut-off values (if such threshold values truly exist). If no optimal cut-off values can be estimated, consideration should be given to a score system based

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

on multivariate analysis of PD-L1 expression and other factors associated with clinical benefit to guide patient selection.

Such statistical analyses can be conducted on the available data. In the absence of better evidence, the currently available information based on suboptimal methodology is still considered useful to some extent to guide treatment decisions and should be described in the product information.

- b. The reliability and usability of the PD-L1 as biomarker in clinical practice and the possible implications of any restriction/recommendations in the SmPC based on this biomarker

Immunohistochemistry is per se a well-established technique and a CE-marked assay is available. However, there are concerns about the reliability and clinical utility of the method in view of the dynamic nature of this marker and tumour environment, and the difficulties with PD-L1 determination in clinical practice are also due to the lack of comparability data between the different assays. Further data on the reliability of this assay in a real-life setting (especially in melanoma if very low cut-offs of 1% are used, which is problematic in relation to the low number of cells which were counted), as well as data to compare the different available assays,  should  be  provided  in  order  to  be  able  to  conclude  on  the  reliability  and  clinical  utility  of  this biomarker.

Still,  even  acknowledging  the  current  limitations  and  the  fact  that  optimal  cut-off  values  are  lacking, information (e.g., SmPC section 5.1) about PD-L1 expression and activity are considered useful to guide treatment decisions (see answers to questions No. 2-3) but no clear restrictions based on precise cut-offs can be proposed based on the current data due to limitations described above.

Aside from a more comprehensive analysis of the available data, it is recommended to continue to further elucidate  other  biomarkers  in  the  future,  including  mutational  load  as  a  marker  for  passenger mutations/neo-antigens, gene expression etc., and to conduct further studies on tumour heterogeneity (intra-tumour and between different lesions, including primary tumours vs. metastatic lesions).

2. Nivolumab showed an overall clinically relevant improvement in overall survival compared to docetaxel for the whole population. However, concerns exist as the overall survival and PFS data show that this effect might be limited to certain subgroups, in particular the population with a high PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 ≥5%). The experts are invited to discuss

- -To what extent the PDL-1 status should be used to indicate the benefit of nivolumab (also considering the discussion under 1).
- -Whether other patient characteristics can be identified that influence the effect on OS.

In the non-SQ NSCLC indication, PD-L1 expression ≥10% was associated with higher increase survival for nivolumab v. docetaxel, compared to lower PD-L1 expression. However, considerable uncertainty remains about the existence of an optimal cut-off in terms of PD-L1 expression in view of the limitations described above.

There are some concerns that the effect on survival associated with nivolumab might be slightly worse during the first few months (based on visual exploration of the survival curves), particularly in patients with the poorest prognosis, as claimed by the applicant. This may be due to a delay in the onset of the therapeutic effect  of  immunotherapy  compared  to  chemotherapy,  although  this  remains  an  assumption  and  a detrimental interaction in terms of disease progression cannot be excluded. Based on the current data, in patients with rapidly progressing disease, chemotherapy might be the preferred option. In patients with poor prognostic factors, chemotherapy might not always be the optimal choice. The decision should be taken on a case by case basis.

Concerning PD-L1 expression for patient selection, the limitations described in the answer to question No. 1 apply, including inadequate exploration of optimal cut-off values. Thus, clear restrictions based on the currently explored cut-offs do not seem appropriate. However, while awaiting the results of further and more

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

comprehensive analyses (see answer to question No. 1), the available information (including subgroup analyses, e.g., non-smokers and EGFR mutation) is considered useful to guide treatment decisions and should be described in the product information.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Nivolumab in the treatment of non-SQ NSCLC results in a meaningful OS gain for patients that live past the first 3 months interval and are labeled   as &lt;10%, &lt;5% and &lt;1% PD-L1 expression. Patients with PD-L1 expression ≥50% (assessed by a post hoc exploratory analysis), although small in size, seem to reach OS&gt;3 months more frequently.

Physicians should consider the delayed onset of nivolumab effect before initiating treatment in patients with poorer prognostic features and/or aggressive disease. In non-squamous NSCLC, a higher number of deaths within 3 months was observed in nivolumab compared to docetaxel. Factors associated with early deaths were poorer prognostic factors and/or more aggressive disease combined with low or no tumour PD-L1 expression (see sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC).

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy (changes underlined):

- To further investigate the value of biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status at tumour cell membrane level by IHC (e.g., other methods / assays, and associated cut-offs, that might prove more sensitive and specific in predicting response to treatment based on PD-L1, PD-L2, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes with measurement of CD8+T density, RNA signature, etc.) as predictive of nivolumab efficacy. This will be provided for all the approved indications:
- Melanoma: studies CA209038 and CA209066
- NSCLC: studies CA209017, CA209057 and CA209026
- To further investigate the associative analyses between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression conducted in studies CA209066 and CA209057.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

A total of 582 patients were randomized in study CA209057 (287 patient have been treated in the nivolumab group and 268 in the docetaxel group).

The safety data from CA209057 were pooled with supportive data from treated subjects in the Phase 3 study CA209017 (N=260), and the Phase 2 study CA209063 (n=117), which used the same nivolumab dosing regimen of 3 mg/kg nivolumab Q2W.

For the purpose of the assessment of this variation, the population from study CA209057 is considered the main safety dataset.

Twenty-four (24) subjects with disease progression reported as the reason for discontinuation also had unrelated AEs leading to discontinuation reported (Nivolumab group (n = 17), docetaxel group (n = 7)).

Reasons for withdrawal of consent, when given, were: no desire for further treatment, no desire to continue in the study, refusal to visit the clinical site, no desire to continue in the study due to the subject not receiving the experimental drug, and no desire to continue with anti-neoplastic treatment.

'Other' reasons for discontinuing the study therapy were: required steroid therapy; health status had not improved,  was  being  treated  with  steroids,  will  receive  radiotherapy,  subject  was  confused;  required prolonged hospitalization; symptomatic deterioration; fatigue/investigator decided to stop treatment.

In CA209057, the minimum follow-up was approximately 13.2 months

The median duration of study therapy was 2.6 months (95% CI: 1.91, 3.25) for nivolumab treatment and 2.3 months (95% CI: 2.10, 2.83) for docetaxel treatment. As evidenced by the separation in the K-M estimates of therapy duration, a substantially higher proportion of subjects in the nivolumab group had duration of therapy lasting &gt; 6 months as compared to the docetaxel group, and this trend persisted for duration of therapy&gt; 12 months. Accordingly, a greater number of subjects were continuing nivolumab at the time of the analysis (43/287), as compared to no subjects who were continuing docetaxel.

Dose Delay, Dose Reduction, Infusion Interruption, and Reduction of Infusion Rate

Most subjects received all doses of study medication without an infusion interruption, rate reduction, or delay.  Most of the subjects in the docetaxel group did not require a dose reduction; dose reductions were not permitted with nivolumab treatment.

## Infusion interruptions:

The most common reason for infusion interruption in the nivolumab group was 'other' further described as: infusion running faster than expected, to give IV diluted, bradycardia, discussion with physician, infusion nurse error, went to bathroom mid-infusion/upon return had swelling on IV site, felt anxious, AE bronchitis, paraesthesia in upper limbs and feet, and non-compliant

The most common reason for infusion interruption in the docetaxel group was hypersensitivity reaction.

## Dose delays

The majority of delays in the both treatment groups were reported as due to an 'other' reason and more specifically to personal or administrative reasons.

## Dose reductions:

Dose reductions were not allowed for nivolumab-treated patients. Those patients experiencing any grade 4 toxicity were to discontinue nivolumab permanently.  In the docetaxel group, 25.7% of subjects required a dose reduction, most of which were due to AEs (89.6%).

MedRA Versicn:

Source: Refer to TableS.6.5ofCA209057FinalCSR

CTC Versicn 4.0 Includes events reported between first doee and 30 days after last dose of studly therapy.

## Selected AEs

In  order  to  characterise  AEs  of  special  clinical  interest  that  are  potentially  associated  with  the  use  of nivolumab, the applicant identified AEs based on the following 4 guiding principles:

- AEs that may differ in type, frequency, or severity from AEs caused by non-immunotherapies
- AEs that may require immunosuppression (e.g., corticosteroids) as part of their management
- AEs whose early recognition and management may mitigate severe toxicity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- AEs  for  which  multiple  event  terms  may  be  used  to  describe  a  single  type  of  AE,  thereby necessitating the pooling of terms for full characterization.

## Endocrine Events

The endocrine select AE category included the following subcategories: adrenal disorders, diabetes, pituitary disorders, and thyroid disorders.

In the nivolumab group the median time to onset for any grade drug-related endocrine select AE was 12.1 weeks. Twelve of the 27 subjects (44.4%) with endocrine AEs had resolution of their events. Most AEs belonging to the endocrine select AE category had not yet resolved (median time to resolution not reached) since some events, though well-controlled with hormone replacement therapy, were not considered resolved due to the continuing for replacement therapy.

In the pooled data of patients treated with nivolumab monotherapy (including completed melanoma and NSCLC studies), the incidence of thyroid disorders was 8.7% (115/1322). Grade 2 and Grade 3 thyroid disorders were reported in 5.1% (67/1322) and &lt;0.1% (1/1322) of patients, respectively. Grade 2 and Grade 3 hypophysitis occurred in &lt;0.1% (1/1322) and 0.2% (2/1322) of patients, respectively. Grade 2 and Grade 3 adrenal insufficiency each occurred in 0.2% (2/1322). Diabetes mellitus (Grade 2), and diabetic ketoacidosis (Grade 3) were each reported in&lt;0.1% (1/1322) of patients. No Grade 4 or 5 endocrinopathies were reported. Median time to onset of these endocrinopathies was 2.8 months (range: 0.4-13.4). One patient (&lt;0.1%) with Grade 3 adrenal insufficiency required discontinuation of nivolumab. Eight patients received high dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents) at median initial dose of 0.9 mg/kg (range: 0.5-1.3) for a median duration of 2.4 weeks (range: 0.6-4.9). Resolution occurred in 60 patients (48.4%) with a median time to resolution of 26.1 weeks (range: 0.4-94.1).

## Gastrointestinal Events

The  GI  select  AE  category  included  the  following  terms:  colitis,  colitis  ulcerative,  diarrhoea,  enteritis, enterocolitis, frequent bowel movements, and GI perforation.

In the nivolumab group, the median time to onset for any grade drug-related GI select AE was 4.7 weeks. The median time to onset of the Grade 3 drug-related events (in 2 subjects) was 11.7 weeks. The median time to resolution for any grade drug-related GI select AEs was 1.5 weeks.

In the pooled safety data, the incidence of rash was 29.0% (383/1322). Grade 2 and Grade 3 cases were reported in 5.1% (68/1322) and 1.0% (13/1322) of patients, respectively. No Grade 4 or 5 cases were reported. Median time to onset was 1.4 months (range: 0.0-15.3). Four patients (0.3%) required permanent discontinuation  of  nivolumab.  Sixteen  patients  received  high-dose  corticosteroids  (at  least  40  mg prednisone equivalents) at a median initial dose of 0.9 mg/kg (range: 0.4-2.7) for a median duration of 2.1 weeks (range: 0.1-38.7). Resolution occurred in 220 patients (58%) with a median time to resolution of 18.0 weeks (range: 0.1-97.3).

## Hypersensitivity/Infusion Reactions

Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions included the following terms: anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, bronchospasm, hypersensitivity, and infusion-related reaction.

In  the  nivolumab  group,  the  median  time  to  onset  of  any  grade  drug-related  hypersensitivity/infusion reaction was 0.93 weeks. The median time to resolution of any grade drug-related hypersensitivity/infusion reaction was 0.14 weeks.

In  the  pooled  safety  data,  the  incidence  of  hypersensitivity/infusion  reactions,  including  anaphylactic reaction, was 3.8% (50/1322). Grade 2, Grade 3, and Grade 4 cases were reported in 1.5% (20/1322), 0.2% (3/1322), and &lt;0.1% (1/1322) of patients, respectively. No Grade 5 cases were reported.

## Adverse drug reactions

Safety data to support Section 4.8 of the SmPC were pooled across completed studies in multiple indications using the intended dose and regimen for nivolumab monotherapy. The studies included in the analyses for nivolumab monotherapy (3 mg/kg Q2W) were as follows: three studies in NSCLC (CA209057, CA209017, and  CA209063)  and  three  studies  in  melanoma  (CA209037,  CA209066,  and  CA209067  [monotherapy arm]).

The general safety profile in the pooled monotherapy data across indications is consistent with the safety reported for each indication.

The studies used for the pooling of safety data are summarized in the table below.

Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy in the different indications is consistent.

In general, the type, frequency, and severity of AEs were consistent across tumour types.

Exposure-adjusted  AE  incidence  rates  (events  per  100  person-years  of  exposure)  were  1747.7  in melanoma, and 1795.6 in NSCLC.

The table below summarises all ADRs listed in section 4.8 together with frequency based on the pooled safety dataset.

a 1ceath was attributed to nivolumeb （enceghalitis); association tonivolumab was changed after databaselock

Sme:RefeytnTahlR.2-1nfm2n9n57Fina1CSR

Grade 5 events were more frequent in the nivolumab group mainly due to more grade 5 SAEs of malignant progression (3.8% vs 2.2% respectively).

One death in the nivolumab group (encephalitis) and two deaths in the docetaxel group (1 due febrile neutropenia, 1 due to interstitial lung disease) were assessed as related to study drug. The death in the nivolumab group, although reported prior to database lock, had its association with nivolumab changed after database lock.

## Laboratory findings

## Haematology

Abnormalities in haematology tests performed during treatment or within 30 days of last treatment dose were primarily Grade 1-2 in the nivolumab group. The only Grade 3-4 hematologic abnormality reported in ≥5% of subjects in the nivolumab group was absolute lymphocyte decrease (12.2% Grade 3, 1.0% Grade 4). In the docetaxel group, the majority of hematologic abnormalities in haemoglobin, platelet count, and absolute lymphocyte count were Grade 1-2, while the majority of abnormalities in leukocytes and absolute neutrophil  count  were  Grade  3-4.  Grade  3  and  4  hematologic  abnormalities  were  reported  in  ≥5%  of subjects in the docetaxel group in all the hematologic tests monitored except Grade 4 absolute lymphocyte count and Grade 3-4 platelet count.

A higher number of subjects in the docetaxel group experienced a ≥2-grade shift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality.

## Serum Chemistry

## Hepatic parameters

In the nivolumab group, abnormalities in hepatic parameters (all increases) were primarily Grade 1-2, with Grade  3-4  abnormalities  reported  in  ≥2%  of  subjects  limited  to  AST  (2.8%)  and  ALT  (2.4%).  In  the docetaxel group, abnormalities in hepatic parameters (all increases) were primarily Grade 1-2, and no Grade 3-4 hepatic parameter abnormalities were reported in ≥2% of subjects in the docetaxel group.

The number of subjects who experienced a ≥2-grade shift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality in either treatment group was low.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal parameters

In the nivolumab group, any reported abnormalities in creatinine (increases) were primarily Grade 1 or 2. There were no Grade 3-4 abnormalities in creatinine in the  nivolumab group.  In the docetaxel group, abnormalities in creatinine were also primarily Grade 1-2, with the exception of 1 Grade 3 abnormality. There were no Grade 4 creatinine abnormalities reported in either treatment group.

## Thyroid function tests

The proportion of subjects with elevated TSH &gt; ULN who had TSH ≤ ULN at baseline was greater in the nivolumab group compared to the docetaxel group (16.7% and 5.3%, respectively). The proportion of subjects with at least 1 TSH &gt; ULN and at least 1 FT3/FT4 value &lt; LLN was greater in the nivolumab group (12.0%)  compared  to  the  docetaxel  group  (2.4%).  No  meaningful  differences  were  noted  between treatment groups for subjects with on-treatment TSH &lt; LLN who had TSH ≥ LLN at baseline.

## Electrolytes

Abnormalities in electrolytes were primarily Grade 1 to 2 in severity.

- In  the  nivolumab  group,  Grade  3-4  abnormalities  in  electrolyte  levels  were  reported  for hyponatremia (21 subjects, 7.3%), hyperkalaemia (5 subjects, 1.7%), hypokalaemia (4 subjects, 1.4%), hypomagnesemia (4 subjects, 1.4%), hypercalcemia (2 subjects, 0.7%), and hypermagnesaemia (2 subjects, 0.7%); no Grade 3-4 abnormalities were reported forhypocalcaemia or hypernatremia.
- In  the  docetaxel  group,  Grade  3-4  abnormalities  were  reported  for  hyponatremia  (9  subjects, 3.4%), hypokalaemia (7 subjects, 2.7%), hypermagnesaemia (2 subjects, 0.8%), hypomagnesemia  (2  subjects,  0.8%),  and  hyperkalaemia  (2  subjects,  0.8%);  no  Grade  3-4 abnormalities were reported for hypercalcemia, hypocalcaemia, and hypernatremia.

## Vital signs

In CA209057, vital signs were monitored and recorded at the site during each treatment infusion. Review of vital signs identified no safety concerns.

## Pooled safety data

In patients treated with nivolumab monotherapy, the proportion of patients who experienced a worsening from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was as follows: 3.2% for anaemia (all Grade 3), 0.4% for thrombocytopenia, 8.1% for lymphopenia, 0.7% for neutropenia, 1.6% for increased alkaline phosphatase, 2.7% for increased AST, 2.1% for increased ALT, 1.2% for increased total bilirubin, 0.4% for increased creatinine, 1.9% for increased amylase, 8.3% for increased lipase, 6% for hyponatremia, 1.7% for hyperkalaemia, 1.5% for hypokalaemia, 0.8% for hypercalcemia, 0.7% for hypermagnesemia, 0.6% for hypomagnesemia, 0.6% for hypocalcaemia, 0.6% for leukopenia, and &lt;0.1% for hypernatremia.

## Safety in special populations

In CA209057, the frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the nivolumab group for subgroups of gender, race, age, and region were similar to the AE frequencies in the overall treated population.

## Age

Summaries of on-treatment adverse events by age subgroups (≥65 to &lt;75, ≥75 to &lt;85, and ≥85 years of age) are provided for the non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSQ NSCLC) population (CA209057) in the table below. There is no safety data presented for the ≥85 years age group as there were no subjects in that age group treated with nivolumab in the CA209057 study.

Of the 3 subjects with neutralizing ADA samples, only 1 subject had drug-related AEs reported (Grade 1 goiter and thyroiditis, Grade 2 hypothyroidism and adenoviral conjunctivitis), which occurred after the neutralizing ADA sample (Day 98 vs. Day 29), and no SAEs were reported. A total of 8 nivolumab subjects experienced hypersensitivity/infusion site reactions in this study, and the ADA status of 6 of those subjects was negative.

Of the 1037 patients who were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and evaluable for the presence of anti-product-antibodies, 128 patients (12.3%) tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-product-antibodies by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay. Nine patients (0.9%) had neutralising antibodies. There was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile, or toxicity profile associated with anti-product-antibody development based on the pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analyses. Neutralizing antibodies were not associated with loss of efficacy (see section 4.8 of the SmPC).

## Integrated analyses of the overall safety profile in the NSCLC population

Pooling of the safety data across NSCLC studies (NSQ and SQ) was conducted to provide a larger sample size.

Table 56: Safety presentation for NSCLC pooled populations

| Study     | CA209057+CA209017   | CA209057+CA209017   | CA209057+CA209017+CA209063   |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Treatment | Docetaxel           | Nivolumab           | Nivolumab                    |
| Treated   | N=397               | N=418               | N=535                        |

The pooled safety data for NSCLC populations indicated a safety profile that was consistent with previous findings and did not significantly alter the frequencies, types, and severity of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and select AEs for both all causality and drug-related events.

The NSQ-NSCLC population and the SQ-NSCLC population showed a comparable incidence of adverse events (97.6% vs. 96.9%), serious adverse events (46.7% vs. 46.6%). However, the NSQ-NSCLC showed a higher incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of the study (16.7% vs. 10.7%) and the overall incidence of select AEs (75% vs.54.4%).

Both populations reported the same most frequently AE's: fatigue, decreased appetite, and cough. The most reported drug related AE's were fatigue, nausea and decreased appetite.

The NSQ-NSCLC population reported a higher incidence of pulmonary embolism (4.2 % vs. 1.5 %); grade 3-4 AEs (3.1% vs. 1.5%), SAE pulmonary embolism (3.8 % vs. 1.5%). The NSQ-NSCLC reported 2 deaths possibly related to pulmonary embolism within 10 days of drug administration, with no such deaths reported in the nivolumab SQ-NSCLC population. Although the association between thromboembolism and lung

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cancer adenocarcinoma is higher than squamous cell carcinoma, the concern is raised that nivolumab might be associated with a more severe risk of embolism in the NSQ-NSCLC. This observation is supported by the lower incidence of reported pulmonary embolism in the comparable docetaxel NSQ-NSCLC population.

The overall incidence of select drug related adverse events is for the NSQ-NSCLC population higher than for the SQ-NSCLC population 48.8% vs 31.5%, including a higher incidence of grade 3-4 AEs: 3.8% vs. 2.4%. No grade 5 select adverse events were reported.

The NSQ-NSCLC population showed a higher incidence of drug-related endocrine-related adverse events (9.4%), hepatic events (5.2 %), skin related events (17.8%) and hypersensitivity events (2.8%). The reported incidence in the SQ population was 3.8%, 1.5%, 4.6%. 9.2% and 0.8% respectively. Noticeable differences were observed for the select endocrine AE hypothyroidism (9.4% vs. 3.8%) and rash (9.4% vs. 3.8%).

The incidence (of gastrointestinal (7.7% vs. 8.4%) and renal AE 2.4% vs. 3.1%) was comparable, the pulmonary drug related AE lower (3.5% vs. 4.6 %).

The NSQ-NSCLC population showed a higher incidence than the SQ-NSCLC population for the grade 3-4 AE for the hepatic (1.0% vs. 0%), pulmonary (1.4% vs. 0%), and skin related (0.7 vs. 0) select AEs. Both populations did not report grade 3-5 drug related endocrine or hypersensitivity AE's.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

For the purpose this variation, the population from study CA209057 is considered the main safety dataset.

The pivotal study had an open label design, which might be vulnerable to allocation bias of treatment related adverse events. Therefore, more weight is given to the comparison of the all-causality adverse events.

The main reason for discontinuation in both groups was (clinical/radiological) disease progression. The proportion of patients discontinuing due to AEs was in general low in both treatment groups, with a higher percentage of patients discontinuing in the docetaxel group (5.9% vs. 15.7% in the nivolumab and docetaxel groups, respectively).

The mean duration of study therapy was slightly higher for the nivolumab group than the docetaxel group (2.6 months vs. 2.3 months, respectively), with a relative dose intensity of 82.6% and 65.7%, respectively.

The majority of patients (&gt;90%) in both groups did not require an infusion interruption or infusion rate decreased. Cycle delays were reported by 39.0% of nivolumab patients and 36.9% of docetaxel patients. In terms of dose delays, cycles delayed ≥4 days were more frequently reported for docetaxel than nivolumab (53.4% vs. 67.3%).The most common reason for the delay was 'other reasons' (approximately 52% in both groups), followed by AE (approximately 45% in both groups). The category 'other reasons' includes a heterogeneous group of administrative/personal reasons (which account for approximately half of them), along with other clinical or disease-related reasons.

The most common treatment-related AEs for the nivolumab-treated patients were: fatigue (16%), nausea (11%), decreased appetite (10.5%), asthenia (10.1%) and rash (9.4%). Most of them were mild-moderate in severity. In the docetaxel-treated patients, the most common treatment-related AEs were consistent with that already known for docetaxel.  In both treatment groups, frequencies of all causality AEs followed similar trends to those observed for treatment-related AEs.

In nivolumab subjects, selected AEs were more frequently reported in the skin and GI SOCs, and most of them were mild-moderate in severity. In general, the observed profile of selected AEs does not differ from that observed in the SQ NSCLC indication.

In the pulmonary drug-related selected AEs, more nivolumab patients experienced pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease (n=10), compared to docetaxel (n=2). This imbalance was previously observed in the SQ-NSCLC and a warning is currently included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Four out of the 10 cases were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

grade 3-4, and 8 of the cases (including all grade 3-4 events) required corrective treatment with immune-modulating drugs. At the time of the data cut-off, 8 out of the 10 cases had reported the event as solved.

The MAH also compared the exposure adjusted rate of pulmonary embolism between nivolumab and docetaxel (7.7 vs. 6.3 per 100 patient-years). In addition, the background incidence of pulmonary embolism in lung cancer is 16.5-18/100 patient-years, which is higher than observed in the study. Pulmonary embolism will be monitored as a routine pharmacovigilance.

Skin selected AEs were reported in 26.5% of patients (n=76). Most of them were mild-moderate in severity and no grade 4-5 events were reported in this category. Regarding toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) cases, the MAH stated that 3 cases of fatal TEN were reported during on-going routine pharmacovigilance. This type of events has been evaluated in a safety variation (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0004 adopted on 17 December 2015) and sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC had been updated.

Most drug related select adverse events were grade 1-2 and most events resolved. At the time of database lock, both populations showed a comparable incidence of unresolved drug related select adverse events (NQ-NSCLC population 13%, SQ-NSCLC population 15%).

The frequency of SAEs (all causalities) was slightly higher for nivolumab than docetaxel, with a similar percentage of G3-4 events. In the nivolumab group, respiratory disorders were the most frequently reported SAEs, which can be expected due to the location of the primary tumour. The second most frequently reported SOC was neoplasms including 8% of patients reporting a disease progression SAE (compared to 2.6% in the docetaxel group). Patients treated in the docetaxel group experienced more frequent SAEs in the blood/lymphatic disorders and infections/infestations SOCs (mostly grade 3-4 events).

The most common primary reason for death was 'disease progression' in both treatment groups (54.7% vs. 66.8%, for nivolumab and docetaxel, respectively. Deaths due to drug toxicity were infrequent in both groups (1 [&lt;1%] in each group), which is at least reassuring. The risk of nivolumab related toxic death therefore appears to be low.

AEs leading to discontinuation (all causality) were more frequently reported in docetaxel than nivolumab patients with a slightly higher % of grade 3-4 AEs in the nivolumab group. The most frequent AE leading to discontinuation in docetaxel patients was fatigue, while in nivolumab patients the most frequent was malignant neoplasm progression.

In terms of drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation, similar trends can be observed for the docetaxel group. In the nivolumab group, the most frequently reported drug-related AE leading to discontinuation was pneumonitis (in 3 patients). The low numbers reported in some of the SOC hamper reaching a conclusion.

In general the safety profile of patients &lt;65 and those 65-74 years old seems comparable, with few minor differences. Information provided for the patients over the age of 74 does not show any alarming data, but the reduced number of patients does not allow reaching a conclusion (see section 4.8 of the SmPC).

Patients with pre-established renal/hepatic failure were not explicitly excluded from the pivotal study. Safety results do not suggest a negative impact due to renal impairment. The safety profile of nivolumab seems less favourable in patients with hepatic impairment (in comparison with the overall population) however these results need to be taken cautiously due to the small sample size. This has been reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

In general, no large differences can be observed in terms of AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation according to PD-L1 status. The main difference observed is a higher number of grade 5 events in the ≥1% PD-L1 expression group (none of them were considered drug-related). The significance of this finding is unknown.

Criteria for endocrinopathy treatment modification were amended in the SmPC to provide clear guidance to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

physicians including more conservative discontinuation criteria for adrenal insufficiency. Each of Grade 4 endocrinopathy events has been added for completeness as a criterion for permanent discontinuation (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC).

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for an immune response to nivolumab. In an integrated analysis of nivolumab immunogenicity assessments, the overall rate of ADA development in the assessed population is low given the low percentage of ADA positive subjects, low titers in positive subjects, very low number of subjects categorized as persistent positive and very low number of subjects positive for neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, no association was established between the presence of neutralizing antibodies and loss of efficacy.

Based on a cross comparison with the SQ-NSCLC dossier, the safety profile of nivolumab might be more favourable in the SQ-NSCLC population compared with the NSQ-NSCLC population. The current NSQ-NSCSL showed a higher incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of the study (16.7% vs. 10.7%) and the overall incidence of select AEs (75% vs. 54.4%).

The NSQ-NSCLC population reported a higher incidence of select adverse events including a higher frequency of Grade 3-4 pneumonitis than the SQ-NSCLC population. The potential contribution of nivolumab to more severe pulmonary embolism in the NSQ-NSCLC population was discussed during the assessment. The exposure-adjusted data and the risk for pulmonary embolism did not seem to be increased. However, these observations need to be taken cautiously due to the small numbers.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

The safety profile of nivolumab in patients with non-SQ NSCLC seems to be largely consistent with that previously observed in SQ-NSCLC patients. No new safety signals have been identified.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to the higher number of deaths within 3 months observed with nivolumab compared to docetaxel in non-squamous NSCLC has been added to the product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to align the annexes with the latest QRD template version 9.1 and to implement minor editorial changes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable as the changes introduced are not considered to substantially impact the readability of the package leaflet.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The efficacy of Opdivo in the treatment of advanced non-squamous NSCLC after prior chemotherapy in adults is based on a single pivotal study (CA209057). At the time of the analysis, the minimum follow-up time was 13.2 months.

Results from the study revealed a median overall survival of 12.19 months (95%CI: 9.66, 14.98) for the nivolumab group and 9.36 months for the docetaxel group (95%CI: 8.05, 10.68). The OS rate at 12 months was 50.5% (95% CI: 44.6, 56.1) for nivolumab, in comparison to 39.0% (95% CI: 33.3, 44.6) for docetaxel.

This effect was further supported by the results of the key secondary efficacy endpoint: ORR 19.2 % (95% CI: 14.8, 24.2) for nivolumab and 12.4% (95% CI: 8.8, 16.8) for docetaxel (odds ratio estimate 1.68 (95% CI: 1.07, 2.64, p 0.0246). Results obtained for other secondary efficacy endpoints (TTR and DOR) were also supportive. The majority of pre-specified subgroup analyses also showed statistically significant results.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The survival curve for nivolumab is lower than that for docetaxel in the first 6 months, indicating a higher frequency of deaths in the nivolumab group. A multivariate analysis suggests an association between early death and low PD-L1 expression, ECOG score 1, time since last therapy &lt; 3 months and 'progressive disease' as best response to prior therapy. These analyses indicate that poorer prognostic features and/or aggressive disease, in combination with no/low PD-L1 expression, characterise patients treated with nivolumab with higher potential for death within the first 3 months, compared to docetaxel.

There seems to be a negative association between nivolumab benefit and level of PD-L1 expression. Accordingly, the OS difference compared to docetaxel seems to decrease or disappear with lower PD-L1 expression. This is different to the previous melanoma and SQ-NSCLC indications, in which a benefit of nivolumab was seen for both patients with PD-L1 positive and negative tumours. Also, analyses were not consistent across different efficacy endpoints. However, these findings need confirmation and estimation of a cut-off point for PD-L1 expression in tumours cannot be established with the analyses presented. A number of biomarker investigations will be conducted by the MAH to address this issue (see Annex II condition).

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The most common treatment-related AEs for the nivolumab-treated patients in the pivotal study were: fatigue (16%), nausea (11%), decreased appetite (10.5%), asthenia (10.1%) and rash (9.4%). Most of them were mild-moderate in severity. In nivolumab subjects, immune-related AEs were more frequently reported in the skin (26.5% patients) and GI (15.7% patients) SOCs, and most of them were mild-moderate severity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The frequency of SAEs (all causalities) was slightly higher for nivolumab than docetaxel (46.7% vs. 41.4%, respectively), with a similar percentage of G3-4 events (33.1% vs. 34.0%, respectively).

At the time of the data cut- off, 64.5% and 76.1% of patients in the nivolumab and docetaxel groups, respectively, had died. The most common primary reason for death was 'disease progression' in both treatment groups (54.7% vs. 66.8%, for nivolumab and docetaxel, respectively). Grade 5 (All causality) AEs were more frequent in the nivolumab group (n=23, 8.0%) than docetaxel (n=14, 5.2%), but deaths due to drug toxicity were infrequent in both groups (1 [&lt;1%] in each group).

In general, the observed profile of selected AEs does not differ largely from that observed in the SQ NSCLC indication.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

An unexpected higher frequency of malignant neoplasm progression as SAE has been reported for nivolumab treated patients in the CA209057 study (8% vs. 2.6%, for nivolumab vs. docetaxel, respectively).

Nivolumab also noted more cases of other malignant neoplasms (n=5) compared to docetaxel (n=0).

Nivolumab showed a higher incidence of pulmonary embolism, (4.2%) compared with docetaxel (2.1%) with more serious events (3.8% vs. 1.1%) and reported deaths (n=4) than the docetaxel group (n=1). However, the numbers were too low to be conclusive and these events will be monitored via routine pharmacovigilance.

The inclusion of elderly (&gt;75 years) patients was limited to 43 (7%) patients, with no patients over the age of 84 receiving treatment with nivolumab. Although no new safety signals has been identified in elderly patients, the data in patients &gt;75 years is considered too limited to draw any conclusion.

Safety data in patients with renal/hepatic impairment is limited (see sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC).

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The data on nivolumab in the pivotal study showed an overall clinically relevant improvement with difference in median OS of 2.8 months in the overall survival compared to docetaxel as second line treatment in an overall population of NSQ-NSCLC showing progressive disease. The safety profiles of nivolumab and docetaxel are different but comparable in terms of tolerability. The overall incidences of adverse events, serious adverse events and events leading to discontinuation were relatively similar. However, a higher rate of pneumonitis and pulmonary embolism was reported. Nivolumab showed a low number of toxic deaths (n=5, including four possible associated cased of pulmonary embolism). Nivolumab's toxicity appears to be manageable. The safety profile is not associated with the well-known toxic effects of chemotherapy and this might be of specific benefit for patients showing sequelae after first line chemotherapy.

## Benefit-risk balance

Nivolumab showed a clinically relevant improvement in overall survival compared to docetaxel for the whole population, which is considered clinically relevant.

From a safety point of view, treatment appears well tolerated and the different AEs profile appears to be manageable in a clinical practice setting. No new safety findings were identified in the data submitted.

The benefit risk balance is therefore considered positive.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The beneficial results seemed to be related to the level of expression of the baseline PD-L1 receptor. Nivolumab showed a higher ORR and higher improvement in OS in patients with a high baseline PD-L1 expression value.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients with low PD-L1 expression level, the overall survival was comparable to docetaxel. Nivolumab could therefore represent an alternative treatment option because of its different safety profile.

Multivariate analysis suggested an association between early death (within the first 3 months) and poorer prognostic features and/or aggressive disease, no/low PD-L1 expression, ECOG score 1, time since last therapy &lt; 3 months and 'progressive disease' as best response to prior therapy. It is reasonable to assume that patients with a poor prognosis and a more aggressive disease would benefit less taking into account the delayed effect of immunotherapy on OS.

Several uncertainties regarding PD-L1 assay validity and availability in 'real-life' setting remain and should be addressed by the MAH (see Annex II condition). A number of investigations to clarify the role of this biomarker are ongoing.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I, II, IIIA and IIIB |

Extension of Indication to include treatment as monotherapy of locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC after prior chemotherapy in adults based on study CA209057. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Further, SmPC section 4.8 has been revised with updated combined clinical trial exposure numbers to reflect inclusion of studies in non-squamous NSCLC and in advanced melanoma. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to align the annexes with the latest QRD template version 9.1, to update the agreed post-authorisation measures in Annex II and to implement minor editorial changes. A revised RMP version 4.2 was agreed during the procedure.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following amended conditions:

| 4. The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of nivolumab should be further explored, specifically: • To continue the exploration of the optimal cut-off for PD-L1 positivity based on current assay method used to further elucidate its value as predictive of nivolumab efficacy. These analyses will be conducted in studies CA209037 and CA209066 in patients with advanced melanoma. • To further investigate the value of biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status at tumour cell membrane level by IHC (e.g., other methods / assays, and associated cut-offs, that might prove more sensitive and specific in predicting response to treatment based on PD-L1, PD-L2, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes with measurement of CD8+T density, RNA signature, etc.) as predictive of nivolumab efficacy. This will be provided for all the approved indications: - Melanoma: studies CA209038 and CA209066 - NSCLC: studies CA209017, CA209057 and CA209026 - RCC: studies CA209025 and CA209009 • To further investigate the relation between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in Phase 1 studies (CA209009, CA209038 and CA209064). • To further investigate the associative analyses between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression conducted in studies CA209066, CA209057 and CA209025. • To further investigate the possible change in PD-L1 status of the tumour during treatment and/or tumour progression in studies | 30 th September 2015 30 th September 2017 31 st March 2018 31 st March 2018 31 st March 2017 30th June 2018 30 th September 2017 |
