## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

Aliskiren  is  an  anti-hypertensive  agent,  which  acts  by  inhibiting  the  enzyme  renin  to  block  the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, the precursor of angiotensin II. Aliskiren (Rasilez) at once  daily  doses  of  150  and  300  mg  was  approved  in  the  EU  on  22  August  2007,  for  use  as monotherapy,  or  in  combination  with  other  anti-hypertensive  agents,  for  the  treatment  of  mild  to moderate hypertension.

On  13  April  2011,  the  fixed  dose  combination  aliskiren/hydrochlorothiazide  (Riprazo  HCT),  was authorised in the EU for the treatment of essential hypertension in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on aliskiren or hydrochlorothiazide used alone, and as substitution therapy in patients adequately controlled with aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide, given concurrently, at the same dose level as in the combination. The approved dosages are: 150/12.5 mg, 150/25 mg, 300/12.5 mg, 300/25 mg. Rasilamlo,  the  fixed  dose  combination  of  aliskiren  and  amlodipine  (150/5mg;  150/10mg;  300/5  mg 300/10mg) was authorised in the EU on 14 April 2011 for the treatment of essential hypertension in adult  patients  whose  blood  pressure  is  not  adequately  controlled  with  aliskiren  or  amlodipine  used alone. A type II variation was approved to remove the contraindication against concomitant use of verapamil and aliskiren from the Summary of Product Characteristics of Rasilez and RasilezHCT (II/41 and II/05G, approved in March 2011) and to include a statement with regard to potential for interaction with organic anionic transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors and with rifampicin. Corresponding amendments  were  also  introduced  into  the  Patient  leaflet.  The  present  variation  application  is submitted  to  introduce  the  same  changes  to  the  Product  Information  for  all  aliskiren-containing medicinal products. The rationale for the removal of the verapamil contraindication was based largely upon the results of clinical study CSPP100A2111, herein assessed. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Based on preclinical data, it is known that P-gp is a major determinant of aliskiren bioavailability. A number of interactions studies have been conducted between aliskiren and inhibitors of P-gp, including cyclosporine,  ketoconazole  and  atorvastatin  and  the  results  are  described  in  the  SmPC.  The  clinical study CSPP100A2111 was conducted to explore the pharmacokinetic interaction between aliskiren and verapamil  in  healthy  volunteers.  The  results  of  the  study  were  submitted  to  CHMP  as  a  follow  up measure for Rasilez in April 2009.

With this variation the MAH is fulfilling the FUM001 for RiprazoHCT and SprimeoHCT.

The  changes  to  the  PI  as  proposed  by  the  MAH  in  section  9  of  this  AR  and  are  identical  to  those approved for Rasilez and RasilezHCT:

## The  original  assessment  of  variation  II/41  and  II/05  is  reported  below,  including  all evaluation waves.

On 24 July 2008, the Variation Application Rasilez II/26 was approved by the CHMP in order to update the  SmPC  on  the  basis  of  results  from  a  recently  completed  drug-drug  interaction  study  with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ciclosporin  A  (SPP100A2106).  During  the  assessment  the  CHMP  requested  a  contraindication  with regard to concomitant use of aliskiren and the highly potent P-gp inhibitor ciclosporin and other potent P-gp  inhibitors  (verapamil,  quinidine).  Further  revisions  have  been  also  introduced  related  to  SmPC section 4.4 and the re-structuring of section 4.5. However, the adoption was accompanied by a list of follow-up  measures  to  be  fulfilled  post-authorisation.  Among  these,  FUM  015  (non  clinical)  was  the following:

'To provide additional preclinical data evaluating the potential mechanism of the ciclosporin interaction with aliskiren. If the interaction with ciclosporin cannot be attributed to P-gp only, further investigation of transporters will be carried out.

The  pre-clinical  studies  should  clarify  the  effect  of  P-gp  inhibition  on  aliskiren  PK,  including  tissue distribution. Because the effect of ciclosporin may also be mediated by mechanisms other than P-gp inhibition,  non  clinical  data  on  aliskiren  tissue  distribution  in  experimental  models  in  which  P-gp  is absent (as the mdr-deficient mice) should be provided. The mechanism by which ciclosporin and other Pgp  inhibitors  inhibit  aliskiren  clearance  may  be  investigated  by  using  the  same  model  (i.e.,  by investigating the effect of ciclosporin both in the mdr-deficient and wild-type mice)'.

The Rapporteur considered that the variation could be approvable provided that the MAH adequately addressed  the  2 nd Request  of  Supplementary  Information,  which  was  the  following: 'Available  data convincingly demonstrate that P-gp inhibitors do not increase aliskiren distribution to the brain. Yet, these  data  do  not  allow  to  clarify  whether  or  not  verapamil  may  cause  an  increase  in  aliskiren distribution  to  tissues,  and  particularly  those  from  which  aliskiren  is  normally  excluded.  Therefore, available  non  clinical  and  clinical  data  may  not  be  sufficiently  predictive  of  toxicity  arising  from  the presence  of  aliskiren  in  these  tissues,  when  aliskiren  is  co-administered  with  verapamil.  The  MAH should consider performing a non clinical study investigating the effect of verapamil on the distribution of aliskiren to all the organs and tissues examined in a thorough distribution study and address the possible toxicological consequences of an altered distribution'.

The MAH had already provided the study report of the pre-clinical study (DMPK R0700870: Distribution of SPP100 after single oral administration (15 mg free base/kg) of SPP100 hemifumarate to rats with or without  co-administration  of  ciclosporin  A')  required  by  the  Follow  Up  Measure  016:  'To  conduct  a study to investigate the effect of P-gp on the tissue distribution of aliskiren'. The  MAH  subsequently  submitted  the  data  of  the  non  clinical  study  ' Pharmacokinetics  and  tissue distribution after oral administration of 100 mg/kg aliskiren to mdr1a/1b deficient and wild type mice Effect of ciclosporin and ketoconazole (DMPK R0900355)' (for conclusive fulfilment of FUM 015). Based on  the  data  of  this  study,  the  MAH  proposed  to  eliminate  the  Contraindication  (SmPC  4.3)  for  the concomitant use of aliskiren + verapamil and to add a Special warning (SmPC 4.4) for the concomitant use. In addition, the MAH proposed to amend the text of Section 4.4. and 4.5 in order to reflect the potential for interaction of aliskiren with verapamil, and the impact of Pgp inhibition on the distribution of aliskiren. The proposed variation applied to both aliskiren (Rasilez) and aliskiren/HCTZ (Rasilez HCT) product information (see concomitant RasilezHCT II/05 AR). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The MAH has not performed any further study but has provided a response based on the discussion on previously submitted data and literature data.

| Variation(s) requested   | Type   |
|--------------------------|--------|
| C.I.4                    | II     |

This type II variation relates to the following changes: Update of section 4.3 of the Summary Product Characteristics (SmPC) to remove verapamil from the contraindications, and sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC, following the CHMP assessment of the data regarding the potential for interaction of aliskiren with verapamil, and the impact of Pgp inhibition on the distribution of aliskiren. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, MAH took opportunity to update the contact details of local representatives in the PIL for Riprazo, Sprimeo and Riprazo HCT. This application is submitted in fulfilment of the FUM001 for Riprazo HCT and Sprimeo HCT. 1.2. Non-clinical aspects Rationale for proposed changes Non clinical data showed that PSC833 (an inhibitor of Mdr1 and Mrp2) dramatically decreased biliary clearance  of  aliskiren.  The  results  of  the  ciclosporin-aliskiren  drug-drug  interaction  study  in  healthy subjects  showed  that  ciclosporin  markedly  increased  aliskiren  AUC  while  decreasing  its  clearance. Taken  together  these  data  suggest  that  P-gp  is  a  major  determinant  of  aliskiren  absorption  and elimination. However,  the  effect  of  ciclosporin  may  also  be  due  to  the  inhibition  of  liver  uptake  transporters. Therefore, the CHMP's evaluation was that a DDI study with verapamil would help clarifying the effects of  P-gp  inhibitors  on  aliskiren  PK.  The  MAH  provided  the  results  of  a  DDI  study  with  verapamil  at steady-state. These data showed that verapamil increased aliskiren Cmax and AUC by ~2-fold. The effect  of  verapamil  was  consistent  with  that  of  other  moderate  P-gp  inhibitors,  ketoconazole  (which increased aliskiren steady-state Cmax and AUC by ~80%) and atorvastatin (50% increase in aliskiren Cmax and AUC). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Yet, the contraindication for the co-administration with potent P-gp inhibitors such as verapamil was mainly based on concerns about the possible enhancement of tissue penetration due to P-gp inhibition.

A first non clinical study was submitted by the MAH with the aim of clarifying the effect of ciclosporin on distribution to tissues and particularly to the brain, from which aliskiren is normally excluded (study DMPK  R0700870: Distribution  of  SPP100  after  single  oral  administration  (15  mg  free  base/kg)  of SPP100 hemifumarate to rats with or without co-administration of ciclosporin A', required by the FUM 016). The study was carried out in rats. The results of the study showed that when ciclosporin was coadministered with aliskiren, the drug distributed to all tissues (but not to brain and spinal chord) from which it is normally excluded (after a single dose), such as bone marrow, eye (choroid), thyroid gland.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Notably, ciclosporin only caused a 2-fold increase in blood levels but a much greater increase in several tissues  (  100-fold  in  liver,  10-fold  in  kidney,  20-fold  in  salivary  gland).  The  increase  of  the tissue/blood ratios of concentrations suggested that ciclosporin inhibits a transporter-mediated efflux of  aliskiren.  Yet,  this  transporter  has  not  been  identified  and  the  mechanism  of  the  increase  in exposure elicited by ciclosporin is still unknown. Moreover, the absence of aliskiren in the brain in the ciclosporin  group could be due to too low ciclosporin concentrations at the blood brain barrier, as a consequence of the administration route chosen (oral administration).

The MAH has now submitted the results of a study carried out using the mdr -deficient mice model in order to clarify:

1) the effect of P-gp inhibition on tissue distribution, particularly to the brain;

2) whether the effect of ciclosporin is due only to P-gp inhibition or may involve other mechanisms. The effect of ketoconazole on aliskiren PK in wild type and P-gp knockout mice was also investigated.

Test compound as well the inhibitor compounds were administered orally by gavage. Co-administration of  vehicle  or  (inhibitor)  compound  solution  was  done  30  min  before  administration  of  the  aliskiren solution.  The  doses  of  ciclosporin  and  ketoconazole  were  those  previously  used  in  published  DDI studies. Each group included 12 animals (2 per time point). The sampling times for blood/plasma and organs/tissues were: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24h. The following tissues were dissected and analysed for aliskiren concentration: liver, kidney, brain, fat, muscle, lung and heart.  Concentrations of aliskiren in plasma and tissues were determined by a quantitative LC/MS/MS method with a limit of quantification of 0.200 ng/mL.

Data submitted Study DMPK R0900355 Wild type mice (WT) and P-gp knockout mice (KO) were orally dosed with aliskiren (100 mg/kg). The effect of co-administration of ciclosporin (p.o. and i.v.) and ketoconazole (p.o.) was also investigated both in WT and KO mice. Treatment groups were the following: A : mdr1a/1b  (-/-) mice, 100  mg/kg  p.o. aliskiren and pre-administration of Neoral vehicle microemulsion (4 mL/kg p.o.) B : wild type mice, 100 mg/kg p.o. aliskiren and pre-administration of Neoral vehicle microemulsion (4 mL/kg p.o.) C : mdr1a/1b (-/-) mice, 100 mg/kg p.o. aliskiren and pre-administration of ciclosporin (10 mg/kg p.o.) D : wild type mice, 100 mg/kg p.o. aliskiren and pre-administration of ciclosporin (10 mg/kg p.o.) E : mdr1a/1b (-/-) mice, 100 mg/kg p.o. aliskiren and pre-administration of ketoconazole (50 mg/kg p.o.) F : wild type mice, 100 mg/kg p.o. aliskiren and pre-administration of ketoconazole (50 mg/kg p.o.) G :  wild type mice, 100 mg/kg p.o. aliskiren and pre-administration of ciclosporin (5 mg/kg i.v.)

## Brain

Aliskiren levels in brain are shown in the following table:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In KO  mice  aliskiren levels are 30-fold higher than in WT  mice  (A  vs. B).  However,  the AUCbrain/AUCplasma ratio is lower in KO than in WT mice (0.3 vs. 0.73), which may suggest that the higher levels in KO mice may be a consequence of the much higher plasma levels (62 fold higher in KO than  in  WT  mice).  On  the  other  hand,  in  WT  mice,  brain  levels  were  essentially  unaffected  by ciclosporin  (both  p.o.  and  i.v.)  or  ketoconazole,  even  though  plasma  levels  were  increased  by  both compounds (17 fold by ciclosporin).

P-gp inhibitors apparently do not increase the drug distribution to the brain, which suggests that the concentration of inhibitors at the blood-brain barrier may be too low to inhibit P-gp activity at this site. Accordingly, ciclosporin did not increase brain levels in KO mice.

## Other tissues

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In all other tissues aliskiren levels were 3 to 10 fold higher in KO than in WT mice. These differences appear to be due to the increase in plasma levels because the Tissue/Plasma AUC ratios were all lower in KO than in WT mice. In the table below Tissue/Plasma AUC  ratios are shown for WT and KO mice.

| Tissue   | WT mice   | KO mice   |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Liver    | 44        | 5         |
| Kidney   | 34        | 4         |
| Lung     | 11        | 0.6       |
| Fat      | 5.7       | 0.3       |

| Brain    |           |           |

In WT mice, co-administration of ciclosporin caused a 2-3 fold increase in aliskiren levels in kidney, heart and lung, and a decrease in the tissue/plasma AUC ratio.

In liver, levels were lower in mice co-treated with oral, but not intravenous, ciclosporin with respect to control WT mice. The difference is essentially due to a marked difference in 0.5 h levels (control mice: 23,550 ng/g; oral ciclosporin treated mice: 3,745 ng/g). The underlying mechanism is unknown but it appears  possible  that  ciclosporin  may  inhibit  hepatic  uptake  of  aliskiren.  Ciclosporin  also  decreased liver levels in KO mice, which indicates that the effect is independent of P-gp inhibition.

In  WT mice, co-administration of ketoconazole did not cause changes in aliskiren tissue levels, with respect to control mice. The tissue/plasma AUC ratio was consequently lower in all tissues.

## Overall conclusions

The non clinical data provided by the MAH convincingly demonstrate that the original safety concern which led to classify verapamil as a potent P-gp inhibitor is not supported by experimental data. In rats, the increase caused by verapamil in the tissue levels of the prototype P-gp substrate, digoxin, was very similar to the increase in plasma levels.

Therefore, the contraindication for the concomitant administration of verapamil and aliskiren can be removed.  A  warning  should  be  added  in  section  4.4  of  SmPC  (under  subheading  'Moderate  P-gp inhibitors).

The Risk Management Plan has been updated accordingly.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Clinical  and  non  clinical  data  indicate  that  the  role  of  P-gp  and  other  transporters  in  aliskiren  PK  is more  complex  than  that  described  in  the  current  SmPC.  In  particular,  as  noted  by  the  Novartis scientific team, aliskiren is also a substrate for OATP2B1-mediated transport in vitro, and OATP2B1 is the  likely  hepatic  uptake  transporter  of  aliskiren  (Vaidyanathan  et  al., J  Clin  Pharmacol 2008  48: 1323).  Therefore,  it  is  likely  that  the  decrease  by  ciclosporin  of  aliskiren  clearance  is  mediated inhibition  of  OATP2B1,  ciclosporin  being  an  inhibitor  of  OATP2B1  (Kalliokoski  and  Niemi  M.  Br  J Pharmacol.  2009,158(3):693-705).  The  information  reported  in  the  current  SmPC  on  the  role  of transporters (and their inhibitors) on aliskiren PK also need to be updated based on all available non clinical  and  clinical  data.  In  particular,  section  4.4,  4.5,  5.2  should  be  revised.  The  results  of  the published study on the effect of rifampicin on aliskiren PK (Tapaninen et al., Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2010 May;66(5):497-502) should also be inserted in the revised SmPC.

## 1.3. Risk management plan

The Risk Management Plan (RMP), reflecting the removal of the contraindication of the concomitant administration  of  verapamil  and  aliskiren  for  Rasilez  (RMP  7.0)  and  Rasilez  HCT  (RMP  7.0)  were submitted during Rasilez II-41 and Rasilez II-05 procedures and were assessed in the frame of the relevant procedures.

## 2. Changes to the Product Information

The following changes to the current aliskiren product infomation are proposed by the MAH (underlined new text, strikethrough deleted text):

## 4.3 Contraindications

….. The concomitant use of aliskiren with ciclosporin and itraconazole, two highly potent P-gp inhibitors, and other potent P-gp inhibitors (e.g. quinidine, verapamil), is contraindicated (see section 4.5). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use ….. Moderate P-gp inhibitors Co-administration  of  aliskiren  300 mg  with  ketoconazole  200 mg  or  verapamil  240 mg  resulted  in  a 76%  or  97%  increase  in  aliskiren  AUC,  respectively  but  P-gp  inhibitors  such  as  ketoconazole  are expected to increase tissue concentrations more than plasma concentrations. Therefore caution should be  exercised  when  aliskiren  is  administered  with  moderate  P-gp  inhibitors  such  as  ketoconazole  or verapamil (see section 4.5). 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Digoxin and verapamil bioavailability may be slightly decreased by Rasilez. ….. P-glycoprotein interactions MDR1/Mdr1a/1b (P-gp) was found to be the major efflux system involved in intestinal absorption and biliary  excretion  of  aliskiren  in  preclinical  studies.  Rifampicin,  which  is  an  inducer  of  P-gp,  reduced aliskiren  bioavailability  by  approximately  50%  in  a  clinical  study.  Other  inducers  of  P-gp  (St.  John's wort,  rifampicin)  might  therefore  decrease  the  bioavailability  of  Rasilez.  Although  this  has  not  been investigated for aliskiren, it is known that P-gp also controls tissue uptake of a variety of substrates and P-gp inhibitors can increase the tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios. Therefore, P-gp inhibitors may increase tissue levels more than plasma levels. The potential for drug interactions at the P-gp site will likely depend on the degree of inhibition of this transporter. P-gp potent inhibitors A single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) increases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase may be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC and Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of aliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Moderate P-gp inhibitors

Co-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg) or verapamil (240 mg) with aliskiren (300 mg) resulted in a 76% or 97% increase in aliskiren AUC, respectively. The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in the presence of ketoconazole or verapamil is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest recommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration enhances aliskiren gastrointestinal absorption  and  decreases  biliary  excretion.  Therefore,  caution  should  be  exercised  when  aliskiren  is administered with ketoconazole, verapamil or other moderate P-gp inhibitors (clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone).

## P-gp substrates or weak inhibitors

No relevant interactions with atenolol, digoxin, amlodipine or cimetidine have been observed. When administered with atorvastatin (80 mg), steady-state aliskiren (300 mg) AUC and Cmax increased by

50%.

## Moderate P-gp inhibitors

Co-administration  of  ketoconazole  (200 mg)  with  aliskiren  (300 mg)  resulted  in  an  80%  increase  in plasma levels of aliskiren (AUC and Cmax). Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren and ketoconazole co-administration  enhances  aliskiren  gastrointestinal  absorption  and  decreases  biliary  excretion.  The change in plasma levels of aliskiren in the presence of ketoconazole is expected to be within the range that would be achieved if the dose of aliskiren were doubled; aliskiren doses of up to 600 mg, or twice the highest recommended therapeutic dose, have been found to be well tolerated in controlled clinical trials. Yet, P-gp  inhibitors are expected  to increase  tissue  concentrations  more  than  plasma concentrations. Therefore, caution should be exercised when aliskiren is administered with ketoconazole or other moderate pgp inhibitors (itraconazol, clarithromycin, telithromycin, erythromycin, amiodarone).

## P-gp potent inhibitors

A single dose drug interaction study in healthy subjects has shown that ciclosporin (200 and 600 mg) increases Cmax of aliskiren 75 mg approximately 2.5-fold and AUC approximately 5-fold. The increase may be higher with higher aliskiren doses. In healthy subjects, itraconazole (100 mg) increases AUC and Cmax of aliskiren (150 mg) by 6.5-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively. Therefore, concomitant use of aliskiren and P-gp potent inhibitors is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

## Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) inhibitors

Preclinical studies indicate that aliskiren might  be a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptides.  Therefore,  the  potential  exists  for  interactions  between  OATP  inhibitors  and  aliskiren when administered concomitantly (see interaction with Grapefruit juice).

## 3. Conclusion

On  22  September  2011  the  CHMP  considered  these  Type  II  variations  following  a  worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.
