Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Primary vaccination :

The primary vaccination schedule consists of two or three doses of 0.5 ml administered within the first year of life  according  to official  recommendations.  There should be an interval of at least 1  month between doses : such as 2 , 3, 4 months; 2, 4, 6 months; 3, 5 months.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Booster :

After a primary vaccination with 2 doses of HEXAVAC (i.e. 3, 5 months), a booster dose must be given between 11 and 13 months of age; after a  primary vaccination with 3 doses of Hexavac (e.g. 2, 3,  4  months;  2,  4,  6  months),  a  booster  dose  must  be  given  between  12  and  18  months  of  age, according to official recommendations.

HEXAVAC  can  be  used  for  the  booster  dose  provided  the  toddler  has  received  a  full  primary vaccination course of each of the antigens contained in HEXAVAC regardless of whether they were administered as monovalent or combination vaccines produced by Sanofi Pasteur MSD.

## Method of administration

Temperature of ≥ 40.0 °C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause.

HEXAVAC  should  be  administered  intramuscularly  into  the  quadriceps  or  deltoid  preferably  at alternating sites for subsequent injections. This vaccine should not be used in newborns, adolescents or adults. 4.3 Contraindications Known  hypersensitivity to any component  of  the vaccine or severe reaction after previous administration of the vaccine. Encephalopathy within 7 days of administration of a previous dose of any vaccine containing pertussis antigens (whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccines). In  these  circumstances  the  vaccination  course  should  be  continued  with  vaccine  not  containing  a pertussis component. Vaccination should be postponed in the case of fever or acute disease. 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use This vaccine should not be used in newborns, adolescents or adults. Infants born of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers should receive Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) and Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant) at birth and should complete the hepatitis  B  vaccination  series.  The  subsequent  administration  of  HEXAVAC  for  completion  of  the hepatitis  B  vaccination  series  in  infants  who  were  born  of  HBsAg-positive  mothers  and  received HBIG or infants born of mothers of unknown status has not been studied. HEXAVAC should not be used as the birth dose or subsequent doses during the first year of life for children born to HbsAgpositive mothers. HEXAVAC should be administered  with  caution  to  subjects  with  thrombocytopenia  or  a  bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. HEXAVAC  should  under  no  circumstances  be  administered  intravascularly.  The  intradermal  or subcutaneous routes must not be used either. If  any  of  the  following  events  are  known  to  have  occurred  in  temporal  relation  to  receipt  of  the vaccine,  the  decision  to  give  further  doses  of  pertussis-containing  vaccines  should  be  carefully considered: Medicinal product no longer authorised

Collapse  or  shock-like  state  (hypotonic-hyporesponsiveness  episode)  within  48  hours  of vaccination.

Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination.

Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination.

Antipyretic treatment should be initiated according to local guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As  with  all  injectable  vaccines,  appropriate  medical  treatment  and  supervision  should  be  readily available  for  immediate  use  in  case  of  a  rare  anaphylactic  reaction  following  the  administration  of vaccine.

In  subjects  who  have  a  history  of  a  severe  reaction  within  48  hours  of  a  previous  injection  with  a vaccine containing similar components, the course of vaccination should be carefully considered.

Because  of  the  long  incubation  period  of  hepatitis  B,  it  is  possible  for  unrecognised  hepatitis  B infection to be present at the time of immunisation. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B infection in such cases.

HEXAVAC will not prevent hepatitis infection caused by other agents such as hepatitis A, hepatitis C and hepatitis E or by other liver pathogens. HEXAVAC  does  not  protect  against  invasive  diseases  due  to  serotypes  other  than Haemophilus influenzae type b or against meningitis of other origins. As each dose may contain undetectable traces of neomycin, streptomycin and polymyxin B, caution should  be  exercised  when  the  vaccine  is  administered  to  subjects  with  hypersensitivity  to  these antibiotics. The immunogenicity of HEXAVAC  could  be  reduced by immunosuppressive treatment or immunodeficiency. In such cases it is recommended to postpone the vaccination until the end of the disease  or  treatment.  Nevertheless,  vaccination  of  subjects  with  chronic  immunodeficiency  such  as HIV infection is recommended even if the antibody response might be limited. There  are  currently  no  sufficient  data  available  regarding  immunogenicity  of  the  concomitant administration of HEXAVAC with PREVENAR (pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated vaccine, adsorbed).  However  when  HEXAVAC  was  co-administered  with  PREVENAR  (pneumococcal polysaccharide  conjugated  vaccine,  adsorbed)  in  clinical  studies,  the  rate  of  febrile  reactions  was higher compared to that occurring following the administration of hexavalent vaccines alone. These reactions were mostly moderate (less than or equal to 39° C) and transient. HEXAVAC  must  not  be  mixed  in  the  same  syringe  with  other  vaccines  or  other  parenterally administered drugs. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Except in the case of immunosuppressive therapy (see 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for  use),  no  significant  clinical  interaction  with  other  treatments  or  biological  products  has  been documented. There are no data in regards to the efficacy and safety of concomitant administration of HEXAVAC with Measles, Mumps and Rubella Virus Vaccine, live. There  are  currently  no  sufficient  data  available  regarding  immunogenicity  of  the  concomitant administration of HEXAVAC with PREVENAR (pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated vaccine, adsorbed).

## · Clinical trials experience

In  clinical  trials,  more  than  3,900  infants  and  4,400  toddlers  (from  12  to  20  months  of  age)  have received HEXAVAC.

Commonly reported reactions included redness  and/or  induration/swelling/pain  at  the  injection  site, fever equal to or greater than 38 °C, irritability, drowsiness, loss of appetite, insomnia, diarrhoea and vomiting.  Less  commonly,  fever  equal  to  or  greater  than  40  °C,  tenderness  at  the  injection  site, prolonged inconsolable crying and redness and/or induration &gt; 7 cm at the injection site or swelling of the  entire  limb  have  been  reported.  Febrile  convulsion  and  high-pitched  crying  have  been  reported rarely.  A  single  bilateral  oedematous  reaction  of  the  lower  limbs  and  a  single,  hypotonic  hyporesponsive episode have been reported. These  signs  and  symptoms  usually  occurred  within  48  hours  following  the  vaccination.  They  were mostly mild, generally lasting for up to 72 hours and resolved spontaneously. No increase in the number of undesirable reactions was noted between first, second and third doses of the primary series except for an increase in the rate of fever equal to or greater than 38 °C after the second dose in the primary series. The rate of fever equal to or greater than 40 °C increased after booster immunisation but remained &lt; 1 %. Redness and/or induration &gt; 7 cm at the injection site increased after booster immunisation but remained &lt; 1 %. In rare instances, these cases were associated with swelling of the entire limb. · Post marketing experience The  following  additional  undesirable  effects  have  been  reported  following  the  widespread  use  of HEXAVAC. Common (&gt;1/100 and &lt;1/10) Application site disorders (reactions at the injection site): Oedema /  Pruritus / Urticaria.

## · Potential undesirable effects

In  addition,  other  undesirable effects  have  been  reported  with  the  marketed  use  of  vaccines  closely related to HEXAVAC.

Undesirable effects  reported  in  clinical  trials  and  the  marketed  use  to  date  of  Sanofi  Pasteur  MSD diphtheria,  tetanus,  acellular  pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type  b  and  inactivated  poliomyelitis adsorbed vaccine are included in the list of undesirable effects for HEXAVAC.

Very  rare  reactions  following  the  use  of  Sanofi  Pasteur  MSD  hepatitis  B  (recombinant)  vaccine include alopecia, hypotension, optic neuritis, facial paralysis, erythema multiforme, and anaphylaxis. As with other hepatitis B vaccines, in many instances, the causal relationship to the vaccine has not been established. 4.9 Overdose Not applicable. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Bacterial and viral vaccines, combined, ATC code : J07CA The  diphtheria  and  tetanus  toxoids  are  prepared  from  the  toxins  of  cultures  of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Clostridium  tetani by  formaldehyde  detoxification  followed  by  purification.  The surface  antigen  of  hepatitis  B  virus  is  produced  by  culture  of  a  recombinant  strain  of  yeast  cells ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The poliomyelitis vaccine is obtained from the propagation of poliomyelitis viruses types 1, 2 and 3 on Vero cells, purified, then inactivated by formaldehyde. The  acellular  pertussis  components  (pertussis  toxin:  PT  and  filamentous  haemagglutinin:  FHA)  are extracted  from Bordetella  pertussis cultures  then  separately  purified.  The  pertussis  toxin  (PT)  is detoxified separately with glutaraldehyde to create the toxoid (PTxd). The FHA is not detoxified. It has been shown that PTxd and FHA play a major role in protection against pertussis. This  vaccine  contains  the  purified  capsular  polysaccharide  (polyribosyl  ribitol  phosphate:  PRP)  of Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugated to tetanus toxoid. When administered alone PRP induces a serological response, but it is weakly immunogenic in infants. The covalent binding of PRP to tetanus toxoid makes it a T-cell dependent antigen which induces a specific IgG anti-PRP response in infants and which elicits immune memory. This  vaccine  induces  specific  humoral  antibodies  against  HBsAg  (anti-HBs)  and  against  diphtheria and  tetanus  toxoids  (anti-D  and  anti-T).  Development  of  anti-HBs  titre  equal  to  or  greater  than  10 mIU/ml and of anti-D and anti-T equal to or greater than 0.01 IU/ml measured 1-2 months after the third  injection  correlates  with  protection  against  hepatitis  B  infection  and  against  diphtheria  and tetanus respectively. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Immune response after primary vaccination

In the pivotal clinical study, all infants (100 %) developed a seroprotective antibody level (equal to or greater  than  0.01 IU/ml)  to  both  diphtheria  and  tetanus  antigens  one  month  after  completion  of  the primary series. For pertussis, 91.8 % and 90.5 % of infants achieved a four-fold rise in PT and FHA antibody  titres  respectively.  The  4-fold  increase  in  post  immunisation  titres  is  considered  a  sign  of seroconversion of which the clinical significance is unknown in the absence of a serological correlate of  protection.  Protective  levels  of  anti-HBs  (equal  to  or  greater  than  10 mIU/ml)  were  achieved  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

96.6 % of infants ; the geometric mean titres (GMTs) were diminished compared to the control group. Anti-poliovirus  titres  above  the  threshold  of  5  (reciprocal  of  dilution  in  seroneutralisation)  against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 were developed in 100 % of infants and these were considered protected against poliomyelitis. After primary vaccination, 93.7 % of infants had an anti-PRP titre equal to or greater than 0.15 µg/ml; the GMTs were diminished compared to the control group (2.06 µg/ml versus 3.69 µg/ml).

## Immune response after booster injection

In the pivotal clinical study where toddlers received HEXAVAC as a booster dose after having been primed  with  HEXAVAC,  antibody  titres  equal  to  or  greater  than  0.1 IU/ml  were  achieved  by  all toddlers to tetanus and by 98.8 % to diphtheria. A mean 7.4 and 4.3-fold rise in antibody titres to PT and  FHA  respectively  was  achieved  and  all  toddlers  developed  protective  antibody  titres  against poliovirus  types  1,  2  and  3.  Just  before  the  booster  injection  anti-PRP  GMTs  were  0.40 µg/ml  and 0.64 µg/ml for HEXAVAC and for the control group respectively. After booster, GMTs increased to 16.7 µg/ml and 23.0 µg/ml in each group respectively, indicating a strong anamnestic response. AntiPRP titres equal to or greater than 0.15 µg/ml and equal to or greater than 1 µg/ml were achieved in 100 % and 96.6 % of toddlers respectively. Following the booster dose, 96.6 % of toddlers developed anti-HBs titres equal to or greater than 10 mIU/ml. A mean 20.5-fold rise in antibody titres to HBs was observed after the booster dose. Other trials gave similar or higher results. Surveillance and antibody long  term  persistence  studies  are  ongoing  and  will  provide  additional  information  in  regards  to  the duration of protection. After  a  3,  5,  12  months  schedule,  immune  responses  were  compatible  with  the  sought  clinical protection and of the same magnitude as those reported previously for HEXAVAC or other licensed combination vaccines during the second year of life 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Evaluation of pharmacokinetic properties is not required for vaccines. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Preclinical data including single-dose, repeated dose and  local tolerance studies revealed no unexpected findings and no target organ toxicity. 6.

## 1. WHAT IS HEXAVAC AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR

HEXAVAC is an injectable vaccine in a 0.5 ml single dose syringe.

HEXAVAC is indicated to help protect your child against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, infection of the liver caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus and invasive disease (infection of brain and spinal cord tissues, infection of the blood, etc.) caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacterium in children 8 weeks to 18 months of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

HEXAVAC is available in packs of 1, 10, 25 and 50 with or without neddles.

## 2. BEFORE YOU USE HEXAVAC

## Do not use HEXAVAC:

- -if your child is allergic to any component of the vaccine.
- -in case of newborns, adolescents or adults.

There  are  currently  not  sufficient  data  available  regarding  immune  response  of  the  concomitant administration of HEXAVAC with PREVENAR (pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugated vaccine, adsorbed).  However,  when  HEXAVAC  was  co-administered  in  clinical  studies  the  rate  of  febrile reactions  was  higher  compared  to  that  occurring  following  administration  of  hexavalent  vaccines alone. These reactions were mostly moderate and transient. If your child is due to be vaccinated with HEXAVAC and other vaccines simultaneously, please ask your doctor for further information.

-if your child has  fever or other illness, particularly a cough, cold or flu (vaccination should be delayed). -if your infant has suffered brain damage (encephalopathy) following a previous dose of a whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccine. Take special care with HEXAVAC: -if your child has an hypersensitivity to neomycin, streptomycin and polymyxin B, due to the use of these substances during production. -if your child has a thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. -if any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal relation to receipt of the vaccine  (The  decision  to  give  further  doses  of  pertussis-containing  vaccines  to  your  child should  be  carefully  considered  if  any  of  the  following  events  are  known  to  have  occurred following the administration of the vaccine) : Temperature of ≥ 40.0 °C within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause. Collapse  or  shock-like  state  (hypotonic-hyporesponsiveness  episode)  within  48  hours  of vaccination. Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination. Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination. -if your child has any present or past medical problems or allergies, including allergic reactions after any dose of HEXAVAC. -if  you  are  a  hepatitis  B  virus  surface  antigen  (HBsAg)-positive  mother,  your  infant  should receive Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine (Recombinant) at birth and  should  complete  the  hepatitis  B  vaccination  series.  The  subsequent  administration  of HEXAVAC for completion of the hepatitis B vaccination series in infants who were born of HBsAg-positive mothers and received HBIG or infants born of mothers of unknown status has not been studied. HEXAVAC should not be used as the birth dose or subsequent doses during the first year of life for children born to HbsAg-positive mothers . -because as with other similar vaccines, cases of Haemophilus b disease may occur in the week after vaccination prior to the onset of the protective effects of the vaccine. -because hepatitis B infection can go undetected for a long period of time, it is possible that an individual may already be infected at the time the vaccine is given. The vaccine may not prevent hepatitis B in these individuals. Using other vaccines Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 3. HOW TO USE HEXAVAC

The primary vaccination schedule consists of two or three doses of 0.5 ml administered within the first year of life according to the official recommendations. There should be an interval of at least 1 month between doses : such as 2 , 3, 4 months; 2, 4, 6 months; 3, 5 months.

After a primary vaccination with 2 doses of HEXAVAC (e.g 3, 5 months), a booster dose must  be given between 11 and 13 months of age; after a  primary vaccination with 3 doses of Hexavac (e.g. 2, 3,  4  months;  2,  4,  6  months),  a  booster  dose  must  be  given  between  12  and  18  months  of  age, according to official recommendations.

HEXAVAC  can  be  used  for  the  booster  dose  provided  the  toddler  has  received  a  full  primary vaccination  course  of  each  of  the  antigens  contained  in  Hexavac  regardless  of  whether  they  were administered as monovalent or combination vaccines produced by Sanofi Pasteur MSD. HEXAVAC should be injected into the quadriceps or deltoid muscle preferably at alternating sites for subsequent injections. HEXAVAC  should  under  no  circumstances  be  administered  intravascularly.  The  intradermal  or subcutaneous routes must not be used either. HEXAVAC  must  not  be  mixed  in  the  same  syringe  with  other  vaccines  or  other  parenterally administered drugs. For needle free syringes, the needle should be pushed firmly on to the end of the prefilled syringe and rotated through 90 degrees. If you forget to take HEXAVAC: Your doctor will decide when to give the missed dose. 4. POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS As with other vaccines your child may have some side effects.
