## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

Avtozma, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for:

- the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults not previously treated with MTX.
- the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in adult patients who have either responded inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more diseasemodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.

In these patients, Avtozma can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.

Avtozma has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray  and to improve physical function when given in combination with methotrexate.

## Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

Avtozma is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults who are receiving systemic corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA)

Avtozma is indicated for the treatment of active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in  patients 2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with NSAIDs  and systemic corticosteroids. Avtozma can be given as monotherapy (in case of intolerance to MTX  or where treatment with MTX is inappropriate) or in combination with MTX.

## Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA)

Avtozma in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic polyarthritis (pJIA; rheumatoid factor positive or negative and extended oligoarthritis) in patients 2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with MTX. Avtozma can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.

## Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)

Avtozma is indicated for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in adults and paediatric patients 2 years of age and older.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment should be initiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of RA, COVID-19, sJIA, pJIA or CRS.

For infusion bags made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), infusion bags that are di(2ethylhexyl)phthalate-free (DEHP-free) should be used.

All patients treated with Avtozma should be given the Patient Alert Card.

## Posology

## RA Patients

The recommended posology is 8 mg/kg body weight, given once every four weeks.

For individuals whose body weight is more than 100 kg, doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended (see section 5.2).

Doses above 1.2 g have not been evaluated in clinical studies (see section 5.1).

## COVID-19 Patients

The recommended posology for treatment of COVID-19 is a single 60-minute intravenous infusion of 8 mg/kg in patients who are receiving systemic corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation, see section 5.1. If clinical signs or symptoms worsen or do not improve after the first dose, one additional infusion of Avtozma 8 mg/kg may be administered. The interval between the two infusions should be at least 8 hours.

For individuals whose body weight is more than 100 kg, doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended (see section 5.2).

Administration of Avtozma is not recommended in patients with COVID-19 who have any of the following laboratory abnormalities:

| Laboratory test type      | Laboratory value   | Action                                       |

| Platelet count            | < 50 x 10 3 /μL    |                                              |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) (adults and paediatrics)

The recommended posology for treatment of CRS given as a 60-minute intravenous infusion is 8 mg/kg in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 12 mg/kg in patients weighing less than  30 kg. Avtozma can be given alone or in combination with corticosteroids.

If no clinical improvement in the signs and symptoms of CRS occurs after the first dose, up to 3 additional doses of Avtozma may be administered. The interval between consecutive doses should be at least 8 hours. Doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended in CRS patients.

Patients with severe or life-threatening CRS frequently have cytopenias or elevated ALT or AST due to the underlying malignancy, preceding lymphodepleting chemotherapy or the CRS.

## Special populations

Paediatric patients sJIA Patients

The recommended posology in patients above 2 years of age is 8 mg/kg once every 2 weeks in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 12 mg/kg once every 2 weeks in patients weighing less than 30 kg. The dose should be calculated based on the patient's body weight at each administration. A change in dose should only be based on a consistent change in the patient's body weight over time.

The safety and efficacy of intravenous Avtozma in children below 2 years of age has not been established.

Dose interruptions of tocilizumab for the following laboratory abnormalities are recommended in sJIA  patients in the tables below. If appropriate, the dose of concomitant MTX and/or other medications  should be modified or dosing stopped and tocilizumab dosing interrupted until the clinical situation  has been evaluated. As there are many co-morbid conditions that may affect laboratory values in sJIA,  the decision to discontinue tocilizumab for a laboratory abnormality should be based upon the medical  assessment of the individual patient.

There are insufficient clinical data to assess the impact of a tocilizumab dose reduction in sJIA patients who have experienced laboratory abnormalities.

Available data suggest that clinical improvement is observed within 6 weeks of initiation of treatment with tocilizumab. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient exhibiting no improvement within this timeframe.

## pJIA Patients

The recommended posology in patients above 2 years of age is 8 mg/kg once every 4 weeks in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 10 mg/kg once every 4 weeks in patients weighing less than 30 kg. The dose should be calculated based on the patient's body weight at each administration. A change in dose should only be based on a consistent change in the patient's body weight over time.

The safety and efficacy of intravenous Avtozma in children below 2 years of age has not been established.

Dose interruptions of tocilizumab for the following laboratory abnormalities are recommended in pJIA patients in the tables below. If appropriate, the dose of concomitant MTX and/or other medications should be modified or dosing stopped and tocilizumab dosing interrupted until the clinical situation has  been evaluated. As there are many co-morbid conditions that may affect laboratory values in pJIA,  the decision to discontinue tocilizumab for a laboratory abnormality should be based upon the medical  assessment of the individual patient.

Reduction of tocilizumab dose due to laboratory abnormalities has not been studied in pJIA patients.

Available data suggest that clinical improvement is observed within 12 weeks of initiation of treatment with tocilizumab. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a patient exhibiting no improvement within this timeframe.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients &gt;65 years of age.

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal impairment. Avtozma has not been  studied in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). Renal function should  be monitored closely in these patients.

## Hepatic impairment

Avtozma has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dose recommendations can be made.

## Method of administration

After dilution, Avtozma for RA, sJIA, pJIA, CRS, and COVID-19 patients should be administered  as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour.

## RA, sJIA, pJIA, CRS and COVID-19 Patients ≥ 30 kg

Avtozma should be diluted to a final volume of 100 mL with sterile, non-pyrogenic sodium chloride  9 mg/mL (0.9%) or 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection using aseptic technique.

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## sJIA, pJIA and CRS Patients &lt; 30 kg

Avtozma should be diluted to a final volume of 50 mL with sterile, non-pyrogenic sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) or 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection using aseptic technique.

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

If signs and symptoms of an infusion related reaction occur, slow or stop the infusion and administer appropriate medication/ supportive care immediately, see section 4.4.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Active, severe infections with the exception of COVID-19 (see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## RA, pJIA and sJIA Patients

## Infections

Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including tocilizumab (see section 4.8, undesirable effects). Avtozma treatment must not be initiated in patients with active infections (see section 4.3). Administration of tocilizumab should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection until the infection is controlled (see section 4.8). Healthcare professionals should exercise caution when considering the use of Avtozma in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions (e.g. diverticulitis, diabetes and interstitial lung disease) which may predispose patients to infections.

Vigilance for the timely detection of serious infection is recommended for patients receiving biological treatments as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened, associated with suppression of the acute phase reaction. The effects of tocilizumab on C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils and signs and symptoms of infection should be considered when evaluating a patient for a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

potential infection. Patients (which includes younger children with sJIA or pJIA who may be less able to communicate their symptoms) and parents/guardians of sJIA or pJIA patients should be instructed to contact their healthcare professional immediately when any symptoms suggesting infection appear, in order to assure rapid evaluation and appropriate treatment.

## Tuberculosis

As recommended for other biological treatments, RA, sJIA and pJIA patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to starting Avtozma therapy. Patients with latent TB should be treated with standard anti-mycobacterial therapy before initiating Avtozma. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin and interferon-gamma TB blood test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or immunocompromised.

Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during or after therapy with Avtozma.

## Viral reactivation

Viral reactivation (e.g. hepatitis B virus) has been reported with biologic therapies for RA. In clinical studies with tocilizumab, patients who screened positive for hepatitis were excluded.

## Complications of diverticulitis

Events of diverticular perforations as complications of diverticulitis have been reported uncommonly with tocilizumab in RA patients (see section 4.8). Avtozma should be used with caution in patients with previous history of intestinal ulceration or diverticulitis. Patients presenting with symptoms potentially indicative of complicated diverticulitis, such as abdominal pain, haemorrhage and/or unexplained change in bowel habits with fever should be evaluated promptly for early identification of diverticulitis, which can be associated with gastrointestinal perforation.

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with infusion of tocilizumab (see section 4.8). Such reactions may be more severe, and potentially fatal in patients who have experienced hypersensitivity reactions during previous infusions even if they have received premedication with steroids and antihistamines. Appropriate treatment should be available for immediate use in the event of an anaphylactic reaction during treatment with Avtozma. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious hypersensitivity / serious infusion related reaction occurs, administration of Avtozma should be stopped immediately and Avtozma should be permanently discontinued.

## Active hepatic disease and hepatic impairment

Treatment with tocilizumab, particularly when administered concomitantly with MTX, may be associated with elevations in hepatic transaminases, therefore, caution should be exercised when considering treatment of patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).

## Hepatotoxicity

Transient or intermittent mild and moderate elevations of hepatic transaminases have been reported commonly with tocilizumab treatment (see section 4.8). An increased frequency of these elevations was observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) were used in combination with tocilizumab. When clinically indicated, other liver function tests including bilirubin should be considered.

Serious drug-induced liver injury, including acute liver failure, hepatitis and jaundice, have been observed with tocilizumab (see section 4.8). Serious hepatic injury occurred between 2 weeks to more than 5 years after initiation of tocilizumab. Cases of liver failure resulting in liver transplantation have been reported. Patients should be advised to immediately seek medical help if they experience signs and symptoms of hepatic injury.

Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of Avtozma treatment in patients with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

elevated ALT or AST &gt; 1.5 x ULN. In RA, pJIA and sJIA patients with baseline ALT or AST &gt; 5 x ULN, treatment is not recommended.

In RA, pJIA and sJIA patients, ALT/AST should be monitored every 4 to 8 weeks for the first 6 months of treatment followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. For recommended modifications, including Avtozma discontinuation, based on transaminases levels see section 4.2. For ALT or AST elevations &gt; 3-5 x ULN, confirmed by repeat testing, Avtozma treatment should be interrupted.

## Haematological abnormalities

Decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts have occurred following treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with MTX (see section 4.8). There may be an increased risk of neutropenia in  patients who have previously been treated with a TNF antagonist.

In patients not previously treated with tocilizumab, initiation is not recommended in patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below 2 x 10 9 /L. Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of tocilizumab treatment in patients with a low platelet count (i.e. platelet count below 100 x 10 3 /μL). In RA, sJIA and pJIA patients who develop an ANC &lt; 0.5 x 10 9 /L or a platelet count &lt; 50 x 10 3 /μL, continued treatment is not recommended.

Severe neutropenia may be associated with an increased risk of serious infections, although there has been no clear association between decreases in neutrophils and the occurrence of serious infections in clinical trials with tocilizumab to date.

In RA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and thereafter according to standard clinical practice. For recommended dose modifications based on ANC and platelet counts, see section 4.2.

In sJIA and pJIA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored at the time of second infusion and thereafter according to good clinical practice, see section 4.2.

## Lipid parameters

Elevations in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides were observed in patients treated with tocilizumab (see section 4.8). In the majority of patients, there was no increase in atherogenic indices, and elevations in  total cholesterol responded to treatment with lipid lowering agents.

In sJIA, pJIA and RA patients, assessment of lipid parameters should be performed 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of tocilizumab therapy. Patients should be managed according to local clinical guidelines for management of hyperlipidaemia.

## Neurological disorders

Physicians should be vigilant for symptoms potentially indicative of new-onset central demyelinating disorders. The potential for central demyelination with tocilizumab is currently unknown.

## Malignancy

The risk of malignancy is increased in patients with RA. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy.

## Vaccinations

Live and live attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with tocilizumab as clinical safety has not been established. In a randomised open-label study, adult RA patients treated with tocilizumab and MTX were able to mount an effective response to both the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide and tetanus toxoid vaccines which was comparable to the response seen in patients on MTX only. It is recommended that all patients, particularly sJIA and pJIA patients, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating Avtozma therapy. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of Avtozma therapy  should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cardiovascular risk

RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders and should have risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care.

## Combination with TNF antagonists

There is no experience with the use of Avtozma with TNF antagonists or other biological treatments for RA, sJIA or pJIA patients. Avtozma is not recommended for use with other biological agents.

## COVID-19 Patients

- The efficacy of Avtozma has not been established in the treatment of COVID-19 patients who do not have elevated CRP levels, see section 5.1
- Avtozma should not be administered to COVID-19 patients who are not receiving systemic corticosteroids as an increase in mortality cannot be excluded in this subgroup, see section 5.1.

## Infections

In COVID-19 patients, Avtozma should not be administered if they have any other concurrent  severe active infection. Healthcare professionals should exercise caution when considering the use of Avtozma in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions (e.g. diverticulitis, diabetes, and interstitial lung disease) which may predispose patients to infections.

## Hepatotoxicity

Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 may have elevated ALT or AST levels. Multi-organ failure with involvement of the liver is recognized as a complication of severe COVID-19. The decision to administer tocilizumab should balance the potential benefit of treating COVID-19 against the potential risks of acute treatment with tocilizumab. In COVID-19 patients with elevated ALT or AST above 10 x ULN, administration of Avtozma treatment is not recommended. In COVID-19 patients,  ALT/AST should be monitored according to current standard clinical practices.

## Haematological abnormalities

In COVID-19 patients who develop an ANC &lt; 1 x 10 9 /L or a platelet count &lt; 50 x 10 3 /μL, administration of treatment is not recommended. Neutrophil and platelet counts should be monitored according to current standard clinical practices, see section 4.2.

## Paediatric population

## sJIA Patients

Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a serious life-threatening disorder that may develop in sJIA patients. In clinical trials, tocilizumab has not been studied in patients during an episode of active MAS.

## Excipients with known effect

## Polysorbate

Each 80 mg vial contains 2.0 mg of polysorbate 80. Each 200 mg vial contains 5.0 mg of polysorbate 80. Each 400 mg vial contains 10.0 mg of polysorbate 80.

Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Patients with polysorbate allergy should not take this medicine.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

Concomitant administration of a single dose of 10 mg/kg tocilizumab with 10-25 mg MTX once weekly had no clinically significant effect on MTX exposure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of MTX, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids on tocilizumab clearance.

The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by cytokines, such as IL-6, that stimulate chronic inflammation. Thus, CYP450 expression may be reversed when potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, such as tocilizumab, is introduced.

In vitro studies with cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 caused a reduction in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. Tocilizumab normalises expression of these enzymes.

In a study in RA patients, levels of simvastatin (CYP3A4) were decreased by 57% one week following a single dose of tocilizumab, to the level similar to, or slightly higher than, those observed in healthy subjects.

When starting or stopping therapy with tocilizumab, patients taking medicinal products which are individually adjusted and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2 or 2C9 (e.g. methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, (with the possibility for oral glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome), atorvastatin, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, ciclosporin, or benzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses may need to be increased to maintain therapeutic effect. Given its long elimination half-life (t1/2), the effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment.

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of tocilizumab in pregnant women. A study in animals has shown an increased risk of spontaneous abortion/embryo-foetal death at a high dose (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.

Avtozma should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether tocilizumab is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of tocilizumab in milk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with Avtozma should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Avtozma therapy to the woman.

## Fertility

Available non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility under tocilizumab treatment.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Tocilizumab has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8, dizziness).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most commonly reported ADRs (occurring in ≥ 5% of patients treated with tocilizumab monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs for RA, sJIA, pJIA and CRS) were upper respiratory  tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension and increased ALT.

The most serious ADRs were serious infections, complications of diverticulitis, and hypersensitivity reactions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most commonly reported ADRs (occurring in ≥ 5% of patients treated with tocilizumab for  COVID-19) were hepatic transaminases increased, constipation, and urinary tract infection.

ADRs from clinical trials and/or post marketing experience with tocilizumab based on spontaneous case reports, literature cases and cases from non-interventional study programs are listed in Table 1 and  in Table 2 by MedDRA system organ class. The corresponding frequency category for each ADR is based on the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100), rare (&gt;1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000) or very rare (&lt;1/10 000). Within each frequency  grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## RA Patients

The safety profile of tocilizumab has been studied in 4 placebo-controlled studies (studies II, III, IV and V), 1 MTX-controlled study (study I) and their extension periods (see section 5.1).

The double-blind controlled period was 6 months in four studies (studies I, III, IV and V) and was up  to 2 years in one study (study II). In the double-blind controlled studies, 774 patients received tocilizumab 4 mg/kg in combination with MTX, 1 870 patients received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with MTX or other DMARDs and 288 patients received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg monotherapy.

The long-term exposure population includes all patients who received at least one dose of tocilizumab  either in the double-blind control period or open label extension phase in the studies. Of the 4 009  patients in this population, 3 577 received treatment for at least 6 months, 3 296 for at least one year,  2 806 received treatment for at least 2 years and 1 222 for 3 years.

## Infections

In the 6-month controlled studies the rate of all infections reported with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD treatment was 127 events per 100 patient years compared to 112 events per 100 patient years  in the placebo plus DMARD group. In the long-term exposure population, the overall rate of infections with tocilizumab was 108 events per 100 patient years exposure.

In 6-month controlled clinical studies, the rate of serious infections with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs was 5.3 events per 100 patient years exposure compared to 3.9 events per 100 patient years  exposure in the placebo plus DMARD group. In the monotherapy study, the rate of serious infections  was 3.6 events per 100 patient years of exposure in the tocilizumab group and 1.5 events per 100  patient years of exposure in the MTX group.

In the long-term exposure population, the overall rate of serious infections (bacterial, viral and fungal) was 4.7 events per 100 patient years. Reported serious infections, some with fatal outcome, included active tuberculosis, which may present with intrapulmonary or extrapulmonary disease, invasive pulmonary infections, including candidiasis, aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis and pneumocystis jirovecii, pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial arthritis. Cases of opportunistic infections have been reported.

## Interstitial Lung Disease

Impaired lung function may increase the risk for developing infections. There have been postmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of which had fatal outcomes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Gastrointestinal Perforation

During the 6-month controlled clinical trials, the overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation, was 0.26 events per 100 patient years with tocilizumab therapy. In the long-term exposure population the overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was 0.28 events per 100 patient years. Reports of gastrointestinal perforation on tocilizumab were primarily reported as complications of diverticulitis including generalised purulent peritonitis, lower gastrointestinal perforation, fistulae and abscess.

## Infusion Related Reactions

In the 6-month controlled trials adverse events associated with infusion (selected events occurring during or within 24 hours of infusion) were reported by 6.9% of patients in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD group and 5.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. Events reported during the infusion were primarily episodes of hypertension; events reported within 24 hours of finishing an infusion were headache and skin reactions (rash, urticaria). These events were not treatment limiting.

The rate of anaphylactic reactions (occurring in a total of 8/4 009 patients, 0.2%) was several fold higher with the 4 mg/kg dose, compared to the 8 mg/kg dose. Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation were reported in a total of 56 out of 4 009 patients (1.4%) treated with tocilizumab during the controlled and open label clinical studies. These reactions were generally observed during the second to fifth infusions of tocilizumab (see section 4.4). Fatal anaphylaxis has been reported after marketing authorisation during treatment with tocilizumab (see section 4.4).

## Haematological abnormalities:

## Neutrophils

In the 6-month controlled trials decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 10 9 /L occurred in 3.4% of patients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to &lt; 0.1% of patients on placebo plus DMARDs. Approximately half of the patients who developed an ANC &lt; 1 x 10 9 /L did so within 8 weeks after starting therapy. Decreases below 0.5 x 10 9 /L were reported in 0.3% patients receiving tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs. Infections with neutropenia have been reported.

During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of decreases in neutrophil counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical trials.

## Platelets

In the 6-month controlled trials decreases in platelet counts below 100 x 10 3 /μL occurred in 1.7% of patients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to &lt; 1% on placebo plus DMARDs. These decreases occurred without associated bleeding events.

During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of decreases in platelet counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical trials.

Very rare reports of pancytopenia have occurred in the post marketing setting.

## Hepatic transaminase elevations

During the 6-month controlled trials transient elevations in ALT/AST &gt; 3 x ULN were observed in 2.1% of patients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg compared to 4.9% of patients on MTX and in 6.5% of patients who received 8 mg/kg tocilizumab plus DMARDs compared to 1.5% of patients on placebo plus DMARDs.

The addition of potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) to tocilizumab monotherapy resulted in increased frequency of these elevations. Elevations of ALT/AST &gt; 5 x ULN were observed in 0.7% of tocilizumab monotherapy patients and 1.4% of tocilizumab plus DMARD patients, the majority of whom were discontinued permanently from tocilizumab treatment. During the double-blind controlled period, the incidence of indirect bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal, collected as a routine laboratory parameter, is 6.2% in patients treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab + DMARD. A total of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

5.8%  of patients experienced an elevation of indirect bilirubin of &gt; 1 to 2 x ULN and 0.4% had an elevation  of &gt; 2 x ULN.

During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of elevation in ALT/AST remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical trials.

## Lipid parameters

During the 6-month controlled trials, increases of lipid parameters such as total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and/or HDL cholesterol have been reported commonly. With routine laboratory monitoring it was seen that approximately 24% of patients receiving tocilizumab in clinical trials experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol ≥ 6.2 mmol/L, with 15% experiencing a sustained increase in LDL to ≥ 4.1 mmol/L. Elevations in lipid parameters responded to treatment with lipid-lowering agents.

During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled trials.

## Malignancies

The clinical data are insufficient to assess the potential incidence of malignancy following exposure to tocilizumab. Long-term safety evaluations are ongoing.

## Skin Reactions

Rare reports of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have occurred in the post marketing setting.

## Patients with COVID-19

The safety evaluation of tocilizumab in COVID-19 was based on 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo  controlled trials (studies ML42528, WA42380, and WA42511). A total of 974 patients were exposed  to tocilizumab in these studies. Collection of safety data from RECOVERY was limited and is not  presented here.

The following adverse reactions, listed by MedDRA system organ class in Table 2, have been adjudicated from events which occurred in at least 3% of tocilizumab treated patients and more commonly than that in patients on placebo in the pooled safety-evaluable population from clinical studies ML42528, WA42380, and WA42511.

Table 2: List of Adverse Reactions 1 Identified From the Pooled Safety-Evaluable Population From  tocilizumab Clinical Studies in COVID-19 patients 2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Infections

In the pooled safety-evaluable population from studies ML42528, WA42380, and WA42511, the rates of infection/serious infection events were balanced between COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab (30.3%/18.6%, n=974) versus placebo (32.1%/22.8%, n=483).

The safety profile observed in the baseline systemic corticosteroids treatment group was consistent with the safety profile of tocilizumab from the overall population presented in Table 2. In this subgroup, infections and serious infections occurred in 27.8% and 18.1% of patients treated with IV  tocilizumab and in 30.5% and 22.9% of patients treated with placebo, respectively.

## Laboratory Abnormalities

The incidence of laboratory abnormalities was generally similar between patients with COVID-19 who received one or two doses of tocilizumab-IV compared with those who received placebo in the randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trials with few exceptions. Decreases in platelets and neutrophils and elevations of ALT and AST were more frequent among patients receiving tocilizumab-IV versus placebo (see section 4.2 and 4.4).

## sJIA and pJIA Patients

The safety profile of tocilizumab in the paediatric population is summarized in the sections on pJIA and sJIA below. In general, the ADRs in pJIA and sJIA patients were similar in type to those seen in RA patients, see section 4.8.

ADRs in the pJIA and sJIA patients treated with tocilizumab are listed in the Table 3 and presented by  MedDRA system organ class. The corresponding frequency category for each ADR is based on the  following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10) or uncommon (≥ 1/1 000  to &lt; 1/100).

discomfort, arthralgia and headache

## pJIA Patients

The safety profile of intravenous tocilizumab in pJIA has been studied in 188 patients from 2 to 17 years of age. The total patient exposure was 184.4 patient years. The frequency of ADRs in pJIA patients can be found in Table 3. The types of ADRs in pJIA patients were similar to those seen in RA and sJIA patients, see section 4.8. When compared to the adult RA population, events of nasopharyngitis, headache, nausea, and decreased neutrophil count were more frequently reported in the pJIA population. Events of cholesterol increased were less frequently reported in the pJIA population than in the adult RA population.

## Infections

The rate of infections in the tocilizumab all exposure population was 163.7 per 100 patient years. The most common events observed were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. The rate of serious infections was numerically higher in patients weighing &lt;30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (12.2 per 100 patient years) compared to patients weighing ≥30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (4.0 per 100 patient years). The incidence of infections leading to dose interruptions was also numerically higher in patients weighing &lt;30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (21.4%) compared to patients weighing ≥30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (7.6%).

## Infusion Related Reactions

In pJIA patients, infusion related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. In the tocilizumab all exposure population, 11 patients (5.9%) experienced infusion related reactions during the infusion and 38 patients (20.2%) experienced an event within 24 hours of an infusion. The most common events occurring during infusion were headache, nausea and hypotension and within 24 hours of infusion were dizziness and hypotension. In general, the adverse drug reactions observed during or within 24 hours of an infusion were similar in nature to those seen in RA and sJIA patients, see section 4.8.

No clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation were reported.

## Neutrophils

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, a decrease in neutrophil count below 1 × 10 9 /L occurred in 3.7% of patients.

## Platelets

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, 1% of patients had a decrease in platelet count to ≤ 50 × 10 3 /µL without associated bleeding events.

## Hepatic transaminase elevations

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, elevation in ALT or AST ≥ 3xULN occurred in 3.7% and &lt;1% of patients, respectively.

## Lipid parameters

During routine laboratory monitoring in the intravenous tocilizumab study WA19977 3.4% and 10.4%  of patients experienced a post-baseline elevation of their LDL-cholesterol value to ≥ 130 mg/dL and  total cholesterol value to ≥ 200 mg/dL at any time during the study treatment, respectively.

## sJIA Patients

The safety profile of intravenous tocilizumab in sJIA has been studied in 112 patients from 2 to 17 years of age. In the 12 week double-blind, controlled phase, 75 patients received treatment with tocilizumab (8 mg/kg or 12 mg/kg based upon body weight). After 12 weeks or at the time of switching to tocilizumab, due to disease worsening, patients were treated in the open label extension phase.

In general, the ADRs in sJIA patients were similar in type to those seen in RA patients, see section 4.8.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The frequency of ADRs in sJIA patients can be found in Table 3. When compared to the adult RA population, patients with sJIA experienced a higher frequency of nasopharyngitis, decrease in neutrophil counts, hepatic transaminases increased, and diarrhea. Events of cholesterol increased were less frequently reported in the sJIA population than in the adult RA population.

## Infections

In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of all infections in the intravenous tocilizumab group was 344.7 per 100 patient years and 287.0 per 100 patient years in the placebo group. In the open label extension phase (Part II), the overall rate of infections remained similar at 306.6 per 100 patient years.

In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of serious infections in the intravenous tocilizumab group was 11.5 per 100 patient years. At one year in the open label extension phase the overall rate of serious infections remained stable at 11.3 per 100 patient years. Reported serious infections were similar to those seen in RA patients with the addition of varicella and otitis media.

## Infusion Related Reactions

Infusion related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. In the 12 week controlled phase, 4% of patients from the tocilizumab group experienced events occurring during infusion. One event (angioedema) was considered serious and life-threatening, and the patient was discontinued from study treatment.

In the 12 week controlled phase, 16% of patients in the tocilizumab group and 5.4% of patients in the placebo group experienced an event within 24 hours of infusion. In the tocilizumab group, the events included, but were not limited to rash, urticaria, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, arthralgia and headache. One of these events, urticaria, was considered serious.

Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation, were reported in 1 out of 112 patients (&lt; 1%) treated with tocilizumab during the controlled and up to and including the open label clinical trial.

## Neutrophils

During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, a decrease in neutrophil counts below 1 x 10 9 /L occurred in 7% of patients in the tocilizumab group, and no decreases in the placebo group.

In the open label extension phase, decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 10 9 /L, occurred in 15% of the tocilizumab group.

## Platelets

During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, 3% of patients in the placebo group and 1% in the tocilizumab group had a decrease in platelet count to ≤ 100 x 10 3 /µL.

In the open label extension phase, decreases in platelet counts below 100 x 10 3 /µL, occurred in 3% of patients in the tocilizumab group, without associated bleeding events.

## Hepatic transaminase elevations

During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, elevation in ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 5% and 3% of patients, respectively, in the tocilizumab group, and 0% in  the placebo group.

In the open label extension phase, elevation in ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 12% and 4% of patients, respectively, in the tocilizumab group.

## Immunoglobulin G

IgG levels decrease during therapy. A decrease to the lower limit of normal occurred in 15 patients at some point in the study.

## Lipid parameters

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase (study WA18221), 13.4% and 33.3% of patients experienced a post-baseline elevation of their LDL-cholesterol value to ≥ 130 mg/dL  and total cholesterol value to ≥ 200 mg/dL at any time during study treatment, respectively.

In the open label extension phase (study WA18221), 13.2% and 27.7% of patients experienced a postbaseline elevation of their LDL-cholesterol value to ≥ 130 mg/dL and total cholesterol value to ≥ 200 mg/dL at any time during study treatment, respectively.

## CRS Patients

The safety of tocilizumab in CRS has been evaluated in a retrospective analysis of data from clinical trials, where 51 patients were treated with intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (12 mg/kg for patients less than 30 kg) with or without additional high-dose corticosteroids for severe or life-threatening CAR Tcell-induced CRS. A median of 1 dose of tocilizumab (range, 1-4 doses) was administered.

## Immunogenicity

Anti-tocilizumab antibodies may develop during tocilizumab treatment. Correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse events may be observed.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There are limited data available on overdose with tocilizumab. One case of accidental overdose was reported in which a patient with multiple myeloma received a single dose of 40 mg/kg. No adverse reactions were observed.

No serious adverse reactions were observed in healthy volunteers who received a single dose up to 28 mg/kg, although dose limiting neutropenia was observed.

## Paediatric population

No case of an overdose in the paediatric population has been observed.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Interleukin inhibitors; ATC code: L04AC07.

Avtozma is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency https://www.ema.europa.eu.

## Mechanism of action

Tocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL6R). Tocilizumab has been shown to inhibit sIL-6R and mIL-6R-mediated signalling. IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, monocytes and fibroblasts. IL-6 is involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell activation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, induction of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis and stimulation of haemopoiesis. IL-6 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases including inflammatory diseases, osteoporosis and neoplasia.

Pharmacodynamic effects

In clinical studies with RA patients treated with tocilizumab, rapid decreases in CRP, erythrocyte

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sedimentation rate (ESR), serum amyloid A (SAA) and fibrinogen were observed. Consistent with the effect on acute phase reactants, treatment with tocilizumab was associated with reduction in platelet count within the normal range. Increases in haemoglobin levels were observed, through tocilizumab decreasing the IL-6 driven effects on hepcidin production to increase iron availability. In tocilizumabtreated patients, decreases in the levels of CRP to within normal ranges were seen as early  as week 2, with decreases maintained while on treatment.

In healthy subjects administered tocilizumab in doses from 2 to 28 mg/kg, absolute neutrophil counts decreased to their lowest 3 to 5 days following administration. Thereafter, neutrophils recovered towards baseline in a dose dependent manner. Rheumatoid arthritis patients demonstrated a similar pattern of absolute neutrophil counts following tocilizumab administration (see section 4.8).

In COVID-19 patients with one dose of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg administered intravenously, decreases in the levels of CRP to within normal ranges were seen as early as Day 7.

## RA Patients

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy of tocilizumab in alleviating the signs and symptoms of RA was assessed in five randomised, double-blind, multi-centre studies. Studies I-V enrolled patients ≥ 18 years of age with active RA diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and who had at least eight tender and six swollen joints at baseline.

In Study I, tocilizumab was administered intravenously every four weeks as monotherapy. In Studies II, III and V, tocilizumab was administered intravenously every four weeks in combination with MTX vs. placebo and MTX. In Study IV, tocilizumab was administered intravenously every 4 weeks in combination with other DMARDs vs. placebo and other DMARDs. The primary endpoint for each of the five studies was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.

Study I evaluated 673 patients who had not been treated with MTX within six months prior to randomisation and who had not discontinued previous MTX treatment as a result of clinically important toxic effects or lack of response. The majority (67%) of patients were MTX-naïve. Doses of 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab were given every four weeks as monotherapy. The comparator group was weekly MTX (dose titrated from 7.5 mg to a maximum of 20 mg weekly over an eight week period).

Study II, a two year study with planned analyses at week 24, week 52 and week 104, evaluated 1 196 patients who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Doses of 4 or 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab or placebo were given every four weeks as blinded therapy for 52 weeks in combination with stable MTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly). After week 52, all patients could receive open-label treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg. Of the patients who completed the study who were originally randomised to placebo + MTX, 86% received open-label tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in year 2. The primary endpoint at week 24 was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response. At week 52 and week 104 the co-primary endpoints were prevention of joint damage and improvement in physical function.

Study III evaluated 623 patients who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Doses of 4 or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo were given every four weeks, in combination with stable MTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly).

Study IV evaluated 1 220 patients who had an inadequate response to their existing rheumatologic therapy, including one or more DMARDs. Doses of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo were given every four weeks in combination with stable DMARDs.

Study V evaluated 499 patients who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to one or more TNF antagonist therapies. The TNF antagonist therapy was discontinued prior to randomisation. Doses of 4 or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo were given every four weeks in combination with stable MTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly).

## Clinical response

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In all studies, patients treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg had statistically significant higher ACR 20, 50, 70 response rates at 6 months compared to control (Table 4). In study I, superiority of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg was demonstrated against the active comparator MTX.

The treatment effect was similar in patients independent of rheumatoid factor status, age, gender, race, number of prior treatments or disease status. Time to onset was rapid (as early as week 2) and the magnitude of response continued to improve with duration of treatment. Continued durable responses were seen for over 3 years in the open label extension studies I-V.

In patients treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg, significant improvements were noted on all individual components of the ACR response including: tender and swollen joint counts; patients and physician global assessment; disability index scores; pain assessment and CRP compared to patients receiving placebo plus MTX or other DMARDs in all studies.

Patients in studies I - V had a mean Disease Activity Score (DAS28) of 6.5-6.8 at baseline. Significant reduction in DAS28 from baseline (mean improvement) of 3.1-3.4 were observed in tocilizumab-treated patients compared to control patients (1.3-2.1). The proportion of patients achieving a DAS28 clinical remission (DAS28 &lt; 2.6) was significantly higher in patients receiving tocilizumab (28-34%) compared to 1-12% of control patients at 24 weeks. In study II, 65% of patients achieved a DAS28 &lt; 2.6 at week 104 compared to 48% at 52 weeks and 33% of patients at week 24.

In a pooled analysis of studies II, III and IV, the proportion of patients achieving an ACR 20, 50 and 70 response was significantly higher (59% vs. 50%, 37% vs. 27%, 18% vs. 11%, respectively) in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD vs. the tocilizumab 4 mg/kg plus DMARD group (p&lt; 0.03). Similarly the proportion of patients achieving a DAS28 remission (DAS28 &lt; 2.6) was significantly higher (31% vs. 16% respectively) in patients receiving tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD than in patients receiving tocilizumab 4 mg/kg plus DMARD (p&lt; 0.0001).

## Major Clinical Response

After 2 years of treatment with tocilizumab plus MTX, 14% of patients achieved a major clinical  response (maintenance of an ACR70 response for 24 weeks or more).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Radiographic response

In Study II, in patients with an inadequate response to MTX, inhibition of structural joint damage was  assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified Sharp score and its components, the  erosion score and joint space narrowing score. Inhibition of joint structural damage was shown with significantly less radiographic progression in patients receiving tocilizumab compared to control  (Table 5).

In the open-label extension of Study II the inhibition of progression of structural joint damage in tocilizumab plus MTX-treated patients was maintained in the second year of treatment. The mean change from baseline at week 104 in total Sharp-Genant score was significantly lower for patients randomised to tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus MTX (p&lt;0.0001) compared with patients who were randomised to placebo plus MTX.

Following 1 year of treatment with tocilizumab plus MTX, 85% of patients (n=348) had no progression of structural joint damage, as defined by a change in the Total Sharp Score of zero or less,  compared with 67% of placebo plus MTX-treated patients (n=290) (p ≤ 0.001). This remained consistent following 2 years of treatment (83%; n=353). Ninety three percent (93%; n=271) of patients  had no progression between week 52 and week 104.

## Health-related and quality of life outcomes

Tocilizumab-treated patients reported an improvement in all patient-reported outcomes (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index - HAQ-DI), Short Form-36 and Functional Assessment of  Chronic Illness Therapy questionnaires. Statistically significant improvements in HAQ-DI scores were  observed in patients treated with tocilizumab compared with patients treated with DMARDs. During  the open-label period of Study II, the improvement in physical function has been maintained for up to  2 years. At Week 52, the mean change in HAQ-DI was -0.58 in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus MTX  group compared with -0.39 in the placebo + MTX group. The mean change in HAQ-DI was  maintained at Week 104 in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus MTX group (-0.61).

## Haemoglobin levels

Statistically significant improvements in haemoglobin levels were observed with tocilizumab compared with DMARDs (p&lt; 0.0001) at week 24. Mean haemoglobin levels increased by week 2 and  remained within normal range through to week 24.

## Tocilizumab versus adalimumab in monotherapy

Study VI (WA19924), a 24 week double-blinded study that compared tocilizumab monotherapy with  adalimumab monotherapy, evaluated 326 patients with RA who were intolerant of MTX or where  continued treatment with MTX was considered inappropriate (including MTX inadequate responders). Patients in the tocilizumab arm received an intravenous (IV) infusion of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) every 4  weeks (q4w) and a subcutaneous (SC) placebo injection every 2 weeks (q2w). Patients in the  adalimumab arm received an adalimumab SC injection (40 mg) q2w plus an IV placebo infusion q4w.  A statistically significant superior treatment effect was seen in favour of

tocilizumab over adalimumab  in control of disease activity from baseline to week 24 for the primary endpoint of change in DAS28  and for all secondary endpoints (Table 6).

The overall clinical adverse event profile was similar between tocilizumab and adalimumab. The proportion of patients with serious adverse events was balanced between the treatment groups (tocilizumab 11.7% vs. adalimumab 9.9%). The types of adverse drug reactions in the tocilizumab arm  were consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab and adverse drug reactions were reported  at a similar frequency compared with Table 1. A higher incidence of infections and infestations was  reported in the tocilizumab arm (48% vs. 42%), with no difference in the incidence of serious  infections (3.1%). Both study treatments induced the same pattern of changes in laboratory safety  parameters (decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts, increases in ALT, AST and lipids), however,  the magnitude of change and the frequency of marked abnormalities was higher with tocilizumab  compared with adalimumab. Four (2.5%) patients in the tocilizumab arm and two (1.2%) patients in  the adalimumab arm experienced CTC grade 3 or 4 neutrophil count decreases. Eleven (6.8%) patients  in the tocilizumab arm and five (3.1%) patients in the adalimumab arm experienced ALT increases of CTC grade 2 or higher.  The mean LDL increase from baseline was 0.64 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) for patients in the tocilizumab arm and 0.19 mmol/L (7 mg/dL) for patients in the adalimumab arm. The safety observed in the tocilizumab arm was consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab and no new or unexpected adverse drug reactions were observed (see Table 1).

## MTX naïve, Early RA

Study VII (WA19926), a 2 year study with the planned primary analysis at week 52 evaluated 1 162 MTX-naïve adult patients with moderate to severe, active early RA (mean disease duration ≤ 6 months). Approximately 20% of patients had received prior treatment with DMARDs other than MTX.  This study evaluated the efficacy of IV tocilizumab 4 or 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks/MTX combination  therapy, IV tocilizumab 8 mg/kg monotherapy and MTX monotherapy in reducing the signs and symptoms and rate of progression of joint damage for 104 weeks. The primary endpoint was  the proportion of patients achieving DAS28 remission (DAS28 &lt; 2.6) at week 24. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg + MTX and tocilizumab monotherapy groups met the primary endpoint compared with MTX alone. The tocilizumab 8 mg/kg + MTX group also showed statistically significant results across the key secondary endpoints. Numerically greater responses compared with MTX alone were observed in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg monotherapy group in  all secondary endpoints, including radiographic endpoints. In this study, ACR/EULAR remission (Boolean and Index) were also analysed as pre-specified exploratory endpoints, with higher responses

## COVID-19

## Clinical Efficacy

## RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) Collaborative Group Study in Hospitalized Adults Diagnosed with COVID-19

RECOVERY was a large, randomised, controlled, open-label, multi-center platform study conducted in the United Kingdom to evaluate the efficacy and safety of potential treatments in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19. All eligible patients received usual care and underwent an initial (main) randomisation. Eligible patients for the trial had clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and no medical contraindications to any of the treatments. Patients with clinical evidence of progressive COVID-19 (defined as oxygen saturation &lt;92% on room air or receiving oxygen therapy, and CRP ≥75 mg/L) qualified for a second randomisation to receive either intravenous tocilizumab or usual care alone.

Efficacy analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprising 4 116 patients who  were randomised with 2 022 patients in the tocilizumab + usual care arm and 2 094 patients in the usual  care alone arm. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the ITT population were well  balanced across treatment arms. The mean age of participants was 63.6 years (standard deviation [SD] 13.6 years). The majority of patients were male (67%) and White (76%). The median (range) level of  CRP was 143 mg/L (75-982).

At baseline, 0.2% (n=9) of patients were not on supplemental oxygen, 45% of patients required low flow oxygen, 41% of patients required non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen and 14% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation; 82% were reported receiving systemic corticosteroids (defined as patients who initiated treatment with systemic corticosteroids either prior to or at the time of randomisation). The most common comorbidities were diabetes (28.4%), heart disease (22.6%) and chronic lung disease (23.3%).

The primary outcome was time to death through Day 28. The hazard ratio comparing the tocilizumab + usual care arm to the usual care alone arm was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.76 to 0.94), a statistically significant result (p = 0.0028). The probabilities of dying by Day 28 were estimated to be 30.7% and 34.9% in the tocilizumab and usual care arms, respectively. The risk difference was estimated to be -4.1% (95% CI: -7.0%  to  -1.3%),  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis.  The  hazard  ratio  among  the  pre-specified subgroup of patients receiving systemic corticosteroids at baseline was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70 to 0.89),  and for the pre-specified subgroup not receiving systemic corticosteroids at baseline was 1.16 (95%  CI: 0.91 to 1.48).

The median time to hospital discharge was 19 days in the tocilizumab+ usual care arm and &gt;28 days in the usual care arm (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 1.22 [1.12 to 1.33]).

Among patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, the proportion of patients who required mechanical ventilation or died by Day 28 was 35% (619/1754) in the tocilizumab + usual care arm and 42% (754/1800) in the usual care alone arm (risk ratio [95% CI] = 0.84, [0.77 to 0.92] p&lt;0.0001).

Paediatric population sJIA Patients Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of tocilizumab for the treatment of active sJIA was assessed in a 12 week randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, two arm study. Patients included in the trial had a total disease duration of at least 6 months and active disease but were not experiencing an acute flare requiring corticosteroid doses of more than 0.5 mg/kg prednisone equivalent. Efficacy for the treatment of macrophage activation syndrome has not been investigated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients (treated with or without MTX) were randomised (tocilizumab:placebo = 2:1) to one of two treatment groups, 75 patients received tocilizumab infusions every two weeks, either 8 mg/kg for patients ≥ 30 kg or 12 mg/kg for patients &lt; 30 kg and 37 patients were assigned to receiving placebo infusions every two weeks. Corticosteroid tapering was permitted from week six for patients who achieved a JIA ACR70 response. After 12 weeks or at the time of escape, due to disease worsening, patients were treated in the open label phase at weight appropriate dosing.

## Clinical response

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with at least 30% improvement in the JIA ACR core set (JIA ACR30 response) at week 12 and absence of fever (no temperature recording ≥ 37.5°C in the preceding 7 days). Eighty five percent (64/75) of tocilizumab treated patients and 24.3% (9/37) of placebo treated patients achieved this endpoint. These proportions were highly significantly different (p&lt;0.0001).

The percent of patients achieving JIA ACR 30, 50, 70 and 90 responses are shown in Table 8.

Table 8. JIA ACR response rates at week 12 (% patients)

| Response Rate   | Tocilizumab N = 75   | Placebo N = 37   |
|-----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| JIA ACR 30      | 90.7% 1              | 24.3%            |
| JIA ACR 50      | 85.3% 1              | 10.8%            |
| JIA ACR 70      | 70.7% 1              | 8.1%             |
| JIA ACR 90      | 37.3% 1              | 5.4%             |

1 p&lt;0.0001, tocilizumab vs. placebo

## Systemic Effects

In the tocilizumab treated patients, 85% who had fever due to sJIA at baseline were free of fever (no temperature recording ≥ 37.5°C in the preceding 14 days) at week 12 versus 21% of placebo patients (p&lt;0.0001).

The adjusted mean change in the pain VAS after 12 weeks of tocilizumab treatment was a reduction of 41 points on a scale of 0 - 100 compared to a reduction of 1 for placebo patients (p&lt;0.0001).

## Corticosteroid Tapering

Patients achieving a JIA ACR70 response were permitted corticosteroid dose reduction. Seventeen (24%) tocilizumab treated patients versus 1 (3%) placebo patient were able to reduce their dose of corticosteroid by at least 20% without experiencing a subsequent JIA ACR30 flare or occurrence of systemic symptoms to week 12 (p=0.028). Reductions in corticosteroids continued, with 44 patients off oral corticosteroids at week 44, while maintaining JIA ACR responses.

## Health related and quality of life outcomes

At week 12, the proportion of tocilizumab treated patients showing a minimally clinically important improvement in the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (defined as an individual total score decrease of ≥ 0.13) was significantly higher than in placebo treated patients, 77% versus 19% (p&lt;0.0001).

## Laboratory Parameters

Fifty out of seventy five (67%) tocilizumab treated patients had a haemoglobin &lt; LLN at baseline. Forty (80%) of these patients had an increase in their haemoglobin to within the normal range at week 12, in comparison to 2 out of 29 (7%) of placebo treated patients with haemoglobin &lt; LLN at baseline (p&lt;0.0001).

## pJIA Patients Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of tocilizumab was assessed in a three-part study WA19977 including an open-label extension in children with active pJIA. Part I consisted of a 16-week active tocilizumab treatment lead-in period (n=188) followed by Part II, a 24-week randomised double-blind placebo-controlled

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

withdrawal period (n=163), followed by Part III, a 64-week open-label period. In Part 1, eligible patients ≥ 30 kg received tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks for 4 doses. Patients &lt; 30 kg were randomised 1:1 to receive either tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks for 4 doses. Patients who completed Part I of the study and achieved at least a JIA ACR30 response at week 16 compared to baseline were eligible to enter the blinded withdrawal period (Part II) of the study. In Part II, patients were randomised to tocilizumab (same dose received in Part I) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by concurrent MTX use and concurrent corticosteroid use. Each patient continued in Part II of the study until Week 40 or until the patient satisfied JIA ACR30 flare criteria (relative to Week 16) and qualified for escape to tocilizumab therapy (same dose received in Part I).

## Clinical response

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a JIA ACR30 flare at week 40 relative to week 16. Forty eight percent (48.1%, 39/81) of the patients treated with placebo flared compared with 25.6% (21/82) of tocilizumab treated patients. These proportions were statistically significantly different (p=0.0024).

At the conclusion of Part I, JIA ACR 30/50/70/90 responses were 89.4%, 83.0%, 62.2%, and 26.1%, respectively.

During the withdrawal phase (Part II), the percentage of patients achieving JIA ACR 30, 50, and 70 responses at Week 40 relative to baseline are shown in Table 9. In this statistical analysis, patients who flared (and escaped to TCZ) during Part II or who withdrew, were classified as non-responders. An additional analyses of JIA ACR responses, considering observed data at Week 40, regardless of flare status, showed that by Week 40, 95.1% of patients who had received continuous TCZ therapy, had achieved JIA ACR30 or higher.

The number of active joints was significantly reduced compared to baseline in patients receiving tocilizumab compared to placebo (adjusted mean changes of -14.3 vs -11.4, p=0.0435). The physician's global assessment of disease activity, as measured on a 0-100 mm scale, showed a greater reduction in disease activity for tocilizumab compared to placebo (adjusted mean changes of -45.2 mm vs -35.2 mm, p=0.0031).

The adjusted mean change in the pain VAS after 40 weeks of tocilizumab treatment was 32.4 mm on a 0-100 mm scale compared to a reduction of 22.3 mm for placebo patients (highly statistically significant; p=0.0076).

The ACR response rates were numerically lower for patients with prior biologic treatment as shown in Table 10 below.

Patients randomised to tocilizumab had fewer ACR30 flares and higher overall ACR responses than patients receiving placebo regardless of a history of prior biologic use.

## CRS

The efficacy of tocilizumab for the treatment of CRS was assessed in a retrospective analysis of data from clinical trials of CAR T-cell therapies (tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel) for haematological malignancies. Evaluable patients had been treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (12 mg/kg for patients &lt; 30 kg) with or without additional high-dose corticosteroids for severe or life-threatening CRS; only the first episode of CRS was included in the analysis. The efficacy population  for the tisagenlecleucel cohort included 28 males and 23 females (total 51 patients) of median age 17  years (range, 3-68 years). The median time from start of CRS to first dose of tocilizumab was 3 days  (range, 0-18 days). Resolution of CRS was defined as lack of fever and off vasopressors for at least 24  hours. Patients were considered responders if CRS resolved within 14 days of the first dose of  tocilizumab, if no more than 2 doses of tocilizumab were needed, and no drugs other than tocilizumab  and corticosteroids were used for treatment. Thirty-nine patients (76.5%; 95% CI: 62.5%-87.2%)  achieved a response. In an independent cohort of 15 patients (range: 9-75 years old) with axicabtagene ciloleucel-induced CRS, 53% responded.

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with tocilizumab in all subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of cytokine release syndrome associated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy.

## COVID-19

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with tocilizumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of COVID-19.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Intravenous use

## RA Patients

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on  a database composed of 3 552 RA patients treated with a one-hour infusion of 4 or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab every 4 weeks for 24 weeks or with 162 mg tocilizumab given subcutaneously either once a week or every other week for 24 weeks.

The following parameters (predicted mean ± SD) were estimated for a dose of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab given every 4 weeks: steady-state area under curve (AUC) = 38 000 ± 13 000 h µg/mL, trough concentration (Cmin) = 15.9 ± 13.1 µ g/mL and maximum concentration (Cmax) = 182 ± 50.4 µg/mL, and the accumulation ratios for AUC and Cmax were small, 1.32 and 1.09, respectively. The accumulation ratio was higher for Cmin (2.49), which was expected based on the non-linear clearance contribution at lower concentrations. Steady-state was reached following the first administration for Cmax and after 8 and 20 weeks for AUC and Cmin, respectively. Tocilizumab AUC, Cmin and Cmax increased with increase of body weight. At body weight ≥ 100 kg, the predicted mean (± SD) steadystate AUC, Cmin and Cmax of tocilizumab were 50 000 ± 16 800 μg·h/mL, 24.4 ± 17.5 μg/mL, and 226 ± 50.3 μg/mL, respectively, which are higher than mean exposure values for the patient population (i.e. all body weights) reported above. The dose-response curve for tocilizumab flattens at higher exposure, resulting in smaller efficacy gains for each incremental increase in tocilizumab concentration such that clinically meaningful increases in efficacy were not demonstrated in patients treated with &gt; 800 mg of tocilizumab. Therefore, tocilizumab doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

not recommended (see section 4.2).

## COVID-19 Patients

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab was characterized using a population pharmacokinetic analysis of a database composed of 380 adult COVID-19 patients in Study WA42380 (COVACTA) and Study CA42481 (MARIPOSA) that treated with a single infusion of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab or two infusions separated by at least 8 hours. The following parameters (predicted mean+SD) were estimated for a dose of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab: area under curve over 28 days (AUC0-28) = 18 312 (5 184) hour·µg/mL, concentration at Day 28 (Cday28) = 0.934 (1.93) µg/mL and maximum concentration (Cmax) = 154 (34.9) µg/mL. The AUC0-28, Cday28 and Cmax, following two doses of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab  separated by 8 hours, were also estimated (predicted mean +SD): 42 240 (11 520) hour·µg/mL and 8.94 (8.5) µg/mL, and 296 (64.7) µg/mL respectively.

## Distribution

In RA patients the central volume of distribution was 3.72 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 3.35 L resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 7.07 L.

In COVID-19 adult patients, the central volume of distribution was 4.52 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 4.23 L, resulting in a volume of distribution of 8.75 L.

## Elimination

Following intravenous administration, tocilizumab undergoes a dual elimination from the circulation, one following a linear clearance and one following a concentration-dependent non-linear clearance. In RA patients, the linear clearance was 9.5 mL/h. In COVID-19 adult patients, the linear clearance was 17.6 mL/h in patients with baseline ordinal scale category 3 (OS 3, patients requiring supplemental oxygen), 22.5 mL/h in patients with baseline OS 4 (patients requiring high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation), 29 mL/h in patients with baseline OS 5 (patients requiring mechanical ventilation), and 35.4 mL/h in patients with baseline OS 6 (patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or mechanical ventilation and additional organ support). The concentration-dependent non-linear clearance plays a major role at low tocilizumab concentrations. Once the non-linear clearance pathway is saturated, at higher tocilizumab concentrations, clearance is mainly determined by the linear clearance.

In RA patients, the t1/2  of tocilizumab was concentration-dependent. At steady-state following a dose of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks, the effective t1/2 decreased with decreasing concentrations within a dosing interval from 18 days to 6 days.

In COVID-19 patients, serum concentrations were below the limit of quantification after 35 days on average following one infusion of tocilizumab IV 8 mg/kg.

## Linearity

Pharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab did not change with time. A more than dose-proportional increase in the AUC and Cmin was observed for doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Cmax increased dose-proportionally. At steady-state, predicted AUC and Cmin were 3.2 and 30 fold higher at 8 mg/kg as compared to 4 mg/kg, respectively.

## Special populations

Renal impairment: No formal study of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab has been conducted. Most of the patients in the population pharmacokinetic analysis had normal renal function or mild renal impairment. Mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance based on Cockcroft-Gault &lt; 80 mL/min and ≥ 50 mL/min) did not impact the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab.

Hepatic impairment: No formal study of the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab has been conducted.

Age, gender and ethnicity : Population pharmacokinetic analyses in RA and COVID-19 patients, showed that age, gender and ethnic origin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

severity are both covariates which have an appreciable impact on the linear clearance of tocilizumab.

## sJIA Patients:

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on a database composed of 140 sJIA patients treated with 8 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks (patients with a body  weight ≥ 30 kg) 12 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks (patients with a body weight &lt; 30 kg), 162 mg SC every  week (patients weighing ≥ 30 kg), 162 mg SC every 10 days or every 2 weeks (patients weighing  below 30 kg).

Table 11. Predicted mean ± SD PK parameters at steady-state after IV dosing in sJIA

| Tocilizumab PK Parameter       | 8 mg/kgQ2W ≥ 30 kg   | 12 mg/kgQ2W below 30 kg   |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|

| C trough (µg/mL)               | 69.7 ± 29.1          | 68.4 ± 30.0               |
| C mean (µg/mL)                 | 119 ± 36.0           | 123 ± 36.0                |
| Accumulation C max             | 1.42                 | 1.37                      |
| Accumulation C trough          | 3.20                 | 3.41                      |
| Accumulation C mean or AUC τ * | 2.01                 | 1.95                      |

After IV dosing, approximately 90% of the steady-state was reached by week 8 for both the 12 mg/kg (BW &lt; 30 kg) and 8 mg/kg Q2W (BW ≥ 30 kg) regimens.

In sJIA patients, the central volume of distribution was 1.87 L and the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.14 L resulting in a volume of distribution at a steady state of 4.01 L. The linear clearance estimated as a parameter in the population pharmacokinetic analysis, was 5.7 mL/h.

The half-life of tocilizumab in sJIA patients is up to 16 days for the two body weight categories (8 mg/kg for body weight ≥ 30 kg or 12 mg/kg for body weight &lt; 30 kg) at week 12.

## pJIA Patients:

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab in pJIA patients was characterized by a population pharmacokinetic analysis which included 237 patients who were treated with 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (patients weighing ≥ 30 kg), 10 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg), 162 mg SC every 2 weeks (patients weighing ≥ 30 kg), or 162 mg SC every 3 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg).

| C mean (µg/mL)                 | 42.2 ± 13.4          | 31.6 ± 7.84               |
| Accumulation C max             | 1.04                 | 1.01                      |
| Accumulation C trough          | 2.22                 | 1.43                      |
| Accumulation C mean or AUC τ * | 1.16                 | 1.05                      |

After IV dosing, approximately 90% of the steady-state was reached by week 12 for the 10 mg/kg (BW &lt; 30 kg), and by week 16 for the 8 mg/kg (BW ≥ 30 kg) dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The half-life of tocilizumab in pJIA patients is up to 16 days for the two body weight categories (8 mg/kg for body weight ≥ 30 kg or 10 mg/kg for body weight &lt; 30 kg) during a dosing interval at steady state.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity.

Carcinogenicity studies were not performed because IgG1 monoclonal antibodies are not deemed to have intrinsic carcinogenic potential.

Available non-clinical data demonstrated the effect of IL-6 on malignant progression and apoptosis resistance to various cancer types. This data does not suggest a relevant risk for cancer initiation and progression under tocilizumab treatment. Additionally, proliferative lesions were not observed in a 6-month chronic toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys or in IL-6 deficient mice.

Available non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility under tocilizumab treatment. Effects on endocrine active and reproductive system organs were not observed in a chronic cynomolgus monkey toxicity study and reproductive performance was not affected in IL-6 deficient mice. Tocilizumab administered to cynomolgus monkeys during early gestation, was observed to have no direct or indirect harmful effect on pregnancy or embryonal-foetal development. However, a slight increase in abortion/embryonal-foetal death was observed with high systemic exposure (&gt; 100 x human exposure) in the 50 mg/kg/day high-dose group compared to placebo and other low-dose groups. Although IL-6 does not seem to be a critical cytokine for foetal growth or the immunological control of the maternal/foetal interface, a relation of this finding to tocilizumab cannot be excluded.

Treatment with a murine analogue did not exert toxicity in juvenile mice. In particular, there was no impairment of skeletal growth, immune function and sexual maturation.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

Avtozma, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for

- the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults not previously treated with MTX.
- the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in adult patients who have either responded  inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.

In these patients, Avtozma can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.

Avtozma has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray  and to improve physical function when given in combination with methotrexate.

## Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA)

Avtozma is indicated for the treatment of active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in patients 1 year of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with NSAIDs and systemic corticosteroids. Avtozma can be given as monotherapy (in case of intolerance to MTX

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or where treatment with MTX is inappropriate) or in combination with MTX.

## Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA)

Avtozma in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic polyarthritis (pJIA; rheumatoid factor positive or negative and extended oligoarthritis) in patients 2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with MTX. Avtozma can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.

## Giant cell arteritis (GCA)

Avtozma is indicated for the treatment of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) in adult patients.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Tocilizumab SC formulation is administered with a single-use pre-filled syringe with needle safety device.  Treatment should be  initiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of RA, sJIA, pJIA and / or GCA.

The first injection should be performed under the supervision of a qualified health care  professional. A patient or parent/guardian can self-inject Avtozma only if the physician determines  that it is appropriate and the patient or parent/guardian agrees to medical follow-up as necessary and  has been trained in proper injection technique.

Patients who transition from tocilizumab IV therapy to SC administration should administer the first SC dose at the time of the next scheduled IV dose under the supervision of a qualified health care professional.

All patients treated with Avtozma should be given the Patient Alert Card.

Suitability of the patient or parent/guardian for subcutaneous home use should be assessed and patients  or parent/guardian instructed to inform a healthcare professional before administering the next dose if  they experience symptoms of an allergic reaction. Patients should seek immediate medical attention if  developing symptoms of serious allergic reactions (see section 4.4).

## Posology

## RA

The recommended posology is subcutaneous 162 mg once every week.

Limited information is available regarding switching patients from Avtozma intravenous formulation to Avtozma subcutaneous fixed dose formulation. The once every week dosing interval should be followed.

Patients transitioning from intravenous to subcutaneous formulation should administer their first subcutaneous dose instead of the next scheduled intravenous dose under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.

## GCA

The recommended posology is subcutaneous 162 mg once every week in combination with a tapering course of glucocorticoids. Avtozma can be used alone following discontinuation of glucocorticoids. Avtozma monotherapy should not be used for the treatment of acute relapses (see 4.4).

Based upon the chronic nature of GCA, treatment beyond 52 weeks should be guided by disease activity, physician discretion, and patient choice.

## RA and GCA

Dose adjustments due to laboratory abnormalities (see section 4.4).

RA and GCA Missed dose

If a patient misses a subcutaneous weekly injection of Avtozma within 7 days of the scheduled dose, he/she should be instructed to take the missed dose on the next scheduled day. If a patient misses a subcutaneous once every other week injection of Avtozma within 7 days of the scheduled dose, he/she should be instructed to take the missed dose immediately and the next dose on the next

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

scheduled day.

## Special populations

## Elderly:

No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients &gt; 65 years of age.

## Renal impairment:

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Avtozma has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). Renal function should be  monitored closely in these patients.

## Hepatic impairment:

Avtozma has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dose recommendations can be made.

## Paediatric patients

The safety and efficacy of Avtozma subcutaneous formulation in children from birth to less than 1 year have not been established. No data are available.

A change in dose should only be based on a consistent change in the patient's body weight over time.  Avtozma can be used alone or in combination with MTX.

## sJIA Patients

The recommended posology in patients above 1 year of age is subcutaneous 162 mg once every week in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or subcutaneous 162 mg once every 2 weeks in patients weighing less than 30 kg.

Patients must have a minimum body weight of 10 kg when receiving Avtozma subcutaneously.

## pJIA Patients:

The recommended posology in patients above 2 years of age is subcutaneous 162 mg once every 2 weeks in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or subcutaneous 162 mg once every 3 weeks  in patients weighing less than 30 kg.

## Dose adjustments due to laboratory abnormalities (sJIA and pJIA)

If appropriate, the dose of concomitant MTX and/or other medications should be modified or dosing stopped and tocilizumab dosing interrupted until the clinical situation has been evaluated. As there are  many co-morbid conditions that may affect laboratory values in sJIA or pJIA, the decision to discontinue tocilizumab for a laboratory abnormality should be based upon the medical assessment of  the individual patient.

## · Liver enzyme abnormalities

| Laboratory Value    | Action                                                                                                                                         |

| < 50                                    | Discontinue Avtozma. The decision to discontinue Avtozma in sJIA or pJIA for a laboratory abnormality should be based on the medical assessment of the individual patient. |

Reduction of tocilizumab dosing frequency due to laboratory abnormalities has not been studied in sJIA or pJIA patients.

The safety and efficacy of Avtozma subcutaneous formulation in children with conditions other than  sJIA or pJIA have not been established.

Available data with the IV formulation suggest that clinical improvement is observed within 12 weeks  of initiation of treatment with tocilizumab. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a  patient exhibiting no improvement within this timeframe.

## Missed dose

If a sJIA patient misses a subcutaneous weekly injection of Avtozma within 7 days of the scheduled dose, he/she should be instructed to take the missed dose on the next scheduled day. If a patient misses a subcutaneous once every 2 week injection of Avtozma within 7 days of the scheduled dose, he/she should be instructed to take the missed dose immediately and the next dose on the next scheduled day.

If a pJIA patient misses a subcutaneous injection of Avtozma within 7 days of the scheduled dose, he/she should take the missed dose as soon as they remember and take the next dose at the regular

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

scheduled time. If a patient misses a subcutaneous injection of Avtozma by more than 7 days of the scheduled dose or is unsure when to inject Avtozma, call the doctor or pharmacist.

## Method of administration

Avtozma is for subcutaneous use.

After proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Avtozma if their physician determines that it is appropriate. The total content (0.9 mL) of the pre-filled syringe should be administered as a subcutaneous injection. The recommended injection sites (abdomen, thigh and upper  arm) should be rotated and injections should never be given into moles, scars, or areas where the skin  is tender, bruised, red, hard, or not intact.

The pre-filled syringe should not be shaken.

Comprehensive instructions for the administration of Avtozma in a pre-filled syringe are given in the package leaflet, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Active, severe infections (see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Avtozma subcutaneous formulation is not intended for intravenous administration.

Avtozma subcutaneous formulation is not intended to be given to children with sJIA weighing less than 10 kg.

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Infections

Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including tocilizumab (see section 4.8, Undesirable effects). Avtozma treatment must not be initiated in patients with active infections (see section 4.3). Administration of tocilizumab should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection until the infection is controlled (see section 4.8). Healthcare professionals should exercise caution when considering the use of Avtozma in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions (e.g.) diverticulitis, diabetes and interstitial lung disease which may predispose patients to infections.

Vigilance for the timely detection of serious infection is recommended for patients receiving immunosuppressive agents such as Avtozma as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened, due to suppression of the acute phase reactants. The effects of tocilizumab on C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils and signs and symptoms of infection should be considered when evaluating  a patient for a potential infection. Patients (which includes younger children with sJIA or pJIA who  may be less able to communicate their symptoms) and parents/guardians of sJIA or pJIA patients,  should be instructed to contact their healthcare professional immediately when any symptoms  suggesting infection appear, in order to assure rapid evaluation and appropriate treatment.

## Tuberculosis

As recommended for other biological treatments, all patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis  (TB) infection prior to starting Avtozma therapy. Patients with latent TB should be treated with  standard anti-mycobacterial therapy before initiating Avtozma. Prescribers are reminded of the risk  of false negative tuberculin skin and interferon-gamma TB blood test results, especially in patients  who are severely ill or immunocompromised.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients and parents/guardians of sJIA or pJIA patients should be advised to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade (fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during or after therapy with Avtozma.

## Viral reactivation

Viral reactivation (e.g. hepatitis B virus) has been reported with biologic therapies for RA. In clinical studies with tocilizumab, patients who screened positive for hepatitis were excluded.

## Complications of diverticulitis

Events of diverticular perforations as complications of diverticulitis have been reported uncommonly in patients treated with tocilizumab (see section 4.8). Avtozma should be used with caution in patients with previous history of intestinal ulceration or diverticulitis. Patients presenting with symptoms potentially indicative of complicated diverticulitis, such as abdominal pain, haemorrhage and/or unexplained change in bowel habits with fever should be evaluated promptly for early identification of diverticulitis which can be associated with gastrointestinal perforation.

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis have been reported in association with tocilizumab (see section 4.8). Such reactions may be more severe, and potentially fatal in patients who  have experienced hypersensitivity reactions during previous treatment with Avtozma even if they  have received premedication with steroids and antihistamines. If an anaphylactic reaction or other  serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of Avtozma should be stopped immediately,  appropriate therapy initiated and Avtozma should be permanently discontinued.

## Active hepatic disease and hepatic impairment

Treatment with tocilizumab, particularly when administered concomitantly with MTX, may be associated with elevations in hepatic transaminases, therefore, caution should be exercised when considering treatment of patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).

## Hepatotoxicity

Transient or intermittent mild and moderate elevations of hepatic transaminases have been reported commonly with tocilizumab treatment (see section 4.8). An increased frequency of these elevations was observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) were used in combination with tocilizumab. When clinically indicated, other liver function tests including bilirubin should be considered.

Serious drug-induced liver injury, including acute liver failure, hepatitis and jaundice, have been observed with tocilizumab (see section 4.8). Serious hepatic injury occurred between 2 weeks to more  than 5 years after initiation of tocilizumab. Cases of liver failure resulting in liver transplantation have  been reported. Patients should be advised to immediately seek medical help if they experience signs and symptoms of hepatic injury.

Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of Avtozma treatment in patients with elevated ALT or AST &gt; 1.5 x ULN. In patients with baseline ALT or AST &gt; 5 x ULN, treatment is not  recommended.

In RA, GCA, pJIA and sJIA patients, ALT/AST should be monitored every 4 to 8 weeks for the first 6  months of treatment followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. For recommended modifications, including Avtozma discontinuation, based on transaminases levels see section 4.2. For ALT or AST elevations &gt; 3-5 x ULN, Avtozma treatment should be interrupted.

## Haematological abnormalities

Decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts have occurred following treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with MTX (see section 4.8). There may be an increased risk of neutropenia in patients who have previously been treated with a TNF antagonist.

In patients not previously treated with tocilizumab, initiation is not recommended in patients with an

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ANC below 2 x 10 9 /L. Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of Avtozma treatment in patients with a low platelet count (i.e. platelet count below 100 x 10 3 /μL). In patients who  develop an ANC &lt; 0.5 x 10 9 /L or a platelet count &lt; 50 x 10 3 /μL, continued treatment is not recommended.

Severe neutropenia may be associated with an increased risk of serious infections, although there has been no clear association between decreases in neutrophils and the occurrence of serious infections in clinical trials with tocilizumab to date.

In RA and GCA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and thereafter according to standard clinical practice. For recommended dose modifications based on ANC and platelet counts, see section 4.2.

In sJIA and pJIA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored at the time of the second administration and thereafter according to good clinical practice (see section 4.2).

## Lipid parameters

Elevations in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides were observed in patients treated with tocilizumab (see section  4.8). In the majority of patients, there was no increase in atherogenic indices, and elevations in total  cholesterol responded to treatment with lipid lowering agents.

In all patients, assessment of lipid parameters should be performed 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of  Avtozma therapy. Patients should be managed according to local clinical guidelines for management of hyperlipidaemia.

## Neurological disorders

Physicians should be vigilant for symptoms potentially indicative of new-onset central demyelinating disorders. The potential for central demyelination with Avtozma is currently unknown.

## Malignancy

The risk of malignancy is increased in patients with RA. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy.

## Vaccinations

Live and live attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with Avtozma as clinical safety has not been established. In a randomised open-label study, adult RA patients treated with tocilizumab  and MTX were able to mount an effective response to both the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide  and tetanus toxoid vaccines which was comparable to the response seen in patients on MTX only. It is recommended that all patients particularly paediatric or elderly patients, be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating Avtozma therapy. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of Avtozma therapy  should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents.

## Cardiovascular risk

RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders and should have risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care.

## Combination with TNF antagonists

There is no experience with the use of Avtozma with TNF antagonists or other biological treatments for RA patients. Avtozma is not recommended for use with other biological agents.

## GCA

Avtozma monotherapy should not be used for the treatment of acute relapses as efficacy in this setting has not been established. Glucocorticoids should be given according to medical judgement and  practice guidelines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## sJIA

Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a serious life-threatening disorder that may develop in sJIA patients. In clinical trials, tocilizumab has not been studied in patients during an episode of active  MAS.

## Excipients with known effect

## Polysorbate

Each 162 mg pre-filled syringe contains 0.2 mg of polysorbate 80.

Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Patients with polysorbate allergy should not take this medicine.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

Concomitant administration of a single dose of 10 mg/kg Avtozma with 10-25 mg MTX once weekly had no clinically significant effect on MTX exposure.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of MTX, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids on tocilizumab clearance in RA patients. In  GCA patients, no effect of cumulative corticosteroid dose on tocilizumab exposure was observed.

The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by cytokines, such as IL-6, that stimulate chronic inflammation. Thus, CYP450 expression may be reversed when potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, such as Avtozma, is introduced.

In vitro studies with cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 caused a reduction in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. tocilizumab normalises expression  of these enzymes.

In a study in RA patients, levels of simvastatin (CYP3A4) were decreased by 57% one week following  a single dose of tocilizumab, to the level similar to, or slightly higher than, those observed in healthy  subjects.

When starting or stopping therapy with tocilizumab, patients taking medicinal products which are individually adjusted and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2 or 2C9 (e.g. methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, (with the possibility for oral glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome), atorvastatin, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, ciclosporin, or benzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses may need to be increased to maintain therapeutic effect. Given its long elimination half-life (t1/2), the effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment.

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of Avtozma in pregnant women. A study in animals has shown an increased risk of spontaneous abortion/embryo-foetal death at a high dose (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown.

Avtozma should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.

## Breast-feeding

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is unknown whether tocilizumab is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of Avtozma in milk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or  to continue/discontinue therapy with Avtozma should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Avtozma therapy to the woman.

## Fertility

Available non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility under Avtozma treatment.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Tocilizumab has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8, dizziness).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety profile comes from 4 510 patients exposed to tocilizumab in clinical trials; the majority of these patients were participating in adult RA studies (n=4 009), while the remaining experience comes  from GCA (n=149), pJIA (n=240) and sJIA (n=112) studies. The safety profile of tocilizumab across  these indications remains similar and undifferentiated.

The most commonly reported Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) were upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension and increased ALT.

The most serious ADRs were serious infections, complications of diverticulitis, and hypersensitivity reactions.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

ADRs from clinical trials and/or post marketing experience with tocilizumab based on spontaneous case reports, literature cases and cases from non-interventional study programs are listed in Table 1 and are presented by MedDRA system organ class. The corresponding frequency category for each AR is based on the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100) rare, ( ≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000) or very rare (&lt; 1/10 000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

3 This adverse reaction was identified through post marketing surveillance but not observed in controlled clinical trials. The frequency category was estimated as the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval calculated on the basis of the total number of patients exposed to TCZ in clinical trials.

## Subcutaneous use

## RA

The safety of subcutaneous tocilizumab in RA includes a double-blind, controlled, multicenter study,  SC-I. SC-I was a non-inferiority study that compared the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab 162 mg  administered every week versus 8 mg/kg intravenous in 1 262 patients with RA. All patients received  background non-biologic DMARD(s). The safety and immunogenicity observed for tocilizumab  administered subcutaneous was consistent with the known safety profile of intravenous tocilizumab  and no new or unexpected adverse drug reactions were observed (see Table 1). A higher frequency of  injection site reactions was observed in the subcutaneous arms compared with placebo subcutaneous  injections in the intravenous arms.

## Injection site reactions

During the 6-month controlled period, in SC-I, the frequency of injection site reactions was 10.1%  (64/631) and 2.4% (15/631) for the subcutaneous tocilizumab and the subcutaneous placebo  (intravenous group) weekly injections, respectively. These injection site reactions (including  erythema, pruritus, pain and haematoma) were mild to moderate in severity. The majority was  resolved without any treatment and none necessitated drug discontinuation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Haematological abnormalities:

## Neutrophils

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 6 month controlled clinical trial SC-I, a decrease in neutrophil count below 1 × 10 9 /L occurred in 2.9% of patients on the subcutaneous weekly  dose.

There was no clear relationship between decreases in neutrophils below 1 x 10 9 /L and the occurrence  of serious infections.

## Platelets

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 6 month clinical trial SC-I, none of the patients on the SC weekly dose had a decrease in platelet count to ≤50 × 10 3 / μL.

## Hepatic transaminase elevations

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 6-month controlled clinical trial SC-I, elevation in ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN occurred in 6.5% and 1.4% of patients, respectively on the subcutaneous weekly dose.

## Lipid parameters

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 6 month controlled clinical trial SC-I, 19% of  patients experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol &gt; 6.2 mmol/L (240 mg/dL), with 9%  experiencing a sustained increase in LDL to ≥ 4.1 mmol/L(160 mg/dL) on the subcutaneous weekly  dose.

## sJIA (SC)

The safety profile of subcutaneous tocilizumab was evaluated in 51 paediatric patients (1 to 17 years of  age) with sJIA. In general, the adverse drug reactions in patients with sJIA were similar in type to those seen in RA patients (see Undesirable Effects section above).

## Infections

The rate of infection in sJIA patients treated with SC tocilizumab was comparable to sJIA patients treated with IV tocilizumab.

## Injection Site Reactions (ISRs)

In the SC Study (WA28118), a total of 41.2% (21/51) sJIA patients experienced ISRs to tocilizumab SC. The most common ISRs were erythema, pruritus, pain, and swelling at the injection site. The majority of ISRs reported were Grade 1 events and all ISRs reported were non-serious and none required patient withdrawal from treatment or dose interruption.

## Laboratory Abnormalities

In the 52-week open-label SC Study (WA28118), neutrophil count decrease to below 1 × 10 9 /L occurred in 23.5% of patients treated with tocilizumab SC. Decreases in platelet counts to below 100 ×  10 3 /μL occurred in 2% of the patients treated with tocilizumab SC. An elevation in ALT or AST to ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 9.8% and 4.0% patients treated with tocilizumab SC, respectively.

## Lipid parameters

In the 52-week open-label SC Study (WA28118), 23.4% and 35.4% of patients experienced a postbaseline elevation of their LDL-cholesterol value to ≥130 mg/dL and total cholesterol value to ≥200 mg/dL at any time during study treatment, respectively.

## pJIA (SC)

The safety profile of subcutaneous tocilizumab was also evaluated in 52 paediatric patients with pJIA.  The total patient exposure to tocilizumab in the pJIA all exposure population was 184.4 patient years  for IV and 50.4 patient years for SC tocilizumab. In general, the safety profile observed in patients  with pJIA was consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab with the exception of ISRs (see  Table 1). A higher frequency of pJIA patients experienced ISRs following SC tocilizumab injections  compared to adult RA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Infections

In the SC tocilizumab study, the rate of infection in pJIA patients treated with SC tocilizumab was comparable with pJIA patients treated with IV tocilizumab.

## Injection Site Reactions

A total of 28.8% (15/52) pJIA patients experienced ISRs to tocilizumab SC. These ISRs occurred in a  44% of patients ≥3 0 kg compared to 14.8% of patients below 30 kg. The most common ISRs were injection site erythema, swelling, hematoma, pain and pruritis. All ISRs reported were non-serious Grade 1 events, and none of the ISRs required patient withdrawal from treatment or dose interruption.

## Laboratory Abnormalities

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, a decrease in neutrophil count below 1 × 10 9 /L occurred in 15.4% of patients treated with SC tocilizumab. An elevation in ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN occurred in 9.6% and 3.8% patients treated with tocilizumab SC,  respectively. No patients treated with SC tocilizumab experienced a decrease in platelet count to ≤ 50 × 10 3 / μL.

## Lipid parameters

In the SC Study, 14.3% and 12.8% of patients experienced a post-baseline elevation of their LDLcholesterol value to ≥ 130 mg/dL and total cholesterol value to ≥ 200 mg/dL at any time during study  treatment, respectively.

## GCA (SC)

The safety of subcutaneous tocilizumab has been studied in one Phase III study (WA28119) with 251  GCA patients. The total patient years duration in the tocilizumab all exposure population was 138.5  patient years during the 12 month double blind, placebo controlled phase of the study. The overall  safety profile observed in the tocilizumab treatment groups was consistent with the known safety  profile of tocilizumab (see Table 1).

## Infections

The rate of infection/serious infection events was balanced between the tocilizumab weekly group (200.2/9.7 events per 100 patient years) vs. placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone taper (156.0/4.2 events per 100 patient years) and placebo plus 52 weeks taper (210.2/12.5 events per 100 patient years) groups.

## Injection site reactions

In the tocilizumab subcutaneous weekly group, a total of 6% (6/100) patients reported an adverse reaction occurring at the site of a subcutaneous injection. No injection site reaction was reported as a serious adverse event or required treatment discontinuation.

## Haematological abnormalities:

## Neutrophils

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 12 month controlled clinical trial, a decrease in  neutrophil count below 1 × 10 9 /L occurred in 4% of patients in the tocilizumab subcutaneous weekly  group. This was not observed in either of the placebo plus prednisone taper groups.

## Platelets

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 12 month controlled clinical trial, one patient (1%, 1/100) in the tocilizumab subcutaneous weekly group had a single transient occurrence of decrease  in platelet count to &lt;100 × 10 3 / μL without associated bleeding events. A decrease in platelet count below 100 × 10 3 / μL was not observed in either of the placebo plus prednisone taper groups.

## Hepatic transaminase elevations

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 12 month controlled clinical trial, elevation in  ALT ≥3 x ULN occurred in 3% of patients in the tocilizumab subcutaneous  weekly group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared  to  2% in the placebo plus 52 week prednisone taper group and none in the placebo plus 26 week  prednisone taper group. An elevation in AST &gt; 3 ULN occurred in 1% of patients in the tocilizumab  subcutaneous weekly group, compared to no patients in either of the placebo plus prednisone taper  groups.

## Lipid parameters

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 12 month controlled clinical trial, 34% of patients experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol &gt; 6.2 mmol/L  (240 mg/dL), with 15% experiencing a sustained increase in LDL to ≥ 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) in the tocilizumab subcutaneous weekly group.

## Intravenous use

## RA

The safety of tocilizumab has been studied in 5 Phase III, double-blind controlled trials and their extension periods.

The all control population includes all patients from the double-blind phases of each core study from randomisation until either the first change in the treatment regimen, or two years is reached. The control period in 4 of the studies was 6 months and in 1 study was up to 2 years. In the double-blind controlled studies 774 patients received tocilizumab 4 mg/kg in combination with MTX, 1 870 patients  received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with MTX/other DMARDs and 288 patients received  tocilizumab 8 mg/kg monotherapy.

The all exposure population includes all patients who received at least one dose of tocilizumab either in the double-blind control period or open label extension phase in studies. Of the 4 009 patients in this  population, 3 577 received treatment for at least 6 months, 3 296 for at least one year; 2 806 received  treatment for at least 2 years and 1 222 for 3 years.

Description of selected adverse reactions

## Infections

In the 6-month controlled studies the rate of all infections reported with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD treatment was 127 events per 100 patient years compared to 112 events per 100 patient years  in the placebo plus DMARD group. In the long-term exposure population, the overall rate of infections with tocilizumab was 108 events per 100 patient years exposure.

In 6-month controlled clinical studies, the rate of serious infections with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs was 5.3 events per 100 patient years exposure compared to 3.9 events per 100 patient years  exposure in the placebo plus DMARD group. In the monotherapy study the rate of serious infections  was 3.6 events per 100 patient years of exposure in the tocilizumab group and 1.5 events per

100 patient years of exposure in the MTX group.

In the all exposure population the overall rate of serious infections was 4.7 events per 100 patient years.  Reported serious infections, some with fatal outcome, included pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster,  gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis, bacterial arthritis. Cases of opportunistic infections have also been  reported.

## Interstitial lung disease

Impaired lung function may increase the risk for developing infections. There have been postmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of  which had fatal outcomes.

## Gastrointestinal perforation

During the 6-month controlled clinical trials, the overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was 0.26 events per 100 patient years with tocilizumab therapy. In the long-term exposure population the  overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was 0.28 events per 100 patient years. Reports of  gastrointestinal perforation on tocilizumab were primarily reported as complications of diverticulitis  including

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

generalised purulent peritonitis, lower gastrointestinal perforation, fistulae and abscess.

## Infusion Related Reactions

In the 6-month controlled trials adverse events associated with infusion (selected events occurring during or within 24 hours of infusion) were reported by 6.9% of patients in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD group and 5.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. Events reported during  the infusion were primarily episodes of hypertension; events reported within 24 hours of finishing an  infusion were headache and skin reactions (rash, urticaria). These events were not treatment limiting.

The rate of anaphylactic reactions (occurring in a total of 6/3 778patients, 0.2%) was several fold higher with the 4 mg/kg dose, compared to the 8 mg/kg dose. Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation were reported in a total of 13 out of 3 778 patients (0.3%) treated with tocilizumab  during the controlled and open label clinical studies. These reactions were generally observed during the second to fifth infusions of tocilizumab (see section 4.4). Fatal anaphylaxis has been reported after marketing authorisation during  treatment with intravenous tocilizumab (see section 4.4).

## Haematological abnormalities: Neutrophils

In the 6-month controlled trials decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 10 9 /L occurred in 3.4% of patients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to &lt; 0.1% of patients on placebo plus DMARDs. Approximately half of the patients who developed an ANC &lt; 1 x 10 9 /L did so within 8 weeks after starting therapy. Decreases below 0.5 x 10 9 /L were reported in 0.3% patients receiving tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs. Infections with neutropenia have been reported.

During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of decreases in neutrophil counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical trials.

## Platelets

In the 6-month controlled trials decreases in platelet counts below 100 x 10 3 /μL occurred in 1.7% of patients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to &lt; 1% on placebo plus DMARDs. These decreases occurred without associated bleeding events.

During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of decreases in platelet counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical  trials.

Very rare reports of pancytopenia have occurred in the post marketing setting.

## Hepatic transaminase elevations

During the 6-month controlled trials transient elevations in ALT/AST &gt; 3 x ULN were observed in 2.1% of patients on tocilizumab  8 mg/kg compared to 4.9% of patients on MTX and in 6.5% of patients who received 8 mg/kg tocilizumab  plus DMARDs compared to 1.5% of patients on placebo plus DMARDs.

The addition of potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) to tocilizumab monotherapy resulted in increased frequency of these elevations. Elevations of ALT/AST &gt; 5 x ULN were observed in 0.7% of  tocilizumab monotherapy patients and 1.4% of tocilizumab plus DMARD patients, the majority of  whom were discontinued permanently from tocilizumab treatment. During the double-blind controlled period, the incidence of indirect bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal, collected as a routine  laboratory parameter, is 6.2% in patients treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab + DMARD. A total of  5.8% of patients experienced an elevation of indirect bilirubin of &gt; 1 to 2 x ULN and 0.4% had an  elevation of &gt; 2 x ULN.

During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of elevation in ALT/AST remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

trials.

## Lipid parameters

During the 6-month controlled trials, increases of lipid parameters such as total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and/or HDL cholesterol have been reported commonly. With routine laboratory monitoring it was seen that approximately 24% of patients receiving tocilizumab in clinical trials experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol ≥ 6.2 mmol/L, with 15% experiencing a  sustained increase in LDL to ≥ 4.1 mmol/L. Elevations in lipid parameters responded to treatment  with lipid-lowering agents.

During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled trials.

## Malignancies

The clinical data are insufficient to assess the potential incidence of malignancy following exposure to  tocilizumab. Long-term safety evaluations are ongoing.

## Skin Reactions

Rare reports of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have occurred in the post marketing setting.

## Immunogenicity

Anti-tocilizumab antibodies may develop during tocilizumab treatment. Correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse events may be observed.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There are limited data available on overdose with tocilizumab. One case of accidental overdose was reported in which a patient with multiple myeloma received a single dose of 40 mg/kg administered intravenously. No adverse reactions were observed.

No serious adverse reactions were observed in healthy volunteers who received a single dose up to 28 mg/kg, although dose limiting neutropenia was observed.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Interleukin inhibitors; ATC code: L04AC07.

Avtozma is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency https://www.ema.europa.eu.

## Mechanism of action

Tocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R). Tocilizumab has been shown to inhibit sIL-6R and mIL-6R-mediated signalling. IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, monocytes and fibroblasts. IL-6 is involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell activation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, induction of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis and stimulation of haemopoiesis. IL-6 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases including inflammatory diseases, osteoporosis and neoplasia.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

In clinical studies with tocilizumab, rapid decreases in CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),  serum amyloid A (SAA) and fibrinogen were observed. Consistent with the effect on acute phase  reactants, treatment with tocilizumab was associated with reduction in platelet count within the normal  range. Increases in haemoglobin levels were observed, through tocilizumab decreasing the IL-6 driven  effects on hepcidin production to increase iron availability. In tocilizumab-treated patients, decreases  in the levels of CRP to within normal ranges were seen as early as week 2, with decreases maintained  while on treatment.

In GCA clinical study WA28119, similar rapid decreases in CRP and ESR were observed along with  slight increases in mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration. In healthy subjects administered  tocilizumab in doses from 2 to 28 mg/kg intravenously and 81 to 162 mg subcutaneously, absolute  neutrophil counts decreased to their lowest 2 to 5 days following administration. Thereafter,  neutrophils recovered towards baseline in a dose dependent manner.

Patients demonstrate a comparable (to healthy subjects) decrease of absolute neutrophil counts  following tocilizumab administration (see section 4.8).

## Subcutaneous use

## RA

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of subcutaneous administered tocilizumab in alleviating the signs and symptoms of RA  and radiographic response, was assessed in two randomised, double-blind, controlled, multi-center  studies. For study I (SC-I), patients were required to be &gt;18 years of age with moderate to severe  active RA diagnosed according to ACR criteria who had at least 4 tender and 4 swollen joints at  baseline. All patients received background non-biologic DMARD(s). For study II (SC-II), patients  were required to be &gt; 18 years of age with moderate to severe active RA diagnosed according to ACR  criteria who had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline.

Switching from 8 mg/kg intravenous once every 4 weeks to 162 mg subcutaneous once every week, will alter  exposure  in  the  patient. The  extent  varies  with  the  patient's  body weight (increased in light body weight patients and decreased in heavy body weight patients) but clinical outcome is consistent  with that observed in intravenous treated patients.

## Clinical response

Study SC-I evaluated patients with moderate to severe active RA who had an inadequate clinical  response to their existing rheumatologic therapy, including one or more DMARD(s) where  approximately 20% had a history of inadequate response to at least one TNF inhibitor. In SC-I,  1 262 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive tocilizumab subcutaneous 162 mg every week or tocilizumab intravenous 8 mg/kg every four weeks in combination with nonbiologic DMARD(s). The  primary endpoint in the study was the difference in the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20  response at week 24. The results from study SC-I is shown in Table 2.

TCZ = tocilizumab a = Per Protocol Population

Patients in study SC-I had a mean Disease Activity Score (DAS28) at baseline of 6.6 and 6.7 on the  subcutaneous and intravenous arms, respectively. At week 24, a significant reduction in DAS28 from  baseline (mean improvement) of 3.5 was observed on both treatment arms, and a comparable  proportion of patients had achieved DAS28 clinical remission (DAS28 &lt; 2.6) on the subcutaneous  (38.4%) and IV (36.9%) arms.

## Radiographic response

The radiographic response of subcutaneous administered tocilizumab was assessed in a double-blind,  controlled, multicenter study in patients with active RA (SC-II). Study SC-II evaluated patients with  moderate to severe active RA who had an inadequate clinical response to their existing rheumatologic  therapy, including one or more DMARD(s) where approximately 20% had a history of inadequate  response to at least one TNF inhibitor. Patients were required to be &gt;18 years of age with active RA  diagnosed according to ACR criteria who had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline. In SC-II, 656 patients were randomised 2:1 to tocilizumab subcutaneous 162 mg every other week or  placebo, in combination with non-biologic DMARD(s).

In study SC-II, inhibition of structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as a  change from baseline in the van der Heijde modified mean total Sharp score (mTSS). At week 24,  inhibition of structural damage was shown, with significantly less radiographic progression in patients receiving tocilizumab subcutaneous compared to placebo (mean mTSS of 0.62 vs. 1.23, p=0.0149 (van  Elteren). These results are consistent with those observed in patients treated with intravenous  tocilizumab.

In study SC-II, at week 24 there was ACR20 of 60.9%, ACR50 of 39.8% and ACR70 of 19.7% for  patients treated with tocilizumab subcutaneous every other week versus placebo ACR20 of 31.5%,  ACR50 of 12.3% and ACR70 of 5.0%. Patients had mean DAS28 at baseline of 6.7 on subcutaneous  and 6.6 on placebo arms. At week 24, a significant reduction in DAS28 from baseline of 3.1 was  observed on subcutaneous and 1.7 on placebo arm, and for DAS28 &lt; 2.6, 32.0% was observed on  subcutaneous and 4.0% on placebo arm.

## Health-related and quality of life outcomes

In study SC-I, the mean decrease in HAQ-DI from baseline to week 24 was 0.6 on both the subcutaneous and intravenous arms. The proportion of patients achieving a clinically relevant  improvement in HAQ-DI at week 24 (change from baseline of ≥ 0.3 units) was also comparable on the  subcutaneous (65.2%) versus intravenous (67.4%) arms, with a weighted difference in proportions of -  2.3% (95% CI - 8.1, 3.4). For SF-36, the mean change from baseline at week 24 in the mental component score was 6.22 for the subcutaneous arm and 6.54 for the intravenous arm, and for the physical component score was also similar with 9.49 for the subcutaneous arm and 9.65 for the  intravenous arm.

In study SC-II, mean decrease in HAQ-DI from baseline to week 24 was significantly greater for  patients treated with tocilizumab subcutaneous every other week (0.4) versus placebo (0.3). Proportion  of patients achieving a clinically relevant improvement in HAQDI at week 24 (change from baseline  of ≥ 0.3 units) was higher for tocilizumab subcutaneous every other week (58%) versus placebo  (46.8%). SF-36 (mean change in mental and physical component scores) was significantly greater with  tocilizumab subcutaneous group (6.5 and 5.3) versus placebo (3.8 and 2.9).

## sJIA (SC)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

paediatric  patients with sJIA, aged 1 to 17 years, to determine the appropriate SC dose of tocilizumab that  achieved comparable PK/PD and safety profiles to the IV regimen.

Eligible patients received tocilizumab dosed according to body weight (BW), with patients weighing ≥30 kg (n=26) dosed with 162 mg of tocilizumab every week (QW) and patients weighing below 30 kg (n=25) dosed with 162 mg of tocilizumab every 10 days (Q10D; n=8) or every 2 weeks (Q2W;  n=17) for 52 weeks. Of these 51 patients, 26 (51%) were naive to tocilizumab and 25 (49%) had been  receiving tocilizumab IV and switched to tocilizumab SC at baseline.

Exploratory efficacy results showed that tocilizumab SC improved all exploratory efficacy parameters  including Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS)-71, for TCZ naïve patients and  maintained all exploratory efficacy parameters for patients who switched from tocilizumab IV to  tocilizumab SC treatment over the entire course of the study for patients in both body weight groups  (below 30 kg and ≥30 kg).

## pJIA (SC)

A 52-week, open-label, multicenter, PK-PD and safety study was conducted in paediatric patients with  pJIA, aged 1 to 17 years old, to determine the appropriate subcutaneous dose of tocilizumab that  achieved comparable PK/PD and safety profiles to the IV regimen.

Eligible patients received tocilizumab dosed according to body weight (BW), with patients weighing ≥ 30 kg (n = 25) dosed with 162 mg of tocilizumab every 2 weeks (Q2W) and patients weighing below 30 kg (n = 27) dosed with 162 mg of tocilizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 52 weeks.  Of these 52 patients, 37 (71%) were naive to tocilizumab and 15 (29%) had been receiving tocilizumab  IV and switched to tocilizumab SC at baseline.

The tocilizumab SC regimens of 162 mg Q3W for patients weighing below 30 kg and of 162 mg Q2W  for patients weighing ≥ 30 kg respectively provide PK exposure and PD responses to support efficacy  and safety outcomes similar to those achieved with the approved tocilizumab IV regimens for pJIA.

Exploratory efficacy results showed that tocilizumab SC improved median Juvenile Arthritis Disease  Activity Score (JADAS)-71 for tocilizumab naïve patients and maintained the median JADAS-71 for  patients who switched from IV to SC tocilizumab treatment over the entire course of the study for  patients in both body weight groups (below 30 kg and ≥ 30 kg).

## GCA (SC)

## Clinical efficacy

Study WA28119 was a randomised, multi-center, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase III superiority study conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with GCA.

Two hundred and fifty one (251) patients with new-onset or relapsing GCA were enrolled and  assigned to one of four treatment arms. The study consisted of a 52-week blinded period (Part 1),  followed by a 104-week open-label extension (Part 2). The purpose of Part 2 was to describe the long-term safety and maintenance of efficacy after 52 weeks of tocilizumab therapy, to explore the rate of relapse and the requirement for tocilizumab therapy beyond 52 weeks, and to gain insight into the  potential long-term steroid-sparing effect of tocilizumab.

Two subcutaneous doses of tocilizumab (162 mg every week and 162 mg every other week) were  compared to two different placebo control groups randomised 2:1:1:1.

All patients received background glucocorticoid (prednisone) therapy. Each of the tocilizumab-treated  groups and one of the placebo-treated groups followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen over  26 weeks, while the second placebo-treated group followed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen over 52 weeks, designed to be more in keeping with standard practice.

The duration of glucocorticoid therapy during screening and before tocilizumab (or placebo) was  initiated, was similar in all 4 treatment groups (see Table 3).

The primary efficacy endpoint assessed by the proportion of patients achieving steroid free sustained  remission at week 52 on tocilizumab plus 26 weeks prednisone taper compared with placebo plus 26  weeks prednisone taper, was met (Table 4).

The key secondary efficacy endpoint also based on the proportion of patients achieving sustained  remission at week 52, comparing tocilizumab plus 26 weeks prednisone taper with placebo plus 52  weeks prednisone taper, was also met (Table 4).

A statistically significant superior treatment effect was seen in favour of tocilizumab over placebo in  achieving steroid-free sustained remission at week 52 on tocilizumab plus 26 weeks prednisone taper compared with placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone taper and with placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone  taper.

The percentage of patients achieving sustained remission at week 52, are shown in the Table 4.

## Secondary Endpoints

The assessment of the time to first GCA flare showed a significantly lower risk of flare for the tocilizumab subcutaneous weekly group compared to placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone and  placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper groups and for the tocilizumab subcutaneous every other  weekly group compared to placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone (when compared at a 0.01 significance  level). Tocilizumab subcutaneous weekly dose also showed a clinically meaningful decrease in the risk  for flare compared to placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone in patients who entered the trial with relapsing  GCA as well as those with new-onset disease (Table 4).

## Cumulative glucocorticoid dose

The cumulative prednisone dose at week 52 was significantly lower in the two tocilizumab dose  groups compared to the two placebo groups (Table 4). In a separate analysis of the patients who  received escape prednisone to treat GCA flare during the first 52 weeks, the cumulative prednisone  dose varied greatly.  The median doses for escape patients in the tocilizumab weekly and every other weekly groups were 3 129.75 mg and 3 847 mg, respectively. Both considerably lower than in the  placebo plus 26 weeks and the placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper groups, 4 023.5 mg and 5 389.5 mg respectively.

## Quality of Life Outcomes

In study WA28119, the SF-36 results were separated into the physical and mental component summary scores (PCS and MCS, respectively). The PCS mean change from baseline to week 52 was higher (showing more improvement) in the tocilizumab weekly and every other weekly dose groups

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

[4.10, 2.76, respectively] than in the two placebo groups [placebo plus 26 weeks; -0.28, placebo plus 52 weeks; -1.49], although only the comparison between tocilizumab weekly plus 26 weeks prednisone taper group and placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper group (5.59, 99% CI: 8.6, 10.32)  showed a statistically significant difference (p=0.0024). For MCS, the mean change from baseline to  week 52 for both tocilizumab weekly and every other weekly dose groups [7.28, 6.12, respectively]  were higher than the placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper group [2.84] (although the differences  were not statistically significant [weekly p=0.0252 for weekly, p=0.1468 for every other weekly]) and  similar to the placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone taper group [6.67].

The Patient's Global Assessment of disease activity was assessed on a 0-100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The mean change in Patient's global VAS from baseline at week 52 was lower (showing  greater improvement) in the tocilizumab weekly and every other weekly dose groups [19.0, -25.3,  respectively] than in both placebo groups [placebo plus 26 weeks -3.4, placebo plus 52 weeks -7.2],  although only the tocilizumab every other weekly plus 26 weeks prednisone taper group showed a  statistically significant difference compared to placebo [placebo plus 26 weeks taper p=0.0059, and  placebo plus 52 weeks taper p=0.0081].

FACIT-Fatigue change from baseline to week 52 scores were calculated for all groups.  The mean [SD] change scores were as follows: tocilizumab weekly plus 26 weeks 5.61 [10.115], tocilizumab every other weekly plus 26 weeks 1.81 [8.836], placebo plus 26 weeks 0.26 [10.702], and placebo plus 52 weeks -1.63 [6.753].

Change in EQ5D scores from baseline to week 52 were tocilizumab weekly plus 26 weeks 0.10 [0.198], tocilizumab every other weekly plus 26 weeks 0.05 [0.215], placebo plus 26 weeks 0.07 [0.293], and placebo plus 52 weeks -0.02 [0.159].

Higher scores signal improvement in both FACIT-Fatigue and EQ5D.

## Intravenous use

## RA

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of tocilizumab in alleviating the signs and symptoms of RA was assessed in five randomised, double-blind, multi-centre studies. Studies I-V enrolled patients ≥ 18 years of age with active RA diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and who had  at least eight tender and six swollen joints at baseline.

In Study I, tocilizumab was administered intravenously every four weeks as monotherapy. In Studies  II, III and V, tocilizumab was administered intravenously every four weeks in combination with MTX  vs. placebo and MTX. In Study IV, tocilizumab was administered intravenously every 4 weeks in  combination with other DMARDs vs. placebo and other DMARDs. The primary endpoint for each of  the five studies was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.

Study I evaluated 673 patients who had not been treated with MTX within six months prior to randomisation and who had not discontinued previous MTX treatment as a result of clinically important toxic effects or lack of response. The majority (67%) of patients were MTX-naïve. Doses of  8 mg/kg of tocilizumab were given every four weeks as monotherapy. The comparator group was weekly MTX (dose titrated from 7.5 mg to a maximum of 20 mg weekly over an eight week period).

Study II, a two year study with planned analyses at week 24, week 52 and week 104, evaluated 1 196 patients who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Doses of 4 or 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab or placebo were given every four weeks as blinded therapy for 52 weeks in combination with stable MTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly). After week 52, all patients could receive open-label treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg. Of the patients who completed the study who were originally randomised to placebo + MTX, 86% received open-label tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in year 2. The primary  endpoint at week 24 was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response. At week 52  and week 104 the co-primary endpoints were prevention of joint damage and improvement in physical  function.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study III evaluated 623 patients who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Doses of 4 or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo were given every four weeks, in combination with stable MTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly).

Study IV evaluated 1 220 patients who had an inadequate response to their existing rheumatologic therapy, including one or more DMARDs. Doses of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo were given every  four weeks in combination with stable DMARDs.

Study V evaluated 499 patients who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to one or more TNF antagonist therapies. The TNF antagonist therapy was discontinued prior to randomisation.  Doses of 4 or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo were given every four weeks in combination with stable  MTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly).

## Clinical response

In all studies, patients treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg had statistically significant higher ACR 20, 50,  70 response rates at 6 months compared to control (Table 5). In study I, superiority of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg was demonstrated against the active comparator MTX.

The treatment effect was similar in patients independent of rheumatoid factor status, age, gender, race,  number of prior treatments or disease status. Time to onset was rapid (as early as week 2) and the  magnitude of response continued to improve with duration of treatment. Continued durable responses  were seen for over 3 years in the open label extension studies I-V.

In patients treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg, significant improvements were noted on all individual components of the ACR response including: tender and swollen joint counts; patients and physician global assessment; disability index scores; pain assessment and CRP compared to patients receiving placebo plus MTX or other DMARDs in all studies.

Patients in studies I - V had a mean Disease Activity Score (DAS28) of 6.5-6.8 at baseline. Significant reduction in DAS28 from baseline (mean improvement) of 3.1-3.4 was observed in tocilizumab-treated patients compared to control patients (1.3-2.1). The proportion of patients achieving a DAS28 clinical remission (DAS28 &lt; 2.6) was significantly higher in patients receiving tocilizumab (28-34%) compared to 1-12% of control patients at 24 weeks. In study II, 65% of patients  achieved a DAS28 &lt; 2.6 at week 104 compared to 48% at 52 weeks and 33% of patients at week 24.

In a pooled analysis of studies II, III and IV, the proportion of patients achieving an ACR 20, 50 and 70 response was significantly higher (59% vs. 50%, 37% vs. 27%, 18% vs. 11%, respectively) in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD vs. the tocilizumab 4 mg/kg plus DMARD group (p&lt; 0.03). Similarly the proportion of patients achieving a DAS 28 remission (DAS28 &lt; 2.6) was significantly higher (31% vs. 16% respectively) in patients receiving tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD than in patients receiving tocilizumab  4 mg/kg plus DMARD (p&lt; 0.0001).

## Major clinical response

After 2 years of treatment with tocilizumab plus MTX, 14% of patients achieved a major clinical  response (maintenance of an ACR70 response for 24 weeks or more).

## Radiographic response

In Study II, in patients with an inadequate response to MTX, inhibition of structural joint damage was  assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified Sharp score and its components, the  erosion score and joint space narrowing score. Inhibition of joint structural damage was shown with  significantly less radiographic progression in patients receiving tocilizumab compared to control  (Table 6).

In the open-label extension of Study II the inhibition of progression of structural joint damage in  tocilizumab plus MTX-treated patients was maintained in the second year of treatment. The mean  change from baseline at week 104 in total Sharp-Genant score was significantly lower for patients  randomised to tocilizumab  8 mg/kg plus MTX (p&lt;0.0001) compared with patients who were  randomised to placebo plus MTX.

Following 1 year of treatment with tocilizumab plus MTX, 85% of patients(n=348) had no progression  of structural joint damage, as defined by a change in the Total Sharp Score of zero or less, compared  with 67% of placebo plus MTX-treated patients(n=290) (p ≤ 0.001). This remained consistent  following 2 years of treatment (83%; n=353). Ninety three percent (93%; n=271) of patients had no  progression between week 52 and week 104.

## Health-related and quality of life outcomes

Tocilizumab--treated patients reported an improvement in all patient-reported outcomes (Health  Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index - HAQ-DI), Short Form-36 and Functional Assessment of  Chronic Illness Therapy questionnaires. Statistically significant improvements in HAQ-DI scores were  observed in patients treated with tocilizumab compared with patients treated with DMARDs. During  the open-label period of Study II, the improvement in physical function has been maintained for up to  2 years. At Week 52, the mean change in HAQ-DI was -0.58 in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus MTX  group compared with -0.39 in the placebo + MTX group. The mean change in HAQ-DI was  maintained at Week 104 in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus MTX group (-0.61).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Haemoglobin levels

Statistically significant improvements in haemoglobin levels were observed with tocilizumab compared with DMARDs (p&lt; 0.0001) at week 24. Mean haemoglobin levels increased by week 2 and  remained within normal range through to week 24.

Tocilizumab versus adalimumab in monotherapy Study VI (WA19924), a 24 week double-blinded study that compared tocilizumab  monotherapy with  adalimumab monotherapy, evaluated 326 patients with RA who were intolerant of MTX or where  continued treatment with MTX was considered inappropriate (including MTX inadequate responders).  Patients in the tocilizumab  arm received an intravenous (IV) infusion of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) every 4  weeks (q4w) and a subcutaneous (SC) placebo injection every 2 weeks (q2w). Patients in the  adalimumab arm received an adalimumab SC injection (40 mg) q2w plus an IV placebo infusion q4w.

A statistically significant superior treatment effect was seen in favour of tocilizumab over adalimumab  in control of disease activity from baseline to week 24 for the primary endpoint of change in DAS28  and for all secondary endpoints (Table 7).

The overall clinical adverse event profile was similar between tocilizumab and adalimumab. The  proportion of patients with serious adverse events was balanced between the treatment groups  (tocilizumab 11.7% vs. adalimumab 9.9%). The types of adverse drug reactions in the tocilizumab arm  were consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab and adverse drug reactions were reported  at a similar frequency compared with Table 1. A higher incidence of infections and infestations was  reported in the tocilizumab arm (48% vs. 42%), with no difference in the incidence of serious  infections (3.1%). Both study treatments induced the same pattern of changes in laboratory safety  parameters (decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts, increases in ALT, AST and lipids), however,  the magnitude of change and the frequency of marked abnormalities was higher with tocilizumab  compared with adalimumab. Four (2.5%) patients in the tocilizumab arm and two (1.2%) patients in  the adalimumab arm experienced CTC grade 3 or 4 neutrophil count decreases. Eleven (6.8%) patients  in the tocilizumab arm and five (3.1%) patients in the adalimumab arm experienced ALT increases of  CTC grade 2 or higher. The mean LDL increase from baseline was 0.64 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) for  patients in the tocilizumab arm and 0.19 mmol/L (7 mg/dL) for patients in the adalimumab arm. The  safety observed in the tocilizumab arm was consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab and  no new or unexpected adverse drug reactions were observed (see Table 1).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab is characterized by nonlinear elimination which is a combination  of linear clearance and Michaelis-Menten elimination.  The nonlinear part of tocilizumab elimination  leads to an increase in exposure that is more than dose-proportional. The pharmacokinetic parameters  of tocilizumab do not change with time. Due to the dependence of total clearance on tocilizumab serum  concentrations, the half-life of tocilizumab is also concentration-dependent and varies depending on  the serum concentration level. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in any patient population tested so far indicate no relationship between apparent clearance and the presence of anti-drug antibodies.

## RA Intravenous use

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on  a database composed of 3 552 RA patients treated with a one-hour infusion of 4 or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab  every 4 weeks for 24 weeks or with 162 mg tocilizumab given subcutaneously either once a week or  every other week  for 24 weeks.

The following parameters (predicted mean ± SD) were estimated for a dose of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab given every 4 weeks: steady-state area under curve (AUC) = 38 000 ± 13 000 h·µg/mL, trough concentration (Cmin) = 15.9 ± 13.1 µ g/mL and maximum concentration (Cmax) = 182 ± 50.4 µg/mL, and. the accumulation ratios for AUC and Cmax were small, 1.32 and 1.09, respectively. The accumulation ratio was higher for Cmin (2.49), which was expected based on the non-linear clearance contribution at lower concentrations. Steady-state was reached following the first administration for Cmax and after 8 and 20 weeks for AUC and Cmin, respectively. Tocilizumab AUC, Cmin and Cmax increased with increase of body weight. At body weight ≥ 100 kg, the predicted mean (± SD) steadystate AUC, Cmin and Cmax of tocilizumab were 50 000 ± 16 800 μg·h/mL, 24.4 ± 17.5 μg/mL, and 226 ± 50.3 μg/mL, respectively, which are higher than mean exposure values for the patient population (i.e. all body weights) reported above. The dose-response curve for tocilizumab flattens at  higher exposure, resulting in smaller efficacy gains for each incremental increase in tocilizumab concentration such that clinically meaningful increases in efficacy were not demonstrated in patients treated with &gt; 800 mg of tocilizumab. Therefore, tocilizumab doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are  not recommended (see section 4.2).

## Distribution

In RA patients the central volume of distribution was 3.72 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 3.35 L resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 7.07 L.

## Elimination

Following intravenous administration, tocilizumab undergoes biphasic elimination from the circulation.  The total clearance of tocilizumab was concentration-dependent and is the sum of the linear and non-linear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as a parameter in the population pharmacokinetic analysis and was 9.5 mL/h. The concentration-dependent non-linear clearance plays a  major role at low tocilizumab concentrations. Once the non-linear clearance pathway is saturated, at  higher tocilizumab concentrations, clearance is mainly determined by the linear clearance.

The t1/2 of tocilizumab was concentration-dependent. At steady-state following a dose of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks, the effective t1/2 decreased with decreasing concentrations within a dosing interval from 18 days to 6 days.

## Linearity

Pharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab did not change with time. A more than dose-proportional increase in the AUC and Cmin was observed for doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Cmax increased dose-proportionally. At steady-state, predicted AUC and Cmin were 3.2 and 30 fold higher at 8 mg/kg as compared to 4 mg/kg, respectively.

## Subcutaneous use

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on  a database composed of 3 552 RA patients treated with 162 mg subcutaneous every week, 162

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mg  subcutaneous every other week, and or 4 or 8 mg/kg intravenous every 4 weeks for 24 weeks.

The pharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab did not change with time. For the 162 mg every week  dose, the predicted mean (±SD) steady-state AUC1week, Cmin and Cmax of tocilizumab were 7970 ± 3432 µg·h/mL, 43.0 ± 19.8 µg/mL, and 49.8 ± 21.0 µg/mL, respectively. The accumulation  ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 6.32, 6.30, and 5.27, respectively. Steady state was reached after  12 weeks for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax.

For the 162 every other week dose, the predicted mean (±SD) steady-state AUC2week, Cmin, and Cmax of  tocilizumab were 3 430 ± 2 660 µg·h/mL, 5.7 ± 6.8 µg/mL, and 13.2 ± 8.8 µg/mL, respectively. The  accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 2.67, 6.02, and 2.12, respectively. Steady state was  reached after 12 weeks for AUC and Cmin, and after 10 weeks for Cmax.

## Absorption

Following subcutaneous dosing in RA patients, the time to peak serum tocilizumab concentrations tmax was 2.8 days. The bioavailability for the subcutaneous formulation was 79%.

## Elimination

For subcutaneous administration, the effective t1/2 is up to 13 days for 162 mg every week and 5 days for 162 mg every other week in patients with RA at steady-state.

## sJIA

## Subcutaneous Use

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab in sJIA patients was characterized by a population pharmacokinetic analysis which included 140 patients who were treated with 8 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks (patients weighing ≥30 kg), 12 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg), 162 mg SC every week (patients weighing ≥30 kg), 162 mg SC every 10 days or every 2 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg).

Limited data are available regarding exposures following subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab in sJIA patients below 2 years of age with a body weight less than 10 kg. Patients with sJIA must have a minimum body weight of 10 kg when receiving tocilizumab subcutaneously (see section 4.2).

| Accumulation C mean or AUC τ * | 4.28              | 2.27                    |

After SC dosing, approximately 90% of the steady-state was reached by week 12 for both the 162 mg QW and Q2W regimens.

## Absorption

Following SC dosing in sJIA patients, the absorption half-life was around 2 days, and the bioavailability for the SC formulation in sJIA patients was 95%.

## Distribution

In paediatric patients with sJIA, the central volume of distribution was 1.87 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.14 L resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 4.01 L

## Elimination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The total clearance of tocilizumab was concentration-dependent and is the sum of the linear clearance and the nonlinear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as a parameter in the population pharmacokinetic analysis and was 5.7 mL/h in paediatric patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Following subcutaneous administration, the effective t1/2 of tocilizumab in sJIA patients is up to 14 days for both the 162 mg QW and Q2W regimens during a dosing interval at steady state.

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab in pJIA patients was characterized by a population pharmacokinetic analysis which included 237 patients who were treated with 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (patients weighing ≥ 30 kg), 10 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg), 162 mg SC every 2 weeks (patients weighing ≥ 30 kg), or 162 mg SC every 3 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg).

Table 9. Predicted mean ± SD PK parameters at steady-state after SC dosing in pJIA

| Tocilizumab PK Parameter       | 162 mgQ2W ≥ 30 kg   | 162 mg Q3Wbelow 30 kg   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| C max (µg/mL)                  | 29.4 ± 13.5         | 75.5 ± 24.1             |
| C min (µg/mL)                  | 11.8 ± 7.08         | 18.4 ± 12.9             |
| C avg (µg/mL)                  | 21.7 ± 10.4         | 45.5 ± 19.8             |
| Accumulation C max             | 1.72                | 1.32                    |
| Accumulation C min             | 3.58                | 2.08                    |
| Accumulation C mean or AUC τ * | 2.04                | 1.46                    |

After IV dosing, approximately 90% of the steady-state was reached by Week 12 for the 10 mg/kg (BW &lt; 30 kg), and by Week 16 for the 8 mg/kg (BW ≥ 30 kg) dose.  After SC dosing, approximately 90% of the steady-state was reached by Week 12 for both the 162 mg SC Q2W and Q3W regimens.

## Absorption

Following SC dosing in pJIA patients, the absorption half-life was around 2 days, and the bioavailability for the SC formulation in pJIA patients was 96%.

## Distribution

In paediatric patients with pJIA, the central volume of distribution was 1.97 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.03 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 4.0 L.

## Elimination

Population pharmacokinetic analysis for pJIA patients showed body size related impact on linear clearance so that body-weight based dosing should be taken into consideration (see Table 9).

After subcutaneous administration, the effective t1/2 of tocilizumab in pJIA patients is up to 10 days for  patients &lt; 30 kg (162 mg SC Q3W) and up to 7 days for patients ≥ 30 kg (162 mg SC Q2W) during  a dosing interval at steady state. Following intravenous administration, tocilizumab undergoes biphasic elimination from the circulation. The total clearance of tocilizumab was concentrationdependent and is the sum of the linear and non-linear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as a  parameter in the population pharmacokinetic analysis and was 6.25 mL/h. The concentrationdependent non-linear clearance plays a major role at low tocilizumab concentrations. Once the nonlinear clearance pathway is saturated, at higher tocilizumab concentrations, clearance is mainly determined by the linear clearance.

## GCA

## Subcutaneous use

The PK of tocilizumab in GCA patients were determined using a population PK model from an analysis dataset composed of 149 GCA patients treated with 162 mg subcutaneous every week or 162 mg subcutaneous every other week.  The developed model had the same structure as the population PK model developed earlier based on data from RA patients (see Table 10).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 10. Predicted mean ± SD PK parameters at steady-state after subcutaneous dosing in GCA

|                                | Subcutaneous              | Subcutaneous   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Tocilizumab PK Parameter       | 162 mg every other weekly | 162 mg weekly  |
| C max (µg/mL)                  | 19.3 ± 12.8               | 73 ± 30.4      |
| C min (µg/mL)                  | 11.1 ± 10.3               | 68.1± 29.5     |
| C mean (µg/mL)                 | 16.2 ± 11.8               | 71.3 ± 30.1    |
| Accumulation C max             | 2.18                      | 8.88           |
| Accumulation C min             | 5.61                      | 9.59           |
| Accumulation C mean or AUC τ * | 2.81                      | 10.91          |

The steady-state profile following the tocilizumab weekly dose was almost flat, with very little fluctuations between trough and peak values, while there were substantial fluctuations for the tocilizumab every other weekly dose. Approximately 90% of the steady-state (AUC τ ) was reached by week 14 in the every other weekly and week 17 in the weekly dose groups.

Based on the current characterization of PK, tocilizumab trough concentration at steady state are 50%  higher in this population relative to average concentrations in a large dataset from the RA population.  These differences occur due to unknown reasons. PK differences are not accompanied by marked  differences in PD parameters and so the clinical relevance is unknown.

In GCA patients, higher exposure was observed in patients with lower body weight. For the 162 mg every week dosing regimen, the steady-state Cavg was 51% higher in patients with body weight less than 60 kg compared to patients weighing between 60 to 100 kg. For the 162 mg every other week regimen, the steady-state Cavg was 129% higher in patients with body weight less than 60 kg compared to patients weighing between 60 to 100 kg. There is limited data for patients above 100 kg (n=7).

## Absorption

Following subcutaneous dosing in GCA patients, the absorption t½ was around 4 days. The bioavailability for the SC formulation was 0.8. The median values of Tmax were 3 days after the tocilizumab weekly dose and 4.5 days after the tocilizumab every other week dose.

## Distribution

In GCA patients, the central volume of distribution was 4.09 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 3.37 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 7.46 L.

## Elimination

The total clearance of tocilizumab was concentration-dependent and is the sum of the linear clearance  and the nonlinear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as a parameter in the population  pharmacokinetic analysis and was 6.7 mL/h in GCA patients,

In GCA patients, at steady state, the effective t ½ of tocilizumab varied between 18.3 and 18.9 days for  162 mg weekly regimen, and between 4.2 and 7.9 days for 162 mg every other weekly regimen. At  high serum concentrations, when total clearance of tocilizumab is dominated by linear clearance, an  effective t ½ of approximately 32 days was derived from the population parameter estimates.

## Special populations

Renal impairment : No formal study of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab  has been conducted. Most of the patients in the RA and GCA studies population pharmacokinetic analysis had normal renal function or mild renal impairment. Mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance based on Cockcroft-Gault formula) did not impact the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Approximately one-third of the patients in the GCA study had moderate renal impairment at baseline (estimated creatinine clearance of 30-59 mL/min). No impact on tocilizumab exposure was noted in these patients.

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.

Hepatic impairment: No formal study of the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab has been conducted.

Age, gender and ethnicity : Population pharmacokinetic analyses in RA and GCA patients, showed that  age, gender and ethnic origin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab.

Results of the population PK analysis for sJIA and pJIA patients confirmed that body size is the only covariate which has an appreciable impact on the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab including elimination and absorption so that body-weight based dosing should be taken into consideration (see Tables 8 and 9).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development.

Carcinogenicity studies were not performed because IgG1 monoclonal antibodies are not deemed to have intrinsic carcinogenic potential.

Available non-clinical data demonstrated the effect of IL-6 on malignant progression and apoptosis resistance to various cancer types. This data does not suggest a relevant risk for cancer initiation and progression under tocilizumab treatment. Additionally, proliferative lesions were not observed in a 6-month chronic toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys or in IL-6 deficient mice.

Available non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility under tocilizumab treatment. Effects on  endocrine active and reproductive system organs were not observed in a chronic cynomolgus monkey  toxicity study and reproductive performance was not affected in IL-6 deficient mice. Tocilizumab  administered to cynomolgus monkeys during early gestation, was observed to have no direct or  indirect harmful effect on pregnancy or embryonal-foetal development. However, a slight increase in  abortion/embryonal-foetal death was observed with high systemic exposure (&gt; 100 x human exposure)  in the 50 mg/kg/day high-dose group compared to placebo and other low-dose groups. Although IL-6  does not seem to be a critical cytokine for foetal growth or the immunological control of the  maternal/foetal interface, a relation of this finding to tocilizumab cannot be excluded.

Treatment with a murine analogue did not exert toxicity in juvenile mice. In particular, there was no impairment of skeletal growth, immune function and sexual maturation.

The non-clinical safety profile of tocilizumab in the cynomolgus monkey does not suggest a difference between intravenous and subcutaneous routes of administration.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

Avtozma, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for

- the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults not  previously treated with MTX.
- the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in adult patients who have either responded inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.

In these patients, Avtozma can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.

Avtozma has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function when given in combination with methotrexate.

## Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA)

Avtozma is indicated for the treatment of active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in patients 12 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with NSAIDs  and systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.2). Avtozma can be given as monotherapy (in case of intolerance to MTX or where treatment with  MTX is inappropriate) or in combination with MTX.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA)

Avtozma in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic polyarthritis (pJIA; rheumatoid factor positive or negative and extended oligoarthritis) in patients 12 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with MTX (see Section 4.2). Avtozma can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where continued treatment  with MTX is inappropriate.

## Giant cell arteritis (GCA)

Avtozma is indicated for the treatment of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) in adult patients.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Tocilizumab SC formulation is administered with a single-use pre-filled pen. Treatment should be initiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of RA, sJIA, pJIA and/or GCA. The pre-filled pen should not be used to treat paediatric patients &lt; 12 years of age since there is a  potential risk of intramuscular injection due to thinner subcutaneous tissue layer.

The first injection should be performed under the supervision of a qualified health care professional. A  patient or parent/guardian can inject Avtozma only if the physician determines that it is appropriate  and the patient or parent/guardian agrees to medical follow-up as necessary and has been trained in  proper injection technique.

Patients who transition from tocilizumab IV therapy to SC administration should administer the first SC dose at the time of the next scheduled IV dose under the supervision of a qualified health care professional.

All patients treated with Avtozma should be given the Patient Alert Card.

Suitability of the patient or parent/guardian for subcutaneous home use should be assessed and patients  or their parent/guardian should be instructed to inform a healthcare professional before administering  the next dose if they experience symptoms of an allergic reaction. Patients should seek immediate  medical attention if developing symptoms of serious allergic reactions (see section 4.4).

## Posology

## RA

The recommended posology is subcutaneous 162 mg once every week.

Limited information is available regarding switching patients from Avtozma intravenous formulation to Avtozma subcutaneous fixed dose formulation. The once every week dosing interval should be followed.

Patients transitioning from intravenous to subcutaneous formulation should administer their first subcutaneous dose instead of the next scheduled intravenous dose under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.

## GCA

The recommended posology is subcutaneous 162 mg once every week in combination with a tapering course of glucocorticoids. Avtozma can be used alone following discontinuation of glucocorticoids. Avtozma monotherapy should not be used for the treatment of acute relapses (see 4.4).

Based upon the chronic nature of GCA, treatment beyond 52 weeks should be guided by disease activity, physician discretion, and patient choice.

## RA and GCA

Dose adjustments due to laboratory abnormalities (see section 4.4).

## RA and GCA Missed dose

If a patient misses a subcutaneous weekly injection of Avtozma within 7 days of the scheduled dose, he/she should be instructed to take the missed dose on the next scheduled day. If a patient misses a subcutaneous once every other week injection of Avtozma within 7 days of the scheduled dose, he/she should be instructed to take the missed dose immediately and the next dose on the next scheduled day.

## Special populations

## Elderly:

No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients &gt;65 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment:

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Avtozma has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). Renal function should be  monitored closely in these patients.

## Hepatic impairment:

Avtozma has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dose recommendations can be made.

## Paediatric patients

The safety and efficacy of Avtozma subcutaneous formulation in children from birth to less than 1 year have not been established. No data are available.

A change in dose should only be based on a consistent change in the patient's body weight over time.  Avtozma can be used alone or in combination with MTX.

## sJIA Patients

The recommended posology in patients above 12 years of age is 162 mg subcutaneously once every week in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 162 mg subcutaneously once every 2 weeks in patients weighing less than 30 kg.

The pre-filled pen should not be used to treat paediatric patients &lt; 12 years of age.

Patients must have a minimum body weight of 10 kg when receiving Avtozma subcutaneously.

## pJIA Patients:

The recommended posology in patients above 12 years of age is 162 mg subcutaneously once every 2  weeks in patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg or 162 mg subcutaneously once every 3 weeks in patients weighing less than 30 kg.

The pre-filled pen should not be used to treat paediatric patients &lt; 12 years of age.  Dose adjustments due to laboratory abnormalities (sJIA and pJIA)

If appropriate, the dose of concomitant MTX and/or other medications should be modified or dosing stopped and tocilizumab dosing interrupted until the clinical situation has been evaluated. As there are  many co-morbid conditions that may affect laboratory values in sJIA or pJIA, the decision to discontinue tocilizumab for a laboratory abnormality should be based upon the medical assessment of the individual patient.

Reduction of tocilizumab dosing frequency due to laboratory abnormalities has not been studied in  sJIA or pJIA patients.

The safety and efficacy of Avtozma subcutaneous formulation in children with conditions other than  sJIA or pJIA have not been established.

Available data with the IV formulation suggest that clinical improvement is observed within 12 weeks  of initiation of treatment with tocilizumab. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in a  patient exhibiting no improvement within this timeframe.

## Missed dose

If a sJIA patient misses a subcutaneous weekly injection of Avtozma within 7 days of the scheduled dose, he/she should be instructed to take the missed dose on the next scheduled day. If a patient misses a subcutaneous once every 2 week injection of Avtozma within 7 days of the scheduled dose, he/she should be instructed to take the missed dose immediately and the next dose on the next scheduled day.

If a pJIA patient misses a subcutaneous injection of Avtozma within 7 days of the scheduled dose, he/she should take the missed dose as soon as they remember and take the next dose at the regular scheduled time. If a patient misses a subcutaneous injection of Avtozma by more than 7 days of the scheduled dose or is unsure when to inject Avtozma, call the doctor or pharmacist.

## Method of administration

## Avtozma is for subcutaneous use.

After proper training in injection technique, patients may self-inject with Avtozma if their physician determines that it is appropriate. The total content (0.9 mL) of the pre-filled pen should be administered as a subcutaneous injection. The recommended injection sites (abdomen, thigh and upper  arm) should be rotated and injections should never be given into moles, scars, or areas where

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the skin  is tender, bruised, red, hard, or not intact.

The pre-filled pen should not be shaken.

Comprehensive instructions for the administration of Avtozma in a pre-filled pen are given in the package leaflet, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Active, severe infections (see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Avtozma subcutaneous formulation is not intended for intravenous administration.

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Infections

Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including tocilizumab (see section 4.8, Undesirable effects). Avtozma treatment must not be initiated in patients with active infections (see section 4.3). Administration of tocilizumab should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection until the infection is controlled (see section 4.8). Healthcare professionals should exercise caution when considering the use of Avtozma in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions (e.g. diverticulitis, diabetes and interstitial lung disease which may predispose patients to infections.

Vigilance for the timely detection of serious infection is recommended for patients receiving immunosuppressive agents such as Avtozma as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened, due to suppression of the acute phase reactants. The effects of Avtozma on C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils and signs and symptoms of infection should be considered when evaluating  a patient for a potential infection. Patients, and parents/guardians of sJIA or pJIA patients, should be  instructed to contact their healthcare professional immediately when any symptoms suggesting  infection appear, in order to assure rapid evaluation and appropriate treatment.

## Tuberculosis

As recommended for other biological treatments, all patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis  (TB) infection prior to starting Avtozma therapy. Patients with latent TB should be treated with  standard anti-mycobacterial therapy before initiating Avtozma. Prescribers are reminded of the risk  of false negative tuberculin skin and interferon-gamma TB blood test results, especially in patients  who are severely ill or immunocompromised.

Patients, and parents/guardians of sJIA or pJIA patients should be advised to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade (fever) suggestive of a tuberculosis infection occur during or after therapy with Avtozma.

## Viral reactivation

Viral reactivation (e.g. hepatitis B virus) has been reported with biologic therapies for RA. In clinical studies with tocilizumab, patients who screened positive for hepatitis were excluded.

## Complications of diverticulitis

Events of diverticular perforations as complications of diverticulitis have been reported uncommonly  in patients treated with Avtozma (see section 4.8). Avtozma should be used with caution in  patients with previous history of intestinal ulceration or diverticulitis. Patients presenting

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with  symptoms potentially indicative of complicated diverticulitis, such as abdominal pain, haemorrhage  and/or unexplained change in bowel habits with fever should be evaluated promptly for early  identification of diverticulitis which can be associated with gastrointestinal perforation.

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis have been reported in association with tocilizumab (see section 4.8). Such reactions may be more severe, and potentially fatal in patients who  have experienced hypersensitivity reactions during previous treatment with Avtozma even if they  have received premedication with steroids and antihistamines. If an anaphylactic reaction or other  serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of Avtozma should be stopped immediately,  appropriate therapy initiated and Avtozma should be permanently discontinued.

## Active hepatic disease and hepatic impairment

Treatment with Avtozma, particularly when administered concomitantly with MTX, may be associated with elevations in hepatic transaminases, therefore, caution should be exercised when considering treatment of patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).

## Hepatotoxicity

Transient or intermittent mild and moderate elevations of hepatic transaminases have been reported commonly with tocilizumab treatment (see section 4.8). An increased frequency of these elevations was observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) were used in combination with tocilizumab. When clinically indicated, other liver function tests including bilirubin should be considered.

Serious drug-induced liver injury, including acute liver failure, hepatitis and jaundice, have been observed with tocilizumab (see section 4.8). Serious hepatic injury occurred between 2 weeks to more  than 5 years after initiation of tocilizumab. Cases of liver failure resulting in liver transplantation have  been reported. Patients should be advised to immediately seek medical help if they experience signs and symptoms of hepatic injury.

Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of Avtozma treatment in patients with elevated ALT or AST &gt; 1.5 x ULN. In patients with baseline ALT or AST &gt; 5 x ULN, treatment is not  recommended.

In RA, GCA, pJIA and sJIA patients, ALT/AST should be monitored every 4 to 8 weeks for the first 6  months of treatment followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. For recommended modifications, including Avtozma discontinuation, based on transaminases levels see section 4.2. For ALT or AST elevations &gt; 3-5 x ULN, Avtozma treatment should be interrupted.

## Haematological abnormalities

Decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts have occurred following treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with MTX (see section 4.8). There may be an increased risk of neutropenia in patients who have previously been treated with a TNF antagonist.

In patients not previously treated with tocilizumab, initiation is not recommended in patients with an ANC below 2 x 10 9 /L. Caution should be exercised when considering initiation of tocilizumab treatment in patients with a low platelet count (i.e. platelet count below 100 x 10 3 /μL). In patients who  develop an ANC &lt; 0.5 x 10 9 /L or a platelet count &lt; 50 x 10 3 /μL, continued treatment is not recommended.

Severe neutropenia may be associated with an increased risk of serious infections, although there has been no clear association between decreases in neutrophils and the occurrence of serious infections in clinical trials with tocilizumab to date.

In RA and GCA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and thereafter according to standard clinical practice. For recommended dose modifications

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

based on ANC and platelet counts, see section 4.2.

In sJIA and pJIA patients, neutrophils and platelets should be monitored at the time of the second administration and thereafter according to good clinical practice (see section 4.2).

## Lipid parameters

Elevations in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides were observed in patients treated with tocilizumab (see section  4.8). In the majority of patients, there was no increase in atherogenic indices, and elevations in total  cholesterol responded to treatment with lipid lowering agents.

In RA and GCA patients, assessment of lipid parameters should be performed 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of tocilizumab therapy. Patients should be managed according to local clinical guidelines for management of hyperlipidaemia.

## Neurological disorders

Physicians should be vigilant for symptoms potentially indicative of new-onset central demyelinating disorders. The potential for central demyelination with tocilizumab is currently unknown.

## Malignancy

The risk of malignancy is increased in patients with RA. Immunomodulatory medicinal products may  increase the risk of malignancy.

## Vaccinations

Live and live attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with tocilizumab as clinical safety  has not been established. In a randomised open-label study, adult RA patients treated with tocilizumab  and MTX were able to mount an effective response to both the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide and tetanus toxoid vaccines which was comparable to the response seen in patients on  MTX only. It is recommended that all patients particularly elderly patients, be brought up to date with  all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating tocilizumab therapy. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of tocilizumab therapy should be in  accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents.

## Cardiovascular risk

RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders and should have risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) managed as part of usual standard of care.

## Combination with TNF antagonists

There is no experience with the use of Avtozma with TNF antagonists or other biological treatments for RA patients. Avtozma is not recommended for use with other biological agents.

## GCA

Avtozma monotherapy should not be used for the treatment of acute relapses as efficacy in this setting has not been established. Glucocorticoids should be given according to medical judgement and  practice guidelines.

## sJIA

Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a serious life-threatening disorder that may develop in sJIA patients. In clinical trials, tocilizumab has not been studied in patients during an episode of active  MAS.

## Excipients with known effect

## Polysorbate

Each 162 mg pre-filled pen contains 0.2 mg of polysorbate 80.

Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Patients with polysorbate allergy should not take this medicine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

Concomitant administration of a single dose of 10 mg/kg Avtozma with 10-25 mg MTX once weekly had no clinically significant effect on MTX exposure.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of MTX, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids on tocilizumab clearance in RA patients. In GCA patients, no effect of cumulative corticosteroid dose on tocilizumab exposure was observed.

The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by cytokines, such as IL-6, that stimulate chronic inflammation. Thus, CYP450 expression may be reversed when potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, such as Avtozma, is introduced.

In vitro studies with cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 caused a reduction in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. tocilizumab normalises expression of these enzymes.

In a study in RA patients, levels of simvastatin (CYP3A4) were decreased by 57% one week following  a single dose of tocilizumab, to the level similar to, or slightly higher than, those observed in healthy subjects.

When starting or stopping therapy with tocilizumab, patients taking medicinal products which are individually adjusted and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2 or 2C9 (e.g. methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, (with the possibility for oral glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome), atorvastatin, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, ciclosporin, or benzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses may need to be increased to maintain therapeutic effect. Given its long elimination half-life (t1/2), the effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity  may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment.

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of Avtozma in pregnant women. A study in animals has shown an increased risk of spontaneous abortion/embryo-foetal death at a high dose (see section 5.3).  The potential risk for humans is unknown.

Avtozma should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether Avtozma is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of Avtozma in  milk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or  to continue/discontinue therapy with Avtozma should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Avtozma therapy to the woman.

## Fertility

Available non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility under Avtozma treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

tocilizumab has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8, dizziness).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The safety profile comes from 4 510 patients exposed to tocilizumab in clinical trials; the majority of these patients were participating in RA studies (n=4 009), while the remaining experience comes from  GCA (n=149), pJIA (n=240) and sJIA (n=112)  studies. The safety profile of tocilizumab across these  indications remains similar and undifferentiated.

The most commonly reported Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) were upper respiratory tract infections,  nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension and increased ALT.

The most serious ADRs were serious infections, complications of diverticulitis, and hypersensitivity reactions.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

ADRs from clinical trials and/or post marketing experience with tocilizumab based on spontaneous case reports, literature cases and cases from non-interventional study programs are listed in Table 1 and are presented by MedDRA system organ class. The corresponding frequency category is based on  the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000  to &lt; 1/100) rare (≥1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000) or very rare (&lt;1/10 000). Within each frequency grouping,  undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

3 This adverse reaction was identified through post marketing surveillance but not observed in controlled clinical trials. The frequency category was estimated as the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval calculated on the basis of the total number of patients exposed to TCZ in clinical trials.

## Subcutaneous use

## RA

The safety of subcutaneous tocilizumab in RA includes a double-blind, controlled, multicenter study,  SC-I. SC-I was a non-inferiority study that compared the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab 162 mg  administered every week versus 8 mg/kg intravenous in 1 262 patients with RA. All patients received  background non-biologic DMARD(s). The safety and immunogenicity observed for tocilizumab  administered subcutaneous was consistent with the known safety profile of intravenous tocilizumab  and no new or unexpected adverse drug reactions were observed (see Table 1). A higher frequency of  injection site reactions was observed in the subcutaneous arms compared with placebo subcutaneous  injections in the intravenous arms.

## Injection site reactions

During the 6-month controlled period, in SC-I, the frequency of injection site reactions was 10.1%  (64/631) and 2.4% (15/631) for the subcutaneous tocilizumab and the subcutaneous placebo  (intravenous group) weekly injections, respectively. These injection site reactions (including  erythema, pruritus, pain and haematoma) were mild to moderate in severity. The majority was  resolved without any treatment and none necessitated drug discontinuation.

## Haematological abnormalities:

## Neutrophils

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 6 month controlled clinical trial SC-I, a decrease in neutrophil count below 1 × 10 9 /L occurred in 2.9% of patients on the subcutaneous weekly  dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There was no clear relationship between decreases in neutrophils below 1 x 10 9 /L and the occurrence  of serious infections.

## Platelets

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 6 month clinical trial SC-I, none of the patients on the SC weekly dose had a decrease in platelet count to ≤50 × 10 3 / μL.

## Hepatic transaminase elevations

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 6-month controlled clinical trial SC-I, elevation in ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN occurred in 6.5% and 1.4% of patients, respectively on the subcutaneous weekly dose.

## Lipid parameters

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 6 month controlled clinical trial SC-I, 19% of  patients experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol &gt; 6.2 mmol/L (240 mg/dL), with 9% experiencing a sustained increase in LDL to ≥ 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) on the subcutaneous weekly dose.

## Subcutaneous Use

## sJIA

The safety profile of subcutaneous tocilizumab was evaluated in 51 paediatric patients (1 to 17 years of  age) with sJIA. In general, the adverse drug reactions in patients with sJIA were similar in type to those seen in RA patients (see Undesirable Effects section above).

## Infections

The rate of infection in sJIA patients treated with SC tocilizumab was comparable to sJIA patients treated with IV tocilizumab.

## Injection Site Reactions (ISRs)

In the SC Study (WA28118), a total of 41.2% (21/51) sJIA patients experienced ISRs to tocilizumab SC. The most common ISRs were erythema, pruritus, pain, and swelling at the injection site. The majority of ISRs reported were Grade 1 events and all ISRs reported were non-serious and none required patient withdrawal from treatment or dose interruption.

## Laboratory Abnormalities

In the 52-week open-label SC Study (WA28118), neutrophil count decrease to below 1 × 10 9 /L occurred in 23.5% of patients treated with tocilizumab SC. Decreases in platelet counts to below 100 ×  10 3 /μL occurred in 2% of the patients treated with tocilizumab SC. An elevation in ALT or AST to ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 9.8% and 4.0% patients treated with tocilizumab SC, respectively.

## Lipid parameters

In the 52-week open-label SC Study (WA28118), 23.4% and 35.4% of patients experienced a postbaseline elevation of their LDL-cholesterol value to ≥130 mg/dL and total cholesterol value to ≥200 mg/dL at any time during study treatment, respectively.

## Subcutaneous use

## pJIA

The safety profile of subcutaneous tocilizumab was also evaluated in 52 paediatric patients with pJIA.  The total patient exposure to tocilizumab in the pJIA all exposure population was 184.4 patient years  for IV and 50.4 patient years for SC tocilizumab. In general, the safety profile observed in patients  with pJIA was consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab with the exception of ISRs (see  Table 1). A higher frequency of pJIA patients experienced ISRs following SC tocilizumab injections  compared to adult RA.

## Infections

In the SC tocilizumab study, the rate of infection in pJIA patients treated with SC tocilizumab was comparable with pJIA patients treated with IV tocilizumab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Injection Site Reactions

A total of 28.8% (15/52) pJIA patients experienced ISRs to tocilizumab SC. These ISRs occurred in a  44% of patients ≥ 30 kg compared to 14.8% of patients below 30 kg.  The most common ISRs were injection site erythema, swelling, hematoma, pain and pruritis. All ISRs reported were non-serious Grade 1 events, and none of the ISRs required patient withdrawal from treatment or dose interruption.

## Laboratory Abnormalities

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, a decrease in neutrophil count below 1 × 10 9 /L occurred in 15.4% of patients treated with SC tocilizumab. An elevation in ALT or AST ≥3 x ULN occurred in 9.6% and 3.8% patients treated with tocilizumab SC,  respectively. No patients treated with SC tocilizumab experienced a decrease in platelet count to ≤ 50 × 10 3 / μL.

## Lipid parameters

In the SC Study, 14.3% and 12.8% of patients experienced a post-baseline elevation of their LDLcholesterol value to ≥ 130 mg/dL and total cholesterol value to ≥ 200 mg/dL at any time during study  treatment, respectively.

## Subcutaneous Use

## GCA

The safety of subcutaneous tocilizumab has been studied in one Phase III study (WA28119) with 251 GCA patients. The total patient years duration in the tocilizumab all exposure population was 138.5 patient years during the 12 month double blind, placebo controlled phase of the study. The overall safety profile observed in the tocilizumab treatment groups was consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab (see Table 1).

## Infections

The rate of infection/serious infection events was balanced between the tocilizumab weekly group (200.2/9.7 events per 100 patient years) vs. placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone taper (156.0/4.2 events per 100 patient years) and placebo plus 52 weeks taper (210.2/12.5 events per 100 patient years) groups.

## Injection site reactions

In the tocilizumab subcutaneous weekly group, a total of 6% (6/100) patients reported an adverse reaction occurring at the site of a subcutaneous injection. No injection site reaction was reported as a serious adverse event or required treatment discontinuation.

## Haematological abnormalities:

## Neutrophils

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 12 month controlled clinical trial, a decrease in  neutrophil count below 1 × 10 9 /L occurred in 4% of patients in the tocilizumab subcutaneous weekly  group. This was not observed in either of the placebo plus prednisone taper groups.

## Platelets

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 12 month controlled clinical trial, one patient (1%, 1/100) in the tocilizumab subcutaneous weekly group had a single transient occurrence of decrease  in platelet count to &lt;100 × 10 3 / μL without associated bleeding events. A decrease in platelet count below 100 × 10 3 / μL was not observed in either of the placebo plus prednisone taper groups.

## Hepatic transaminase elevations

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 12 month controlled clinical trial, elevation in  ALT ≥3 x ULN occurred in 3% of patients in the tocilizumab subcutaneous  weekly group compared  to  2% in the placebo plus 52 week prednisone taper group and none in the placebo plus 26 week  prednisone taper group. An elevation in AST &gt; 3 ULN occurred in 1% of patients in the tocilizumab  subcutaneous weekly group, compared to no patients in either of the placebo plus

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

prednisone taper  groups.

## Lipid parameters

During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab 12 month controlled clinical trial, 34% of patients experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol &gt; 6.2 mmol/L (240 mg/dL), with 15% experiencing a sustained increase in LDL to ≥ 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) in the tocilizumab subcutaneous weekly group.

## Intravenous use

## RA

The safety of tocilizumab has been studied in 4 placebo-controlled studies (studies II, III, IV and V), 1  MTX-controlled study (study I) and their extension periods (see section 5.1).

The double-blind controlled period was 6 months in four studies (studies I, III, IV and V) and was up to 2 years in one study (study II). In the double-blind controlled studies, 774 patients received tocilizumab 4 mg/kg in combination with MTX, 1 870 patients received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with MTX or other DMARDs and 288 patients received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg monotherapy.

The long-term exposure population includes all patients who received at least one dose of tocilizumab  either in the double-blind control period or open label extension phase in the studies. Of the 4 009  patients in this population, 3 577 received treatment for at least 6 months, 3 296 for at least one year,  2 806 received treatment for at least 2 years and 1 222 for 3 years.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Infections

In the 6-month controlled studies the rate of all infections reported with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD treatment was 127 events per 100 patient years compared to 112 events per 100 patient years  in the placebo plus DMARD group. In the long-term exposure population, the overall rate of infections with tocilizumab was 108 events per 100 patient years exposure.

In 6-month controlled clinical studies, the rate of serious infections with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs was 5.3 events per 100 patient years exposure compared to 3.9 events per 100 patient years  exposure in the placebo plus DMARD group. In the monotherapy study the rate of serious infections  was 3.6 events per 100 patient years of exposure in the tocilizumab group and 1.5 events per 100 patient years of exposure in the MTX group.

In the long-term exposure population, the overall rate of serious infections (bacterial, viral and fungal)  was 4.7 events per 100 patient years. Reported serious infections, some with fatal outcome, included  active tuberculosis, which may present with intrapulmonary or extrapulmonary disease, invasive  pulmonary infections, including candidiasis, aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis and pneumocystis  jirovecii, pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial  arthritis. Cases of opportunistic infections have been reported.

## Interstitial lung disease

Impaired lung function may increase the risk for developing infections. There have been postmarketing reports of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis), some of  which had fatal outcomes.

## Gastrointestinal perforation

During the 6-month controlled clinical trials, the overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was 0.26 events per 100 patient years with tocilizumab therapy. In the long-term exposure population the  overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was 0.28 events per 100 patient years. Reports of  gastrointestinal perforation on tocilizumab were primarily reported as complications of diverticulitis  including generalised purulent peritonitis, lower gastrointestinal perforation, fistulae and abscess.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Infusion Related Reactions

In the 6-month controlled trials adverse events associated with infusion (selected events occurring during or within 24 hours of infusion) were reported by 6.9% of patients in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD group and 5.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. Events reported during  the infusion were primarily episodes of hypertension; events reported within 24 hours of finishing an  infusion were headache and skin reactions (rash, urticaria). These events were not treatment limiting.

The rate of anaphylactic reactions (occurring in a total of 8/4 009 patients, 0.2%) was several fold higher with the 4 mg/kg dose, compared to the 8 mg/kg dose. Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation were reported in a total of 56 out of 4 009 patients (1.4%) treated with tocilizumab during the controlled and open label clinical studies. These reactions were generally observed during the second to fifth infusions of tocilizumab (see section 4.4). Fatal anaphylaxis has been reported after marketing authorisation during  treatment with intravenous tocilizumab (see section 4.4).

## Haematological abnormalities:

## Neutrophils

In the 6-month controlled trials decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 10 9 /L occurred in 3.4% of patients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to &lt; 0.1% of patients on placebo plus DMARDs. Approximately half of the patients who developed an ANC &lt; 1 x 10 9 /L did so within 8 weeks after starting therapy. Decreases below 0.5 x 10 9 /L were reported in 0.3% patients receiving tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs. Infections with neutropenia have been reported.

During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of decreases in neutrophil counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical trials.

## Platelets

In the 6-month controlled trials decreases in platelet counts below 100 x 10 3 /μL occurred in 1.7% of patients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARDs compared to &lt; 1% on placebo plus DMARDs. These decreases occurred without associated bleeding events.

During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of decreases in platelet counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical  trials.

Very rare reports of pancytopenia have occurred in the post marketing setting.

## Hepatic transaminase elevations

During the 6-month controlled trials transient elevations in ALT/AST &gt; 3 x ULN were observed in 2.1% of patients on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg compared to 4.9% of patients on MTX and in 6.5% of patients who received 8 mg/kg tocilizumab plus DMARDs compared to 1.5% of patients on placebo plus DMARDs.

The addition of potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. MTX) to tocilizumab monotherapy resulted in increased frequency of these elevations. Elevations of ALT/AST &gt; 5 x ULN were observed in 0.7% of  tocilizumab monotherapy patients and 1.4% of tocilizumab plus DMARD patients, the majority of whom were discontinued permanently from tocilizumab treatment. During the double-blind controlled period, the incidence of indirect bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal, collected as a routine  laboratory parameter, is 6.2% in patients treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab+ DMARD. A total of 5.8%  of patients experienced an elevation of indirect bilirubin of &gt; 1 to 2 x ULN and 0.4% had an elevation  of &gt; 2 x ULN.

During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of elevation in ALT/AST remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled clinical trials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Lipid parameters

During the 6-month controlled trials, increases of lipid parameters such as total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and/or HDL cholesterol have been reported commonly. With routine laboratory monitoring it was seen that approximately 24% of patients receiving tocilizumab in clinical trials experienced sustained elevations in total cholesterol ≥ 6.2 mmol/L, with 15% experiencing a  sustained increase in LDL to ≥ 4.1 mmol/L. Elevations in lipid parameters responded to treatment  with lipid-lowering agents.

During the double-blind controlled period and with long-term exposure, the pattern and incidence of elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with what was seen in the 6-month controlled trials.

## Malignancies

The clinical data are insufficient to assess the potential incidence of malignancy following exposure to  tocilizumab. Long-term safety evaluations are ongoing.

## Skin Reactions

Rare reports of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome have occurred in the post marketing setting.

## Immunogenicity

Anti-tocilizumab antibodies may develop during tocilizumab treatment. Correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse events may be observed.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There are limited data available on overdose with tocilizumab. One case of accidental overdose was reported in which a patient with multiple myeloma received a single dose of 40 mg/kg administered intravenously. No adverse reactions were observed.

No serious adverse reactions were observed in healthy volunteers who received a single dose up to 28 mg/kg, although dose limiting neutropenia was observed.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Interleukin inhibitors; ATC code: L04AC07.

Avtozma is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency https://www.ema.europa.eu.

## Mechanism of action

Tocilizumab binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R). tocilizumab has been shown to inhibit sIL-6R and mIL-6R-mediated signalling. IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, monocytes and fibroblasts. IL-6 is involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell activation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, induction of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis and stimulation of haemopoiesis. IL-6 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases including inflammatory diseases, osteoporosis and neoplasia.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacodynamic effects

In RA clinical studies with tocilizumab, rapid decreases in CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),  serum amyloid A (SAA) and fibrinogen were observed. Consistent with the effect on acute phase  reactants, treatment with tocilizumab was associated with reduction in platelet count within the normal  range. Increases in haemoglobin levels were observed, through tocilizumab decreasing the IL-6 driven  effects on hepcidin production to increase iron availability. In tocilizumab-treated patients, decreases in the levels of CRP to within normal ranges were seen as early as week 2, with decreases maintained  while on treatment.

In GCA clinical study WA28119, similar rapid decreases in CRP and ESR were observed along with slight increases in mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration. In healthy subjects administered tocilizumab in doses from 2 to 28 mg/kg intravenously and 81 to 162 mg subcutaneously, absolute neutrophil counts decreased to their lowest 2 to 5 days following administration. Thereafter, neutrophils recovered towards baseline in a dose dependent manner. RA and GCA patients demonstrate a comparable (to healthy subjects) decrease of absolute neutrophil counts following tocilizumab administration (see section 4.8).

## Subcutaneous use

## RA

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of subcutaneous administered tocilizumab in alleviating the signs and symptoms of RA and radiographic response, was assessed in two randomised, double-blind, controlled, multi-center studies. For study I (SC-I), patients were required to be &gt;18 years of age with moderate to severe active RA diagnosed according to ACR criteria who had at least 4 tender and 4 swollen joints at baseline. All patients received background non-biologic DMARD(s). For study II (SC-II), patients were required to be &gt; 18 years of age with moderate to severe active RA diagnosed according to ACR  criteria who had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline.

Switching from 8 mg/kg intravenous once every 4 weeks to 162 mg subcutaneous once every week, will alter exposure in the patient. The extent varies with the patient's body weight (increased in light body weight patients and decreased in heavy body weight patients) but clinical outcome is consistent with that observed in intravenous treated patients.

## Clinical response

Study SC-I evaluated patients with moderate to severe active RA who had an inadequate clinical response to their existing rheumatologic therapy, including one or more DMARD(s) where approximately 20% had a history of inadequate response to at least one TNF inhibitor. In SC-I, 1 262 patients were randomised 1:1 to receive tocilizumab subcutaneous 162 mg every week or tocilizumab intravenous 8 mg/kg every four weeks in combination with non-biologic DMARD(s). The primary endpoint in the study was the difference in the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 24. The results from study SC-I is shown in Table 2.

Table 2. ACR responses in study SC-I (% patients) at Week 24

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## a = Per Protocol Population

Patients in study SC-I had a mean Disease Activity Score (DAS28) at baseline of 6.6 and 6.7 on the subcutaneous and intravenous arms, respectively. At week 24, a significant reduction in DAS28 from  baseline (mean improvement) of 3.5 was observed on both treatment arms, and a comparable proportion of patients had achieved DAS28 clinical remission (DAS28 &lt; 2.6) on the subcutaneous (38.4%) and IV (36.9%) arms.

## Radiographic response

The radiographic response of subcutaneous administered tocilizumab was assessed in a doubleblind,  controlled, multicenter study in patients with active RA (SC-II). Study SC-II evaluated patients with  moderate to severe active RA who had an inadequate clinical response to their existing rheumatologic  therapy, including one or more DMARD(s) where approximately 20% had a history of inadequate  response to at least one TNF inhibitor. Patients were required to be &gt;18 years of age with active RA  diagnosed according to ACR criteria who had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline. In SC-II, 656 patients were randomised 2:1 to tocilizumab subcutaneous 162 mg every other week or  placebo, in combination with non-biologic DMARD(s).

In study SC-II, inhibition of structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as a change from baseline in the van der Heijde modified mean total Sharp score (mTSS). At week 24, inhibition of structural damage was shown, with significantly less radiographic progression in patients receiving tocilizumab subcutaneous compared to placebo (mean mTSS of 0.62 vs. 1.23, p=0.0149 (van  Elteren). These results are consistent with those observed in patients treated with intravenous  tocilizumab.

In study SC-II, at week 24 there was ACR20 of 60.9%, ACR50 of 39.8% and ACR70 of 19.7% for patients treated with tocilizumab subcutaneous every other week versus placebo ACR20 of 31.5%, ACR50 of 12.3% and ACR70 of 5.0%. Patients had mean DAS28 at baseline of 6.7 on subcutaneous  and 6.6 on placebo arms. At week 24, a significant reduction in DAS28 from baseline of 3.1 was  observed on subcutaneous and 1.7 on placebo arm, and for DAS28 &lt; 2.6, 32.0% was observed on  subcutaneous and 4.0% on placebo arm.

## Health-related and quality of life outcomes

In study SC-I, the mean decrease in HAQ-DI from baseline to week 24 was 0.6 on both the subcutaneous and intravenous arms. The proportion of patients achieving a clinically relevant improvement in HAQ-DI at week 24 (change from baseline of ≥ 0.3 units) was also comparable on the  subcutaneous (65.2%) versus intravenous (67.4%) arms, with a weighted difference in proportions of - 2.3% (95% CI - 8.1, 3.4). For SF-36, the mean change from baseline at week 24 in the mental  component score was 6.22 for the subcutaneous arm and 6.54 for the intravenous arm, and for the  physical component score was also similar with 9.49 for the subcutaneous arm and 9.65 for the  intravenous arm.

In study SC-II, mean decrease in HAQ-DI from baseline to week 24 was significantly greater for patients treated with tocilizumab subcutaneous every other week (0.4) versus placebo (0.3). Proportion  of patients achieving a clinically relevant improvement in HAQ-DI at week 24 (change from baseline  of ≥ 0.3 units) was higher for tocilizumab subcutaneous every other week (58%) versus placebo  (46.8%). SF-36 (mean change in mental and physical component scores) was significantly greater with  tocilizumab subcutaneous group (6.5 and 5.3) versus placebo (3.8 and 2.9).

## Subcutaneous Use

## sJIA

## Clinical Efficacy

A 52-week, open-label, multi-centre, PK/PD and safety study (WA28118) was conducted in paediatric  patients with sJIA, aged 1 to 17 years, to determine the appropriate SC dose of tocilizumab that  achieved comparable PK/PD and safety profiles to the IV regimen.

Eligible patients received tocilizumab dosed according to body weight (BW), with patients weighing

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

≥30 kg (n=26) dosed with 162 mg of tocilizumab every week (QW) and patients weighing below 30 kg (n=25) dosed with 162 mg of tocilizumab every 10 days (Q10D; n=8) or every 2 weeks (Q2W;  n=17) for 52 weeks. Of these 51 patients, 26 (51%) were naive to tocilizumab and 25 (49%) had been receiving tocilizumab IV and switched to tocilizumab SC at baseline.

Exploratory efficacy results showed that tocilizumab SC improved all exploratory efficacy parameters  including Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS)-71, for TCZ naïve patients and  maintained all exploratory efficacy parameters for patients who switched from tocilizumab IV to  tocilizumab SC treatment over the entire course of the study for patients in both body weight groups  (below 30 kg and ≥30 kg).

## Subcutaneous Use

## pJIA

Clinical Efficacy

A 52-week, open-label, multicenter, PK-PD and safety study was conducted in paediatric patients with  pJIA, aged 1 to 17 years old, to determine the appropriate subcutaneous dose of tocilizumab that  achieved comparable PK/PD and safety profiles to the IV regimen.

Eligible patients received tocilizumab dosed according to body weight (BW), with patients weighing ≥ 30 kg (n = 25) dosed with 162 mg of tocilizumab every 2 weeks (Q2W) and patients weighing below 30 kg (n = 27) dosed with 162 mg of tocilizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 52 weeks.  Of these 52 patients, 37 (71%) were naive to tocilizumab and 15 (29%) had been receiving tocilizumab  IV and switched to tocilizumab SC at baseline.

The tocilizumab SC regimens of 162 mg Q3W for patients weighing below 30 kg and of 162 mg Q2W for patients weighing ≥ 30 kg respectively provide PK exposure and PD responses to support efficacy  and safety outcomes similar to those achieved with the approved tocilizumab IV regimens for pJIA.

Exploratory efficacy results showed that tocilizumab SC improved median Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS)-71 for tocilizumab naïve patients and maintained the median JADAS-71 for patients who switched from IV to SC tocilizumab treatment over the entire course of the study for patients in both body weight groups (below 30 kg and ≥ 30 kg).

## Subcutaneous Use

## GCA

Clinical efficacy

Study WA28119 was a randomised, multi-center, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase III superiority study conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with GCA.

Two hundred and fifty one (251) patients with new-onset or relapsing GCA were enrolled and assigned to one of four treatment arms. The study consisted of a 52-week blinded period (Part 1), followed by a 104-week open-label extension (Part 2). The purpose of Part 2 was  to describe the long-term safety and maintenance of efficacy after 52 weeks of tocilizumab therapy, to explore the rate  of relapse and the requirement for tocilizumab therapy beyond 52 weeks, and to gain insight into the  potential long-term steroid-sparing effect of tocilizumab.

Two subcutaneous doses of tocilizumab (162 mg every week and 162 mg every other week) were compared to two different placebo control groups randomised 2:1:1:1.

All patients received background glucocorticoid (prednisone) therapy. Each of the tocilizumabtreated  groups and one of the placebo-treated groups followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen over  26 weeks, while the second placebo-treated group followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen over 52 weeks, designed to be more in keeping with standard practice.

The duration of glucocorticoid therapy during screening and before tocilizumab (or placebo) was initiated, was similar in all 4 treatment groups (see Table 3).

The primary efficacy endpoint assessed by the proportion of patients achieving steroid free sustained remission at week 52 on tocilizumab plus 26 weeks prednisone taper compared with placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone taper, was met (Table 4).

The key secondary efficacy endpoint also based on the proportion of patients achieving sustained remission at week 52, comparing tocilizumab plus 26 weeks prednisone taper with placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper, was also met (Table 4).

A statistically significant superior treatment effect was seen in favour of tocilizumab over placebo in achieving steroid-free sustained remission at week 52 on tocilizumab plus 26 weeks prednisone taper compared with placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone taper and with placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper.

The percentage of patients achieving sustained remission at week 52, are shown in the Table 4.

## Secondary Endpoints

The assessment of the time to first GCA flare showed a significantly lower risk of flare for the tocilizumab subcutaneous weekly group compared to placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone and  placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper groups and for the tocilizumab subcutaneous every other  weekly group compared to placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone (when compared at a 0.01 significance  level). Tocilizumab subcutaneous weekly dose also showed a clinically meaningful decrease in the risk  for flare compared to placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone in patients who entered the trial with relapsing GCA as well as those with new-onset disease (Table 4).

## Cumulative glucocorticoid dose

The cumulative prednisone dose at week 52 was significantly lower in the two tocilizumab dose  groups compared to the two placebo groups (Table 4). In a separate analysis of the patients who  received escape prednisone to treat GCA flare during the first 52 weeks, the cumulative prednisone dose varied greatly.  The median doses for escape patients in the tocilizumab weekly and every other  weekly groups were 3 129.75 mg and 3 847 mg, respectively. Both considerably lower than in the  placebo plus 26 weeks and the placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper groups, 4 023.5 mg and 5 389.5 mg respectively.

## Quality of Life Outcomes

In study WA28119, the SF-36 results were separated into the physical and mental component summary scores (PCS and MCS, respectively). The PCS mean change from baseline to week 52 was higher (showing more improvement) in the tocilizumab weekly and every other weekly dose groups

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

[4.10, 2.76, respectively] than in the two placebo groups [placebo plus 26 weeks; -0.28, placebo plus 52 weeks; -1.49], although only the comparison between tocilizumab weekly plus 26 weeks prednisone taper group and placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper group (5.59, 99% CI: 8.6, 10.32)  showed a statistically significant difference (p=0.0024). For MCS, the mean change from baseline to  week 52 for both tocilizumab weekly and every other weekly dose groups [7.28, 6.12, respectively]  were higher than the placebo plus 52 weeks prednisone taper group [2.84] (although the differences  were not statistically significant [weekly p=0.0252 for weekly, p=0.1468 for every other weekly]) and  similar to the placebo plus 26 weeks prednisone taper group [6.67].

The Patient's Global Assessment of disease activity was assessed on a 0-100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The mean change in Patient's global VAS from baseline at week 52 was lower (showing  greater improvement) in the tocilizumab weekly and every other weekly dose groups [19.0, -25.3,  respectively] than in both placebo  groups [placebo plus 26 weeks -3.4, placebo plus 52 weeks -7.2],  although only the tocilizumab every other weekly plus 26 weeks prednisone taper group showed a  statistically significant difference compared to placebo [placebo plus 26 weeks taper p=0.0059, and  placebo plus 52 weeks taper p=0.0081].

FACIT-Fatigue change from baseline to week 52 scores were calculated for all groups.  The mean [SD] change scores were as follows: tocilizumab weekly plus 26 weeks 5.61 [10.115], tocilizumab every other weekly plus 26 weeks 1.81 [8.836], placebo plus 26 weeks 0.26 [10.702], and placebo plus 52 weeks -1.63 [6.753].

Change in EQ5D scores from baseline to week 52 were tocilizumab weekly plus 26 weeks 0.10 [0.198], tocilizumab every other weekly plus 26 weeks 0.05 [0.215], placebo plus 26 weeks 0.07 [0.293], and placebo plus 52 weeks -0.02 [0.159].

Higher scores signal improvement in both FACIT-Fatigue and EQ5D.

## Intravenous use

## RA

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of tocilizumab in alleviating the signs and symptoms of RA was assessed in five randomised, double-blind, multi-centre studies. Studies I-V enrolled patients ≥ 18 years of age with active RA diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and who had  at least eight tender and six swollen joints at baseline.

In Study I, tocilizumab was administered intravenously every four weeks as monotherapy. In Studies  II, III and V, tocilizumab was administered intravenously every four weeks in combination with MTX  vs. placebo and MTX. In Study IV, tocilizumab was administered intravenously every 4 weeks in  combination with other DMARDs vs. placebo and other DMARDs. The primary endpoint for each of  the five studies was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at week 24.

Study I evaluated 673 patients who had not been treated with MTX within six months prior to randomisation and who had not discontinued previous MTX treatment as a result of clinically important toxic effects or lack of response. The majority (67%) of patients were MTX-naïve. Doses of  8 mg/kg of tocilizumab were given every four weeks as monotherapy. The comparator group was weekly MTX (dose titrated from 7.5 mg to a maximum of 20 mg weekly over an eight week period).

Study II, a two year study with planned analyses at week 24, week 52 and week 104, evaluated 1 196 patients who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Doses of 4 or 8 mg/kg of tocilizumab or placebo were given every four weeks as blinded therapy for 52 weeks in combination with stable MTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly). After week 52, all patients could receive open-label treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg. Of the patients who completed the study who were originally randomised to placebo + MTX, 86% received open-label tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in year 2. The primary endpoint at week 24 was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response. At week 52 and week 104  the co-primary endpoints were prevention of joint damage and improvement in physical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

function.

Study III evaluated 623 patients who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Doses of 4 or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo were given every four weeks, in combination with stable MTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly).

Study IV evaluated 1 220 patients who had an inadequate response to their existing rheumatologic therapy, including one or more DMARDs. Doses of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo were given every  four weeks in combination with stable DMARDs.

Study V evaluated 499 patients who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to one or more TNF antagonist therapies. The TNF antagonist therapy was discontinued prior to randomisation.  Doses of 4 or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo were given every four weeks in combination with stable  MTX (10 mg to 25 mg weekly).

## Clinical response

In all studies, patients treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg had statistically significant higher ACR 20, 50,  70 response rates at 6 months compared to control (Table 5). In study I, superiority of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg was demonstrated against the active comparator MTX.

The treatment effect was similar in patients independent of rheumatoid factor status, age, gender, race,  number of prior treatments or disease status. Time to onset was rapid (as early as week 2) and the  magnitude of response continued to improve with duration of treatment. Continued durable responses  were seen for over 3 years in the ongoing open label extension studies I-V.

In patients treated with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg, significant improvements were noted on all individual components of the ACR response including: tender and swollen joint counts; patients and physician global assessment; disability index scores; pain assessment and CRP compared to patients receiving placebo plus MTX or other DMARDs in all studies.

Patients in studies I - V had a mean Disease Activity Score (DAS28) of 6.5-6.8 at baseline. Significant reduction in DAS28 from baseline (mean improvement) of 3.1-3.4 were observed in tocilizumab-treated patients compared to control patients (1.3-2.1). The proportion of patients achieving a DAS28 clinical remission (DAS28 &lt; 2.6) was significantly higher in patients receiving tocilizumab (28-34%) compared to 1-12% of control patients at 24 weeks. In study II, 65% of patients  achieved a DAS28 &lt; 2.6 at week 104 compared to 48% at 52 weeks and 33% of patients at week 24.

In a pooled analysis of studies II, III and IV, the proportion of patients achieving an ACR 20, 50 and 70 response was significantly higher (59% vs. 50%, 37% vs. 27%, 18% vs. 11%, respectively) in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD vs. the tocilizumab 4 mg/kg plus DMARD group (p&lt; 0.03). Similarly the proportion of patients achieving a DAS 28 remission (DAS28 &lt; 2.6) was significantly higher (31% vs. 16% respectively) in patients receiving tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus DMARD than in patients receiving tocilizumab 4 mg/kg plus DMARD (p&lt; 0.0001).

## Major clinical response

After 2 years of treatment with tocilizumab plus MTX, 14% of patients achieved a major clinical  response (maintenance of an ACR70 response for 24 weeks or more).

## Radiographic response

In Study II, in patients with an inadequate response to MTX, inhibition of structural joint damage was  assessed radiographically and expressed as change in modified Sharp score and its components, the  erosion score and joint space narrowing score. Inhibition of joint structural damage was shown with  significantly less radiographic progression in patients receiving tocilizumab compared to control  (Table 6).

In the open-label extension of Study II the inhibition of progression of structural joint damage in  tocilizumab plus MTX-treated patients was maintained in the second year of treatment. The mean  change from baseline at week 104 in total Sharp-Genant score was significantly lower for patients  randomised to tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus MTX (p&lt;0.0001) compared with patients who were  randomised to placebo plus MTX.

Following 1 year of treatment with tocilizumab plus MTX, 85% of patients(n=348) had no progression  of structural joint damage, as defined by a change in the Total Sharp Score of zero or less, compared  with 67% of placebo plus MTX-treated patients(n=290) (p ≤ 0.001). This remained consistent  following 2 years of treatment (83%; n=353). Ninety three percent (93%; n=271) of patients had no  progression between week 52 and week 104.

## Health-related and quality of life outcomes

Tocilizumab-treated patients reported an improvement in all patient-reported outcomes (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index - HAQ-DI), Short Form-36 and Functional Assessment of  Chronic Illness Therapy questionnaires. Statistically significant improvements in HAQ-DI scores were  observed in patients treated with tocilizumab compared with patients treated with DMARDs. During  the open-label period of Study II, the improvement in physical function has been maintained for up to  2 years. At Week 52, the mean change in HAQ-DI was -0.58 in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

plus MTX  group compared with -0.39 in the placebo + MTX group. The mean change in HAQ-DI was  maintained at Week 104 in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg plus MTX group (-0.61).

## Haemoglobin levels

Statistically significant improvements in haemoglobin levels were observed with tocilizumab compared with DMARDs (p&lt; 0.0001) at week 24. Mean haemoglobin levels increased by week 2 and  remained within normal range through to week 24.

## Tocilizumab versus adalimumab in monotherapy

Study VI (WA19924), a 24 week double-blinded study that compared tocilizumab monotherapy with adalimumab monotherapy, evaluated 326 patients with RA who were intolerant of MTX or where continued treatment with MTX was considered inappropriate (including MTX inadequate responders). Patients in the tocilizumab arm received an intravenous (IV) infusion of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) every 4 weeks (q4w) and a subcutaneous (SC) placebo injection every 2 weeks (q2w). Patients in the adalimumab arm received an adalimumab SC injection (40 mg) q2w plus an IV placebo infusion q4w. A statistically significant superior treatment effect was seen in favour of tocilizumab over adalimumab in control of disease activity from baseline to week 24 for the primary endpoint of change in DAS28 and for all secondary endpoints (Table 7).

The overall clinical adverse event profile was similar between tocilizumab and adalimumab. The proportion of patients with serious adverse events was balanced between the treatment groups (tocilizumab 11.7% vs. adalimumab 9.9%). The types of adverse drug reactions in the tocilizumab arm  were consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab and adverse drug reactions were reported  at a similar frequency compared with Table 1. A higher incidence of infections and infestations was  reported in the tocilizumab arm (48% vs. 42%), with no difference in the incidence of serious  infections (3.1%). Both study treatments induced the same pattern of changes in laboratory safety  parameters (decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts, increases in ALT, AST and lipids), however,  the magnitude of change and the frequency of marked abnormalities was higher with tocilizumab  compared with adalimumab. Four (2.5%) patients in the tocilizumab arm and two (1.2%) patients in  the adalimumab arm experienced CTC grade 3 or 4 neutrophil count decreases. Eleven (6.8%) patients  in the tocilizumab arm and five (3.1%) patients in the adalimumab arm experienced ALT increases of  CTC grade 2 or higher. The mean LDL increase from baseline was 0.64 mmol/L (25 mg/dL) for  patients in the tocilizumab arm and 0.19 mmol/L (7 mg/dL) for patients in the adalimumab arm. The  safety observed in the tocilizumab arm was consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab and  no new or unexpected adverse drug reactions were observed (see Table 1).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab is characterized by nonlinear elimination which is a combination  of linear clearance and Michaelis-Menten elimination.  The nonlinear part of tocilizumab elimination  leads to an increase in exposure that is more than dose-proportional.  The pharmacokinetic parameters  of tocilizumab do not change with time. Due to the dependence of total clearance on tocilizumab serum  concentrations, the half-life of tocilizumab is also concentration-dependent and varies depending on the serum concentration level. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in any patient population tested so far indicate no relationship between apparent clearance and the presence of anti-drug antibodies.

## RA Intravenous use

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on  a database composed of 3 552 RA patients treated with a one-hour infusion of 4 or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab  every 4 weeks for 24 weeks or with 162 mg tocilizumab given subcutaneously either once a week or  every other week for 24 weeks.

The following parameters (predicted mean ± SD) were estimated for a dose of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab given every 4 weeks: steady-state area under curve (AUC) = 38 000 ± 13 000 h µg/mL, trough concentration (Cmin) = 15.9 ± 13.1 µ g/mL and maximum concentration (Cmax) = 182 ± 50.4 µg/mL, and. the accumulation ratios for AUC and Cmax were small, 1.32 and 1.09, respectively. The accumulation ratio was higher for Cmin (2.49), which was expected based on the non-linear clearance contribution at lower concentrations. Steady-state was reached following the first administration for Cmax and after 8 and 20 weeks for AUC and Cmin, respectively. Tocilizumab AUC, Cmin and Cmax increased with increase of body weight. At body weight ≥ 100 kg, the predicted mean (± SD) steadystate AUC, Cmin and Cmax of tocilizumab were 50 000 ± 16 800 μg·h/mL, 24.4 ± 17.5 μg/mL, and 226 ± 50.3 μg/mL, respectively, which are higher than mean exposure values for the patient population (i.e. all body weights) reported above. The dose-response curve for tocilizumab flattens at higher exposure, resulting in smaller efficacy gains for each incremental increase in tocilizumab concentration such that clinically meaningful increases in efficacy were not demonstrated in patients treated with &gt; 800 mg of tocilizumab. Therefore, tocilizumab doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are  not recommended (see section 4.2).

## Distribution

In RA patients the central volume of distribution was 3.72, the peripheral volume of distribution was 3.35 resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 7.07.

## Elimination

Following intravenous administration, tocilizumab undergoes biphasic elimination from the circulation.  The total clearance of tocilizumab was concentration-dependent and is the sum of the linear and non-linear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as a parameter in the population pharmacokinetic analysis and was 9.5 mL/h. The concentration-dependent non-linear clearance plays a  major role at low tocilizumab concentrations. Once the non-linear clearance pathway is saturated, at  higher tocilizumab concentrations, clearance is mainly determined by the linear clearance. The t1/2 of tocilizumab was concentration-dependent. At steady-state following a dose of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks, the effective t1/2 decreased with decreasing concentrations within a dosing interval from 18 days to 6 days.

## Linearity

Pharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab did not change with time. A more than dose-proportional increase in the AUC and Cmin was observed for doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks. Cmax increased dose-proportionally. At steady-state, predicted AUC and Cmin were 3.2 and 30 fold higher at 8 mg/kg as compared to 4 mg/kg, respectively.

## Subcutaneous use

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab were determined using a population pharmacokinetic analysis on  a database composed of 3 552 RA patients treated with 162 mg subcutaneous every week, 162 mg subcutaneous every other week, and or 4 or 8 mg/kg intravenous every 4 weeks for 24 weeks.

The pharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab did not change with time. For the 162 mg every week  dose, the predicted mean (±SD) steady-state AUC1week, Cmin and Cmax of tocilizumab were 7 970 ± 3 432 µg·h/mL, 43.0 ± 19.8 µg/mL, and 49.8 ± 21.0 µg/mL, respectively. The accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 6.32, 6.30, and 5.27, respectively. Steady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax.

For the 162 every other week dose, the predicted mean (±SD) steady-state AUC2week, Cmin, and  Cmax of tocilizumab were 3 430 ± 2 660 µg·h/mL, 5.7 ± 6.8 µg/mL, and 13.2 ± 8.8 µg/mL,  respectively. The accumulation ratios for AUC, Cmin, and Cmax were 2.67, 6.02, and 2.12, respectively.  Steady state was reached after 12 weeks for AUC and Cmin, and after 10 weeks for Cmax.

## Absorption

Following subcutaneous dosing in RA patients, the time to peak serum tocilizumab concentrations t max was 2.8 days. The bioavailability for the subcutaneous formulation was 79%.

## Elimination

For subcutaneous administration, the concentration-dependent apparent t 1/2 is up to 12 days for 162 mg every week and 5 days for 162 mg every other week in patients with RA at steady-state.

## sJIA

## Subcutaneous Use

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab in sJIA patients was characterized by a population pharmacokinetic analysis which included 140 patients who were treated with 8 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks (patients weighing ≥30 kg), 12 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg), 162 mg SC every week (patients weighing ≥30 kg), 162 mg SC every 10 days or every 2 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg).

Limited data are available regarding exposures following subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab in sJIA patients below 2 years of age with a body weight less than 10 kg.

Patients with sJIA must have a minimum body weight of 10 kg when receiving tocilizumab subcutaneously (see section 4.2).

Table 8. Predicted mean ± SD PK parameters at steady-state after SC dosing in sJIA

| Tocilizumab PK Parameter       | 162mgQW ≥ 30 kg   | 162 mg Q2Wbelow 30 kg   |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| C max (µg/mL)                  | 99.8 ± 46.2       | 134 ± 58.6              |

| C mean (µg/mL)                 | 91.3 ± 40.4       | 101 ± 43.2              |
| Accumulation C max             | 3.66              | 1.88                    |
| Accumulation C min             | 4.39              | 3.21                    |
| Accumulation C mean or AUC τ * | 4.28              | 2.27                    |

After SC dosing, approximately 90% of the steady-state was reached by week 12 for both the 162 mg QW and Q2W regimens.

## Absorption

Following SC dosing in sJIA patients, the absorption half-life was around 2 days, and the bioavailability for the SC formulation in sJIA patients was 95%.

## Distribution

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In paediatric patients with sJIA, the central volume of distribution was 1.87 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.14 L resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 4.01 L

## Elimination

The total clearance of tocilizumab was concentration-dependent and is the sum of the linear clearance and the nonlinear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as a parameter in the population pharmacokinetic analysis and was 5.7 mL/h in paediatric patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Following subcutaneous administration, the effective t1/2 of tocilizumab in sJIA patients is up to 14 days for both the 162 mg QW and Q2W regimens during a dosing interval at steady state.

## pJIA

## Subcutaneous use

The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab in pJIA patients was characterized by a population pharmacokinetic analysis which included 237 patients who were treated with 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (patients weighing ≥ 30 kg), 10 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg), 162 mg SC every 2 weeks (patients weighing ≥ 30 kg), or 162 mg SC every 3 weeks (patients weighing below 30 kg).

Table 9. Predicted mean ± SD PK parameters at steady-state after SC dosing in pJIA

| Tocilizumab PK Parameter       | 162 mgQ2W ≥ 30 kg   | 162 mg Q3Wbelow 30 kg   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| C max (µg/mL)                  | 29.4 ± 13.5         | 75.5 ± 24.1             |
| C min (µg/mL)                  | 11.8 ± 7.08         | 18.4 ± 12.9             |
| C avg (µg/mL)                  | 21.7 ± 10.4         | 45.5 ± 19.8             |
| Accumulation C max             | 1.72                | 1.32                    |
| Accumulation C min             | 3.58                | 2.08                    |
| Accumulation C mean or AUC τ * | 2.04                | 1.46                    |

After IV dosing, approximately 90% of the steady-state was reached by Week 12 for the 10 mg/kg (BW &lt; 30 kg), and by Week 16 for the 8 mg/kg (BW ≥ 30 kg) dose.  After SC dosing, approximately 90% of the steady-state was reached by Week 12 for both the 162 mg SC Q2W and Q3W regimens.

## Absorption

Following SC dosing in pJIA patients, the absorption half-life was around 2 days, and the bioavailability for the SC formulation in pJIA patients was 96%.

## Distribution

In paediatric patients with pJIA, the central volume of distribution was 1.97 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.03 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 4.0 L.

## Elimination

Population pharmacokinetic analysis for pJIA patients showed body size related impact on linear clearance so that body-weight based dosing should be taken into consideration (see Table 9).

After subcutaneous administration, the effective t1/2 of tocilizumab in pJIA patients is up to 10 days for  patients &lt; 30 kg (162 mg SC Q3W) and up to 7 days for patients ≥ 30 kg (162 mg SC Q2W) during  a dosing interval at steady state. Following intravenous administration, tocilizumab undergoes biphasic elimination from the circulation. The total clearance of tocilizumab was concentrationdependent and is the sum of the linear and non-linear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as a  parameter in the population pharmacokinetic analysis and was 6.25 mL/h. The concentrationdependent non-linear clearance plays a major role at low tocilizumab concentrations. Once the nonlinear clearance pathway is saturated, at higher tocilizumab concentrations, clearance is mainly determined by the linear clearance.

## Subcutaneous use

The PK of tocilizumab  in GCA patients were determined using a population PK model from an analysis dataset composed of 149 GCA patients treated with 162 mg subcutaneous every week or 162 mg subcutaneous every other week.  The developed model had the same structure as the population PK model developed earlier based on data from RA patients (see Table 10).

Table 10. Predicted mean ± SD PK parameters at steady-state after subcutaneous dosing in GCA

|                                | Subcutaneous              | Subcutaneous   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Tocilizumab PK Parameter       | 162 mg every other weekly | 162 mg weekly  |
| C max (µg/mL)                  | 19.3 ± 12.8               | 73 ± 30.4      |
| C trough (µg/mL)               | 11.1 ± 10.3               | 68.1± 29.5     |
| C mean (µg/mL)                 | 16.2 ± 11.8               | 71.3 ± 30.1    |
| Accumulation C max             | 2.18                      | 8.88           |
| Accumulation C trough          | 5.61                      | 9.59           |
| Accumulation C mean or AUC τ * | 2.81                      | 10.91          |

The steady-state profile following the tocilizumab weekly dose was almost flat, with very little fluctuations between trough and peak values, while there were substantial fluctuations for the tocilizumab every other weekly dose. Approximately 90% of the steady-state (AUC τ ) was reached by week 14 in the every other weekly and week 17 in the weekly dose groups.

Based on the current characterization of PK, tocilizumab trough concentration at steady state are 50%  higher in this population relative to average concentrations in a large dataset from the RA population.  These differences occur due to unknown reasons. PK differences are not accompanied by marked  differences in PD parameters and so the clinical relevance is unknown.

In GCA patients, higher exposure was observed in patients with lower body weight. For the 162 mg every week dosing regimen, the steady-state Cavg was 51% higher in patients with body weight less than 60 kg compared to patients weighing between 60 to 100 kg. For the 162 mg every other week regimen, the steady-state Cavg was 129% higher in patients with body weight less than 60 kg compared to patients weighing between 60 to 100 kg. There is limited data for patients above 100 kg (n=7).

## Absorption

Following subcutaneous dosing in GCA patients, the absorption t½ was around 4 days. The bioavailability for the SC formulation was 0.8. The median values of Tmax were 3 days after the tocilizumab weekly dose and 4.5 days after the tocilizumab every other week dose.

## Distribution

In GCA patients, the central volume of distribution was 4.09 L, the peripheral volume of distribution was 3.37 L, resulting in a volume of distribution at steady state of 7.46 L.

## Elimination

The total clearance of tocilizumab was concentration-dependent and is the sum of the linear clearance  and the nonlinear clearance. The linear clearance was estimated as a parameter in the population  pharmacokinetic analysis and was 6.7 mL/h in GCA patients,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In GCA patients, at steady state, the effective t ½ of tocilizumab varied between 18.3 and 18.9 days for  162 mg weekly regimen, and between 4.2 and 7.9 days for 162 mg every other weekly regimen. At  high serum concentrations, when total clearance of tocilizumab is dominated by linear clearance, an  effective t ½ of approximately 32 days was derived from the population parameter estimates.

## Special populations

Renal impairment: No formal study of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab has been conducted. Most of the patients in the RA and GCA studies population pharmacokinetic analysis had normal renal function or mild renal impairment. Mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance based on Cockcroft-Gault formula) did not impact the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab.

Approximately one-third of the patients in the GCA study had moderate renal impairment at baseline (estimated creatinine clearance of 30-59 mL/min). No impact on tocilizumab exposure was noted in these patients.

No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.

Hepatic impairment: No formal study of the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab has been conducted.

Age, gender and ethnicity : Population pharmacokinetic analyses in RA and GCA patients, showed that  age, gender and ethnic origin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab.

Results of the population PK analysis for sJIA and pJIA patients confirmed that body size is the only covariate which has an appreciable impact on the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab including elimination and absorption so that body-weight based dosing should be taken into consideration (see Tables 8 and 9).

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development.

Carcinogenicity studies were not performed because IgG1 monoclonal antibodies are not deemed to have intrinsic carcinogenic potential.

Available non-clinical data demonstrated the effect of IL-6 on malignant progression and apoptosis resistance to various cancer types. This data does not suggest a relevant risk for cancer initiation and progression under tocilizumab treatment. Additionally, proliferative lesions were not observed in a 6month chronic toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys or in IL-6 deficient mice.

Available non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility under tocilizumab treatment. Effects on  endocrine active and reproductive system organs were not observed in a chronic cynomolgus monkey  toxicity study and reproductive performance was not affected in IL-6 deficient mice. Tocilizumab  administered to cynomolgus monkeys during early gestation, was observed to have no direct or  indirect harmful effect on pregnancy or embryonal-foetal development. However, a slight increase in  abortion/embryonal-foetal death was observed with high systemic exposure (&gt; 100 x human exposure)  in the 50 mg/kg/day high-dose group compared to placebo and other low-dose groups. Although IL-6  does not seem to be a critical cytokine for foetal growth or the immunological control of the  maternal/foetal interface, a relation of this finding to tocilizumab cannot be excluded.

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.
- This medicine has been prescribed for you only.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

In addition to this leaflet, you will be given a Patient Alert Card , which contains important safety information that you need to be aware of before and during treatment with Avtozma.

## What is in this leaflet :

1. What Avtozma is and what it is used for

3. How Avtozma is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Avtozma
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Avtozma is and what it is used for

Avtozma contains the active substance tocilizumab, which is a protein made from specific immune cells (monoclonal antibody), that blocks the action of a specific protein (cytokine) called interleukin-6. This protein is involved in inflammatory processes of the body, and blocking it can reduce the inflammation in your body. Avtozma helps to reduce symptoms such as pain and swelling in your joints and can also improve your performance of daily tasks. Avtozma has been shown to slow the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve your ability to do normal daily activities.

- Avtozma is used to treat adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA),  an autoimmune disease, if previous therapies did not work well enough. Avtozma is usually given in combination with methotrexate. However, Avtozma can be given alone if your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate.
- Avtozma can also be used to treat adults who have not had previous methotrexate treatment  if they have severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis.
- Avtozma is used to treat children with sJIA . Avtozma is used for children aged 2 years  and over who have active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( sJIA ), an inflammatory  disease that causes pain and swelling in one or more joints as well as fever and rash.  Avtozma is used to improve the symptoms of sJIA and can be given in combination with  methotrexate or alone.
- Avtozma is used to treat children with pJIA . Avtozma is used for children aged 2  years and over with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( pJIA ), an inflammatory disease that causes pain and swelling in one or more joints. Avtozma is used to improve the symptoms of pJIA and can be given in combination with methotrexate or alone.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Avtozma is used to treat adults and children aged 2 years and over with severe or lifethreatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) , a side-effect in patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies used to treat certain types of cancer.
- Avtozma is used to treat adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), receiving systemic corticosteroids and requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation.

## 2. What you need to know before you are given Avtozma

## You are not to be given Avtozma

- if you are allergic to tocilizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). (See special warnings at the end of this section under subtitle 'Avtozma contains polysorbate')
- if you have an active, severe infection.

If any of these applies to you, tell the doctor or nurse giving you the infusion.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Avtozma.

- If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, severe dizziness or light-headedness, swelling of the lips or skin rash during or after the infusion, then tell your doctor immediately.
- If you have any kind of infection , short- or long-term, or if you often get infections. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel unwell. Avtozma can reduce your body's ability to respond  to infections and may make an existing infection worse or increase the chance of getting a new infection.
- If you have had tuberculosis , tell your doctor. Your doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Avtozma. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough,  weight loss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell  your doctor immediately.
- If you have had intestinal ulcers or diverticulitis , tell your doctor. Symptoms would include abdominal pain and unexplained changes in bowel habits with a fever.
- If you have liver disease , tell your doctor. Before you use Avtozma, your doctor may do a blood test to measure your liver function.
- If any patient has recently been vaccinated (either adult or child), or is planning a vaccination, tell your doctor. All patients, especially children, should be up-to-date with all their vaccinations before they start treatment with Avtozma, unless urgent treatment initiation is required. Certain types of vaccines should not be used while receiving Avtozma.
- If you have cancer , tell your doctor. Your doctor will have to decide if you can still be given Avtozma.
- If you have cardiovascular risk factors such as raised blood pressure and raised cholesterol levels, tell your doctor. These factors need to be monitored while receiving Avtozma.
- If you have moderate to severe kidney function problems , your doctor will monitor you.
- If you have persistent headaches .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Your doctor will perform blood tests before you are given Avtozma, and during your treatment, to determine if you have a low white blood cell count, low platelet count or high liver enzymes.

## Children and adolescents

Avtozma is not recommended for use in children under 2 years of age.

If a child has a history of macrophage activation syndrome , (activation and uncontrolled proliferation of specific blood cells), tell your doctor. Your doctor will have to decide if they can still be given Avtozma.

## Other medicines and Avtozma

Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines (or your child is, if they are the patient), or have recently taken any. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription.

Avtozma can reduce pain and swelling in the arteries and veins in your head, neck and arms.

GCA is often treated with medicines called steroids. They are usually effective, but can have side effects if used at high doses for a long time. Reducing the steroid dose can also lead to a flare-up of the GCA. Adding Avtozma to the treatment means that steroids can be used for a shorter time, while still controlling GCA.

- children and adolescents, aged 1 year and over, with active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) , an inflammatory disease that causes pain and swelling in one or more joints as well as fever and rash.

Avtozma is used to improve the symptoms of sJIA. It can be given in combination with methotrexate or alone.

- children and adolescents, aged 2 years and over, with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( pJIA ). This is an inflammatory disease that causes pain and swelling in one or more joints.

Avtozma is used to improve the symptoms of pJIA. It can be given in combination with methotrexate or alone .

## 2. What you need to know before you use Avtozma

## Do not use Avtozma

- if you or a child patient you look after are allergic to tocilizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). (See special warnings at the end of this section under subtitle 'Avtozma contains polysorbate')
- if you or a child patient you look after have an active, severe infection.

If either of these applies to you, tell a doctor. Do not use Avtozma.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Avtozma.

- If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, severe dizziness or lightheadedness, swelling of the lips, tongue, face or skin itching, hives or rash during or after the injection, then tell your doctor immediately.
- Do not take the next dose until you have informed your doctor AND your doctor has told you to take the next dose if you have experienced any allergic reaction symptoms after Avtozma administration.
- If you have any kind of infection , short- or long-term, or if you often get infections. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel unwell. Avtozma can reduce your body's ability to respond to infections and may make an existing infection worse or increase the chance of getting a new infection.
- If you have had tuberculosis , tell your doctor. Your doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Avtozma. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever) or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately.
- If you have had intestinal ulcers or diverticulitis , tell your doctor. Symptoms would include abdominal pain and unexplained changes in bowel habits with a fever.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- If you have liver disease , tell your doctor. Before you use Avtozma, your doctor may do a blood test to measure your liver function.
- If any patient has recently been vaccinated, or is planning a vaccination , tell your doctor. All patients should be up-to-date with all their vaccinations before they start treatment with Avtozma. Certain types of vaccines should not be given while receiving Avtozma.
- If you have cancer , tell your doctor. Your doctor will have to decide if you can still be given Avtozma.
- If you have cardiovascular risk factors such as raised blood pressure and raised cholesterol levels, tell your doctor. These factors need to be monitored while receiving Avtozma.
- If you have moderate to severe kidney function problems , your doctor will monitor you.
- If you have persistent headaches .

Your doctor will perform a blood test before you receive Avtozma, to determine if you have a low white blood cell count, low platelet count or high liver enzymes.

## Children and adolescents

Avtozma subcutaneous injection is not recommended for use in children under 1 year of age. Avtozma must not be given to children with sJIA weighing less than 10 kg.

If a child has a history of macrophage activation syndrome (activation and uncontrolled proliferation of specific blood cells), tell your doctor. Your doctor will have to decide if they can still be given Avtozma.

## Other medicines and Avtozma

Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, or have recently taken any. Avtozma can affect the way some medicines work, and the dose of these may require adjustment. If you are using medicines containing any of the following active substances, tell your doctor:

- methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, used to reduce inflammation
- simvastatin or atorvastatin, used to reduce cholesterol levels
- calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine), used to treat raised blood pressure
- theophylline, used to treat asthma
- warfarin or phenprocoumon, used as a blood thinning agents
- phenytoin, used to treat convulsions
- ciclosporin, used to suppress your immune system during organ transplants
- benzodiazepines (e.g. temazepam), used to relieve anxiety

Due to lack of clinical experience, tocilizumab is not recommended for use with other biological medicines for the treatment of RA, sJIA, pJIA or GCA.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

Avtozma is not to be used in pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, may be pregnant, or intend to become pregnant.

Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment.

Stop breast-feeding if you are to be given Avtozma , and talk to your doctor. Leave a gap of at  least 3 months after your last treatment before you start breast-feeding. It is not known whether  Avtozma is passed into breast milk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Driving and using machines

This medicine can cause dizziness. If you feel dizzy, do not drive or use machines.

## Avtozma contains polysorbate

This medicine contains 0.2 mg of polysorbate 80 in each pre-filled syringe. Polysorbates may cause allergic reactions. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

## 3. How to use Avtozma

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You should check  with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.

The treatment will be prescribed and started by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis  and treatment of RA, sJIA, pJIA or GCA.

## The recommended dose

The dose for RA and GCA adults is 162 mg (the content of 1 pre-filled syringe) given once a week.

## Children and adolescents with sJIA (aged 1 year and over) The usual dose of Avtozma depends on the patient's weight.

- If the patient weighs less than 30 kg : the dose is 162 mg (the content of 1 pre-filled syringe) once  every 2 weeks
- If the patient weighs 30 kg or more : the dose is 162 mg (the content of 1 pre-filled syringe) once  every week

## Children and adolescents with pJIA (aged 2 and over) The usual dose of Avtozma depends on the patient's weight.

Avtozma is given by injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ). At the start, your doctor or nurse may inject Avtozma. However, your doctor may decide that you may inject Avtozma yourself. In this case you will get training on how to inject Avtozma yourself. Parents and carers will get training on how to inject Avtozma for patients who cannot inject themselves, such as children.

Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about giving yourself or a child patient you look after an  injection. You will find detailed 'Instructions for administration' at the end of this leaflet.

## If you use more Avtozma than you should

Because Avtozma is given in one pre-filled syringe, it is unlikely that you will receive too much. However, if you are worried, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

If an adult with RA or GCA or a child or adolescent with sJIA misses or forgets a dose

It is very important to use Avtozma exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Keep track of your next dose.

- If you miss your weekly dose within 7 days, take your dose on the next scheduled day.
- If you miss your once every 2 weeks dose within 7 days, inject a dose as soon as you remember  and take your next dose at your regular scheduled time.

## If a child or adolescent with pJIA misses or forgets a dose

It is very important to use Avtozma exactly as prescribed by the doctor. Keep track of the next dose.

- If a dose is missed within 7 days, inject a dose as soon as you remember and give the next dose  at the regular scheduled time.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. What Avtozma is and what it is used for

Avtozma contains the active substance tocilizumab, which is a protein made from specific immune cells (monoclonal antibody), that blocks the action of a specific protein (cytokine) called interleukin-6. This protein is involved in inflammatory processes of the body, and blocking it can reduce the inflammation in your body. Avtozma is used to treat:

- adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) , an autoimmune disease, if previous therapies did not work well enough.
- adults with severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who have not had previous treatment with methotrexate.

Avtozma helps to reduce RA symptoms such as pain and swelling in your joints and can also improve your performance of daily tasks. Avtozma has been shown to slow the damage to the cartilage and bone of the joints caused by the disease and to improve your ability to do normal daily activities.

Avtozma is usually given in combination with another medicine for RA called methotrexate. However, Avtozma can be given alone if your doctor determines that methotrexate is inappropriate.

- adults with a disease of the arteries called giant cell arteritis ( GCA ), caused by inflammation of the body's largest arteries, especially those that supply blood to the head and neck. Symptoms include headache, fatigue and jaw pain. Effects can include strokes and blindness.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Avtozma can reduce pain and swelling in the arteries and veins in your head, neck and arms.

GCA is often treated with medicines called steroids. They are usually effective, but can have side effects if used at high doses for a long time. Reducing the steroid dose can also lead to a flare-up of the GCA. Adding Avtozma to the treatment means that steroids can be used for a shorter time, while still controlling GCA.

- children and adolescents, aged 12 years and over, with active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) , an inflammatory disease that causes pain and swelling in one or more joints as well as fever and rash.

Avtozma is used to improve the symptoms of sJIA. It can be given in combination with methotrexate or alone.

- children and adolescents, aged 12 years and over, with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( pJIA ). This is an inflammatory disease that causes pain and swelling in one or more joints.

Avtozma is used to improve the symptoms of pJIA. It can be given in combination with methotrexate or alone .

## 2. What you need to know before you use Avtozma

## Do not use Avtozma

- if you or a child patient you look after are allergic to tocilizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). (See special warnings at the end of this section under subtitle 'Avtozma contains polysorbate')
- if you or a child patient you look after have an active, severe infection.

If either of these applies to you, tell a doctor. Do not use Avtozma.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Avtozma.

- If you experience allergic reactions such as chest tightness, wheezing, severe dizziness or lightheadedness, swelling of the lips, tongue, face or skin itching, hives or rash during or after the injection, then tell your doctor immediately.
- Do not take the next dose until you have informed your doctor AND your doctor has told you to take the next dose if you have experienced any allergic reaction symptoms after Avtozma administration.
- If you have any kind of infection , short- or long-term, or if you often get infections. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel unwell. Avtozma can reduce your body's ability to respond to infections and may make an existing infection worse or increase the chance of getting a new infection.
- If you have had tuberculosis , tell your doctor. Your doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting Avtozma. If symptoms of tuberculosis (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild fever) or any other infection appear during or after therapy tell your doctor immediately.
- If you have had intestinal ulcers or diverticulitis , tell your doctor. Symptoms would include abdominal pain and unexplained changes in bowel habits with a fever.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- If you have liver disease , tell your doctor. Before you use Avtozma, your doctor may do a blood test to measure your liver function.
- If any patient has recently been vaccinated, or is planning a vaccination , tell your doctor. All patients should be up-to-date with all their vaccinations before they start treatment with Avtozma. Certain types of vaccines should not be given while receiving Avtozma.
- If you have cancer , tell your doctor. Your doctor will have to decide if you can still be given Avtozma.
- If you have cardiovascular risk factors such as raised blood pressure and raised cholesterol levels, tell your doctor. These factors need to be monitored while receiving Avtozma.
- If you have moderate to severe kidney function problems , your doctor will monitor you.
- If you have persistent headaches .

Your doctor will perform a blood test before you receive Avtozma, to determine if you have a low white blood cell count, low platelet count or high liver enzymes.

## Children and adolescents

Avtozma pre-filled pen is not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age.  Avtozma must not be given to children with sJIA weighing less than 10 kg.

If a child has a history of macrophage activation syndrome (activation and uncontrolled proliferation of specific blood cells), tell your doctor. Your doctor will have to decide if they can still be given Avtozma.

## Other medicines and Avtozma

Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, or have recently taken any. Avtozma can affect the way some medicines work, and the dose of these may require adjustment. If you are using medicines containing any of the following active substances, tell your doctor:

- methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, used to reduce inflammation
- simvastatin or atorvastatin, used to reduce cholesterol levels
- calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine), used to treat raised blood pressure

Due to lack of clinical experience, tocilizumab is not recommended for use with other biological medicines for the treatment of RA, sJIA, pJIA, or GCA.

## Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility

Avtozma is not to be used in pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, may be pregnant, or intend to become pregnant.

Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after treatment.

Stop breast-feeding if you are to be given Avtozma , and talk to your doctor. Leave a gap of at  least 3 months after your last treatment before you start breast-feeding. It is not known whether  Avtozma is passed into breast milk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist or nurse has told you. You should check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.

The treatment will be prescribed and started by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of RA, sJIA, pJIA or GCA.

## If you use more Avtozma than you should

Because Avtozma is given in one pre-filled pen, it is unlikely that you will receive too much. However, if you are worried, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

## If an adult with RA or GCA or an adolescent with sJIA misses or forgets a dose

It is very important to use Avtozma exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Keep track of your next dose.
