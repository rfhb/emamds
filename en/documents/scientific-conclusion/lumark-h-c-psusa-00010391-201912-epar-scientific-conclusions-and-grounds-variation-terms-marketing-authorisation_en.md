## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride, the scientific conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on extravasation from the literature and the existing warning on extravasation in the summary of product characteristics, and furthermore , considering the risk of radiation nephropathy and appropriate methods to detect renal disease from the literature and spontaneous reports, the PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride should be amended accordingly.

Furthermore, in view of available data on pancytopenia and neutropenia from the literature, studies and from spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship and a plausible mechanism of action, and on xerostomia from studies and a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship with lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride is established and concluded that the product information of products containing lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing lutetium ( 177 Lu) chloride is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
