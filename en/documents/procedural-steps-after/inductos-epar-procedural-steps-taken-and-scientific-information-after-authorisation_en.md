1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

|                    | In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to submit study protocol for study EUPAS32916 that was agreed by PRAC and to update section 4.4 of the SmPC to add the traceability statement for biological medicinal products.

In addition, the majority of the physicians did not use dibotermin alfa on a regular basis, and did use (always, frequently or sometimes) the educational material (82%) to obtain information on these risks. Therefore, it has been concluded that the educational material should remain in place and actions taken to increase awareness with physicians on the existence of the educational materials and simplify the access to the materials. In addition, the study status of EUPAS32916 to evaluate the effectiveness of additional Risk Minimisation Measures in the RMP has been changed from ongoing to completed. The Annex IID text and the reference to the educational materials in section 10 have been maintained. For more information, please refer to the Summary of   |

|         | the use of InductOs in lumbar interbody spine fusion as a substitute for autogenous bone graft in adults with degenerative disc disease who have had at least 6 months of non operative treatment for this condition in the treatment of adults. Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. Further, SmPC section 4.4 has been updated with warnings related to type of surgery, device and spinal level, and sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC based on supportive non- clinical and clinical data relating to immunogenicity, tumorigenicity or fusion success. The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. Furthermore, the standard term has been updated from \"kit for implant\" to \"powder, solvent and matrix\", and the expression of the strength changed from '12mg' to '1.5 mg/ml' throughout the SmPC, labelling and Package leaflet. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement the latest QRD template (version 9.0) and to make editorial changes throughout the annexes. A revised RMP version 2 was agreed as part of the procedure.

In some cases device migration may necessitate a surgical revision. The vast majority of cases concerned off- label use (including unapproved surgical approach, devices and/or concomitant therapies) nevertheless there is reasonable suspicion that the occurrence of device migration may be causally related to dibotermin alfa. Review of AEs associated with device migration showed that most cases reported were \"cyst like structures\" and \"bone resorption\". These undesirable effects, already listed in the current SmPC, could predispose to the device migration. As such, they also have been reported in section 4.8 as being in some cases associated with the device migration.   |

From the data that became available since the granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation for InductOs, no new safety issues were identified except for the formation of antibodies in a clinical trial. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should continue to closely monitor the formation of antibodies, immune response and neutralising antibodies. Furthermore, the CHMP recommended that the MAH should continue to monitor fluid collections, bone resorption/osteolysis, bone growth, infections, deep vein thrombosis, neurological disorders, malignancies, anaemia, local hypesthesia and heterotopic calcification. Additionally, the CHMP acknowledged that the exposure of InductOs was |

Thus, based upon the safety profile of InductOs, which required the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| II/0028 | To update sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC, following the assessment of PSUR n 6, to include information on the formation of fluid collections. To update section 4.2 of the SPC to enforce the message to use the correct posology and to follow the instructions for using InductOs in anterior lumbar spine fusion indication. These changes are also reflected in the PL. The MAH completed the list of local representatives in the PL to include the two new EU Member States (Bulgaria and Romania). Moreover, the MAH updated the product information in line with the latest EMEA/QRD template. In addition the MAH took the opportunity to include the name of the MAH in the labelling of the vial solvent. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 22/02/2007 | 29/03/2007 | SmPC, Labelling and PL | DDuring the period covered by PSUR n 6 (covering the period from 9 September 2005 to 8 September 2006) formation of fluid collections (pseudocysts, localised oedema, implant site effusion) sometimes encapsulated, in some cases resulting in nerve compression and pain was reported in patients undergoing spine surgery associated with the use of dibotermin alfa/Absorbable Collagen Sponge (rhBMP-2/ACS). Many of these reports have occurred when rhBMP-2/ACS was used in unapproved approaches/devices or in a manner inconsistent with the instructions for use. None of the fluid collections reported occurred in Europe. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the failure to follow the product preparation instructions for rhBMP-2/ACS may compromise its safety and effectiveness: care and caution should be used to prevent overfilling of the construct and/or intervetebral space. |

| II/0020   | To remove \"pregnancy\" from section 4.3 and to update sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SPC to include additional information on formation of antibodies and on pregnancy following new non clinical data. To update section 2 in the PL to reflect the changes introduced in the SPC. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 27/07/2006   | 28/08/2006   | SmPC and PL | The MAH has studied the effect of anti-dibotermin antibodies in a rabbit developmental toxicity study, where pregnant rabbits have been immunised against dibotermin alfa, the active ingredient for InductOs. The findings of this non clinical study indicated that the potential risk of anti- dibotermin antibodies for embryo-foetal development was limited. In some foetuses with decreased body weights there were decreases in ossification of frontal and parietal bones (4 out of 151 foetuses), which is generally considered to be reversible, and antibody related effects could not be ruled out. There were no other alterations in foetal external, visceral, or skeletal morphology. Therefore section 5.3 \"Preclinical Safety Data\" of the SPC was updated to include the findings from this non clinical study. As the basis for a contraindication must be provided by clinical data or strong non clinical data, the CHMP concluded that there was no basis for a contraindication of the use of InductOs during pregnancy. Thus, the contraindication for pregnancy was deleted from section 4.3 \"Contraindication\" of the SPC and replaced by a labelling expressing an advice against the use of InductOs during pregnancy in section 4.6 \"Pregnancy and lactation\" unless |

| II/0023 | To update sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC to include information on the occurrence of neurological disorders in patients undergoing spine surgery following the CHMP assessment of PSUR n 5 covering the period from 9 September 2004 to 8 September 2005. To address two editorial changes in section 4.4 and 4.9 of the SPC. To update the Annexes in line with the EMEA QRD template version 7.0. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet | 28/06/2006 | 04/08/2006 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | During the period covered by PSUR n 5 (from 9 September 2004 to 8 September 2005), nerve compression associated with exuberant and/or ectopic bone formation has been reported in patients undergoing spine surgery with dibotermin alfa/Absorbable Collagen Sponge. Six (6) cases of nerve compression associated with exuberant and/or ectopic bone formation and/or calcification were identified through the period covered by PSUR n 5. In all of these reports, the patient received dibotermin alfa for augmentation of spine fusion surgery. The patients reported symptoms likely to represent neurological complications of excess bone formation (i.e. regional pain or radiculopathy).

| II/0021 | Update of section 4.8 of the SPC to add that placement of InductOs can cause initial resorption of the trabecular bone following the review of cases of osteolysis reported in PSUR n 4 covering the period from 9 March 2004 to 8 September 2004. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 23/02/2006 | 29/03/2006 | SmPC | From an independent investigation in Germany the MAH has received reports of osteolysis. The investigation concerned a study in which InductOs was substituted for autograft bone during spinal surgery using posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) technique and Telamon PEEK cages. InductOs is not approved for this indication in the EU, nor is it approved for use with Telamon PEEK cage device. None of the patients concerned were clinically symptomatic; the event was a radiographic finding. There was radiographic evidence of: \"questionable osteoclastic activity at the deck plate and floor plate of the adjoining vertebral body\". All patients improved, despite these radiographic findings; none of the patients were clinically symptomatic and at the investigations after 6 and 12 months no pathological findings were found. Although none of the event are classified as serious, the investigator halted the study because of the events. |

| II/0007 | This variation relates to an extention of the therapeutic indications for InductOs. The MAH proposes to amend Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 , 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.3 in the SPC. Changes to the PL have been made to reflect the changes to the SPC. Extension of Indication | 17/02/2005 | 29/03/2005 | SmPC and PL     | The new indication is: InductOs is indicated for single-level (L4 - S1) anterior lumbar spine fusion as a substitute for autogenous bone graft in adults with degenerative disc disease who have had at least 6 months of non-operative treatment for this condition. For this new indication InductOs should not be used alone, but must be used with the LT-CAGE Lumbar Tapered Fusion Device.

Seven reports, on 16 patients, of localised cervical oedema coincident with the administration ofdibotemin alfa (rhBMP-2)/ACS were reviewed; in all of the cases the product was used off-label in the cervical spine. In general, the patients had an uneventful post-operative course and presented 1.5-7 days after surgery with neck swelling. Six of the patients recovered, with many receiving corticosteroids. Localised oedema has been noted earlier in patients treated with InductOs although a causal relationship could not be established. Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC have been updated to reflect this information. The PL was amended accordingly.   |
