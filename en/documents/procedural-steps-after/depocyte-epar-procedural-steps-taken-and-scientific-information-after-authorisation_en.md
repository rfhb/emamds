Safety and efficacy in children have not been adequately demonstrated. DepoCyte is not recommended for use in children and adolescents until further data become available. In an open-label non-comparative dose escalation study in 18 paediatric patients (4 to 19 years) with leukaemic meningitis or neoplastic meningitis due to primary brain tumour, an intrathecal dose of 35 mg was identified as the maximum tolerated dose. In addition, the Marketing Authorisation Holder took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet with the contact details for Bulgaria and Romania. |

| R/0013 | Renewal of the marketing authorisation. Medicinal                                                | 27/04/2006 product | 19/06/2006 no | SmPC, Labelling and PL Grounds for one additional renewal: Based upon the data that have become available since the granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP considers that the benefit/risk balance of DepoCyte remains positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely monitored for the following reasons: DepoCyte is indicated for the intrathecal treatment of lymphomatous meningitis, and has the potential to produce serious neurological toxicity. Commonly occurring symptoms are those associated with irritation of the meninges or arachnoiditis, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, neck rigidity, neck pain, back pain and convulsions. Toxicity may be related to single doses or be cumulative from multiple dosing, may occur soon after injection or be delayed. For these reasons it is clearly essential that close vigilance is maintained. DepoCyte was authorised in the EU on 11 July 2001. However, the medicinal product was not launched on the European market until in the first quarter of 2004, so post- marketing experience in the EU is limited to two years at the time of this renewal. Therefore, the CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit yearly PSURs for the next three years, focusing on continued close monitoring of neurological adverse reactions. The PSUR frequency will be longer authorised |

Therefore, in view of the limited period of marketing during this assessment period and based upon the safety profile of DepoCyte, which requires the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time. authorised   |
