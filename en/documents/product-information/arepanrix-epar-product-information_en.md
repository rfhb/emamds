3.75 micrograms**

Prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

Pandemic influenza vaccine should be used in accordance with Official Guidance.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

The dose recommendations take into account available data from:

- Ongoing clinical studies in healthy subjects who received a single dose of Arepanrix (H1N1)
- Clinical studies in healthy subjects (including elderly subjects) who received two doses of a version of Arepanrix containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

And also from:

- On-going clinical studies in healthy subjects who received a single dose or two doses of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process
- Clinical studies in healthy subjects who received two doses of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H5N1 manufactured using a different process.

In some age groups there are limited clinical study data (adults aged 60-79 years and children aged 10 to 17 years), very limited clinical study data (adults aged 80 years and older, children aged 6 months to 9 years) or no data (children aged less than 6 months) with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H5N1 or from H1N1v manufactured using a different process as detailed in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1.

## Adults aged 18-60 years:

One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.

Immunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after administration of Arepanrix (H1N1) in clinical studies suggest that a single dose may be sufficient.

If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and the second dose.

## Elderly (&gt;60 years)

One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.

Immunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after administration of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in clinical studies suggest that a single dose may be sufficient.

If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and the second dose.

## Children and adolescents aged 10-17 years

Immunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after administration of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in clinical studies suggest that dosing may be in accordance with the recommendations for adults.

## Children aged from 6 months to 9 years

One dose of 0.25 ml at an elected date.

Preliminary immunogenicity data obtained with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in a limited number of children aged 6-35 months show that there is a further immune response to a second dose of 0.25 ml administered after an interval of three weeks.

The use of a second dose should take into consideration the information provided in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Children aged less than 6 months

Vaccination is not currently recommended in this age group.

It is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Arepanrix should complete the vaccination course with Arepanrix (see section 4.4).

## Method of administration

Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde and sodium deoxycholate) of this vaccine. If vaccination is considered to be necessary, facilities for resuscitation should be immediately available in case of need.

See section 4.4 for Special warnings and special precautions for use.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Caution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, to thiomersal and to residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde and sodium deoxycholate).

Medicinal product no longer authorised As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. If the pandemic situation allows, immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection. Arepanrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. There are no data with Arepanrix using the subcutaneous route.  Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. There are no data on administration of AS03-adjuvanted vaccines before or following other types of influenza vaccines intended for pre-pandemic or pandemic use. Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). There are no safety and immunogenicity data available from clinical studies with Arepanrix or with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in children aged less than 6 months. There are limited data available from a clinical study with an AS03containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in healthy children aged from 10 to 17 years, very limited data with the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in healthy children aged from 6 to 35 months and limited data from a study with a version of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H5N1 manufactured using a different process in children aged from 3 to 9 years.

Very limited data with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in children aged 6 to 35 months (N=51) who received two doses of 0.25 ml (half of the adult dose) with an interval of 3 weeks between doses indicate an increase in the rates of injection site reactions and general symptoms (see section 4.8).  In particular rates of fever (axillary temperature ≥ 38°C) may increase considerably after the second dose. Therefore, monitoring of temperature and measures to lower the fever (such as antipyretic medication as seems clinically necessary) are recommended in young children (e.g. up to approximately 6 years of age) after each vaccination.

There are limited data available from clinical studies with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in adults aged over 60 years and very limited data in adults aged over 80 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Arepanrix with other H1N1 pandemic vaccines.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Data obtained on co-administration of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluarix, a split virion vaccine) in healthy adults aged over 60 years did not suggest any significant interference in the immune response to the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v. The immune response to Fluarix was satisfactory.   Co-administration was not associated with higher rates of local or systemic reactions compared to administration of the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v alone.

Therefore the data indicate that Arepanrix may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines (with injections made into opposite limbs).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Data obtained on the administration of a non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluarix, a split virion vaccine) three weeks before a dose of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in healthy adults over 60 years of age, did not suggest any significant interference in the immune response to the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v. Therefore the data indicate that Arepanrix may be administered three weeks after the administration of non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines. There are no data on co-administration of Arepanrix with other vaccines. If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified. The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment. Following influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, HTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative.  These transitory false-positive results may be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation There are currently no data available on the use of Arepanrix in pregnancy. Data from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do not suggest malformations or fetal or neonatal toxicity. Animal studies with Arepanrix do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

The use of Arepanrix may be considered during pregnancy if this is thought to be necessary, taking into account official recommendations.

Arepanrix may be used in lactating women.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 'Undesirable Effects' may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery.

Adults

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In a clinical study that evaluated the reactogenicity of the first 0.5 ml dose of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process in healthy adults aged 1860 (N=120) and above 60 years (N=120) the frequency of adverse reactions was similar between age groups, except for redness (more common in subjects aged &gt;60 years) and shivering and sweating (more common in subjects aged 18-60 years).

In a clinical study that evaluated reactogenicity in healthy adults aged 18-60 years who received two 0.5 ml doses (21 days apart) of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process, there were higher rates of most general solicited symptoms (such as fatigue, headache, arthralgia, shivering, sweating and fever) after the second dose compared to the first dose.

## Children aged 10-17 years

Medicinal product no longer authorised In a clinical study that evaluated the reactogenicity in children 10 to 17 years of age who received two 0.5 ml doses (21 days apart) of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process, there was no increase in reactogenicity after the second dose compared to the first dose. Gastro-intestinal symptoms and shivering were reported at higher rates compared to the rates reported from studies with AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H5N1 manufactured using a different process. Children aged 3-9 years In a clinical study that evaluated reactogenicity in children 3 to 5 and 6 to 9 years of age who received a single half adult (i.e. 0.25 ml) dose of an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1 manufactured using a different process, the frequency of the following adverse reactions was as shown in the table: Adverse reactions 3-5 years Pain 60.0% Redness 26.7% Swelling 21.7% Shivering 13.3% Sweating 10.0% Fever &gt;38°C 10.0% Fever &gt;39°C 1.7% Diarrhoea 5.0% Drowsiness 23.3% Irritability 20.0% Loss of appetite 20.0%

In this protection experiment, the ferrets (six ferrets/group) were immunized intramuscularly with vaccine candidate containing four different doses of H5N1 antigen (3.75, 1.5, 0.6 and 0.24 µg of HA antigen) adjuvanted with half dose of AS03. In addition, one group of six ferrets were immunized with vaccine candidate containing 3.75 µg H5N1 + full dose of AS03 and one control group included ferrets immunized with non-adjuvanted vaccine (3.75 micrograms HA). The results of this heterologous challenge study indicate 80.7%-100% protection in all adjuvanted candidate vaccines compared to 43% protection with the non adjuvanted vaccine, showing the benefit of AS03 adjuvantation.

Information from non-clinical studies: The ability to induce protection against homologous and heterologous vaccine strains was assessed non-clinically with A/Indonesia/05/05 (H5N1) using ferret challenge models. -Challenge with a homologous pandemic H5N1 strain (A/Indonesia/5/05) In this protection experiment, the ferrets (six ferrets/group) were immunized intramuscularly with vaccine candidate containing three different doses of H5N1 antigen (7.5, 3.8 and 1.9 µg of HA antigen) adjuvanted with the standard dose or half dose of AS03. Control groups included ferrets immunized with adjuvant alone and non-adjuvanted vaccine (7.5 micrograms HA). Ferrets immunized with the non adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine were not protected from death and showed similar lung viral loads and degree of viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract as those exhibited by ferrets immunized with the adjuvant alone. Conversely the combination of a range of doses of H5N1 antigen with AS03 adjuvant was able to protect against mortality and to reduce lung virus loads and viral shedding after intra-tracheal challenge with a homologous wild type H5N1 virus.  Serological testing indicated a direct correlation between vaccines induced HI and neutralising antibody titres in protected animals compared to antigen and adjuvant controls. -Challenge with a heterologous pandemic H5N1 strain (A/Hong Kong/156/97)

Arepanrix consists of two containers: Suspension: multidose vial containing the antigen, Emulsion: multidose vial containing the adjuvant.

Prior to administration, the two components should be mixed.

Instructions for mixing and administration of the vaccine:

1. Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be allowed to reach room temperature.  Whitish sediments may be observed in the suspension vial; these sediments are part of the normal physical appearance of the suspension.  The emulsion presents as a whitish appearance.
2. Each vial should be shaken and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter (other than the white sediments described above) and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine.

Medicinal product no longer authorised 3. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by means of a syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen. 4. After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed vaccine is a whitish emulsion.  In the event of other variation being observed, discard the vaccine. 5. The volume of the Arepanrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml. The vaccine should be administered in accordance with the recommended posology (see section 4.2). 6. The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance.  In the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine. 7. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml (full dose) or 0.25 ml (half dose) is withdrawn into a syringe for injection and administered intramuscularly. 8. After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25°C. If the mixed vaccine is stored in a refrigerator, it should be allowed to reach room temperature before each withdrawal. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 7.

## PACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER

## Arepanrix suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection

Pandemic influenza vaccine (H1N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted)

For the most up-to-date information please consult the website of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA): http://www.emea.europa.eu/.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.
- -If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor.

## You should not receive Arepanrix:

Medicinal product no longer authorised In this leaflet : 1. What Arepanrix is and what it is used for 2. Before you receive Arepanrix 3. How Arepanrix is given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Arepanrix 6. Further information 1. What Arepanrix is and what it is used for Arepanrix is a vaccine against a pandemic influenza (flu). Pandemic flu is a type of influenza that occurs every few decades and which spreads rapidly around the world. The symptoms of pandemic flu are similar to those of ordinary flu but may be more severe. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defence system) will produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. As with all vaccines, Arepanrix may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. 2. Before you are given Arepanrix

- if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of Arepanrix (these are listed at the end of the leaflet) or to any of the substances that may be present in trace amounts as follows: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde or sodium deoxycholate. Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. However, in a pandemic situation, it may be appropriate for you to have the vaccine provided that appropriate medical treatment is immediately available in case of an allergic reaction.

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine.

## Take special care with Arepanrix:

- if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ingredient contained in the vaccine, to thiomersal, to egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde  or to sodium deoxycholate. (see section 6. Further information).

- if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then your vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as  a  cold  should  not  be  a  problem,  but  your  doctor  will  advise  whether  you  could  still  be vaccinated with Arepanrix.
- if  you have a poor immune response (as for example because of immunosuppressive therapy, e.g. corticosteroid treatments or chemotherapy for cancer),
- if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first few weeks after vaccination with Arepanrix the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given Arepanrix.

In any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed.

Medicinal product no longer authorised If your child receives the vaccine, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense after the second dose, especially temperature over 38°C. Therefore monitoring of temperature and measures to lower the temperature (such as giving paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever) after each dose are recommended. Please inform your doctor or nurse if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently been given any other vaccine. Areapanrix can be given at the same time as seasonal influenza vaccines that do not contain an adjuvant. Persons who have received a seasonal influenza vaccine that does not contain an adjuvant may receive Arepanrix after an interval of at least three weeks. There is no information on administration of Arepanrix with other vaccines and no information on administration of the AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process with any other vaccines than non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. However, if this cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs.  In such cases, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense. Pregnancy and breast-feeding Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, plan to become pregnant. You should discuss with your doctor whether you should receive Arepanrix. The vaccine may be used during breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

Some effects mentioned under section 4. 'Possible side effects' may affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## Important information about some of the ingredients of Arepanrix

This vaccine contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you may experience an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially sodium- and potassium-free.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How Arepanrix is given

Your doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations.

The vaccine will be injected into a muscle (usually in the upper arm).

Adults including the elderly and children from the age of 10 years onwards: A dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given Clinical data with an AS03-containing vaccine containing HA from H1N1v manufactured using a different process suggest that a single dose may be sufficient. If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and second dose.

## Children from 6 months to 9 years of age

The side effects listed below have occurred with Arepanrix (H5N1) in clinical studies in adults, including the elderly. In these clinical studies most side effects were mild in nature and short term. The side-effects are generally similar to those related to seasonal flu vaccines.

Medicinal product no longer authorised A dose (0.25 ml) of the vaccine will be given. If a second dose of 0.25 ml is given this will be administered at least three weeks after the first dose. Children aged less than 6 months of age Vaccination is currently not recommended in this age group. When Arepanrix is given for the first dose, it is recommended that Arepanrix (and not another vaccine against H1N1) be given for the complete vaccination course. 4. Possible side effects Like all medicines, Arepanrix can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Allergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock. Doctors are aware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases. The frequency of possible side effects listed below is defined using the following convention: Very common (affects more than 1 user in 10) Common (affects 1 to 10 users in 100) Uncommon (affects 1 to 10 users in 1,000) Rare (affects 1 to 10 users in 10,000) Very rare (affects less than 1 user in 10,000)

These side effects have also been observed with similar frequencies in clinical studies in adults including the elderly and in children aged 10 to 17 years with a similar vaccine (H1N1), except for redness (uncommon in the adults and common in the elderly) and fever (uncommon in the adults and elderly). Gastro-intestinal symptoms and shivering were at a higher rate in the children 10-17 years of age. In children aged 3-9 years who received a first half adult dose of a similar vaccine (H1N1), the side effects were similar compared to the side effects reported in adults, with the exception of shivering, sweating and gastro-intestinal symptoms which were reported at a higher rate in children aged 3 to 9 years. Additionally, in children aged 3 to 5 years of age, drowsiness, irritability and loss of appetite were reported very commonly.

Suspension: multidose vial containing the antigen, Emulsion: multidose vial containing the adjuvant.

Prior to administration, the two components should be mixed.

## Instructions for mixing and administration of the vaccine:

1. Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be allowed to reach room temperature. Whitish sediments may be observed in the suspension vial; these sediments are part of the normal physical appearance of the suspension.  The emulsion presents as a whitish appearance
2. Each vial should be shaken and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter (other than the white sediments described above) and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine.
3. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by means of a syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen.
4. After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed vaccine is a whitish emulsion.  In the event of other variation being observed, discard the vaccine.
5. The volume of the Arepanrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml. The vaccine should be administered in accordance with the recommended posology (see section 3 'How Arepanrix is given').
6. The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance.  In the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine.
7. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml (full dose) or 0.25 ml (half dose) is withdrawn into a syringe for injection and administered intramuscularly.
8. After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25°C. If the mixed vaccine is stored in a refrigerator, it should be allowed to reach room temperature before each withdrawal.
