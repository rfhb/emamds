A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Management Plan (RMP) of the qHPV vaccine. It is an extension of study V501-020 (the pivotal efficacy study of qHPV vaccine in young men 16 to 26 years of age) to assess effectiveness and immunogenicity of the qHPV vaccine for up to 10 years of follow-up. Submission of this final report fulfils Gardasil MEA 070.3 and Silgard MEA 069.3. - Extension of Protocol V501-16. The base study was an MSD-sponsored randomized clinical trial that assessed the immunogenicity of a 2 dose Schedule of the qHPV in adolescents 9 to 13 years of age compared to a 3-dose schedule in young women16 to 26 years of age. The study provides additional immunogenicity follow-up through 5 years post-vaccination. Submission of this study fulfils Gardasil REC 083 and Silgard REC 080. RMP version 12 was also submitted, updated to reflect completion of the above-mentioned category 3 study. In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10 and to amend the details of one local representative in the package leaflet.

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to slightly amend the Package Leaflet with the addition of a sentence to correct a discrepancy between vial and pre-filled syringe and to amend the contact details for the Danish contact in the list of representatives (the latter applicable to Gardasil only). Furthermore section 2 of the outer packaging for pre-filled syringes was revised to remove the word 'dose' that was repeated (applicable to Gardasil only). The requested variation worksharing procedure proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, labelling and Package Leaflet. product | 26/06/2014 | 27/05/2015 SmPC and PL no longer | The long term effectiveness is demonstrated with no cases of HPV disease observed at a median follow-up of 6.8 years post vaccination in preadolescent and adolescent girls and boys and with observed persistent immunogenicity in all HPV types. Few vaccine-related adverse events were reported from the 96 month data of this study in preadolescent and adolescent girls and boys. Data from other long-term follow-up studies covering all the populations studied (including Young Adult Women, Mid-Adult Women and Adult Men) support the long term effectiveness, immunogenicity and safety of the qHPV vaccine. |

However, regarding ADEM the additional clarification and information provided did not justify the enclosure in section 4.8 of the SPC as yet. Close monitoring, cumulative reporting and commenting on all such events will continue in future PSURs.   |

The safety data reported between concomitant vaccination group versus non-concomitant vaccination group were generally comparable although injection site swelling and headache were reported at higher frequency in the concomitant group.   |
