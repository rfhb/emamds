## 1. Introduction

On 19 th  May 2017 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study number 201378 in accordance with Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended.  The  study  has  not  been  conducted  in accordance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan and will not result in an update to the Product Information.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measures specific obligations.

The  clinical  study  report  of  study  201378  included  a  mix  of  adolescents  and  adults  with  no disaggregated results included by age subset. In September 2017, after CHMP request, the MAH has provided the results of study  201378  disaggregated for the subgroup of adolescents.

The submitted study does not influence the benefit risk for Relvar Ellipta/ Relvinty Ellipta and that no consequential regulatory action is required.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Relvar  Ellipta  was  approved  in  the  EU  on  13th  November  2013  and  the  duplicate  licence,  Revinty Ellipta, approved in the EU on 2nd May 2014 for the following indication:

'regular  treatment  of  asthma  in  adults  and  adolescents  aged  12  years  and  older  where  use  of  a combination medicinal product (long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate: patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  'as  needed'  inhaled  short-acting beta2-agonists'.

Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 as amended, the application included a EMA Decision on the granting of a class waiver for the condition COPD (EMA/825560/2009). A EMA Decision on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan, which included a waiver in children under 5 years of age and a deferral in children aged 5-11 years (EMEA-000431-PIP01-08-M04; P/0049/2012), was also submitted in the application.

The last EMA Decision was issued by August 2013 (P/0216/2013) corresponding to the Modification 06. The agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP), which is expected to be completed by November 2019, established six clinical measures for adolescents (12 to less than 18 years) and adults. Four of these measures were agreed to assay FF/VI in combination.

In accordance with Article 46 of the regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 Glaxo Group Ltd hereby submits to the EMA the final study report for 201378 which achieved Last Subject Last Visit on 25th November 2016. Study number 201378 was a stand alone study and not part of a paediatric investigation plan and I hereby confirm that these data do not require an update of the product information, in line with Article 46 regulations.

The MAH stated that the hereby submitted study 'A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, multicenter study of once daily fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 Inhalation Powder, twice

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

daily fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 Inhalation Powder, and twice daily fluticasone propionate  250  Inhalation  Powder  in  the  treatment  of  persistent  asthma  in  adults  and  adolescents already adequately controlled on twice daily inhaled corticosteroid and longacting beta2-agonist' study number: 201378 is not part of a PIP.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The formulations of FF/VI used in the study were the same as the products approved in the EU (i.e. FF/VI 100/25 mcg equivalent to a delivered dose of 92/22 mcg, and FF/VI 200/25 mcg, equivalent to a delivered dose of 184/22 mcg), delivered via the ELLIPTATM dry powder inhaler to treat adults and adolescents with asthma. There are currently no plans to develop a paediatric formulation for children less than 5 years old.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for study number: 201378

'A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy,  parallel group, multicenter study of once daily fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 Inhalation Powder, twice daily fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50  Inhalation  Powder,  and  twice  daily  fluticasone  propionate  250  Inhalation  Powder  in  the treatment of persistent asthma in adults and adolescents already adequately controlled on twice daily inhaled corticosteroid and longacting beta2-agonist'

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study 201378 'A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, multicenter study of once daily fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 Inhalation Powder, twice daily fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 Inhalation Powder, and twice daily fluticasone propionate 250 Inhalation Powder in the treatment of persistent asthma in adults and adolescents already adequately controlled on twice daily inhaled corticosteroid and longacting beta2-agonist'

## Description

Inhaled fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  (FF/VI)  is  approved  for  the  treatment of  asthma  in  adults  and adolescents aged 12 years and older, and for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. Inhaled FF/VI has been approved for marketing in the EU through the Centralised procedure.

Study 201378 was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group 24 week non-inferiority study which compared the efficacy and safety of FF/VI 100/25 once daily (OD) with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/SAL) 250/50 twice daily (BD) and FP 250 BD in subjects 12 years  of  age  and  older  with  persistent  asthma  currently  well-controlled  on  mid-dose  inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2- agoinst (ICS/LABA) combination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of RELVAR™ ELLIPTA™ 100/25 once daily to SERETIDE™ ACCUHALER™/DISKUS™ 250/50 twice daily in adult and adolescent subjects 12 years of age and older with persistent bronchial asthma adequately controlled on twice daily ICS/ LABA.

## Study design

This  was  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  parallel  group  24  week  noninferiority  study.  Eligible  subjects  who  were  currently  adequately  controlled  on  ICS  plus  LABA (equivalent to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol [FP/SAL] 250/50 twice daily [BD]) were switched to the same ICS component of their current combination treatment for treatment during the 5 day LABA washout period (Figure 1).

At  the  end  of  the  LABA  washout  period,  those  subjects  who  demonstrated  reversibility,  defined  as ≥150 mL increase in forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1) following inhalation of albuterol/salbutamol, stopped receiving ICS alone and were given open label FP/SAL 250/50 BD for the 4 week run-in period. All subjects were provided with albuterol/salbutamol to use as needed to control asthma symptoms. Subjects who met eligibility criteria at the end of the 4 week run-in period were randomized to treatment with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) 100/25 once daily (OD), FP/SAL 250/50 BD, or FP 250 BD in a 1:1:1 ratio for 24 weeks. There were a total of 7 clinic visits and a safety follow-up assessment was conducted by telephone approximately 7 days after the end of treatment.

## Study population /Sample size

Eligible  subjects  who  were  currently  adequately  controlled  on  ICS  plus  LABA  (equivalent  to  FP/SAL 250/50 BD) with a forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1) of ≥80% were switched to the same ICS component  of  their  current  combination  treatment  for  treatment  during  the  5  day  LABA  washout period. At the end of the LABA washout period, those subjects who demonstrated reversibility, defined

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

as ≥150 mL increase in FEV1 following inhalation of albuterol/salbutamol, stopped receiving ICS alone and were given open-label FP/SAL 250/50 BD for the 4 week run-in period. In order to be randomized to treatment at Visit 3, subjects could not have had symptoms during the day or used rescue/reliever medication on more than two days each week for the last 14 consecutive days of the run-in period or any  nighttime  awakening  due  to  asthma  during  the  last  14  consecutive  dates  of  the  run-in  period; criteria must have been met for each 7 day week. Subjects had to show compliance with completion of morning (AM) and evening (PM) diary data on ≥4 of the last 7 consecutive days of the run-in period Subjects could not have changed asthma medication except for the planned change from ICS/LABA to the same ICS alone at Visit 1 and from ICS alone to open-label FP/SAL at Visit 2, or experienced a respiratory infection or severe asthma exacerbation between Visit 1 and Visit 3.

## Sample Size Considerations

The sample size calculations were based on the primary efficacy endpoint of PM FEV1.

Investigational  product  was  stored  in  a  secure,  limited  access  area  under  the  appropriate  physical conditions for the product.

Any subject who had a study inhaler that failed to function properly was to return the inhaler to the clinic as soon as possible to avoid missing any doses. Study inhalers that failed to function properly were returned to GSK for testing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol for use as needed to treat acute asthma symptoms throughout the study was supplied by GSK.

## Treatment Assignment

Subjects  were  assigned  to  study  treatment  in  accordance  with  the  randomization  schedule.  The randomization schedule was generated by GSK. Subjects were randomized using an IWRS.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Efficacy Assessment

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint

The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in clinic visit PM FEV1 at the end of the 24week treatment period.

Forced expiratory volume in 1 second was measured in the PM (between 5:00 PM and 11:00 PM) at Visits 1 through 7 using spirometry equipment that met or exceeded the minimal recommendations of the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS). All sites used standardized spirometry  equipment  provided  by  an  external  vendor  and  the  vendor  performed  overreads  on maneuvers. Subjects were required to withhold their albuterol/salbutamol for at least 6 hours before clinic visits where lung function measurements were performed. At Visits 4 through 7, FEV1 was to be measured within ±1 hour of the time FEV1 was measured at Visit 3. Subjects did not dose study drug prior to coming into the clinic for Visits 4 through 7.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints and Other Efficacy Endpoints were also analised.

## Safety Assessments

The safety assessments were the monitoring of adverse events (AE) and severe asthma exacerbations. The investigator or site staff was responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events that met the definition of an AE or SAE. Adverse event information volunteered by the subject, discovered by investigator questioning or detected by other means was collected from the start of study treatment until the follow-up contact. The following information on AEs was obtained:

- Duration (start and stop dates)
- Severity (mild, moderate, severe)
- Causality (reasonable possibility of relationship to IP yes/no)
- Actions taken and outcome

A severe asthma exacerbation was defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) for at least 3 days or an inpatient hospitalization or emergency department visit due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids.

## Statistical Methods

All data analysis methods for this CSR were described in a Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP) dated 02 December 2016. All programming was performed in a HARP environment using SAS Version 9.4 or a later version.

## Screening and Baseline Lung Function

Screening lung function tests demonstrated a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of 2.89 L and  a mean percent predicted FEV1 of 92.3%. Baseline lung function tests were similar to Screening with a mean pre-dose FEV1 of 2.83 L and a mean percent predicted FEV1 of 90.2%. At Visit 2, a mean reversibility of 15.8% and 376.2 mL was demonstrated.

## Efficacy results

To  account  for  multiplicity  across  key  endpoints,  a  step-down  closed  testing  procedure  was  applied whereby inference for a test in the pre-defined hierarchy was dependent upon statistical significance having been achieved for previous tests in the hierarchy. Analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoint of percentage  of  subjects  controlled  (defined  as  ACT  score  ≥20)  at  Week  24  did  not  demonstrate statistical significance for FF/VI 100/25 compared with FP 2; therefore, inference cannot be made for the FF/VI versus FP comparison on PM PEF or the 'Other' efficacy endpoints and these results should be interpreted as descriptive only.

## Evening Trough FEV1

## Repeated Measures Analyses

The treatment difference for FF/VI versus FP/SAL in evening trough FEV1 at Week 24 was 19 mL (95% CI -11, 49) for the ITT Population (Table 10) and 6 mL (95% CI -27,  40) for the PP Population (Table 11). Non-inferiority was therefore demonstrated as the lower bound of the 95% CI for evening trough FEV1 was greater than the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of -100 mL for both populations.

At Week  24,  FF/VI 100/25  demonstrated  a  statistically significant least squares  (LS)  mean improvement  in  evening  trough  FEV1  of  123  mL  compared  with  FP  250  (p&lt;0.001)  and  FP/SAL demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  LS  mean  improvement  in  evening  trough  FEV1  of  104  mL compared with FP 250 (p&lt;0.001) (Table 10) providing assay sensitivity for the study. These data are displayed graphically in Figure 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  results  on  the  PP  Population  were  supportive  of  the  ITT  analysis  demonstrating  a  statistically significant LS mean improvements of 120 mL for FF/VI 100/25 compared with FP 250 (p&lt;0.001) and 113 mL for FP/SAL compared with FP 250 (p&lt;0.001) (Table 11).

Last Observation Carried Forward Analysis

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The analysis of FEV1 using LOCF was consistent with the analysis for FEV1 using repeated measures; non-inferiority of FF/VI 100/25 to FP/SAL 250/50 was demonstratedas the lower bound of the 95% CI for evening trough FEV1 was greater than the predefined non-inferiority margin of -100 mL (treatment difference 16 mL [95% CI -13, 46]) (Table 12).

At Week 24, FF/VI 100/25 demonstrated a statistically significant LS mean improvement of 124 mL compared  with  FP  250  (p&lt;0.001)  and  FP/SAL  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  LS  mean improvement of 107 mL compared with FP 250 (p&lt;0.001) (Table 12).

## Efficacy Conclusions

Non-inferiority of FF/VI 100/25 to FP/SAL 250/50 was demonstrated at Week 24 as the lower bound of the 95% CI for evening trough FEV1 was greater than the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of -100 mL for both the ITT and PP Populations (Figure 5). These results were supported by the results of the sensitivity  analysis  of  LOCF  and  exploratory  analyses  including  post-treatment  data.  A  statistically significant LS mean improvement in evening trough FEV1 for FF/VI 100/25 compared with FP 250 was demonstrated at Week 24 for the ITT Population (Figure 6).

## Assessor's comments on efficacy results

Non-inferiority of FF/VI 100/25 to FP/SAL 250/50 was demonstrated at Week 24 as the lower bound of the 95% CI for evening trough FEV1 was greater than the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 100 mL for both the ITT and PP Populations and these results were supported by the appropriate sensitivity analysis.

However,  data  of  ITT  [12-17  Years  Old]  Population  (a    total  of  100  subjects  (7%)  of  the  total population  were  12  to  17  years  of  age)  has  not  been  provided  separately  in  the  study  report; Therefore it is not possible to assess the efficacy in these pediatric patients.

Nevertheless, results obtained in the study 201378 performed in asthmatic subjects aged 12 years and  older  are  consistent  to  the  EU  summary  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  not  alter  the risk/benefit profile of FF/VI 100/25. No further regulatory is action required.

## Safety results

## Adverse Events

The overall incidence of any on-treatment or post-treatment AE was similar across treatment groups (44% to 45%) (Table 19). Drug-related AEs were low and similar across treatment groups.

A total of 19 subjects experienced an AE leading to premature discontinuation of study medication or withdrawal from the study (9 in the FF/VI 100/25 group, 6 in the FP/SAL 250/50 group, and 4 in the FP 250 group).

A total of 19 subjects experienced SAEs (6 each in the FF/VI 100/25 and FP/SAL 250/50 groups and 7 in the FP 250 group). No deaths occurred during the study.

## On-treatment Adverse Events

The highest incidence of on-treatment AEs occurred in the Infections and infestations SOC at a similar incidence  across  treatment  groups  (30%  in  the  FF/VI  100/25  and  FP  250  groups  and  29%  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

FP/SAL 250/50 group (Table 20). The most frequently reported AEs during the treatment period in any treatment group were nasopharyngitis (12% in the FF/VI 100/25 group, 13% in the FP/SAL 250/50 group, and 11% in the FP 250 group) and headache (8% in the FF/VI 100/25 and FP 250 groups and 7%  in  the  FP/SAL  250/50  group)  (Table  21).  All  most  frequent  AEs  were  reported  with  a  similar incidence across treatment groups.

## Drug-related Adverse Events

Adverse events that were reported by the investigator to be possibly or probably drugrelated occurred at a similar rate across treatment groups (Table 22). The most frequently reported drug-related AEs were  dysphonia  (n=7,  &lt;1%  in  each  treatment  group)  and  oral  candidiasis  (n=7,  &lt;1%  in  each treatment group).

## Serious and Other Significant Adverse Events

## Deaths

No deaths were reported during double-blind treatment. No deaths were reported post-treatment

## Other Serious Adverse Events

On-treatment SAEs were reported by 15 subjects (6 subjects in the FF/VI 100/25 group, 4 subjects in the FP/SAL 250/50 group, and 5 subjects in the FP 250 group). No individual SAE occurred in more than 1 subject. None of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be possible or probably drugrelated. Post-treatment SAEs were reported by 2 subjects each in the FP/SAL 250/50 group and the FP 250 group.

## Other Significant Adverse Events

## Adverse  Events  Leading  to  Permanent  Discontinuation  of  Study  Medication  or  Withdrawal  from  the Study

Adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of study medication or withdrawal from the study were reported by 9 subjects in the FF/VI 100/25 group, 6 subjects in the FP/SAL 250/50 group, and 4 subjects in the FP 250 group. Oral candidiasis was reported in 2 subjects in the FF/VI 100/25 group and insomnia was reported by 1 subject each in the FF/VI 100/25 and FP/SAL 250/50 groups; no other individual Aes leading to permanent discontinuation of study medication or withdrawal from the study occurred in more than 1 subject.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

The most frequently reported AEs of special interest were in the lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) excluding pneumonia grouping (4% each in the FF/VI 100/25 and FP 250 groups and 3% in the FP/SAL 250/50 group) and the local steroid effects grouping (4% in the FF/VI 100/25 group and 3% each in the FP/SAL 250/50 and FP 250 groups) (Table 23).

Serious  adverse  events  of  special  interest  occurred  in  2  subjects  in  the  FF/VI  100/25  group  and  3 subjects in the FP 250 group. No individual SAE of special interest occurred in more than 1 subject.

Two  subjects  in  the  FF/VI  100/25  group  experienced  an  on-treatment  event  of  pneumonia;  one associated x-ray showed infiltrates and the other did not. No subjects experienced a post-treatment event of pneumonia.

## Severe Asthma Exacerbations

On-treatment severe asthma exacerbations were reported by 19 subjects (4%) in the FF/VI 100/25 group, 20 subjects (4%) in the FP/SAL 250/50 group, and 27 subjects (5%) in the FP 250 group. Each of these subjects received systemic/oral corticosteroids for the exacerbation. Nine of the subjects (2 in the  FF/VI  100/25  group,  3  in  the  FP/SAL  250/50  group,  and  4  in  the  FP  250  group)  permanently discontinued study treatment due to the exacerbation. Of these, three subjects (2 in the FF/VI 100/25 group and 1 in the FP/SAL 250/50 group) were withdrawn from the study due to the exacerbation. None of the subjects were hospitalized due to the exacerbation; however, 7 subjects were treated in the emergency department (2 each in the FF/VI 100/25 and FP/SAL 250/50 group and 3 in the FP 250 group). One subject in the FP 250 group experienced a severe asthma exacerbation post-treatment.

The incidence of severe asthma exacerbations in the ITT (15 Years and Older) Population is identical to the ITT Population.

## Assessor's comments on safety data

Safety results obtained in the study 201378 performed in asthmatic subjects aged 12 years and older are consistent to the EU summary product characteristics (SmPC) and not alter the risk/benefit profile of FF/VI 100/25. No further regulatory is action required.

However,  the  safety  data  for  (ITT  [12-17  Years  Old]  Population)  has  not  been  provided separately in the study report. Therefore it is not possible to assess the efficacy in these paediatric patients.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The objective of this study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of FF/VI 100/25 once daily to FP/SAL 250/50 twice daily in adult and adolescent subjects 12 years of age and older with asthma adequately controlled on twice daily ICS/LABA (equivalent to FP/SAL 250/50 BD).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  study  population was  similar across treatments  in  terms  of  demographics  and  baseline characteristics.  The  population  was  predominately  White  (82%)  and  female  (64%);  mean  age  was 43.5  years.  The  mean  duration  of  asthma  was  approximately  15  years.  Mean  baseline  percent predicted  FEV1  was  90.24%  and  subjects  demonstrated  reversibility  of  15.82%  and  376.2  mL.  At baseline, the majority of subjects in all treatment groups reported an ACT score of ≥20 (96% in each treatment group). Treatment compliance was high (&gt;95%). Discontinuation of study treatment during the study was similar across treatments (7% to 8%) and the main reason for withdrawal during the study was decision by subject or proxy. The objective of this study was met with non-inferiority of FF/VI  100/25  to  FP/SAL  250/50  demonstrated  at  Week  24  as  the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  CI  for evening trough FEV1 was greater than the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of -100 mL in both the ITT  Population  (treatment  difference  19  mL  [95%  CI  -11,  49])  and  the  PP  Population  (treatment difference 6 mL [95% CI -27, 40]). This was supported by the secondary and other efficacy endpoints where rescue-free and symptom-free 24-hour periods, AM and PM PEF, ACT score, and AQLQ were all generally comparable for FF/VI 100/25 compared with FP/SAL 250/50.

Assay sensitivity was demonstrated with superiority of FF/VI 100/25 over FP 250 at Week 24 with a statistically  significant  (p&lt;0.001)  improvement  of  123  mL  in  evening  trough  FEV1.  This  result  was supported by statistically significant improvements for FF/VI 100/25 over FP 250 of 2.7% (p=0.002) for rescue-free 24-hour periods, 2.7% (p=0.004) for symptom-free 24-hour periods, and 21.5 L/min (p&lt;0.001) for AM PEF and a numerically greater improvement of 19.2 L/min (95% CI 14.9, 23.5) for PM  PEF.  All  three  treatments  were  well  tolerated  as  demonstrated  by  2%  and  fewer  subjects  who discontinued  treatment  due  to  an  AE.  There  was  a  similar  incidence  and  pattern  of  Aes  across treatment groups. The  most  frequently reported on-treatment  AEs  were  nasopharyngitis  and headache. The percentage of drug-related AEs and SAEs were low and comparable across treatment groups. No deaths were reported during the conduct of this study. The most frequent AEs of special interest  (i.e.,  those  expected  for  ICS  or  LABA)  were  LRTI  excluding  pneumonia  and  local  steroid effects,  both  occurring  at  a  rate  of  3%  to  4%  across  treatment  groups.  There  were  two  reports  of pneumonia; both of which occurred in the FF/VI 100/25 group. A total of 4% to 5% of subjects across treatment groups experienced a severe asthma exacerbation.

## Assessor's comments

Results obtained in the study 201378 performed in asthmatic subjects aged 12 years and older are consistent to the EU summary product characteristics (SmPC) and not modify  the risk/benefit profile of FF/VI 100/25. No further regulatory is action required.

However, the data (ITT [12-17 Years Old] Population) has not been provided in the study report, therefore we are not able to assess risk/benefit profile of FF/VI 100/25 for peadriatic population.

## ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS REQUESTED List of questions adopted (August 2017)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) talks of six populations within the total study population to be analysed but only defines five; this should be clarified.
2. Furthermore it is not clear why the total intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) populations (including all patients aged 12 years and above) were split into ITT and PP populations aged 15 years and older and why only an ITT population only was analysed for the subgroup aged 12 to 17 years?

The findings should then be discussed.

## ASSESSMENT OF THE APPLICANT'S RESPONSES (SEPTEMBER 2017)

In  september  2017  Glaxo  Group  Limited  submits  the  Response  to  CHMP's  Assessment  Report  for Relvar Ellipta / Revinty Ellipta study 201378 (measure P46)

## Question 1:

The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) talks of six populations within the total study population to be analysed but only defines five; this should be clarified.

## Response

The  six  populations  defined  for  analysis  are  described  in  Section  4.8.2  of  the  Clinical  Study  Report (CSR) and are described below:

Total Population : This population comprised all subjects screened and for whom a record existed on the study database and was used for the tabulation of reasons for withdrawal before randomization.

Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population : This population comprised all subjects randomized to treatment who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication.  Randomized  subjects  were  assumed  to  have received  study  medication  unless  definitive  evidence  to  the  contrary  existed.  For  the  inequality comparisons, this population constituted the primary population for all analyses of efficacy measures and safety measures. Outcomes were reported according to the randomized treatment allocation.

Per Protocol (PP) Population : This population comprised all subjects in the ITT Population who did not have any full protocol deviations. Protocol deviations could be either full or partial. Subjects with only partial deviations were considered part of the PP Population, but from the date of their deviation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

onwards their data was excluded. The decision to exclude a subject or part of their data from the PP Population was made prior to breaking the blind.

This population was used for analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint only. It was of equal importance to  the  ITT  Population  in  assessing  the  non-inferiority  treatment  comparison,  but  was  considered supporting for assessing the inequality comparison.

ITT (12 - 17 Years Old) Population : This was a subset of the ITT Population for subjects 12 to 17 years of age at Screening.

ITT (15 Years and Older) Population : This was a subset of the ITT Population for subjects 15 years of age and older at Screening.

PP (15 Years and Older) Population : This was a subset of the PP Population for subjects 15 years of age and older at Screening.

## Question 2:

Furthermore  it  is  not  clear  why  the  total  intention-to-treat  (ITT)  and  per  protocol  (PP)  populations (including all patients aged 12 years and above) were split into ITT and PP populations aged 15 years and older and why only an ITT population only was analysed for the subgroup aged 12 to 17 years? Again clarification is required.

## Response

Due to the small number of adolescent subjects (12 to 17 years of age) recruited for Study 201378, summary statistics for the ITT Population only were produced for this subgroup. Analyses for subjects 15 years and older were required for Japan to match the approved age in their Product Information.

## Assessor's comments

Issue clarified.

## Question 3:

The  subgroup  of  12  to  17  year  olds  is  noted  to  be  somewhat  small,  only  7%  of  the  randomised population.  No  information  is  provided  as  to  how  this  sample  size  was  determined;  this  should  be addressed.

## Response

Study 201378 was not a requirement of an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP); therefore, there was no key binding element to meet a fixed percentage of adolescent subjects. Adolescent recruitment was determined by what the sites selected for the study were able to recruit.

## Assessor's comments

Issue clarified.

## Question 4:

Only results from the total randomised population, ITT and PP populations for the entire patient group, 12 years of age and older are presented; no results from the subgroups, and particularly from the 12 to 17 years olds/the adolescent subgroup, are presented.

## Response

Results for the 12 to 17 year old ITT Population were produced and summarized in the Summary of Efficacy  and  Summary  of  Safety  for  the  variation  to  the  Marketing  Authorization  Application  (MAA)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

submitted July 2017 (EMEA/H/C/002673/WS1208/0033 for Relvar Ellipta and EMEA/H/C/002745/WS1208/0029 for Revinty Ellipta. This data is presented in response to Question 5.

## Assessor's comments

Issue clarified.

## Question 5:

The  MAH  should  re-present  the  findings  of  Study  201378  and  should  compare  the  results  for  the patient group aged 18 years and older (the adult patients) with those of the patient group aged 12 to 17  years  (the  adolescent  patients),  with  respect  to  their  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics, efficacy  results  with  respect  to  pulmonary  function  (PM  FEV1  at  the  end  of  the  24-week  treatment period), rescue-free 24-hour periods, symptom-free 24-hour periods and PEF (AM and PM) and safety with regard to the incidence of adverse events, asthma exacerbations and oropharyngeal candidiasis. The findings should then be discussed.

## Response

Subjects 12 to 17 years of age cannot be compared with subjects 18 years and over as this analysis was  not  performed;  however,  the  data  from  subjects  12  to  17  can  be  compared  with  the  full population, of which over 83% consisted of subjects 18 years and over and thus reflects the results in subjects over 18 years of age.

Below is a summary of the data available for subjects 12 to 17 years of age

Demographics  (Table  1.15): Most  subjects  in  the  ITT  (12-17  Years  Old)  Population  were  male (60%) with a mean age of 15 years.

Evening Trough FEV1 (Table 2.7): For the ITT (12-17 Years Old) Population, increases in evening trough FEV1 at Week 24 compared with baseline were seen across all treatment groups. The mean change from baseline was 60 mL for the FF/VI 100/25 group, 59 mL for the FP/SAL 250/50 group, and 41 mL for the FP 250 group. Due to the low numbers of adolescents, no formal statistical analyses were conducted in 12 to 17 year olds.

Severe Asthma Exacerbations (Table 3.26): In the ITT (12-17 Years Old) Population, one subject in the FP/SAL 250/50 group reported a severe asthma exacerbation.

Conclusion: Overall, the safety profile for FF/VI for adolescents has identified no new safety concerns when compared to the overall treatment group in Study 201378. There are too few adolescents in this study to allow a separate meaningful description of efficacy in the adolescent subgroup.

## Assessor's comments

The MAH has justified that subjects 12 to 17 years of age cannot be compared with subjects 18 years and over as this analysis was not performed; however, the data from subjects 12 to 17 can be compared with the full population, of which over 83% consisted of subjects 18 years and over and thus reflects the results in subjects over 18 years of age.

The  data  request  for  subjects  12  to  17  years  of  age  has  been  provided  properly  and  a  little discussion has been addressed about the findings in paediatric population.

The MAH has not presented a separate statistical analysis for the adolescent subgroup, which is endorsed by the Rapporteur due to the very small size of this subgroup. In addition, descriptive comparative analysis of the adolescents subgroup and the full population does not show significant differences.

Overall, the safety profile of FF/VI in adolescents included in study 201378 was consistent with the safety profile in the overall study population. Therefore, no safety concerns were identified in adolescents.

## Conclusion

Issue solved

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

FF/VI 100/25 fixed dose combination is authorised for use as once daily treatment of persistent asthma in adolescents aged  12  years and  older. In accordance  with Article 46  of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, the MAH submitted the final report of the study number 201378. These data have  also been submitted as part of the post-authorisation measures specific obligations.

Study 201378 was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, multicenter study  of  once  daily  fluticasone  furoate/vilanterol  100/25  Inhalation  Powder,  twice  daily  fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 Inhalation Powder, and twice daily fluticasone propionate 250 Inhalation Powder in the treatment of persistent asthma in adults and adolescents (12 years and older) already adequately controlled on twice daily inhaled corticosteroid and long acting beta2-agonist.

Initially, the MAH submitted pooled data in the overall study population not disaggregated for adults and  adolescents.  After  CHMP  request,  the  MAH  has  provided  the  results  of  study    201378 disaggregated  for  the  adolescents  subgroup.  The  MAH  has  not  presented  any  separate  statistical analysis for the adolescents subgroup, which is endorsed by the Rapporteur due to the very small size of this subgroup. In addition, descriptive comparative analysis of the paediatrics subgroups and the full population does not shows significants differences.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, the safety profile for FF/VI for adolescents in study 201378 was consistent with the safety profile in the overall study population. Therefore, no safety concerns were identified in adolescents.

Moreover, results obtained in the study 201378 performed in asthmatic subjects aged 12 years and older  are  consistent  to  the  EU  summary  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  do  not  alter  the risk/benefit profile of FF/VI 200/25. No further regulatory action is required.
