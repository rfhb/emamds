## 1. Scope of the variation and changes to the dossier

| Scope of the variation:            | Extension of indication of Tarceva for the first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations. The MAH also applied to revise the warnings on keratitis in section 4.4 of the SmPC and sections 2, 4 of the Package Leaflet following a request from the CHMP to harmonise the wording across EGFR inhibitor products. Annex II has also been updated to reflect the latest Risk Management Plan version number (RMP v. 3.1). The MAH took the opportunity to introduce amendments to the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.   |

## 3. Scientific discussion

## 3.1. Introduction

Epidermal  Growth  Factor  Receptors  (EGFRs)  are  over-expressed  in  a  number  of  tumours,  including NSCLC.  Erlotinib  is  an  orally  administered  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  (TKI).  It  is  a  small  molecule specifically targeting the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR receptor which plays an important role in major signalling cellular pathways involved in tumour genesis and tumour growth.

Erlotinib (Tarceva) has already been approved for 2 nd and further line treatment of patients with advanced (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC and for maintenance therapy (in patients with SD) after 4 cycles of 1 st line chemotherapy). Tarceva is also approved in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

This application is for an extension of the NSCLC indication to add: first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR activating mutations'.

The indication is based on the results from study ML 20650 (EURTAC), an ongoing Phase III, openlabel trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erlotinib treatment in previously untreated patients with advanced NSCLC who present mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR as well as two bibliographic references were also presented as supportive:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  A prospective study conducted by the Spanish Lung Cancer Group (SLCG) (Rosell et al., N Engl J Med (2009), 361:958-67) which screened for EGFR mutations in patients with advanced NSCLC and treated eligible patients with erlotinib .

-  A pooled analysis conducted by Paz-Ares et al. (Paz-Ares et al., J. Cell. Moll. Med. Vol 14, N01-2, 2010  pp.51-69)  comparing  the  efficacy  of  first-line  chemotherapy  and  EGFR  TKIs  (erlotinib  and gefitinib) in patients with EGFR mutated tumours .

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA decision (EMEA-000195-PIP0-08) for the following conditions:

-  Non small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer

On the granting of a class waiver.

## General comments on compliance with GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 3.2. Toxico-pharmacological aspects

The  non-clinical  information  provided  were  extracted  from  scientific  articles  and  mainly  concern mutated forms of the EGFR, which have been found expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor tissue in humans, and the differences between the mutated forms and the wild-type EGFR, and on the inhibitory potency of erlotinib on these forms of EGFR.

## 3. 2. 1. Pharmacology

## 3. 2. 1. 1. Primary pharmacodynamics

## In vitro studies

The EGFR consists of an extra cellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, an intracellular kinase  domain,  and  the  C-terminal  tail.  The  tail  contains  several  tyrosine  residues  which  can  be phosphorylated.

On the cell surface, EGFR exists in a state of equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms: the binding  partner  is  either  another  EGFR  (homodimerization)  or  one  of  the  other  family  members (heterodimerization). This equilibrium is shifted to  the dimeric form in the presence of ligands, e.g. EGF. These ligands bind to the extracellular domain and stabilize the dimer (Lemmon, MA 2009 ) .

The kinase domain of EGFR consists of two lobes, one at the C-terminal (C-lobe), and the other at the N-terminal  (N-lobe)  with  the  active  site  in  between  the  lobes.  The  kinase  domain  exists  in  two conformations, an inactive conformation, where the active site is 'closed' for substrates and the active conformation where the active site is 'open' for substrates.

In the active conformation of the kinase domain, the C-terminal tail bridges to the active site of the kinase domain and a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to one of several tyrosines of the C- terminal  tail.  This  catalytic  cycle  repeats  itself  (ADP  leaves  the  active  site,  a  new  molecule  of  ATP enters,  and  again  one  phosphate  group  is  transferred  to  another  tyrosine  on  the  tail).  These phosphorylated motifs then recruit various adaptor molecules and thus a variety of signal pathways are activated which eventually leads to cell proliferation and survival (Bose R and Zhang X, 2009).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Erlotinib competes with ATP in its binding pocket, and thus eliminates the phosphorylation step and in this way hinders cell proliferation.

An enzymatic study (Qui C et al., 2009) of the nearly full-length wild-type EGFR protein in active (EGFbound) and inactive (cetuximab inactivated) forms demonstrates that erlotinib binds to the activated form  of  the  kinase  domain  of  wild-type  EGFR  about  ten-fold  more  tightly  than  to  the  inactive conformation. In this way it can efficiently block initiation of the signaling cascade (Table 1).

Table 1 Affinity of Erlotinib to Nearly-Full Length EGFR

| EGFR                    | IC 50 erlotinib (µM)   |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Wild-Type (EGF) a       | 0.486  0.089          |
| Wild-Type (cetuximab) b | 4.4  2.1              |

b wild-type EGFR with bound cetuximab: the kinase domain is in the inactive state

- a wild-type EGFR in the presence of the ligand EGF: the kinase domain is in the active state

Several experiments indicate that in mutated EGFRs, the kinase domain is preferentially in the active conformation (Eck MJ and Yun CH, 2010).

Another  major  consequence  of  the  activating  mutations  is  that  EGFR  becomes  functional  in  the absence of ligands. This was shown in cellular experiments which followed the phosphorylation of EGFR and the downstream signaling: In cells containing wild-type EGFR no phosphorylation and downstream-signaling  is  observed  in  the  absence  of  EGF.  In  cells  which  contain  EGFR  (L858R)  or EGFR(del), phosphorylation and signaling occurs constitutively, i.e. in the absence of EGF (Okabe T et al., 2007)

Since these mutations occur in the vicinity of the kinase domain, they influence the binding constants of  ATP  and  erlotinib,  and  thus  the  ability  of  erlotinib  to  abrogate  the  signaling  cascade  and  the  cell proliferation. Structurally the EGFRs bearing activating mutations resemble the ligand-activated form of wild-type EGFR. Hence it may be expected that similarly the activating mutations may bind erlotinib and ATP better than wild-type EGFR. However, studies by Carey et al. using the isolated cytoplasmic kinase domain of mutated EGFRs, found that the picture is more complicated (Table 2).

Surprisingly,  kinetic  studies  using  the  isolated  cytoplasmic  kinase  domain  of  mutated  EGFRs,  found that  while  ATP  binds  less  tightly  to  the  mutated  EGFRs,  erlotinib  binds  tighter  (Table  2).  The  ratio Ki[erlotinib] / Km[ATP] provides a relative estimate of the inhibitory potency. Thus it is estimated that erlotinib  can  inhibit  the  most  common  mutated  forms  of  EGFRs  approximately  10  -  100  fold  more efficiently than the wild-type form (Carey et al).

The  sensitivity  of  a  comprehensive  panel  of  EGFR  mutations  toward  erlotinib  was  measured  using Ba/F3 cells expressing the activating EGFR mutants (Kancha RK et al, 2009). The mutants caused IL-3 - independent growth in the Ba/F3 cells, indicating that these mutations lead to a growth advantage in vitro. The most abundant mutations are also the most sensitive ones (table 3).

## In vivo studies

The  potential  of  these  activating  mutations  to  cause  lung  cancer  was  shown  in  transgenic  mouse models (Politi K et al., 2006). These transgenic mice with doxycycline dependant expression of an exon 19  deletion  mutant  (EGFR  (del  L747-S752))  or  the  L858R  mutant  (EGFR  (L858R))  in  type  II pneumocytes  developed  lung  tumours  within  two  weeks  after  induction  with  doxycycline.  The  mice expressing  the  EGFR  (L858R)  allele  showed  diffuse  lung  cancer  highly  reminiscent  of  human bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and later developed interspersed multifocal adenocarcinomas. In contrast,  mice  expressing  EGFR  (del  L747-S752)  developed  multifocal  tumors  embedded  in  normal lung  parenchyma  with  a  longer  latency.  With  mice  carrying  either  EGFR  allele,  withdrawal  of doxycycline (de-induction of the oncogene expression) caused rapid tumor regression.

Tumor bearing transgenic mice expressing the exon 19 deletion mutant (EGFR(del747-S752)) or the L858R mutant (EGFR(L858R)) in type II pneumocytes under the control of doxycycline were treated with  erlotinib  at  doses  of  12.5  mg/kg/day.  Partial  to  complete  responses  evaluated  by  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was observed as early as 2 days after erlotinib treatment. The amount of tumor regression as assayed histologically correlated with the length of treatment. After 2-4 days of study  treatment  tumor  cells  were  still  observed  throughout  the  lung  sections.  Very  few  tumor  cells were  detected  in  lung  tissue  from  animals  treated  with  erlotinib  for  &gt;  2  weeks.  Emphysematous changes  and  scarring  were  observed  in  the  lungs  of  treated  mice,  presumably  in  areas  where adenocarcinomas  were  eliminated  or  were  being  eliminated.  Tumours  in  two  mice  that  were heterozygous  for  p53,  generated  in  the  context  of  ongoing  experiments  to  determine  the  effect  of tumour suppressor gene deficiencies on mutant EGFR-dependent tumorigenesis, also regressed upon erlotinib treatment

These results suggest that inhibition of the kinase activity of the mutant receptor is sufficient to elicit responses similar to those observed upon de-induction of the EGFR oncogene in transgenic mice and to that observed after TKI treatment of most human lung tumors with EGFR mutations. In addition, in mice,  both  bronchioloalveolar  carcinoma  and  solid  invasive  adenocarcinomas  respond  to  treatment with erlotinib.

## Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The MAH provided bibliographic data to support the efficacy of erlotinib for the treatment of human lung tumours with EGFR mutations.

The provided pharmacology data showed that erlotinib has higher affinity and efficacy at the active domain of the mutated EGFR than the wild-type receptor. In-vivo studies in tumour bearing transgenic mutant receptor mice treated with erlotinib showed and rapid regression of malignant lung tumours comparable to the effect observed in human lung tumours with EGFR mutations.

The estimated future environmental exposure in terms of surface water PEC to erlotinib even assuming a doubling of the use of erlotinib will be around 100 times lower than estimated in the first ERA and similarly for the other dependent PEC values and the risk ratios including the one for sediment. Therefore, the justification for not submitting a new ERA in the current application is deemed acceptable

## Conclusion

The available literature describes the higher affinity and efficacy of erlotinib at the active domain of the mutated EGFR than the wild-type receptor. No additional non-clinical studies are considered necessary.

## 3.3. Clinical aspects

NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of all cases of lung cancer. Although there has been a gradual decrease in the incidence of NSCLC in men, it continues to increase in women. The treatment of NSCLC is determined by disease stage. Surgery continues to be the mainstay of treatment for early-stage and localized disease. Over 70% patients with NSCLC present at an advanced stage, including patients with metastatic  disease  and  those  with  locally  advanced  disease  with  malignant  pleural  or  pericardial effusion.  Current  therapeutic  options  for  advanced  stage  patients  have  the  potential  to  palliate symptoms and extend survival; however, the disease is incurable. The median survival with support treatment alone (without chemotherapy) is approximately 3-4 months.

Platinum-based chemotherapy, when given as first-line therapy, modestly prolongs survival compared with best supportive care. Several third- generation chemotherapeutic agents (paclitaxel, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, docetaxel, vinorelbine and  irinotecan) have  also shown  single-agent activity. In randomized Phase III  trials,  these  agents  in  combinations  with  platinum  have  been  associated  with improved quality of life (QoL) and modest improvements in survival. However, no doublet regimen has proved superior and survival outcomes are poor (median survival, 8-10 months; 1 year survival rate 35% to 40%). Furthermore, platinum-based chemotherapy is associated with several life-threatening short-term side effects (e.g. febrile neutropenia and sepsis) as well as long-term side effects. This is particularly  relevant  for  the  use  of  cisplatin  which  can  cause  neuropathy  that  may  be  exacerbated when combined with other potentially neurotoxic agents such as paclitaxel or vinorelbine. Additionally, there is a sub-set of patients from whom cisplatin-based doublets are not indicated as they have poor

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

performance status and are at risk of life-threatening toxicities. Advances  in  the  knowledge  of  tumour  biology  and  mechanisms  of  oncogenesis  have  granted  the singling  out  of  molecular  targets  for  NSCLC  treatment.  Bevacizumab,  a  vascular  endothelial  growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody, has been approved in many countries (including the EU) for use in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC on the basis of two phase III randomized trials. These represent the first evidence of improvement in treatment outcomes of chemotherapy with targeted therapies in the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. Epidermal  Growth  Factor  Receptors  (EGFRs)  are  over-expressed  in  a  number  of  tumours,  including NSCLC. The tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR receptor plays an important role in major signalling cellular pathways involved in tumour genesis and tumour growth. Erlotinib is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It binds to the intracellular kinase domain of  the  EGFR  in  competition  with  ATP.  In  patients  with  mutations  in  the  kinase  domain,  the  binding constants  for  ATP  and  erlotinib  are  altered  leading  to  more  tightly  binding  of  erlotinib.  In  result, erlotinib blocks mutated EGFR more efficiently. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that tumours with  activating  EGFR  mutations  are  more  dependent  on  EGFR  signalling  for  their  proliferation.  In consequence,  activating  mutations  in  the  EGFR  gene  confer  hypersensitivity  to  TKIs  and  increased responsiveness to TKIs why these mutations are strong, positive predictors of response to this kind of therapy. Studies have shown that mutations in certain exons of the EGFR gene have been consistently correlated with increased efficacy in response to EGFR TKIs. Activating EGFR mutations are most frequently identified in Asians, in adenocarcinomas, in women and in non-smokers. The most frequently observed mutations are represented by single-point mutations in exon 21 and deletions in exon 19 . The number of patients with activating mutations is relatively limited in  Europe:  The  reported  prevalence  of  these  activation  mutations  is  about  10-15%  in  Caucasian populations compared to 30% in Asian populations. Erlotinib  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  stage  IIIB/IV  NSCLC  in  the  maintenance  (in patients  with stable disease (SD) after 4 cycles of 1 st line chemotherapy), 2 nd and further-line setting. In the first-line setting, platinum-based chemotherapy, which achieves objective response rates (ORR) in around 30% - 40% of NSCLC patients, may still be the best option for patients with EGFR wild-type (WT) tumours. However, molecular studies have indicated that certain mutations in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene occur more frequently in patients who respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. These mutations have become known as activating mutations. It has been observed that 7090% of patients with these alterations respond to TKIs in the first-line setting. In contrast, the efficacy of various treatments in the maintenance setting or in second-line of therapy is substantially lower, resulting in response rates (RRs) in around only 10% of patients. Gefitinib  (Iressa)  is  another  EGFR  TKI  currently  approved  in  EU  Countries  for  treatment  of  patients with NSCLC and EGFR activating mutations independently of the line of therapy. Median PFS values reported with gefitinib (Iressa) in first line treatment of NSCLC are around 9.5-9.8 months [Paz Ares et al. 2009, IPASS study, Mok et al 2009].

##  The EURTAC study

The MAH submitted the interim Clinical Study Report ML20650 (EURTAC) Trial

## Methods

ML20650 (EURTAC) is a Phase III, multicenter, open-label,randomized study of erlotinib (Tarceva) treatment versus chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung who present mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

Randomised patients have been screened and confirmed exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation in the EGFR TK domain. Tumour samples were screened for EGFR activating mutations by use of  Sanger  sequencing.  Positive  samples  were  confirmed  using  a  PCR-based  lab  developed test with a sensitivity to detect 10% of mutant DNA in a background of 90% WT DNA.

Patients  in  the  erlotinib  arm  received  150  mg/day  orally  until  disease  progression,  unacceptable toxicity or death occurred. Patients in the chemotherapy arm received either a cisplatin plus docetaxel or  a  cisplatin  plus  gemcitabine  regimen.  Patients  who  were  not  candidates  for  cisplatin  treatment would receive carboplatin instead.

The study design is presented in Figure 1.

## Treatments

## Erlotinib

Erlotinib was given at a dose of 150 mg/day once daily; the medication was to be taken at the same time every morning with 200 mL of water, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the ingestion of food. Patients received treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. For all practical effects a treatment cycle was defined as 3 weeks of continuous treatment with erlotinib. Chemotherapy The following combinations of chemotherapy were allowed to be used per protocol: · Cisplatin plus docetaxel: cisplatin 75 mg/m2 intravenous (i.v.) Day 1 and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 i.v.on day 1, repeat cycle repeated every 3 weeks · Cisplatin plus gemcitabine: Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8. Repeat cycles every 3 weeks. In the case of patients not eligible for treatment with cisplatin, cisplatin could be replaced by carboplatin. The schedules were the following: · Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 day 1 and carboplatin AUC = 6 Day 1, every 21 days. · Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 and carboplatin AUC = 5 Day 1, every 21 days. When docetaxel was used, at each cycle prophylactic medication (6 doses of 8 mg of dexamethasone i.v.) was administered.

## Tumour assessments

Tumour response was evaluated according to the RECIST version 1.0 criteria Regular and symmetrical tumour assessments were performed by investigators. A blinded review was performed by an independent review committee (IRC).

## Objectives

The  objective  of  the  EURTAC  trial  was  to  compare  per  oral  treatment  with  erlotinib  with  standard chemotherapy  regimens  in  the  1 st line  treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  and  activating mutations in EGFR.

The primary objective of this study was to compare investigator-assessed PFS in the two treatment arms of the study (conventional chemotherapy vs. erlotinib) in patients with NSCLC in advanced stages (stages IIIB and IV) who have not received previous chemotherapy or any other systemic antitumor therapy for their disease and whose tumors have activating mutations in the TK domain of the EGFR.

The secondary objectives of this study were to assess: · Investigator-assessed objective response · Overall survival (including 1- and 2-year survival rates) · Location of progression · Safety profile · Gene mutation analysis of EGFR in serum · Quality of life (lung cancer symptom scale [LCSS])

## Sample size - Interim Analysis

In the sample size calculation, conservative median PFS of 10 months was presumed for the erlotinib arm vs. 6 months in the chemotherapy arm. Standard statistical tests were used.

The planned sample size was 174 patients. An interim analysis was pre-specified after 88 out of 135 planned  events  had  occurred.  A  Lan-DeMets  alpha-spending  function  was  used  to  maintain  the significance level at 5%. A more conservative stopping boundary was introduced in the IDMC charter. The efficacy interim analysis was performed with a cut-off date of 2 August 2011.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Results

## Disposition of patients

This study was conducted in Spain, Italy and France. The first patient was enrolled in 2007. At the time of the data-cut off for the interim analysis (2 August 2010) 154 patients had been randomized in the study:  77  received  chemotherapy  and  77  received  erlotinib  as  1 st line  treatment.  The  applicant  has adequately accounted for the number of patients who were withdrawn from the study. Of note, the imbalances  observed  between  the  treatment  arms  in  this  respect  can  be  explained  by  the  longer treatment duration in the erlotinib arm (until progression) compared to the chemotherapy arm (for a maximum of 4 cycles (12 weeks).

Figure 2 Disposition of Patients

The applicant has adequately accounted for major protocol violations. The number is limited and is not considered to have affected the integrity of the trial.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Demographics

The majority of patients enrolled were from Spanish centers. As expected, more females were included in  this  trial  (activating  EGFR  mutations  are  seen  more  frequently  in  females).  All  patients  were Caucasians and the median age was 64 years. Small imbalances were observed between treatment arms regarding gender and smoking status. This is not considered critical.

Randomization  was  stratified  by  ECOG  status  and  mutation  type/location.  These  factors  were  wellbalanced  between  treatment  arms.  Small  imbalances  in  performance  status  were  noted  within  the subgroups of different mutation type which is to be expected in subgroups.

## Primary endpoint: PFS (INV)

The duration of median follow-up was 10.7 months in the chemotherapy arm vs. 14.3 months in the erlotinib  arm.  At  the  time  of  the  interim  analysis,  the  data  were  reasonably  mature:  92  events  had occurred. Fourty seven (47) (61.8%) patients had an event in the chemotherapy arm vs. 45 (58.4%) in the erlotinib arm.

The  HR  for  PFS  as  assessed  by  investigators  was 0.42 (95%  CI  0.27-0.64,  p&lt;0.0001)  which corresponds  to  a  58  %  reduction  in  the  risk  of  progression  or  death.  This  is  considered  a  highly clinically relevant gain in PFS. The K-M curves make a clear and early separation. The median PFS for patients in the chemotherapy arm was 5.2 months vs. 9.7 months in the erlotinib arm resulting in an absolute gain of 4.5 months in median PFS in erlotinib-treated patients.

12% of patients in the chemotherapy arm and 37% of patients in the erlotinib arm were event-free 1 year after randomization.

Most patients with activating EGFR mutations have adenocarcinomas. The subgroup of patients with non-adenocarcinomas was very small (n= 13) and only 1 patient had squamous cell histology.

## IRC-based assessment of PFS

Not all scans have been reviewed by the IRC. The retrospective nature of the IRC review and logistic barriers  are  mentioned  by  the  MAH  as  possible  reasons  for  the  incomplete  review  by  the  IRC.  The percentages of scans reviewed in both treatments arms are relatively large during the first 30 weeks of treatment (where the number of patients is largest); 50-75% in the chemotherapy arm and 86-90% in the erlotinib arm.

Based on the number of available scans and relevant clinical information 30 patients were considered to have had an event by independent review in the chemotherapy arm vs. 31 patients in the erlotinib arm (data cut-off of 2 August 2010). The numbers were 47 and 45, respectively, in the analysis based on investigators' assessment. The HR for PFS (IRC) was 0.47 (95% CI:  0.28 - 0.78, p = 0.0030). The median  PFS  was  5.4  months  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  vs.  10.4  months  in  the  erlotinib  arm.  Even though this analysis is based on fewer events than the investigator-based analysis (64% of events in the chemotherapy arm and 69% of events in the erlotinib arm), this IRC-based result is consistent with the result of the primary analysis.

When focusing on patients with valid assessments by both investigator and IRC (46 patients in the chemotherapy  arm  and  61  patients  in  the  erlotinib  arm),  the  concordance  rate  was  63%  in  the chemotherapy arm and 75.4% in the erlotinib arm.

## OS

At the time of the interim analysis, only 35% of the patients had died reason why the OS data are considered still immature. The HR for OS was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.47 - 1.37, p-value 0.42). The median OS was 18.8 months in the chemotherapy arm vs. 22.9 months in the erlotinib arm.

At  the  time  of  the  interim  analysis  more  patients  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  (67%)  had received later lines of therapy (often including an EGFR, TKI) after progression vs. 36% in the erlotinib arm which will most certainly confound OS results.

## Best Overall Response (CR/PR)

The percentage of responders (CR/PR) was significantly larger in the erlotinib arm (54.5%) compared  with the chemotherapy  arm  (10.5%). Erlotinib-treated responders mainly experienced PR (51.9%).

In contrast, no significant difference was found between treatment arms in terms of disease control (= CR+PR+SD) (65.8% vs. 77.9%) based on investigators' assessment. This is due to the relatively high number of patients who experienced SD in response to chemotherapy.

## QoL

Completion rates of the QoL questionnaire were too low to allow further analyses.

## Updated Results

An additional post-hoc analysis was performed including additional data from period of time from cutoff  for  the  planned  interim  analysis  (August 2, 2010) until the date of disclosure of interim analysis results to study investigators (January 26, 2011). These data were presented at ASCO in 2011, and the Rapporteurs have specifically asked for these data to be presented in this submission.

The updated PFS analysis was performed when 111 events had occurred (67.8% in the chemotherapy arm and 60.5% in the erlotinib arm). The HR for PFS had further improved (= 0.37 95% CI: 0.25 0.54, p&lt; 0.0001). The absolute gain in median PFS was unchanged (4.5 months) in erlotinib treated patients.

OS results remain immature (40% of patients had died), but it is noteworthy that the HR for OS is no longer &lt; 1. In contrast, the percentage of patients in the chemotherapy arm receiving further lines of therapy  and  particularly  crossing-over  to  receive  erlotinib,  had  risen  to  77%  which  is  a  possible explanation for the decreasing OS difference between treatment arms.

## Supportive studies

An overview of data submitted as part of this application is provided in Table x. Efficacy data are available from 438 patients with tumours having activating EGFR mutations, of who 234 received erlotinib as first-line therapy.

All studies reported, used erlotinib at the standard approved dose of 150 mg/day, which has already been established as a safe and efficacious dose in patients with advanced NSCLC.

Of  note,  reliability  of  these  data  presented  as  supportive  couldn't  be  assessed  by  the  CHMP  as  no clinical study report was submitted.

-  Spanish Lung Cancer Group (SLCG) data (Rosell et al., N Engl J Med (2009)

## Methodology

The SLCG has conducted a prospective, large scale screening for EGFR mutations in patients with stage IIIB disease with pleural effusion or stage IV NSCLC. Patients were required to be chemotherapy-naïve or  to  have  received  up  to  two  prior  chemotherapy  regimensRosell  et  al,  2009,  to  have  measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) of 0-2. Other eligibility criteria included availability of sufficient  tumour  tissue  for  EGFR  mutation  analysis,  and  adequate  hematologic,  renal  and  hepatic function. The smoking history of the patients was obtained at baseline, and patients were categorized as those who had never smoked (&lt;100 lifetime cigarettes), former smokers ( ≥ 1 year since cessation), or  current  smokers  (still  smoking,  or  &lt;1  year  since  cessation).  Patients  with  active  metachronous cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, severe heart disease or who were pregnant were specifically excluded. A  total  of  2105  patients  from  129  institutions  in  Spain  were  screened  by  a  central  laboratory  for presence of EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion and L858R substitution in exon 21) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing Rosell, 2009 EGFR mutations were found in 350 / 2105 patients (16.6%) of which 217 received treatment with erlotinib. As expected, mutations were most frequent in women (69.7%), in never smokers (66.6%) and in patients with adenocarcinomas (80.9%). The principal analyses were PFS and OS. In addition, post-hoc analyses included analyses of patients' characteristics and response according to sex, smoking history, age, ECOG PS, and treatment. Included  in  the  SLCG  study  were  the  data  from  TARGET,  a  prospective  phase II  trial  of  first-line erlotinib treatment in 43 chemo-naïve patients aged 18 years or older with histologically-documented diagnosis  of  advanced  NSCLC  with  tumours  with  activating  EGFR  mutationsPaz-Ares,  2006.  Patients had to have a WHO PS 0-2, normal organ function and no clinically relevant co-morbidities to be eligible for the trial. Eligible patients were allocated to receive erlotinib (150 mg/day) orally until PD or intolerable toxicity.  Study  assessments were performed every 3-4 weeks. The primary parameter of efficacy was TTP. Secondary parameters included RR, OS, QoL and toxicity profile.

## Results

Only 296 patients were considered eligible for erlotinib treatment at a dose of 150 mg/day until PD or intolerable toxicity. Further 79 patients did never receive treatment for a variety of reasons including death (n = 18), patient or physician decision (n = 23), or received erlotinib treatment subsequent to the analysis (n = 38). Therefore, a total of 217 patients received treatment with erlotinib (150 mg/day) and were included  in  the  analysis.  In  these  remaining  patients,  median  age  was  67  (22-88)  years. 72.8% of subjects were female, 98.2% were Caucasian, 68.2% were never smokers and 76.5% had an ECOG PS of 1 or 2. Regarding tumour type, 81.1% of tumours were adenocarcinoma.

Of these patients, 113 (52.1%) received erlotinib as first-line therapy, and 104 received erlotinib as second-  or  third-line  therapy.  Median  follow-up  for  all  patients  was  14.0  months  (range  1  to  42 months).

Median PFS in the overall population (N = 217) was 14.0 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 16.7) and was comparable in patients receiving first-line therapy (14.0 months, 95% CI, 9.7 to 18.3; N = 113) and second- or further line therapy (13.0 months; 95% CI, 9.7 to 16.3; N =104). Of the 197 patients who could be evaluated for response, 24 had a complete response (CR), 115 had a partial response (PR), 38 had SD and 20 had PD. The overall rate of CR or PR to erlotinib was 70.6%. At the time of the analysis, median OS in the overall population was 27.0 months (95% CI, 22.7 to 31.3 months). Similar results were found in patients who received erlotinib as first-line therapy (28.0 months: 95% CI, 22.7 to 33.0 months) or as second-line therapy (27.0 months: 95% CI, 19.9 to 34.1 months).

There were no significant differences in PFS according to performance status, age, smoking history, or type  of  EGFR  mutation  (Table  2).  However,  median  PFS  was  shown  to  be  longer  in  females  (16.0 months: 95% CI, 12.7 to 19.2 months) than in males (9.0 months: [95% CI, 6.1 to 11.9 months]; p = 0.003). Similarly, median OS was 29.0 months (95% CI: 24.9 to 33.1) in females and 18.0 months (95% CI: 14.5 to 21.5) in males (p = 0.05) in these patients with activating EGFR mutations. The multivariate analysis revealed an association between poor PFS and male sex and the presence of the exon 21 (L858R) mutation.

##  Pooled Analysis of Published Clinical Trial Data (Paz-Ares et al., J. Cell. Moll. Med. Vol 14, N01-2, 2010 pp. 51-69 )

## Methodology:

In this literature review, the medical literature (Medline, Biosis Previews and Embase) was reviewed to identify  appropriate  clinical  studies  for  inclusion  in  the  pooled  analysis.  The  search  was  limited  to studies published in 2004 or later and non-English language manuscripts and reviews were excluded. In addition, studies presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meetings in 2008 and  2009  were  reviewed  as  well.  Studies  that  were  performed  in  the  maintenance  or  adjuvant treatment settings or involved sequential administration of multiple EGFR TKIs were excluded from the pooled analysis.

Within the studies included in the pooled analysis, a variety of techniques were used to determine the EGFR mutation status of tumours. However, the methods used in individual studies were not critically assessed as part of the pooled analysis.

PFS (or time to progression [TTP]) was chosen as the most appropriate endpoint to evaluate between studies and the main focus of the analysis was to obtain an estimate of the pooled median PFS by a weighted average of the single study medians. Median PFS estimates obtained in each eligible study were summed and the pooled median PFS estimated as the group-size weighted average.

Since many reports did not provide information on line of therapy specifically for patients with tumours having EGFR mutations, the outcome has not been assessed according to line of therapy in the pooled analysis. However, in order to estimate the effect of treatment in the first-line setting, an analysis was performed that included only studies where 90% or more of the included patients (regardless of EGFR mutation status) received the treatment in question as first-line therapy (in consequence, the Spanish SLCG study was not included in this subgroup analysis.)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Results:

A  total  of  12  studies  involving  365  patients  evaluated  erlotinib,  39  studies  involving  1069  patients evaluated gefitinib and 9 studies involving 375 patients evaluated chemotherapy. Among the studies included in the pooled analysis, the estimated proportion of patients who received first-line treatment with erlotinib, gefitinib and chemotherapy was 57%, 57% and 95%, respectively.

For patients treated with any line of therapy, median PFS was 13.2 months (range 8.6 to 15.8 months) in patients treated with erlotinib compared to 9.8 months (range 3 to 16 months) in patients treated with gefitinib and 5.9 months (range 4 to 8.4 months) in patients treated with chemotherapy.

In  the  weighted  pooled  analysis,  the  overall  median  PFS  was  determined  as  13.2  months  (95% Accuracy Interval [AI], 12.0 to 14.7 months) for erlotinib treated patients, 9.8 months (95% AI, 9.2 to 10.4 months) for gefitinib treated patients and 5.9 months (95% AI, 5.3 to 6.5 months) for patients treated with chemotherapy.

For patients treated predominantly in the first-line setting, median PFS was 12.5 months (range 10.0 - 16.0 months) in patients treated with erlotinib compared to 9.9 months (range 9.0 - 10.9 months) in patients  treated  with  gefitinib  and  6.0  months  (range  4.5  -  6.7  months)  in  patients  treated  with chemotherapy.

##  CALGB30406 Phase II study (Janne et al., J Clin Oncol 28:7s, 2010)

## Methodology

The CALGB30406 study was a randomized Phase II trial designed compared to the first-line therapy with  erlotinib  alone  in  combination  with  carboplatin/paclitaxel  in  chemotherapy-naïve  patients  with advanced NSCLC, never or light smokers.

Patients  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  smoking  history  (never  or  light  smokers)  and  randomized  to erlotinib  (150  mg/day)  or  6 cycles  of  carboplatin  (AUC  =  6)  /  paclitaxel  (200  mg/m 2 )  plus  erlotinib (150 mg/day) followed by single agent erlotinib. Collection of pre-tumour assessments was mandatory for  determination  of  EGFR  mutation  status.  The  primary  endpoint  was  PFS.  Secondary  endpoints included RR and OS.

## Results

The results of the CALGB30406 study were reported at ASCO in 2010. Of the 182 patients randomized, 105 were identified to have tumours with wild-type EGFR and 67 were identified to have tumours with activating EGFR mutations (32 who received erlotinib alone and 35 who received chemotherapy plus erlotinib).

Female  patients  comprised  61%  and  58%  of  the  studied  population,  respectively,  and  the  majority were  Caucasian  (76%  and  84%  in  the  erlotinib-carboplatin  and  erlotinib  alone  arms,  respectively). Most  patients  (&gt;75%  in  both  arms)  were  never  smokers  and  the  majority  had  adenocarcinoma subtype (87% in the erlotinib-carboplatin arm vs 80% in the erlotinib alone arm).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall,  PFS  was  similar  between  the  erlotinib  (6.7  months;  [80%  CI,  4.7  to  8.2  months])  and chemotherapy plus erlotinib (6.0 months; [80% CI, 5.6-7.3 months]) treatment arms, respectively. However, in patients with tumours with activating EGFR mutations, PFS was increased in both erlotinib treatments arms (16.4 months; [80% CI, 12.1 to 23.8] and 17.2 months [80% CI, 11.1 to 27.6] in the erlotinib alone and chemotherapy plus erlotinib arms, respectively).

Consistent  with  results  for  PFS,  in  patients  with  tumours  with  activating  EGFR  mutations,  OS  was increased in both erlotinib treatment groups. In patients who received erlotinib single agent therapy, OS  was  27.6  months  [80%  CI;  24.0  to  42.8  months].  Similarly,  OS  in  patients  who  received combination therapy was 39.0 months [80% CI: 39.0 - not reached].

In patients with tumours with EGFR mutations who received erlotinib alone, RR was 66%. In patients treated with erlotinib plus chemotherapy, RR was 69%.

##  Phase II study (Laskin et al. 2009)

## Methodology

This  Phase  II  clinical  trial  of  first-line  erlotinib  for  clinically  selected  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC showed  the  feasibility  of  performing  pre-treatment  biopsies  in  this  clinical  setting.  The  patient population enrolled was 'enriched' in that patients were selected for at least two of the following: never smokers,  female  gender,  Asian/Southeast  Asian  origin,  and  BAC  or  adenocarcinoma.  A  total  of  65 patients with advanced (Stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC, no prior chemotherapy for advanced disease and an ECOG PS  2 were selected to receive erlotinib 150 mg/day until PD. The primary endpoint of the trial was non-progression at 8 weeks.

## Results

More than 80% of patients were female, 75% were never smokers, 70% were of Asian origin and 69% had adenocarcinoma subtype. Results of a mutational analysis showed that of the 49  samples with adequate DNA for analysis,  19  (39%)  had  EGFR  mutations  (exons  19  and  21).  Seventeen  of  these patients were of Asian ethnicity and 18 were never smokers.

Clinical results showed that 52 of the patients treated with erlotinib (80%) had not progressed after 8 weeks.  Female  patients,  patients  who  were  never  smokers,  patients  with  adenocarcinoma  histology and  patients  of  Asian  ethnicity  were  more  likely  to  derive  benefit  from  erlotinib  treatment.  PR  was observed in 22 patients (34%) and SD in 24 patients (37%) with a disease control rate of 71%. Of the 22 patients with a PR, 17 had tumours with activating EGFR mutations. Two of the 24 patients with SD had tumours with activating EGFR mutations. TTP in patients with tumours with EGFR mutations was 12.8 months and median OS was 17.0 months in patients with tumours with EGFR mutations.

##  Study BO18192 (SATURN)

## Methodology

This is  a  multi-centre,  double-blind  randomized Phase III study designed to evaluate the efficacy of erlotinib or placebo following 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with histologically documented, advanced or  recurrent (Stage IIIB and not amenable for combined modality treatment) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC who have not experienced disease progression or unacceptable toxicity during chemotherapy.

After eligibility screening, patients with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC completed 4 cycles of an acceptable platinum-based chemotherapy combination. Following chemotherapy, patients who met the following criteria; ECOG PS of 0 - 1, a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks, adequate haematological, renal and hepatic  function,  and  absence  of  unacceptable  toxicity  and/or  disease  progression  (CR,  PR  or  SD), were considered eligible for erlotinib treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Eligible  patients  were  randomized  to  receive  either  erlotinib  150  mg/day  or  placebo  until  PD, unacceptable toxicity or death. Randomization was performed using an adaptive minimization method which  ensured  a  balanced  stratification  by  treatment  arm  for  the  following  factors:  EGFR  protein expression  by  IHC,  stage  of  disease  at  start  of  chemotherapy,  ECOG  PS,  chemotherapy  regimen, smoking status and region. Treatment was to continue until PD, unacceptable toxicity or death.

Mandatory  tumour  sampling  was  performed  at  screening.  Tumour  measurements  (RECIST)  were conducted at screening, baseline, every 6 weeks until week 48 and then every 12 weeks until PD. QoL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Lung (FACT-L) instrument.

The co-primary efficacy endpoints were investigator-assessed PFS according to RECIST in all patients and in the EGFR IHC positive population. An independent combined radiological and clinical assessment was  undertaken  to  provide  an  independent  assessment  of  response  and  PD.  Secondary  efficacy endpoints included OS in all patients, OS in EGFR IHC positive population, PFS in EGFR IHC negative subgroup,  OS  in  EGFR  IHC  negative  subgroup,  TTP,  time  to  symptom  progression,  response  rates (RECIST) and QoL. Exploratory analyses of other molecular markers and their correlations with clinical outcomes were conducted.

With the exception of EGFR status assessment by IHC, other biomarkers were investigated to generate hypotheses  regarding  their  potential  value  as  predictive  indicators  of  clinical  benefit  from  erlotinib therapy  in  NSCLC.  Those  biomarkers  included  EGFR  gene  copy  number  by  fluorescence in  situ hybridization  (FISH),  EGFR  mutation  status,  Kirsten  Rat  Sarcoma  2  viral  oncogene  homolog  (K-ras) mutation  status,  and  the  status  of  a  polymorphism  in  EGFR  Intron  1.  Subgroup  analyses  of  these biomarkers were pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan.

## Results

Patients were randomized to treatment with erlotinib (150 mg/day) (n = 438) or placebo (n = 451) until PD or intolerable toxicity.

In patients with a known EGFR mutation status (n = 449), 11% were identified with mutation positive tumours, 22 in the erlotinib group and 27 in the placebo group.

Data  presented  for  study  BO18192  are  from  the  clinical  cut-off  for  overall  survival  (May  17,  2009) since this is the most recent data.

In  patients  with  tumours  with  activating  EGFR  mutations,  addition  of  erlotinib  after  4 cycles  of chemotherapy significantly improved PFS compared with placebo (HR 0.23, [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.45]; log-rank  p  &lt;  0.0001).  Median  PFS  was  46.1  weeks,  [95%  CI,  33.7  to  59.6]  in  the  erlotinib  arm compared with 13.0 weeks the placebo arm [95% CI, 11.6 to 21.3].  The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is presented in figure 9.

##  Study ML20981 (OPTIMAL)

OPTIMAL  study  is  an  ongoing  randomized,  multicenter  Phase III  investigator  sponsored  trial  (IST) conducted  in  China  comparing  efficacy  and  safety  of  first-line  erlotinib  versus  carboplatin  plus gemcitabine chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with tumours with activating EGFR mutations. This study was a trial  sponsored  and  run  by  the  Chinese  Thoracic  Oncology  Group  (CTONG).  Since  no  CSR  is available  for  this  study,  the  MAH  submitted  the  overview  of  the  efficacy  results  as  part  of  the responses to the 1 st RfSI and as they have been presented at international congresses:

Of 549 patients screened, 186 (34%) had EGFR activating mutation NSCLC, 165 were randomized and 154 included in the study population (82 erlotinib; 72 carboplatin/gemcitabine [carb/gem]). Baseline data were well-balanced between the erlotinib and carb/gem arms: male (42% vs. 40%, respectively), adenocarcinoma (88% vs. 86%), never-smoker (72% vs. 69%) and type of EGFR activating mutation (exon 19 deletion: 52% vs. 54%). The median PFS was 13.1 months in the erlotinib group compared with 4.6 months in the carb/gem group;  PFS HR = 0.16 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.26]; p &lt;0.0001 (Figure 10).

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Overall, the studies enrolled patients with advanced NSCLC (stage III/IV), median age ranged between 22 and 88 years and more than 80% of patients in the studies had an ECOG PS &lt;2. Adenocarcinoma was the  most  common  tumour  subtype  and  the  majority  of  patients  in  each  of  these  studies  were females who had never been smokers.

An  overview  of  efficacy  results  for  the  erlotinib  studies  in  NSCLC  patients  with  tumours  having activating EGFR mutations is shown in Table 5.

a  The SLCG study was included in the review of published trials (Paz-Ares et al, 2010) and the overall median PFS was included in the analysis of a weighted pooled PFS for this study. However, the study was not included in the analysis of PFS in predominantly first-line patients as the population comprised 52% of patients who received firstline therapy and 48% of patients who received erlotinib as second- or third-line therapy. b median PFS or OS in patients receiving first-line therapy. c median PFS or OS in patients receiving second or third line therapy. d GLYPH&lt;31&gt;median PFS in studies in which  90% of patients received treatment in the first-line setting (predominantly firstline patients). e   Data from the study BO18192 cannot be compared directly with the other 1 st -line data presented in this table,

because the treatment in this study was given as maintenance therapy after end of chemotherapy in a subset of responding patients and the time to event was measured only from end of standard first line therapy.

Due to the marked differences in study design and variety of data sources, no pooling of the study data has been performed.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

The  applicant  has  submitted  the  CSR  of  the  interim  results  from  study  ML  20650  (EURTAC),  a randomised  Phase  III,  open-label  trial  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  erlotinib treatment  in  previously  untreated  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  who  present  mutations  in  the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR. The EURTAC study is the first prospectively conducted, relatively large randomized, unblinded phase III trial comparing the efficacy of erlotinib to a standard platinum-based doublet regimen in the 1 st line treatment of patients with EGFR activating mutations in Europe. Erlotinib was dosed at 150 mg/day which is the dose already approved for 2 nd  line and maintenance treatment. Standard doses were used in the chemotherapy regimens. The control arm is acceptable: 4-6 cycles of platinum-based doublets represent  the  standard  regimen  in  the  first-line  treatment  of  advanced  NSCLC.  The  choice  of  the specific  chemotherapy  regimen  was  at  the  discretion  of  the  treating  physician  (4  options  were  prespecified). In case of AEs, recommendations for dose reductions/interruptions had been pre-specified for both erlotinib and chemotherapy regimens. Following  review  of  the  interim  analysis  results,  the  IDMC  recommended  stopping  of  the  trial  after demonstration of a substantial benefit of erlotinib over chemotherapy. At the time the HR for PFS was 0.42 (95% CI 0.27-0.64, p&lt;0.0001) which corresponds to a 58 % reduction in the risk of progression or  death. The  K-M  curves  make  a  clear  and  early  separation.  The  median  PFS  for  patients  in  the chemotherapy arm was 5.2 months vs. 9.7 months in the erlotinib arm resulting in an absolute gain of 4.5  months  in  median  PFS  in  erlotinib-treated  patients.  This  is  lower  than  what  was  observed  for erlotinib as first-line treatment in the study by Rosell et al. (14 months (95% CI: 11.2 - 16.7)) and in the meta-analysis by Paz-Ares et al. (12.5 months). A relatively higher degree of patients with tumour stage IV (&gt;91%) and other prognostic factors of poor outcome (males, previous smokers, pre-treated patients, mutation type, poor PS) might explain the poorer result in the present study. This being an interim analysis may also be a possible cause. Nevertheless, this is still considered a highly clinically relevant gain in PFS. The robustness of the result was confirmed in a number of sensitivity analysis and consistent results were found in subgroups with an acceptable sample size. The trial was unblinded due to the different nature and schedules of the treatment arms: The control arm was represented by 4 cycles of standard platinum-based doublets vs. the test arm of continuous dosing  of  erlotinib  until  progression,  death  or  unacceptable  toxicity  whichever  occurred  first.  The primary endpoint was PFS which is acceptable in the 1 st  line setting. Secondary endpoints were ORR, OS,  safety,  QoL  (LCSS  scale),  location  of  progression  and  gene  mutation  analyses  of  EGFR. Furthermore,  IRC-based  assessments  of  PFS  and  ORR  were  introduced  in  order  to  rule  out investigator-related bias which is endorsed. Due to  the  unblinded  nature  of  the  trial  an  independent  blinded  review  was  introduced  by  an  IRC.

Concordance  rates  observed  between  investigators'  review  and  the  IRC  were  63-73%.  More  scans were  reviewed  in  the  erlotinib  arm  and  there  is  some  uncertainty  left  as  to  the  reason  for  this discrepancy. However, overall the percentages of scans reviewed in both treatment arms are relatively large.  Therefore, the risk of a large systemic bias in the investigators' assessments can be ruled out. The HR for PFS (IRC-based) was 0.47 (95% CI:  0.28 - 0.78, p = 0.0030) and the median PFS 5.4 months in the chemotherapy arm vs. 10.4 months in the erlotinib arm, thus confirming the result of the INV-based analysis. A significant increase in patients experiencing a PR/CR (mainly PR) was seen in patients treated with erlotinib  (54.5%)  compared  to  chemotherapy  (10.5%).  The  observed  RR  in  the  erlotinib  arm  was generally lower than previously observed (70% in the Rosell study). The same explanations as offered for  PFS  may  apply  here.  Furthermore,  patients  with  'evaluable'  disease  and  not  only  'measurable' disease were allowed in the study (8 in the erlotinib arm). These patients can't obtain documentation of PR by RECIST. OS results were immature. So far no difference in OS was observed between treatment arms but a high degree of cross-over and later lines of therapies are expected to have confounded the OS results. Mature OS data must be submitted as a FUM. QoL data are inconclusive due to low completion rates. An updated analysis was performed when 111 PFS events had occurred (67.8% in the chemotherapy arm and 60.5% in the erlotinib arm). The HR for PFS had further improved (= 0.37 (95% CI: 0.25 0.54, p&lt; 0.0001). The absolute gain in median PFS was unchanged (4.5 months) in erlotinib treated patients. OS results remain immature (40% had died), but it is noteworthy that the HR for OS is no longer &lt; 1. In contrast, the percentage of patients in the chemotherapy arm receiving further lines of therapy  and  particularly  crossing-over  to  receive  erlotinib  had  risen  to  77%  which  is  a  possible explanation for the decreasing OS difference between treatment arms. Overall, the updated results confirmed the results of the original interim analysis. The MAH submitted in the original application data derived from published subgroup analyses of three phase II-III studies. These studies involved a very limited number of NSCLC patients with known EGFR activating mutations. The pooled analysis of recent trials performed in patients with EGFR activating mutation tumours treated with first-line chemotherapy or with EGFR TKIs (erlotinib and gefitinib) was hampered by the same flaw. No study reports were submitted allowing an assessment of the reliability and quality of the data. From  a  clinical  perspective  the  data  presented  on  erlotinib  were  considered  of  clinical  relevance. The results consistently show median PFS advantages with erlotinib in first line treatment of NSCLC patients  with  EGFR  activating  mutations  ranging  from  12.5  up  to  16.4  months.  Such  results  are  of clinical  relevance  in  this  patient  population.  Such  patients  historically  are  known  to  progress  after  a median of 6 months when treated with currently recommended 1 st  line platinum-based chemotherapy and, otherwise, after a median of 10 months when treated with gefitinib (IPASS study). The survival results of the SLCG study, and of the CALGB30406 study, showing a median OS with erlotinib of 28 and 27 months respectively, would confirm the benefits of erlotinib in the target population. The  results  indicate  that  patients  with  NSCLC  and  activating  EGFR  mutations  represent  a  distinct subgroup of patients and that these activating mutations in the EGFR are a strong predictive marker of response to TKIs. Furthermore, there's a molecular rationale behind this marked response which has been reproducible in several trials. However, from a regulatory perspective, the lack of CSRs from prospectively conducted trials in the first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  and  EGFR  mutation  positive  tumours  was considered  a  major  deficiency  in  the  original  application.  The  databases  were  not  designed  for regulatory  purposes  and  the  data  quality  and  GCP  compliance  could  not  be  evaluated.  The  main

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

endpoints PFS and RR in these open-label multicenter studies are much more prone to bias than e.g.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

OS. Due to the complexity of the assessment of PFS and the risk of bias, the CHMP has issued the Appendix  1  to  the guideline on  the evaluation of anticancer  medicinal  products  in  man  on methodological aspects of PFS. If and to what extent these considerations were followed cannot be evaluated without full CSRs. Finally,  availability  of  other  licensed  EGFR  TKI  such  as  gefitinib  for  treatment  of  NSCLC  limits  the medical  need  for  this  class  of  drugs  in  this  subgroup  of  the  NSCLC  population.  Indeed,  although  in several in vitro studies certain EGFR mutations appear to be more sensitive to erlotinib than gefitinib, confirming  prospective  clinical  data  comparing  activity  of  gefitinib  versus  erlotinib  and  showing superiority  of  erlotinib  is  missing.  Moreover,  recent  published  phase  II  studies  and  case  reports evaluating  the  potential  clinical  activity  of  erlotinib  in  patients  with  EGFR  mutated  tumours  who experienced PD with gefitinib, failed to show a clinically relevant benefit of erlotinib at least for the majority of the patients treated, probably due to potential acquired cross-over resistance. In the publication of Rosell et al, it is noteworthy that 20% of erlotinib-treated patients seem to be long-term survivors (alive at 36 months). Overall, within the very responsive subset of patients with activating EGFR mutations, it appears that both clinical characteristics (ECOG performance status &lt;1, female  gender,  adenocarcinoma,  absence  of  brain  metastases)  as  well  as  molecular  characteristics (exon 19 deletions) are associated with a better prognosis (long-term survival). However, the lack of CSR in the Spanish Lung cancer Group study, was considered a major deficiency from a regulatory perspective. The MAH has been requested to provide more reassurance regarding the data quality and reliability of the SLCG study. The MAH provided additional information about the SLCG study including a protocol outline, list of sites and investigators, CRF, ICF and supplementary tables  to  the  NEJM  publication.  The  choice  of  treatment  was  made  at  each  respective  institution according  to  local  recommendations.  Inclusion  criteria  were  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC  (nonsquamous). Patients could previously have been treated with chemotherapy so there was no limitation to 1 st line treatment in the advanced setting. Patients to whom erlotinib was administered as a 1 st line therapy  were  part  of  the  TARGET  clinical  substudy.    For  this  subgroup  of  patients,  erlotinib  was apparently used in accordance with the Spanish Ministry of Health recommendations on the utilization of drugs for compassionate use. However, no CSR was available for the SLCG study and neither for the TARGET study. In the analysis of the data provided in the meta-analysis by Paz-Ares et al, and although there appear to  be  some  gaps  in  the  funnel  plots,  (which  could  be  a  chance  finding  due  to  the  small  number  of studies or could be indicative of publication bias) the larger studies lie closer to the vertical reference lines (pooled median PFS) in the plots than the smaller studies and these references are in support of an increasing trend in median PFS with chemotherapy-gefitinib-erlotinib. Therefore, even in presence of a publication bias, it appears unlikely that it would affect the conclusion of increasing median PFS with erlotinib compared to chemotherapy or gefitinib. This is also supported by the forest plots. Due to the lack of CSRs from individual studies, this publication could only be considered supportive to the findings of the EURTAC trial. The SATURN study formed the basis of the approval of erlotinib as maintenance therapy in patients with  SD  after  4  cycles  of  platinum-based  chemotherapy.  Although,  the  benefit  was  much  larger  in patients with activating EGFR mutations, this subgroup was limited and the Risk/Benefit -balance was also considered to be positive in patients with EGFR WT tumours why the indication was not restricted to patients with EGFR activating mutations. The  results  of  the  OPTIMAL  study  showed  a  statistically  significant  superiority  for  erlotinib  versus chemotherapy in terms of PFS in the Asian population. The quality of these data cannot be assessed and the MAH has informed the CHMP that no CSR could be made available. In absence of a CSR, the study results cannot be discussed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In summary, the interim results from the EURTAC study were considered pivotesl whereas published results without CSRs were only considered supportive in this application.

## Methodology for EGFR mutation testing

Only limited information is available regarding the methodologies used to assess the EGFR mutation status  in  the  publications  included  in  this  submission.  In  particular,  the  CALGB30406  study  abstract does not provide any information, and in the pooled analysis publication by Paz-Ares et al. the only comments regarding EGFR mutation testing state that a variety of techniques were used and these were not critically assessed as part of the analysis. The report by Laskin specifies that the EGFR gene status was assessed by DNA sequencing, but no details on how this was performed are provided. On the contrary the publication by Rosell et al. provides a detailed description of the analysis (a laboratory developed  method  (PB  SOP)  that  was  used.  It  was  based  on length  analysis  of  the  fluorescently labelled PCR product for exon 19 deletions, and a TaqMan assay for the L858R mutations in exon 21. All  positive  samples  were  confirmed  by  DNA  sequencing.  Prior  to  DNA  extraction,  samples  were enriched for tumour content by laser-capture micro-dissection. The same methodology is being used in the ongoing EURTAC study.

Finally, in the SATURN study, EGFR mutation analyses were performed using DNA lysates from macroor micro-dissected tissue samples with a minimum tumour cell content of 60 - 80%. Exons 18  21 of the EGFR gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and multiple independent products were analysed by Sanger sequencing. Mutations had to be confirmed on both strands of at least two PCR  products.  Samples  were  classified  EGFR  MUT+  if  the  most  commonly  observed  activating mutations, i.e. deletions in exon 19, and/or the L858R point mutation in exon 21 were detected.

Although tumours with EGFR activation mutations can often be found in NSCLC patients with certain characteristics, patients can not be selected for 1st line TKI therapy based on clinical characteristics only as no characteristics have been identified that are sufficient or necessary for such mutations to occur. Therefore, patient selection must be based on mutational status why the quality and sensitivity of the used EGFR mutation assays becomes essential. Earlier, direct sequencing was commonly used for  the  detection  of  EGFR  mutations.  However,  as  this  method  only  allows  detection  of  mutant sequences  constituting  more  than  30%  of  the  total  genetic  content,  various  alternative  detection methods have been taken into use that allow detection in samples containing few tumour cells, e.g. pleural fluid (these include micro-dissection followed by PCR-mediated amplification etc.).

The MAH has adequately discussed the EGFR mutation testing techniques currently in use, the only commercially  available  kit  (TheraScreen  EGFR  29  by  DxS  Ltd)  and  the  tests  used  in  the  studies included in this dossier and in ongoing studies. More sensitive tests are under development, and EGFR mutation assays will improve further in the years to come, but overall, it is reassuring that mutational status  has  been  determined  according  to  accepted  methodologies  by  experienced  staff  at  central laboratories.

In addition, the MAH has compared the 3 methodologies in question (sequencing, PB SOP and DxS) and documented that 1) concordance between sequencing and PB SOP was 100% when sequencing samples were enriched for tumour content and 2) 100% concordance was observed between PB SOP and DxS.

The MAH has proposed to include the following text in section 4.4 of the SmPC which is considered acceptable by the CHMP:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

'Assessment of EGFR mutation status: When assessing the EGFR mutation status of a patient, it is important  that  a  well-validated  and  robust  methodology  is  chosen  to  avoid  false  negative  or  false positive determinations'.

## 3.3.2.   Clinical safety

##  Evaluation of Safety Parameters

The  safety  analysis  of  study  ML20650  (EURTAC)  is  based  on  the  safety  analysis  population  (SAP). Adverse events were collected up until 28 days after the final administration of study medication but it is important to note that, due to the nature of the treatments the duration of therapy differed in the 2 arms.  Chemotherapy  was  administered  to  patients  for  a  maximum  of  4  cycles  (approximately  3 months) whereas erlotinib was administered until PD or unacceptable toxicity (with the median time to PFS being 9.4 months). This may result in a higher incidence of adverse events in the erlotinib arm.

In the TARGET study adverse events (AEs) were reported every 3-4 weeks from baseline until PD or death. AEs (excluding death) that appeared up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug or 30 days after patient withdrawal (whichever was later) were evaluated. Preferred terms were assigned by the sponsor to the original terms entered on the CRF, using MedDRA v8.1.

In  study  BO18192,  following  completion  of  4  cycles  of  chemotherapy,  AEs  were  recorded  at  the baseline visit and then throughout the erlotinib treatment period until PD or withdrawal of the patient. All AEs (related and unrelated) occurring within 28 days of last study medication intake were recorded. Preferred  terms  were  assigned  by  the  sponsor  to  the  original  terms  entered  on  the  CRF,  using MedDRA v11.0.

In the ongoing trial ML20981, AEs were recorded every 3 weeks throughout the trial until PD or death. All deaths occurring during the trial period or within 30 days after completion of the trial are reported. Preferred terms were assigned by the sponsor to the original terms entered on the CRF, using MedDRA v10.

##  Safety Populations

In  the  EURTAC  study  5  of  the  154  randomized  patients  were  excluded  from  the  safety  analysis populations  (SAP);  3  patients  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  had  no  treatment  and  2  patients  in  the erlotinib arm (one patient had no treatment and one patient had no safety follow-up).

The safety analysis populations for the TARGET and BO18192 studies comprised all patients who had received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication  and  had  at  least  one  safety  follow-up,  whether withdrawn prematurely or not. Of the 43 patients enrolled in the TARGET study, 42 were included in the safety analysis population.

Of the 49 NSCLC patients with EGFR mutated tumours in study BO18192, 48 patients (26 placebo, 22 erlotinib) were included in the safety analysis population. One patient was excluded from the safety analysis due to unblinding of the study drug as placebo and intake of erlotinib.

In  study  ML20981,  the  safety  analysis  population  included  all  patients  who  were  randomized  and received at least one dose of treatment drug. The safety analysis population comprised 155 patients (83 in the erlotinib arm, 72 in the chemotherapy arm).

##  Patient exposure

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Detailed information over extent of exposure and incidence of dose reductions specifically experienced by patients with EGFR activating mutations have been provided only for EURTAC, TARGET, OPTIMAL, and SATURN studies.

In the EURTAC study, the median dose intensity of erlotinib was 150 mg (range 78 mg to 150 mg). Overall, 28% of patients had a dose modification (reduction or interruption). The majority of patients (80%) had no dose reduction. However, 15/75 (20%) patients had their erlotinib dose reduced to 100 mg and 4/75 (5%) patients had their erlotinib dose reduced to 50 mg. The majority of patients (87%) had no dose interruption but 5/75 (7%) had a dose interruption for &lt; 1 week and 8/75 (11%) patients had their dose disrupted for ≥ 1 week.

Overall,  the  exposure  to  erlotinib  or  to  the  4  possible  chemotherapy  regimens,  respectively,  was considered adequate and representative to allow further evaluation of the safety profile.

In the TARGET study of the 42 patients evaluable for safety, 13 (31%) had a temporary interruption of study treatment, 12 patients (28.6%) had an erlotinib dose reduction to 100 mg/day and in 1 of these 12 patients erlotinib was further reduced to 50 mg/day.

In the OPTIMAL study dose reductions were reported in 5 patients in the erlotinib arm (6.0%) and 28 patients in the chemotherapy arm (38.9%).

In    SATURN  study  of  the  48  evaluable  patients  with  EGFR  mutated  tumours  dose  reductions  were performed in 4 patients treated with erlotinib (2 due to rash) and in 1 patient receiving placebo.

## Common AEs

Almost all patients in both treatment arms experienced AEs. The safety profiles of erlotinib compared to  standard  chemotherapy  regimens  are  quiet  distinct.  The  most  common  and  characteristic  AEs associated with erlotinib were diarrhea and rash as expected.

## Severity

Seven  (7)  subjects  experienced  grade  5  events  in  the  erlotinib arm  vs.  4  in the chemotherapy arm. The relatively high number in the erlotinib arm can be explained by the longer  treatment  duration.  Overall,  more  patients  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  experienced severe events (grade ≥ 3):  49  patients  (66.2%)  compared to 31 patients (41.3%) in the erlotinib  arm.  Common  severe  events  in  the  chemotherapy  arms  were  neutropenia  and  asthenia. Common severe events in the erlotinib arm were infections/infestations.

## Deaths

At the time of the interim analysis, 28/77 (36%) of patients in the chemotherapy arm vs. 27/77  (35%)  of  patients  in  the  erlotinib  arm  (35%)  had  died,  mainly  due  to  progressive disease (PD).

During the active treatment phase, 7% of patients in the chemotherapy arm and 13% of patients in the erlotinib arm died. Of note, the treatment duration was much longer in the erlotinib arm. In the erlotinib  arm,  3  deaths  were  due  to  PD.  Seven  (7)  deaths  were  due  to  SAEs  but  only  one  of  these deaths was considered to be directly related to the treatment (hepatotoxicity).

\"One patient who died due to PD in the chemotherapy arm was excluded from the ITl population. This excluded from the SAP.

'This patient died prior to receiving treatment and was excluded from the SAP

## SAEs

25.7% of patients in the chemotherapy arm vs. 26.7% in the erlotinib arm experienced SAEs. In  the  erlotinib  arm,  only  5  events  were  considered  to  be  treatment-related  (diarrhea, respiratory tract infection, hepatotoxitiy (grade 5), hyperbiliruminaemia, lung disorder).

## Discontinuations

The percentages of patients discontinuing due to AEs were largely similar between treatment arms (14.9% vs. 12%). In the erlotinib arm, 4 of the triggering events were considered to be treatment-related (mucosal inflammation, diarrhea, rash, lung disorder). This is in line with previous observations.

## Severity of adverse events

Most AEs reported in the TARGET study were mild or moderate (NCI-CTC Grade 1 or 2) in intensity. Nineteen patients experienced 49 ≥ Grade 3 AEs. Two patients experienced a Grade  3 rash and three experienced  Grade 3 diarrhoea. Other Grade  3 events reported in more than one patient included asthenia (3 patients), dyspnoea (3 patients), folliculitis (2 patients), pneumonia (2 patients), and back pain (2 patients).

## Deaths

Thirty-one of the 42 patients (73.8%) in the TARGET study safety population had died at the time of the database cut-off for the safety analysis (April 22, 2010). All but three of the patients died as a result of PD. Of the three patients who died for reasons other than PD, one died as a result of a urinary tract  infection  and  one  as  a  result  of  antiphospholipid  syndrome.  Both  events  were  considered unrelated to trial treatment by the investigator. One additional patient died as a result of encephalitis which the investigator reported as being possibly related to trial treatment.

## Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)

Fifteen patients in the subpopulation of patients with tumours with activating EGFR mutations from the TARGET study experienced at least one SAE during the treatment period. Most SAEs were reported by no  more  than  one  patient  each.  The  only  events  reported  by  more  than  1  patient  were  dyspnoea (3 patients), infection (2 patients) and pneumonia (2 patients).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Three  patients  (7.1%)  experienced  a  SAE  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  trial treatment. One patient experienced serious encephalitis, one patient experienced a serious infection and the third patient experienced 2 serious events which were reported as infection and pneumonia.

## Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation / Interruption / Modification of Treatment

One patient receiving erlotinib treatment in the TARGET study was withdrawn from trial treatment as a result of an adverse event. This patient was withdrawn as a result of a Grade 4 skin toxicity which the investigator considered probably related to trial treatment. Note: at the time of the safety analysis for the SLCG study, which included the data from TARGET, no patient had withdrawn as a result of an adverse event.

## Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders

In the TARGET study, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders as a class were reported in 36 (85.7%) patients.  Rash  (preferred  term,  all  grades)  was  the  most  frequently  reported  individual  event, occurring in 19 patients (45.2%). The majority of these events were grade 1 or 2 in intensity and most patients  (34/42;  81.0%)  experienced  a  skin  or  subcutaneous  tissue  disorder  which  was  considered related to trial treatment by the investigator. Two patients reported a Grade  3 rash. Other frequently reported skin and subcutaneous events reported in patients in the TARGET trial included alopecia (13 patients; 31%), dry skin (9 patients; 21.4%), pruritus (8 patients; 19.0%), skin toxicity (7 patients; 16.7%),  and  erythema  (4  patients;  9.5%).  The  Grade  3  events  acne,  nail  bed  inflammation  and onycholysis  were  each  reported  by  one  patient  in  this  organ  system.  None  of  the  skin  and subcutaneous tissue disorders in the TARGET study were reported as SAEs.

## SATURN Study (BO18192)

## Common adverse events

The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  reported  in  the  subpopulation  of  patients  with  EGFR  mutated tumours  in  study  BO18192  are  shown  in  Table  7.  A  higher  percentage  of  erlotinib  EGFR  mutation positive  patients  experienced  at  least  1  AE  (20  patients,  90.9%  on  erlotinib,  compared  with  the placebo  group  (12  patients,  46.2%).  The  most  common  events  in  the  erlotinib  group  were  rash (erlotinib  group  10  patients,  45.5%;  placebo  group  1  patient,  3.8%),  diarrhoea  (erlotinib  group  8 patients, 36.4%; placebo group 3 patients, 11.5%), cough (erlotinib group 5 patients, 22.7%; placebo group 1 patient, 3.8%), nausea (erlotinib group 4 patients, 18.2%; placebo group 3 patients, 11.5%), dyspnoea (erlotinib group 4 patients, 18.2%; placebo group 1 patients, 3.8%), and headache (erlotinib group 4 patients, 18.2%; placebo group 1 patients, 3.8%).

## Treatment-related adverse events

In the subpopulation of NSCLC patients with EGFR mutated tumours in study BO18192, 19 of the 22 patients  in  the  erlotinib  arm  (86.4%)  compared  with  5  patients  (19.2%)  in  the  placebo  group experienced  AEs  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study  treatment.  In  the  erlotinib group, the most common AEs regarded as related were rash (erlotinib 10 patients, 45.5%; placebo 1 patient, 3.8%) and diarrhoea (erlotinib 6 patients, 27.3%; placebo 3 patients, 11.5%). Other AEs in the erlotinib group regarded as related in at least 10% of patients included pruritus (13.6%, placebo 7.7%),  acne  (13.6%,  placebo  0%),  dermatitis  acneiform,  (13.6%;  placebo  0%),  dry  skin  (13.6%; placebo 0%), skin fissures (13.6%; placebo 0%), and anorexia (13.6%; placebo 0%).

## Severity of adverse events

In the subpopulation of NSCLC patients with EGFR mutated tumours from study BO18192, the majority of AEs were mild or moderate (NCI-CTC Grade 1 or 2). No grade 4 or 5 AEs were reported in the EGFR mutation positive patients. Six patients in the erlotinib group experienced 12 Grade 3 AEs compared with  one  patient  in  the  placebo  group  who  experienced  1  Grade 3  event.  In  the  erlotinib  treatment group, only one patient experienced a Grade 3 rash and one experienced Grade 3 diarrhoea, compared with none in the placebo group. No individual Grade 3 event was reported in more than one patient.

## Deaths

In study BO18192, in the subpopulation of patients with EGFR mutated tumours, at the time of the clinical cut-off for the survival analysis, 8 patients in the erlotinib treatment group and 13 patients in the  placebo  group  had  died  during  the  treatment  period.  All  21  patients  had  died  as  a  result  of progressive disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Serious Adverse Events

One patient in the subpopulation of NSCLC patients with EGFR mutated tumours in study BO18192 experienced  a  serious  adverse  event  during  the  treatment  period.  This  patient,  who  was  receiving erlotinib  experienced  left  ventricular  dysfunction.  The  event  was  considered  unrelated  to  trial treatment and resolved following corrective treatment.

## Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation / Interruption / Modification of Treatment

None  of  the  patients  in  the  subpopulation  with  EGFR  mutated  tumours  in  study  BO18192  were withdrawn from the erlotinib/placebo single agent treatment period as a result of an adverse event. Four  patients  in  the  erlotinib  subgroup  required  dose  adjustment  following  AEs  compared  with  1 patient in the placebo subgroup.

## Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders

Prior  to  unblinding  of  study  BO18192,  the  sponsor  defined  a  term  'rash'  that  encompassed  all  the appropriate MedDRA preferred terms that could be ascribed to rash-related terms. This was done to avoid underestimating the effect of erlotinib on skin disorders by diluting the incidence across multiple preferred terms. An overview of the MedDRA preferred terms which were included in the composite 'rash' term is shown in Table 8.

## Spanish Lung Cancer Group (SLCG) data (Rosell et al., N Engl J Med (2009), 361:958-67.)

Safety data from the SLCG screening feasibility trial were described in the publication by Rosell et al, 2009. The most common AEs were skin rash, reported in 151 patients (69.6%) and diarrhoea reported in 95 patients (43.8%). The majority of AEs were grade 1 or grade 2 in severity. Grade 3 skin toxicity was recorded in 16 patients (7.4%) and grade 3 diarrhoea reported in 8 patients (3.7%). At the time of the analysis for the publication, no patients had been withdrawn as a result of an adverse event. One subject was diagnosed with interstitial lung  disease  (ILD)  1  month  after  initiation  of  treatment with  erlotinib.  Erlotinib  treatment  was  temporarily  interrupted  and  the  event  resolved  following corticosteroid therapy.

## Pooled Analysis of Published Clinical Trial Data (Paz-Ares et al., J. Cell. Moll. Med. Vol 14, N01-2, 2010 pp. 51-69 )

No safety information was available for this study.

## CALGB30406 Phase II study (Janne et al., J Clin Oncol 28:7s, 2010)

Safety data from the CALGB30406 trial were reported for all patients irrespective of EGFR mutation status.  Of  the  82  patients  receiving  erlotinib  single  agent  therapy,  32  patients  were  identified  with EGFR  mutations  while  of  the  100  patients  receiving  erlotinib  plus  chemotherapy,  35  patients  were identified with EGFR mutations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were the only safety data reported in the CALGB30406 study comparing firstline erlotinib therapy alone or in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC . In the erlotinib arm, grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities were reported by 1 and 0 patients, respectively  (1%  of  patients  overall).  In  the  erlotinib  plus  chemotherapy  arm,  Grade  3  or  4 hematologic toxicities were reported in 28 and 20 patients, respectively (28% of patients overall). Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicities were reported by 17 and 2 patients, respectively, treated with single  agent  erlotinib  (17%  overall).  In  the  erlotinib  plus  chemotherapy  arm,  Grade  3  or  4  nonhematologic toxicities were reported in 39 and 11 patients, respectively (50% overall).

## Phase II study (Laskin et al. 2009)

No safety information was available for this study.

## OPTIMAL Study (ML20981)

The safety data confirm the favourable safety profile of erlotinib,  with  a lower  incidence  of  adverse events and serious adverse events vs. carb/gem. A summary of safety data is provided in table 9. No unexpected adverse events or interstitial lung disease-like events were reported in either arm.

<!-- image -->

At the time of the data cut-off for the safety analysis of OPTIMAL study, a total of 72 patients (86.7%) in  the  erlotinib  treatment  arm  and  69  patients  (95.8%)  in  the  chemotherapy  treatment  arm  had reported at least one adverse event of any grade. The most common all grade AEs (  10% incidence) in patients receiving erlotinib were skin rash (56 patients, 67.5%), ALT increased (25 patients, 30.1%) and diarrhoea (20 patients, 24.1%). In patients in the chemotherapy arm, the most common AEs were thrombocytopenia  (46  patients,  63.9%),  neutropenia  (49  patients,  68.1%),  anaemia  (52  patients,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

72.2%), fatigue (15 patients, 20.8%), skin rash (14 patients, 19.4%) and ALT increased (24 patients, 33.3%).  Most  patients  experienced  at  least  one  AE  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to study  treatment  (66  patients,  79.5%  in  the  erlotinib  treatment  arm  and  68  patients,  94.4%  in  the chemotherapy arm).

Grade  3 AEs were experienced by 13 patients (15.7%) in the erlotinib treatment arm and 45 patients (62.5%)  in  the  chemotherapy  arm,  the  most  common  event  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  being neutropenia (29 patients, 40.3%) and thrombocytopenia (28 patients, 38.9%). The only Grade  3 AE reported by more than one patient each in the erlotinib treatment arm was ALT increased (3 patients; 3.6%).

Ten patients in each treatment arm experienced a serious adverse event during study treatment. In 2 erlotinib  treated  patients  and  all  10  chemotherapy-treated  patients,  the  serious  adverse  event  was considered related to treatment by the investigator.

Dose  reduction  was  reported  for  5  patients  in  the  erlotinib  arm  (6.0%)  and  28  patients  in  the chemotherapy arm (38.9%). In the eroltinib arm, 4 patients had a dose reduction due to elevated ALT levels and one patient had a dose reduction due to stomatitis.

##  Laboratory findings

In  the  TARGET,  BO18192  and  ML20981  studies,  standard  haematology,  biochemistry  and  urinalysis tests  were  performed. All  safety  laboratory  assessments  were  performed locally. Although abnormal laboratory test parameter data were recorded, separate analyses of these data for patients with EGFR mutated tumours were not available from the studies included in this submission.

##  Safety in special populations

No new information is available.

##  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No new information is available.

##  Discontinuation / interruption / dose reductions due to AES

Dose  reductions/interruptions  for  AEs  were  permitted  to  take  place  at  any  time  during  each  of  the TARGET  and  BO18192  studies.  In  the  event  of  a  dose-limiting  toxicity  that  was  not  controlled  by optimal supportive care, or not tolerated due to symptomatology, disfigurement, or interference with normal daily activities, regardless of severity, the daily dose of erlotinib was to be decreased initially by 50 mg/day. Within 2 weeks following a dose reduction, the erlotinib related toxicity had to improve by at least one NCI-CTC grade and be NCI-CTC Grade &lt; 2, or further dose reduction by 50 mg/day was required. Dosing was permitted to be interrupted for a maximum of 2 weeks if clinically indicated and if the toxicity was not controlled by optimal supportive medication.

In particular, erlotinib dosage modification for drug-related diarrhoea and rash was permitted. Once a patient had a dose reduction for toxicity, the dose was not re-escalated, except in the case of erlotinibrelated  rash.  In  TARGET  and  study  BO18192,  in  the  event  of  rash,  the  dose  could  be  re-escalated when the rash was Grade ≤ 2.

In study ML20981, dose adjustments were to be considered in the event of grade 3-4 rash or diarrhoea not controlled by the active internal medicine, or for other grade 3-4 AEs. For skin rash or diarrhoea, re-medication was considered after recovery to grade 1 or less and with the dose of erlotinib reduced by 50 mg/day. For other AEs after temporary interruption of treatment, re-medication was considered with a dose reduction of 50 mg after the recovery of the toxicity. In the event of a suspected ILD, erlotinib was to be stopped immediately and only re-started if a diagnosis of ILD was not confirmed.

##  Post marketing experience

Post marketing data are of minor relevance for the current application as they are not linked to the underlying mutational status.

## Discussion on clinical safety

Safety data have been reported in the Spanish study by Rosell et al. As expected, the most common AEs were skin rash, reported in 69.6% of patients and diarrhoea reported in 43.8% of patients. The majority of AEs were grade 1 or grade 2 in severity. Grade 3 skin toxicity was recorded in 16 patients (7.4%) and grade 3 diarrhoea reported in 8 patients (3.7%). Unfortunately, the safety analysis was performed  for  all  patients  irrespective  of  line  of  therapy  why  it  is  of  limited  value  in  the evaluation  of  the  safety  of  erlotinib  as  first  line  therapy  in  NSCLC  patients  with  tumours bearing EGFR mutations. No safety data was available from the pooled study by Paz-Arez et al.

Further  evidence  comes  from  the  prospectively  conducted  pivotal  EURTAC  study  that  included  75 erlotinib-treated  patients  in  the  safety  analysis  population.  In  this  study,  almost  all  patients  treated experienced AEs. Common AEs associated with erlotinib were diarrhoea, rash, infections (paronychia and  folliculitis),  cough  and  dyspnea.  More  patients  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  experienced  severe events grade ≥ 3) (66.2%) than in the erlotinib arm (41.3%). The most common severe events in the erlotinib arm were infections followed by gastrointestinal disorders and general disorders like asthenia.

The frequency of SAEs was similar between treatment arms (25.7% of patients in the chemotherapy arm vs. 26.7% in the erlotinib arm) but their nature differed.  In the erlotinib arm, only 5 events were considered  to  be  treatment-related  (diarrhea,  respiratory  tract  infection,  hepatotoxitiy  (grade  5), hyperbiliruminaemia, lung disorder).

The overall safety profile of erlotinib given as 1 st   line  therapy in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutated tumours is considered consistent with the known safety profile of erlotinib described in later lines of therapy where only a minority of patients happened to harbour EGFR mutations. The most commonly reported AEs in the 1 st line setting in patients with activating mutations were rash and diarrhoea and the  safety  profile  was  overall  manageable,  although  serious  or  severe  events  did  occur,  demanding dose reductions or interruptions. The discontinuation rate was low. No new safety signals have been identified.  Similarly,  EGFR  mutation  status  has  not  been  found  to  correlate  with  the  frequency  or severity of AEs during gefitinib treatment. There is no indication of a different safety profile of erlotinib in Caucasians compared to Asians why safety results from studies of Asian origin could be extrapolated to European populations. The MAH has not investigated whether a reduced erlotinib dose could actually 'suffice' in the treatment of patients with EGFR activating mutations, but the proposed dosage is wellcharacterized, and the safety profile is considered acceptable although adverse events of erlotinib are not negligible.

## Pharmacovigilance system

## Risk Management Plan

The MAH submitted a revised version of the risk management plan (version 3.1) which is considered adequate by the CHMP. The experience with Tarceva in both clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting is large and most side effects have been detected by now.

The  safety  specification  is  adequate,  and  a  new  identified  risk  has  been  added  to  the  list  of  risks associated with Tarceva use. A drug-drug interaction with statins is a newly identified risk of Tarceva. This new risk is proposed to be handled by routine pharmacovigilance, and depending on the data the need  for  risk  minimisation  measures  will  be  evaluated.  The  rest  of  the  pharmacovigilance  plan  is adequate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regarding risk minimisation, the MAH has generally proposed to use the product information. This is endorsed; therefore the RMP is relevant and adequate to cover the extension of indication. No further actions are warranted at this time.

## 3. 4. Anti- EGFR Class labelling requested by the PhVWP/CHMP

The Pharmacovigilance Working Party was requested by CHMP to consider whether a review of reports of keratitis and ulcerative keratitis should be undertaken, with a view to possible harmonisation of the PI for the EGFR inhibitor class of products.

A review of reports of ocular toxicity associated with other EGFR inhibitors on the EudraVigilance database has revealed that cases of keratitis and ulcerative keratitis have been reported in association with the use of all marketed EGFR inhibitors. Consideration should therefore be given to harmonisation of the PI for the EGFR inhibitor class of products.

The PhVWP considered the number of reports of keratitis and ulcerative keratitis across the EGFR class and agreed that warnings about keratitis and ulcerative keratitis should be updated across the class as follows:

'Patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis such as acute or worsening: eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye should be referred promptly to an ophthalmology specialist.

If a diagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is confirmed, treatment with TRADENAME should be interrupted or discontinued. If keratitis is diagnosed, the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be carefully considered.

Tarceva should be used with caution in patients with a history of keratitis, ulcerative keratitis or severe dry eye. Contact lens use is also a risk factor for keratitis and ulceration.'

This information was reflected in the SmPC section 4.4 and in the Package Leaflet sections 2 and 4.

## 4. Benefit risk assessment

## Benefits

The EURTAC study is the first prospectively conducted, relatively large randomized, unblinded phase III trial comparing the efficacy of erlotinib to a standard platinum-based doublet regimen in the 1 st line treatment of patients with EGFR activating mutations in Europe.

Following review of the interim analysis results of the EURTAC study, the IDMC recommended stopping of the trial after demonstration of a substantial benefit of erlotinib over chemotherapy. At the time the HR for PFS was 0.42 (95% CI 0.27-0.64, p&lt;0.0001) which corresponds to a 58 % reduction in the risk of progression or death. The Kaplan- Meier curves make a clear and early separation. The median PFS for patients in the chemotherapy arm was 5.2 months vs. 9.7 months in the erlotinib arm resulting in an absolute gain of 4.5 months in median PFS in erlotinib-treated patients. This is considered a highly clinically relevant gain in PFS. The robustness of the result was confirmed in a number of sensitivity analyses,  sufficient  reassurance  has  been  provided  regarding  the  independent  review  process  and consistent results were found in subgroups with an acceptable sample size.

Results from supportive trials and published literature confirm the findings of the EURTAC study.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

N/A.

## Unfavourable effects

In  conclusion,  the  overall  safety  profile  of  erlotinib  given  as  1 st line  therapy  in  NSCLC  patients  with EGFR mutated tumours is considered consistent with the known safety profile of erlotinib described in later lines of therapy where only a minority of patients happened to harbour EGFR mutations. The most commonly  reported  AEs  in  the  1 st line  setting  in  patients  with  activating  mutations  were  rash  and diarrhoea and the safety profile was overall manageable, although serious or severe events did occur, demanding dose reductions or interruptions. The discontinuation rate was low. No new safety signals have been identified.

## Benefit-risk balance

The  benefit  of  erlotinib  in  terms  of  PFS  compared  to  standard  chemotherapy  regimens  as  first  line therapy  of  patients  with  activating  EGFR  mutations  is  considered  to  be  clinically  relevant  and  well documented.

The safety profile of erlotinib is considered acceptable, well-characterized and distinct from the wellknown  safety  profile  of  standard  chemotherapies.  The  oral  administration  of  erlotinib  provides convenience to the patient.

## Conclusion

Based  on  the  review  of  the  data  on  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  variation application EMEA/H/C/000618/II/0020 for extending the indication of Tarceva (erlotinib) for the firstline  treatment  of  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  with  activating EGFR mutations, is approvable.

## 5. Conclusion

On 21 July 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet.
