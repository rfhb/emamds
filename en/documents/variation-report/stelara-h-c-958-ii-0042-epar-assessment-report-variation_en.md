## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Ustekinumab is a first-in-class fully human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody to human interleukin (IL)-12/23p40 that binds with specificity to human IL-12 and IL-23 and neutralizes their bioactivity by preventing these cytokines from binding to their IL-12 receptor beta-1 receptor protein expressed on the surface of immune cells. The molecular weight of ustekinumab is approximately 148,600 Daltons. Ustekinumab is a selective immunosuppressant classified according to the proposed Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification system as an Interleukin Inhibitor.

Ustekinumab (Stelara) was approved in the EU on 16 January 2009 for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Since the first approval of ustekinumab in Canada (12 December 2008), it has received marketing approval globally, including other countries in North America, as well as Europe, South America, and the Asia-Pacific region, for the treatment of adult patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis. Ustekinumab is approved in single-use vial and prefilled syringe presentations. The recommended adult dosages for subcutaneous (SC) administration are 45 mg (for patients with body weight ≤ 100 kg) and 90 mg (for patients with body weight &gt;100 kg) at Weeks 0 and 4, respectively, followed by every 12 week doses.

Psoriasis is a chronic, immunologically mediated, inflammatory skin disease of unknown etiology affecting approximately 2 to 3% of the world's population. Approximately 35% of adults with psoriasis report signs and symptoms before the age of 20. An analysis performed using The Health Improvement Network database in the United Kingdom, estimated based on medical records that the prevalence of psoriasis in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age was 94.13 per 10,000 patients. The general consensus is that paediatric psoriasis is probably most accurately characterized as early onset disease rather than as an entity distinct from adult psoriasis.

Psoriasis can have a negative impact on quality of life and psychosocial health. A stepped therapeutic strategy similar to that used in adult patients with psoriasis has been employed in paediatric patients. Topical treatments (steroids, tar, anthralin, calcipotriene, and tazarotene) are commonly used although many of these treatments are not approved for use in children, and are generally not effective for treating more severe forms of the disease. Topical steroids can be associated with skin atrophy, striae, suppression of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, and tachyphylaxis. Phototherapy, particularly ultraviolet B (UVB), is administered to treat moderate to severe paediatric psoriasis but is inconvenient, often difficult to administer in children, and may be associated with long-term skin cancer risks.

Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who do not respond adequately to phototherapy, or who cannot utilize it for a variety of possible reasons, may be treated with conventional systemic agents such as acitretin, MTX, or cyclosporine. However, none of these agents have been rigorously studied in randomized clinical trials in the paediatric psoriasis population and none are currently approved for use in paediatric psoriasis throughout Europe.

Methotrexate is currently the most commonly used systemic treatment for paediatric psoriasis, based primarily on the availability of safety information from its use in paediatric rheumatologic diseases. Side effects include nausea and headache, and use of MTX requires monitoring of blood counts, liver enzymes and renal function.

Most of the other biologic therapies currently approved to treat plaque psoriasis in adults (infliximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab) are not approved for use in paediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. At the time of submission of this application Etanercept [Enbrel] was the only biologic therapy that had received

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

approval in the EU for use in paediatric patients. Etanercept is indicated for the treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents ≥ 6 years of age who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, topical agents and other systemic therapies or phototherapies. Etanercept is administered by once weekly injections.

Therefore, although stepwise therapy is mentioned frequently in the literature, the optimal treatment approach for paediatric patients with moderate to severe psoriasis is less clear than for adults due to the known risks of systemic therapies and the lack of rigorous clinical data or approved therapeutic options for this age group. For these reasons, a proportion of paediatric patients with moderate to severe psoriasis are currently relatively undertreated, and could benefit from additional safe, effective, and convenient therapies.

The applicant has conducted a Phase 3 clinical study (CNTO1275PSO3006 [CADMUS]) to assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of ustekinumab in paediatric subjects ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years of age with plaque-type moderate to severe psoriasis. The data from CNTO1275PSO3006 forms the basis of this variation, and is augmented with information from several key adult psoriasis clinical trials, to facilitate comparisons of the paediatric results with the more extensive adult psoriasis data.

The indication applied for by the MAH at the time of submission of the variation application was: ' Treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in paediatric patients from the age of 12 years and older, who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies'.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

No environmental risk assessment has been provided in accordance with the CHMP guidance EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 as proteins are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.&gt;

## 2.3.2.1. Paediatric study CNTO1275PSO3006

## Rationale for dose selection

In the adult population, no clinically meaningful impact of age on the PK of ustekinumab was observed. Moreover, metabolism of immunoglobulins was not thought to be different in the adolescent population, so it was reasonable to anticipate that the PK of ustekinumab in the adolescent population would be similar to the PK in the adult population. Furthermore, there was an exposure-response relationship between serum ustekinumab levels and clinical response in adult subjects with psoriasis, and given the concept that paediatric and adult psoriasis is essentially one disease and that paediatric psoriasis is best characterized as early onset psoriasis, therefore it was reasonable to believe that adolescent subjects who attain similar serum levels of ustekinumab would likewise experience a similar clinical response, and a similar PK-PD relationship would be observed. If the exposure-response relationship was as projected, a dosage achieving similar exposures in the adolescent population would be expected to result in efficacy levels comparable to those observed in the adult population.

Since limited data from subjects with a body weight ≤ 60 kg were available in the 2 pivotal Phase 3 adult studies (C0743T08/C0743T09) and ustekinumab had not been tested in subjects with a body weight &lt;37.4 kg, body weight adjusted doses were considered to be appropriate for subjects with a body weight ≤ 60 kg. This weight-adjusted approach was further justified by the body weight adjusted clearance of infliximab (another IgG-based mAb) for adolescent subjects from ≤ 12 to &lt;18 years of age. For subjects weighing ≤ 60 kg, the standard dosage (0.75 mg/kg) was chosen based on adjusting the 45 mg dose to body weight (45 mg/60 kg) and the half-standard dosage (0.375 mg/kg) was chosen based on adjusting a 22.5 mg dose to body weight (22.5 mg/60 kg).

The standard dosage was intended to provide ustekinumab exposure in the adolescent psoriasis population comparable to that achieved in the adult psoriasis population with the approved adult dosage. The half-standard dosage was intended to provide ustekinumab exposure comparable to half of the approved psoriasis adult dosage, and was included to allow the ustekinumab PK-PD relationship between adult and adolescent psoriasis to be better defined, so that an appropriate adolescent psoriasis dosage approach could be efficiently determined.

## Bioanalytical methods for serum ustekinumab concentration

For the paediatric psoriasis study CNTO1275PSO3006, serum ustekinumab concentrations were determined by a validated ECLIA method using the MSD ®  platform (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The below the lowest quantifiable sample concentration of the assay (BQL) of the MSD ®  ECLIA was &lt;0.16880 μ g/mL.

Venous blood samples for measuring serum ustekinumab concentrations for PK analysis were collected at Weeks 0, 4, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 40, 52, and 60. At visits when study agent was administered, the sample was collected prior to administration.

For the earlier global adult psoriasis Phase 3 studies C0743T08 (through Week 76) and C0743T09 (through Week 88), serum ustekinumab concentrations were measured by a validated ECLIA on the BioVeris ™ platform (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The BQL of the BioVeris ™ ECLIA was &lt;0.17000 μ g/mL. Because the vendor discontinued support for the BioVeris ™ ECLIA platform, the validated ECLIA method on the MSD ® platform was subsequently used to determine serum ustekinumab concentrations in samples collected after Week 76 in C0743T08, after Week 88 in C0743T09, and from all subsequent studies of ustekinumab, including the paediatric psoriasis study CNTO1275PSO3006 and the regional adult psoriasis studies C0743T23 and C0743T25.

In the cross-validation comparison of the 2 methods, the results generated using the MSD® ECLIA were generally higher compared with the results generated using the BioVeris ™ ECLIA.

## Serum ustekinumab concentrations by dosage

Median serum ustekinumab concentration (micrograms/mL) through week 52; subjects treated with ustekinumab who were randomised to ustekinumab groups at week 0 is shown in the below figure:

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Dose-proportionality in serum ustekinumab concentration was generally observed when comparing mean or median serum ustekinumab concentrations between the half-standard dosage and standard dosage groups. Mean serum ustekinumab concentrations in the standard dosage group were 1.4 to 3.2-fold higher than those at each respective sampling timepoint in the half-standard dosage group, and median serum ustekinumab concentrations in the standard dosage group were 1.7 to 2.3-fold higher than those at each respective sampling time-point in the half-standard dosage group.

Steady state was achieved at Week 28 for the half-standard dosage and standard dosage groups and median steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations at Week 28 were 0.21 μ g/mL and 0.46 μ g/mL, respectively, for the half-standard dosage and standard dosage groups. Mean or median trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were generally maintained at steady state from Week 28 through Week 52. There was no evidence of accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentrations over time.

The number of subjects included in the summary for serum ustekinumab concentrations decreased over time. This was primarily the result of the exclusion of PK data following a change from mg/kg dosages to fixed dosages that was necessitated by an increase in subjects ' body weight from ≤ 60 kg at baseline to &gt;60 kg at later visits as the study progressed, or the loss of subjects who discontinued study agent.

Median serum ustekinumab concentration (micrograms/mL) through week 52; subjects treated with ustekinumab who were randomised to placebo at week 0 is shown in the below figure:

Median (IQ Range) Serum Ustekinumab Concentration (μg/mL)

<!-- image -->

The mean or median serum ustekinumab concentrations at Weeks 28, 40, and 52 in the placebo → half-standard dosage group were generally comparable to those at Weeks 16, 28, and 40, respectively, in subjects who were originally randomized to the half-standard dosage group. The mean or median serum ustekinumab concentrations at Weeks 28, 40, and 52 in the placebo → standard dosage group were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

generally slightly higher than those at Weeks 16, 28, and 40, respectively, in subjects who were originally randomized to the standard dosage group.

## Serum ustekinumab levels below the lowest quantifiable concentration

At weeks 28, 40, and 52, higher proportions of subjects with BQL trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were observed in the half-standard dosage group compared with the standard dosage group. For example, at Week 28 (trough), 37.9% of subjects in the half-standard dosage group had BQL serum ustekinumab concentrations versus 16.1% of subjects in the standard dosage group. A similar pattern was seen in subjects who crossed over from placebo.

## Serum ustekinumab concentrations by body weight

Only 3 subjects (1 each in the half-standard dosage 45 mg, standard dosage 90 mg, and placebo → standard dosage 90 mg groups) had body weight &gt;100 kg at baseline. Therefore, the comparisons of serum ustekinumab concentrations by body weight category were focused on subjects with body weight ≤ 60 kg and those with body weight &gt;60 kg to ≤ 100 kg at baseline.

Median serum ustekinumab concentration (micrograms/mL) through week 52 by weight at week 0; treated subjects randomised to ustekinumab half-standard dosage at week 0 is shown in the below figure:

UstekinumabStandardDosage

<!-- image -->

Similar serum concentrations were observed for subjects with a body weight of ≤60kg at baseline treated with a weight-based dosing compared with those whose body weight was &gt; 60kg to ≤100 kg at baseline treated with the fixed dosage as evidenced by the substantial overlap of the corresponding IQ ranges of serum ustekinumab concentrations at each respective time point between the 2 body-weight groups.

However, within each dosage group (half-standard or standard dosage) median serum ustekinumab concentrations in subjects with a body weight ≤60kg at baseline treated with a weight-based dosage were slightly higher than those levels observed at some respective time points in subjects with a body weight &gt;60 kg to 100 kg at baseline treated with a fixed dosage.

## Comparison across study CNTO1275PSO3006 and adult psoriasis studies

The MAH has stated that cross comparisons of serum ustekinumab concentrations across the 2 pivotal adult clinical trials (C0743T08/C0743T09) are complicated by the following 2 issues:

- The change is assay platform from that initially used for the 2 adult pivotal global Phase 3 studies (BioVeris) to the new assay platform. As noted above, in a cross-validation comparison of the 2 methods, the results generated using the MSD ECLIA were generally higher compared with the results generated using the BioVeris ECLIA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Body weight is an important determinant affecting serum ustekinumab concentrations. The median and inter-quartile (IQ) range of body weight in the paediatric psoriasis study are much lower than those in the 2 pivotal global adult psoriasis studies.

To try and address these issues, in addition to comparisons across the paediatric study and the 2 adult pivotal studies, the MAH has also undertaken comparisons of serum ustekinumab concentrations between CNTO1275PSO3006 and 2 regional adult Phase 3 psoriasis studies (C0743T23 and C0743T25) in adult subjects with psoriasis. In addition to utilizing the same MSD assay platform as that in CNTO1275PSO3006 to measure serum ustekinumab concentrations, the adult subjects in the regional studies C0743T23 and C0743T25 had median and IQ ranges of body weights that were closer to those for the paediatric subjects. The applicant has noted that clinical data have shown that there are generally no ethnic differences in the PK of monoclonal antibodies including ustekinumab.

In addition comparative analyses in studies C0743T08/C0743T09 have been undertaken in which the bodyweight of the reference subpopulation have been limited to closer match those seen in the paediatric trial.

In the paediatric trial serum ustekinumab concentrations were measured in samples collected at selected visits from week 0 through week 52. In the adult trials C0743T08/C0743T09 samples were collected at selected visits from week 0 through week 244. In the regional adult trials (C0743T23 and C0743T25) samples were collected at visits from week 0 through week 36. Since the study designs were the same only through week 28 across the 5 studies, serum ustekinumab concentrations through to week 28 only have been used in the comparisons.

## Comparison across CNTO1275PSO3006 and C0743T08/C0743T09

Subject weight and weight distributions were different across Phase 3 psoriasis studies. Specifically, the median (IQ range) of body weight of paediatric subjects in CNTO1275PSO3006 study (61.6 [53.2, 74.0] kg) was much lower than those of adult subjects in the global Phase 3 studies C0743T08 and C0743T09 (91.6 [76.8, 107.5] kg and 88.6 [76.0, 103.8] kg, respectively).

Therefore, comparisons of serum concentration were performed by weight strata. Since only 3 subjects were &gt;100 kg in CNTO1275PSO3006 and very few subjects were &lt;60 kg in C0743T08 and C0743T09 studies, the serum concentration comparisons between CNTO1275PSO3006 and C0743T08/C0743T09 were done for subjects &gt;60 kg to ≤ 100 kg in CNTO1275PSO3006 and ≤ 100 kg in C0743T08/C0743T09. In these comparisons, the median (IQ range) body weight was 70.2 (64.0, 83.8) kg for paediatric subjects with a body weight &gt;60 kg to ≤ 100 kg in CNTO1275PSO3006 and 82.0 (72.0, 90.7) kg for adult subjects with a body weight ≤ 100 kg in C0743T08 and C0743T09. Therefore, the median (IQ range) body weight in subjects ≤ 100 kg in C0743T08/C0743T09 were still higher than those in subjects &gt;60 kg to ≤ 100 kg in CNTO1275PSO3006.

At each respective sampling time point, median serum ustekinumab concentrations in paediatric subjects in CNTO1275PSO3006 appeared to be modestly higher than those in subjects in C0743T08 and C0743T09. This is expected since the observed differences in median serum ustekinumab concentrations between subjects in CNTO1275PSO3006 and subjects in C0743T08 and C0743T09 were confounded by the assay platform change as well as the differences in body weight between paediatric and adult subjects.

In order to better match the weight distributions between the 2 study populations, a ≤ 80 kg cut-off was chosen with data pooled from C0743T08/C074309 since this cut-off yielded a subpopulation with median (IQ range) of body weight 70.9 (63.2, 75.6) kg. It is noted that the median weight of this subpopulation in C0743T08/C0743T09 was close to that in subjects &gt;60 kg to ≤ 100 kg in CNTO1275PSO3006, although the IQ range in this subpopulation in C0743T08/C0743T09 was slightly tighter and lower than that in subjects &gt;60 kg to ≤ 100 kg in CNTO1275PSO3006

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At each respective sampling time point, median serum ustekinumab concentrations in paediatric subjects in CNTO1275PSO3006 were similar or slightly higher than those in subjects ≤ 80 kg in the combined C0743T08 and C0743T09, and IQ ranges of serum ustekinumab concentrations overlapped significantly between these 2 study subpopulations. This is expected since the weight distributions were generally similar between subjects &gt;60 kg to ≤ 100 kg in CNTO1275PSO3006 and subjects ≤ 80 kg in the combined C0743T08 and C0743T09. The magnitude of the slight differences in observed serum ustekinumab concentrations between those 2 study subpopulations is consistent with what is expected from the assay platform change.

## Comparison across CNTO1275PSO3006 and C0743T23/C0743T25

The overall median (IQ range) of body weights of paediatric subjects in CNTO1275PSO3006 study (61.6 [53.2, 74.0] kg) was closer to those of adult subjects in the regional Phase 3 studies C0743T023 and C0743T25 (70.0 [60.0, 78.0] kg and 72.0 [66.0, 79.5] kg, respectively). In addition, the median (IQ range) of body weight of paediatric subjects &gt;60 kg to ≤ 100 kg in CNTO1275PSO3006 study (70.2 kg [64.0, 83.8] kg) was similar to those in the regional Phase 3 studies C0743T023 and C0743T25. Of note, very limited number of subjects had a body weight &gt;100 kg in C0743T23 and C0743T25. Therefore, the comparisons of serum ustekinumab concentrations between paediatric subjects and those from C0743T23/C0743T25 were made for paediatric subjects &gt;60 kg to ≤ 100 kg in CNTO1275PSO3006 and the whole study population from C0743T23/C0743T25.

Paediatric subjects with a body weight &gt;60 kg to ≤ 100 kg treated with the standard 45 mg dosage in CNTO1275PSO3006 achieved comparable systemic exposure to ustekinumab to that observed in adult subjects with psoriasis treated with the approved 45 mg dosage in C0743T23 and C0743T25. At each respective sampling time point, median serum ustekinumab concentrations were similar and IQ ranges of serum ustekinumab concentrations overlapped between pediatric subjects with a body weight &gt;60 kg to ≤ 100 kg treated with the standard 45 mg dosage and adult subjects treated with the approved 45 mg dosage. These comparisons of PK, which are based on serum concentration results from the same bioanalytical assay platform, provide additional evidence that the standard 45 mg dosage for paediatric subjects with a body

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

weight &gt;60 kg to ≤ 100 kg can achieve a similar exposure to that achieved in adults with a similar body weight treated with the approved 45 mg dosage.

## PK Modelling

In addition to the analyses described above, a population PK modelling and simulation approach was also used to analyse the PK data from the paediatric study and the 2 adult global pivotal psoriasis studies since the non-linear mixed effect modelling (NONMEM) approach is capable of adjusting the differences in the assay platform and body weight across studies in the analysis.

The primary goal of the simulations was to confirm whether the systemic exposure to ustekinumab in paediatric patients with psoriasis across different body weight categories following the proposed paediatric dosages was similar to that in adults who received the approved dosages of ustekinumab.

## Immunogenicity

In study CNTO1275PSO3006, the presence of antibodies to ustekinumab in serum samples was determined by a newly developed, more sensitive and drug-tolerant ECLIA on the MSD platform. This new assay was developed to substantially reduce ustekinumab interference in the detection of antibodies to ustekinumab in human serum samples. The maximum observed sensitivity of the ECLIA for antibodies to ustekinumab was 1.97 ng/mL in human serum. It was verified that the presence of ustekinumab in serum at the concentration levels studied did not interfere with the ECLIA for antibodies to ustekinumab, and 50 ng/mL of antibodies to ustekinumab could be detected in the presence of up to 100 μ g/mL of ustekinumab in human serum.

In the earlier global and regional Phase 3 adult psoriasis studies, a bridging EIA was used to detect antibodies to ustekinumab in serum. The maximum observed sensitivity of the EIA was 125 ng/mL in human serum, and 50 ng/mL of antibodies to ustekinumab could be detected in the presence of up to 7 ng/mL (i.e., 0.007 μ g/mL) of ustekinumab in human serum. Therefore, the detection of antibodies to ustekinumab using the original EIA method was subject to interference by the presence of ustekinumab in the serum samples for immunogenicity analysis.

In order to more meaningfully compare the immunogenicity rates across studies, the original EIA method was also used to detect antibodies to ustekinumab in serum collected from CNTO1275PSO3006.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Incidence of antibodies in study CNTO1275PSO3006

## ECLIA method

All 110 subjects treated with ustekinumab had post-treatment serum samples that were evaluable for antibodies to ustekinumab. With the ECLIA method the combined incidence of antibodies to ustekinumab was 8.2% (n=9) across all ustekinumab-treated subjects (10.7% [n=6] in the half-standard dosage groups and 5.6% [n=3] the standard dosage groups).

The titers of antibodies to ustekinumab ranged from 1:100 to 1:204,800. Seven of the 9 antibody positive subjects had titer levels ≤ 1:800. The 2 subjects with antibody titer levels of 1:12,800 and 1:204,800, respectively, were in the half-standard dosage group.

## EIA method

With the bridging EIA method, the overall incidence of antibodies to ustekinumab across all treatment groups through Week 60 was 1.8% (n=2). Both subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab (with the highest antibody titers of 1:320 and 1:2,560, respectively) were subjects originally randomized to the ustekinumab half-standard dosage group.

The samples positive for antibodies to ustekinumab with the bridging EIA method were also positive for antibodies to ustekinumab with the ECLIA method.

tSubjects with appropriate samples had one or more samples obtained afer their first ustekinumab administration.

Dosage ineachstudy wasmultiple doses:dosagegroupsinclude all subjectswhoreceived ustekinumab at any time.

The original enzyme immunoassay(EIA)was used to detect antibodies to ustekinumab.

Last visit assessed for antibodiestoustekinumab:Week52.

Last visit assessed for antibodies to ustekinumab: Week 60.

Last visit assessed for antibodies to ustekinumab:Week 36.

* The incidences of antibodies to ustekinumab were summarized through Week 60 for CNTO1275PSO3006, through Week 52 for C0743T08/C0743T09, and through Week 36 for C0743T23/C0743T25

In C0743T08, only 1 additional subject became positive for antibodies to ustekinumab between Week 76 and Year 3 with increased exposure to ustekinumab. In C0743T09, no additional subject became positive for antibodies to ustekinumab between Week 52 and Year 5 despite continued exposure to ustekinumab. The results from C0743T08 and C0743T09 studies suggest that subjects who develop antibodies to ustekinumab

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

will do so within the first year of study, while subjects who do not develop antibodies in the first year of treatment are unlikely to do so with long-term maintenance therapy.

With the bridging EIA method, the incidence of antibodies to ustekinumab was consistently low across paediatric and adult psoriasis studies (1.8% in paediatrics as compared with 2.3% to 5.4% in adults).

## Neutralising antibodies

In the paediatric study all 9 ADA-positive subjects in the ECLIA assay were evaluable for NAbs. Of the 9 subjects, 3 (33.3%) were positive for NAbs and 6 (66.7%) were negative for NAbs. Samples that were assessed as negative for Nabs uniformly presented lower ADA titers (titer levels ≤ 1:800). The 2 subjects positive for antibodies to ustekinumab in the EIA assay were both positive for Nabs.

## Antibodies to ustekinumab and pharmacokinetics

In CNTO1275PSO3006, the small number of subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab in each treatment group limited interpretation of these data regarding the impact of antibodies to ustekinumab on the PK of ustekinumab.

In C0743T08 and C0743T09, subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab had generally lower median serum ustekinumab concentrations through Week 52 compared with subjects who were not positive for antibodies to ustekinumab. In C0743T23 and C0743T25, the median serum ustekinumab concentrations in subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab were lower compared with those in subjects who were negative for antibodies to ustekinumab.

## Biomarker analysis

Analyses of biomarkers were based on all treated subjects who received at least 1 dose of study agent.

The effect of ustekinumab treatment on circulating immune cells was analyzed at Week 12 and at Week 52 and compared with baseline. The immune cells measured, defined by their corresponding cell surface markers, were as follows:

- CD3+ (T cells)
- CD4+ (T helper cells)
- CD8+ (Cytotoxic T cells)
- CD3+CD4+CD8+ (Double positive T cells)
- CD4+/CD8+ (ratio of T helper/cytotoxic T cells)
- CD3+CD56+ (NK-like T cells)
- CD16+CD56+ (NK cells)
- CD19+ (B cells)
- CD3+/CD19+ (ratio of T/B cells)

The mean and median percentages of each cell type were summarized by randomized treatment group. Overall, no change from baseline at Week 12 or Week 52 in mean or median percentage of total T cells, T helper or cytotoxic T cells, or B cells was observed. NK-like T cells and NK cells showed a reduction in mean or median percentage of cells by Week 12 in subjects treated with ustekinumab which was not dose-responsive and did not demonstrate further reduction at Week 52.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The range of NK cells and NK-like T cells are within the range reported in healthy adults. NK-like T cells are a small percentage of total T cells and as such large variability can be seen in the reported range of CD3+ CD56+ cells in adults with no reference ranges available for adolescents.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The benefit risk of ustekinumab in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients has been well defined. Given the general consensus that paediatric psoriasis is probably most accurately characterized as early onset disease rather than as an entity distinct from adult psoriasis, it was expected that paediatric patients would have a similar clinical response to ustekinumab to adults. A key objective of the MAH's development program for ustekinumab use in the paediatric population aged 12 to less than 18 years was therefore defining a paediatric dosage regimen that would be safe and effective and could provide systemic exposure to ustekinumab similar to that in adults.

In the paediatric study CNTO1275PSO3006 two dosage regimens were used; a standard dosage that was intended to provide ustekinumab exposure in the adolescent psoriasis population comparable to that achieved in the adult psoriasis population with the approved adult dosage; and a half-standard dosage that was intended to provide ustekinumab exposure comparable to half of the approved psoriasis adult dosage, and was included to allow the ustekinumab PK-PD relationship between adult and adolescent psoriasis patients to be better defined. A fixed dosage regimen, as used in adults, was used for patients weighing &gt;60kg to 100kg (and those &gt;100kg). A weight-based dosing regimen was used in patients weighing 60kg or less.

The serum ustekinumab concentrations were generally higher in the placebo to standard dosage group compared with those subjects who were originally randomised to the standard dosage group. The MAH clarified that the covariates (weight, immune response and history of diabetes) as significant in the population PK model do not explain the difference in serum concentrations but rather that this is due to the small sample size and high inter-individual variability and therefore is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. This was agreed by the CHMP.

During the procedure the MAH provided comparative data from the 4 adult psoriasis clinical trials with regards to the proportions of subjects with serum ustekinumab levels below the lowest quantifiable concentration at measured time points including week 28 (i.e. when steady state is reached). The data showed that the percentage of subjects with serum ustekinumab levels below the lowest quantifiable concentration was similar in the 60-100 kg paediatric subjects to that seen in adults, but lower in &lt;60 kg subjects. The CHMP considered that this is consistent with the slightly higher exposure seen in these subjects.

The CHMP considered that the strategy based on weight based dosing in subjects less than 60kg is intended to minimise exposure in these lighter patients. Whilst it was acknowledged that there is substantive overlap of the corresponding IQ ranges of serum ustekinumab concentrations at each respective time point between the 2 body-weight groups, it was noted that within each dosage group (half-standard or standard dosage) median serum ustekinumab concentrations in subjects with a body weight ≤60kg at baseline treated with a weight-based dosage were slightly higher than those levels observed at some respective time points in subjects with a body weight &gt;60 kg to 100 kg at baseline treated with a fixed dosage.

A comparison of the standard dosage PK data from the paediatric study with the 2 adult global pivotal psoriasis trials (C0743T08/C0743T09) suggested a rather higher exposure for both the weight based dosing in those subjects ≤60 kg and for fixed doses of 45 mg in those greater than 60 kg. The MAH suggested that this can be explained by the difference in the assay used to measure serum ustekinumab concentrations in the paediatric vs the adult studies, and also due to the higher weight distributions in the adult studies. To account for the weight differences between these studies the MAH has undertaken an analysis of the data in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the paediatric subjects with a weight &gt;60 kg to ≤100 kg and adult subjects with a body weight ≤80 kg. In this analysis the magnitude of difference in the exposures is less and the MAH argued the slight differences are consistent with what is expected from the assay platform change. As the assay used in the regional Asian adult psoriasis studies was the same as that used in the paediatric study and the weight distributions of these adult studies was closer to that in the paediatric study (particularly the median [IQ range] of body weight of paediatric subjects with a weight &gt;60 kg to ≤100 kg) a comparison of the serum ustekinumab concentrations was undertaken across these 3 studies and shows exposure data that is more similar. The difficulties in comparing the adult data from the 2 adult global pivotal trials in psoriasis (C0743T08/C0743T09) due to differences in the assay used to measure serum ustekinumab concentrations and differences in the weight distributions between the paediatric and adult studies is acknowledged. However, whilst the additional analysis undertaken by the MAH, particularly those in the 2 regional adult studies (C0743T23/C0743T25) provided some assurance, further information was required during the procedure to provide adequate re-assurance that the exposure in paediatric subjects aged 12 to less than 18y at the proposed standard dosage results in acceptably comparable exposure data to that seen in the approved adult dosage. During the procedure, the MAH clarified that due to the differences in the study designs post 28 weeks, it was not possible to compare exposures post this time. The MAH also suggested that in the 5 year long term phase 3 studies, the PK was maintained. The CHMP considered that a discussion on the data that is available in those adults who have undergone consistent dosing post 12 weeks should have been provided, however the CHMP agreed that the 5 year data does show a consistency of plasma concentrations with time, similar to that has seen at later time point in the paediatric study.

The model used in the population pharmacokinetic analysis incorporated the possible effect of difference in the assay methodology and weight on the pharmacokinetics and as such provided good supporting data for a similarity in exposure between adults and children. A comparison of the trough concentrations predicted from the model seems in good agreement with those observed however Cmax could not be compared. During the procedure the MAH clarified that the Cmax values were not available due to the sparse sampling used in the paediatric studies and this was accepted by the CHMP. An analysis based on Cpeak from the population analysis was provided and considered as supportive data however the model was not fully assessed and the visual predictive checks and simulations showed some evidence of under-prediction of plasma concentrations in adolescents and not considered sufficient in isolation. However the MAH provided an analysis based on 4 week data which was regarded by CHMP as good approximate of the Cmax.

A newer, more sensitive, and drug-tolerant ECLIA method has been developed and used in the paediatric trial to detect antibodies to ustekinumab. The overall incidence of antibodies through week 60 in the paediatric trial was low (1.8% with the bridging EIA method and 8.2% with the ECLIA method). When comparing the results using the bridging EIA method, the antibody rates were comparable across the paediatric and 4 adult trials.

## 2.3.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

In study CNTO1275PSO3006 overall, dose proportionality was observed when comparing mean or median serum ustekinumab concentrations through week 52 between the half-standard and standard dosage groups. Steady state was achieved at week 28 in both groups and trough serum concentrations were generally maintained from week 28 through 52. There was no evidence of accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentrations over time. A higher proportion of subjects with trough serum ustekinumab concentrations below the lowest quantifiable level was seen in the half standard dosage group when compared with the standard dosage group.

On comparison of the main 2 body weight groups, whilst there is substantive overlap of the corresponding IQ ranges of serum ustekinumab concentrations at each respective time point, within each dosage group (half-standard or standard dosage) median serum ustekinumab concentrations in subjects with a body

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

weight ≤ 60kg at baseline treated with a weight-based dosage were slightly higher than those levels observed at some respective time points in subjects with a body weight &gt;60 kg to 100 kg at baseline treated with a fixed dosage.

A comparison of the standard dosage PK data from the paediatric study with the 2 adult global pivotal psoriasis trials (C0743T08/C0743T09) suggested a rather higher exposure for both the weight based dosing in those subjects ≤ 60 kg and for fixed doses of 45 mg in those greater than 60 kg. The MAH suggested that this can be explained by the difference in the assay used to measure serum ustekinumab concentrations in the paediatric vs the adult studies, and also due to the higher weight distributions in the adult studies. This was agreed by the CHMP.

The difficulties in comparing the adult data from the 2 adult global pivotal trials in psoriasis due to differences in the assay used to measure serum ustekinumab concentrations and differences in the weight distributions between the paediatric and adult studies is acknowledged. Additional analyses undertaken by the applicant, particularly those in the 2 regional adult studies (C0743T23/C0743T25) provide some assurance. Further information and analyses provided by the MAH, together with the analyses provided in the initial submission provided adequate re-assurance that the exposure in paediatric subjects aged 12 to less than 18 years at the proposed standard dosage results in acceptably comparable exposure data to that seen in the approved adult dosage.

The pharmacokinetic data collected in the paediatric study was therefore considered adequate to describe the PK in paediatric patients aged 12 years and above and to compare to the PK data available from the adult phase III studies. The exposure in paediatric subjects aged 12 to less than 18 year at the proposed standard dosage results in acceptably comparable exposure data to that seen in adults with the approved dosage.

At Week 0, 110 subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to the following treatment groups:

- Placebo at Weeks 0 and 4; at Week 12, subjects crossed over to receive either:
- Half-standard dosage ustekinumab at Week 12 and 16 and then q12w
- Standard dosage ustekinumab at Week 12 and 16 and then q12w
- Ustekinumab half-standard dosage at Week 0 and 4 and then q12w. At week 12 subjects received placebo to maintain the blind.
- Ustekinumab standard dosage at Week 0 and 4 and then q12w. At week 12 subjects received placebo to maintain the blind.

To maintain the blind, all randomized subjects received each administration of study agent as 2 SC injections in 2 different locations. Therefore, subjects received both the half-standard and standard dosage volumes according to their randomized treatment group and body weight category.

Subjects were followed for efficacy through Week 52 and for safety and immunogenicity through Week 60.

## Early Escape

At Week 8, subjects whose PASI scores increased ≥ 50% from their baseline PASI score were allowed to early escape to the use of moderate to high potency topical steroid preparations through Week 12. It was recommended that subjects use no more than 60 grams per week. Class I (very-high potency) steroids were not allowed. After Week 12, subjects were encouraged to decrease and discontinue use of the moderate to high potency steroid by Week 16.

## Study participants

## Main inclusion criteria

Adolescent subjects ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years of age (excluding those who were pregnant or nursing or planning pregnancy [both males and females]) were eligible for this study if they had moderate to severe plaque-type

0299\\_v2

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

psoriasis (defined by PASI ≥ 12, PGA ≥ 3, and BSA involvement ≥ 10%) and were candidates for phototherapy or systemic treatment of psoriasis or had psoriasis considered by the investigator as poorly controlled with topical therapy after an adequate dose and duration of therapy.

## Main exclusion criteria

Subjects were not to be enrolled into this study:

- If they had non-plaque forms of psoriasis (e.g. erythrodermic, guttate, or pustular) or drug-induced psoriasis (e.g. a new onset of psoriasis or an exacerbation of psoriasis from beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or lithium).
- If they had used topical medications/treatments that could affect psoriasis or PASI evaluation within 2 weeks of first administration of study agent, or had received phototherapy or any systemic medications/treatments that could affect psoriasis or PASI evaluation within 4 weeks of the first administration of study agent.
- If they had received any systemic immunosuppressants within 4 weeks of the first administration of study agent; had received any biologic agent within the previous 3 months or 5 times the t1/2 of the agent (whichever was longer); or had received natalizumab, efalizumab, or agents that deplete B or T cells within 12 months of screening.
- If they had used any therapeutic agent targeted at reducing IL-12 or IL-23.
- If they had any known malignancy or a history of malignancy, or known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.

Subjects with a history of the following were not eligible for enrolment into this study:

- Chronic or recurrent infectious disease; serious infection; latent or active granulomatous infection (including TB); a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection or opportunistic infection; an immune deficiency syndrome; or a lymphoproliferative disease.

## Treatments

Two distinct, weight-based ustekinumab dosages were studied.

The standard dosage (0.75 mg/kg for patients ≤ 60 kg, 45 mg for patients &gt;60 kg but ≤ 100 kg, and 90 mg for patients &gt;100 kg) was intended to provide ustekinumab exposure in the adolescent psoriasis population comparable to that in the adult psoriasis population at the approved adult dosage.

The half-standard dosage (0.375 mg/kg for patients ≤ 60 kg, 22.5 mg for patients &gt;60 kg but ≤ 100 kg, and 45 mg for patients &gt;100 kg) was intended to provide ustekinumab exposure comparable to half of the approved adult dosage, and was included to allow the ustekinumab PK-PD relationship in adolescent psoriasis to be better defined.

Patients were randomised to receive SC injections of the ustekinumab half-standard dosage, the ustekinumab standard dosage, or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by investigational site and baseline weight ( ≤ 60 kg or &gt;60 kg).

Patients in the half-standard dosage and standard dosage groups received ustekinumab at Week 0 and Week 4 followed by every 12 week (q12w) doses with the last dose at Week 40. Patients in the placebo group received placebo at Week 0 and Week 4, and crossed over to receive either half-standard dosage or standard dosage ustekinumab at Week 12 and Week 16, followed by q12w doses of either half-standard dosage or standard dosage ustekinumab, with the last dose at Week 40. Patients were followed for efficacy to Week 52 and for safety to Week 60.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At Week 8, patients whose PASI scores increased by at least 50% from their baseline score were allowed to escape to the use of a moderate to high potency topical steroid preparations through Week 12. After Week 12, patients were encouraged to decrease and discontinue use of the moderate to high potency steroid by Week 16.

## Objectives Primary

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 SC dosage tiers of ustekinumab in the treatment of adolescents, defined as paediatric subjects ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years of age, with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

## Secondary

- To evaluate the impact of ustekinumab on physical, social, emotional, and academic functioning as well as dermatologic symptom impact on health-related quality of life in adolescent subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.
- To evaluate the PK and immunogenicity of ustekinumab in adolescent subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary endpoint

The proportion of subjects who achieved a PGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1) at Week 12.

## Major secondary endpoints

The following pre-specified order was used:

- The proportion of subjects who achieve a PASI 75 response at Week 12 was compared between the ustekinumab half-standard dosage group and the placebo group and between the ustekinumab standard dosage group and the placebo group.
- The change from baseline in CDLQI at Week 12 was compared between the ustekinumab half-standard dosage group and the placebo group and between the ustekinumab standard dosage group and the placebo group.
- The proportion of subjects who achieve a PASI 90 response at Week 12 was compared between the ustekinumab half-standard dosage group and the placebo group and between the ustekinumab standard dosage group and the placebo group.

## Other secondary endpoints

- The proportions of subjects achieving a PGA score of cleared (0) and a PGA score of mild or better ( ≤ 2) at Week 12 was compared between the ustekinumab half-standard dosage group and the placebo group and between the ustekinumab standard dosage group and the placebo group.
- The proportion of subjects achieving a PGA score of cleared (0) and a PGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1) and the proportion of subjects achieving a PGA score of mild or better ( ≤ 2) was summarized over time. An additional analysis using a LOCF procedure was used to impute the missing data after applying treatment failure rules and early escape rules.
- The proportion of PASI 50 responders and the number of subjects with a PASI score of 0 at Week 12 were compared between the ustekinumab half-standard dosage group and the placebo group and between the ustekinumab standard dosage group and the placebo group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The proportions of subjects who achieve PASI 50, PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 responses and the percent improvement from baseline in PASI were summarized over time.
- The change from baseline in CDLQI was summarized over time.
- The change from baseline in CDLQI component scores at Week 12 was compared between the ustekinumab half-standard dosage group and the placebo group and between the ustekinumab standard dosage group and the placebo group.
- The proportion of subjects with CDLQI scores of 0 and 1 at Week 12 for randomized subjects with a baseline CDLQI score &gt;1 was compared between the ustekinumab half-standard dosage group and the placebo group and between the ustekinumab standard dosage group and the placebo group.
- The change from baseline in the total score, psychosocial health summary score, physical health summary score, and each scale of PedsQL at Week 12 were compared between the ustekinumab half-standard dosage group and the placebo group and between the ustekinumab standard dosage group and the placebo group.
- The change from baseline in the total score, psychosocial health summary score and physical health summary score of PedsQL were summarized over time.

## Sample size

The planned sample size was approximately 150 subjects.

Simulation studies were performed to evaluate the power of the primary analysis, the CHM test stratified by body weight ( ≤ 60 kg, &gt;60 kg) for detecting a significant difference in the proportions of subjects who achieve a PGA score of cleared or minimal between at least 1 ustekinumab group and the placebo group at Week 12 (2 sided at an overall 5% significance level). With 50 subjects in each treatment group, the power was calculated for the following assumptions based on the results observed in the Phase 3 studies in adults:

- The proportion of subjects with body weight ≤ 60 kg is between 40% to 60% at baseline.
- The proportion of subjects with a PGA score of cleared or minimal at Week 12 in the placebo group is 10% regardless of body weight ( ≤ 60 kg, &gt;60 kg).
- The proportions of subjects with a PGA score of cleared or minimal at Week 12 in the ustekinumab standard dosage group is 60% for subjects with body weight ≤ 60 kg and 55%, 50%, 45% for subjects with body weight &gt;60 kg.
- The proportions of subjects with a PGA score of cleared or minimal at Week 12 in the ustekinumab half-standard dosage group is 50% for subjects with body weight ≤ 60 kg and 45%, 40%, 35% for subjects with body weight &gt;60 kg.

In all cases, the power to detect a difference between at least 1 ustekinumab group and the placebo group in the proportion of subjects with a PGA score of cleared or minimal at Week 12 was greater than 95%.

Due to challenges with subject enrolment, the Stelara PIP was modified to include a target sample size of 105 subjects. With the reduced sample size, the power to detect a difference between at least 1 ustekinumab group and the placebo group in the proportions of subjects with a PGA score of cleared or minimal at Week 12 was still &gt;95% for all scenarios.

## Randomisation

Dynamic central randomization was implemented in conducting this study and was stratified based on investigational site and baseline weight ( ≤ 60 kg, &gt;60 kg). Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups based on an algorithm implemented in the Interactive Voice/Web Response System (IVRS

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or IWRS) before the study. The randomization method was a minimization with a biased-coin assignment in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to assign subjects to either half-standard dosage treatment; standard dosage treatment; placebo crossing over to half-standard dosage treatment; or placebo crossing over to standard dosage treatment.

## Blinding (masking)

The Sponsor, investigative study sites, and subjects remained blinded to treatment assignment until the last subject enrolled completed the Week 60 evaluations and the database was locked.

Data that could potentially unblind the treatment assignment (e.g. study agent serum concentrations, antibodies to study agent, treatment allocation) were to be handled with special care to ensure that the integrity of the blind was maintained and the potential for bias was minimized. This included making special provisions, such as segregating the data in question from view by the investigators, clinical team, or others as appropriate until the time of database lock and unblinding.

Ustekinumab was supplied as a liquid in vial for SC administration as a single concentration (45 mg in 0.5 mL nominal volume). Placebo was supplied as a liquid in a vial for SC administration as a single presentation (0.5mL nominal volume).

## Statistical methods Level of significance

The study was designed to maintain a Type I error of 0.05 or less for the primary analysis. Multiplicity adjustments were made for the 3 major secondary endpoints (sequential testing with a pre-specified order). Nominal p-values were reported for other secondary analyses.

## Data handling rules

## Treatment failure criteria

Subjects who discontinued study treatment due to lack of efficacy, an AE of worsening of psoriasis, or who started a protocol-prohibited medication/therapy during the study that could affect their psoriasis were considered as treatment failures.

## For all efficacy endpoint analyses

A subject who met 1 or more treatment failure criteria were considered as a treatment failure from that point onward. The baseline values were used for all directly measured endpoints regardless of the actual measurements. Zeros were assigned to improvements and percent improvements, and non-responder status was assigned to binary response variables.

## Early escape rules

Subjects who used a moderate to high potency topical steroid as a result of being eligible to early escape were considered as non-responders at Week 12 for binary endpoints and their continuous outcomes at Week 12 were imputed by the last value at or prior to Week 8. The analysis at Week 16 was the observed data without imputation. After Week 16, if subjects continued to use a moderate to high potency topical steroid, treatment failure rules were applied to those subjects.

For most of the secondary efficacy analyses (e.g. over time summaries), after the treatment failures and early escape rules were applied, no imputation was performed for missing data (e.g. lost to follow-up, missed study visit) and the values remained as missing with the exception of the following:

- The dichotomous endpoints at Week 12:

- PGA score of cleared (0), cleared (0) or minimal (1), and mild or better ( ≤ 2);

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- PASI 100, PASI 90, PASI 75, and PASI 50 responses;

- The proportion of subjects achieving 100%, ≥ 90%, ≥ 75%, or ≥ 50% improvement from baseline in PASI component (Induration, Erythema, and Scaling).

For these endpoints, subjects with missing PGA score, PASI score, or PASI component at Week 12 were considered as not achieving the respective endpoints at Week 12.

## Analysis sets

- All randomised subjects: Defined as the population of all subjects who were randomised to any treatment group.
- Efficacy evaluable subjects : Defined as the subset of all randomized subjects with evaluable outcome measurements. After applying treatment failure rules, no other imputation rules were applied.

The primary efficacy analysis was performed using the all randomized subjects analysis set. The major secondary efficacy analyses for PASI 75 and PASI 90 at Week 12 included the all randomized subjects analysis set, and the change from baseline in CDLQI at Week 12 was based on efficacy evaluable subjects. Most other secondary efficacy analyses were based on the efficacy evaluable subjects analysis set according to their assigned treatment group in the study with the exception of certain dichotomous endpoints at Week 12.

## Analysis of the primary endpoint

The primary endpoint in this study was the proportion of subjects who achieve a PGA score of cleared or minimal at Week 12. In the primary efficacy analysis, data from all randomized subjects were analyzed according to their assigned treatment group. Subjects who met treatment failure criteria prior to Week 12 or who entered early escape were considered non-responders at Week 12. In addition, subjects who had a missing PGA score at Week 12 were considered as not achieving the primary endpoint at Week 12.

In the primary analysis, the proportion of subjects with a PGA score of cleared (1) or minimal (0) at Week 12 was compared between the ustekinumab half-standard dosage group and the placebo group and between the ustekinumab standard dosage group and the placebo group using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test stratified by body weight ( ≤ 60 kg or &gt; 60 kg). The p-values were ordered. To maintain an overall Type I error rate of 0.05, the Holm ' s procedure was used. The smaller p-value was compared to 0.025 (2-sided). If this test was significant, then the other p-value was compared to 0.05 (2 sided). Otherwise, both tests were considered not significant. To establish the efficacy of ustekinumab compared with placebo, at least 1 of the comparisons must be statistically significant (i.e. at least the smaller p-value must be ≤ 0.025).

## Sensitivity analyses

To assess the robustness of the primary endpoint analysis results, the following 3 sensitivity analyses were conducted:

- For subjects who did not return for evaluation at Week 12, a last observation carried forward (LOCF) procedure (e.g. PGA score from the closest visit prior to Week 12) was used to impute the missing data at Week 12, after applying treatment failure rules and early escape rules.
- For subjects who did not return for evaluation at Week 12, the missing PGA score at Week 12 was not imputed. That is, the analysis was performed using observed data, after applying treatment failure rules and early escape rules.
- A re-randomization test was performed for the primary endpoint analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Subgroup analyses

For each of the subgroups based on baseline demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and psoriasis medication history, the difference between the ustekinumab treatment groups and placebo group in the proportion of subjects achieving PGA scores of cleared (0) or minimal (1) at Week 12 and its 95% confidence interval were calculated. Due to the anticipated small sample sizes within subgroups, no p-values were provided, and the continuity correction was included in the confidence limits.

## Independent data safety monitoring board

A Data Monitoring Committee consisting of independent experts in the fields of dermatology, epidemiology, and infectious disease evaluated unblinded safety data from the study at pre-specified intervals.

The single death was due to a motor vehicle accident and assessed as not related to the study agent (the subject was a passenger in the car).

Of the 3 adverse events, 2 were 'worsening of psoriasis', the 3 rd was a precautionary withdrawal of treatment in a patient with toxoplasmosis infection (see clinical safety section).

## Termination of study participation

Through week 60 seventeen subjects (15.5%) terminated study participation. The most common reason for termination was withdrawal of consent (9 subjects 8.2%).

## Study agent unblinding

Two subjects were unblinded prior to week 60:

- One subject in the half-standard dosage group was unblinded by Global Medical Safety due to worsening of psoriasis.
- One subject in the standard dosage group withdrew from study participation due to lack of efficacy. The subject was subsequently unblinded to study agent to know which treatment they were receiving to guide future treatment decisions.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The last scheduled visit for both subjects was Week 20.

Two additional subjects were unblinded by Global Medical Safety but were not included in the listing due to failure to collect the data in the CRF at the sites.

- One subject was unblinded for an SAE of pyelonephritis.
- One subject was unblinded for an SAE of leucopenia

## Recruitment

The trial was conducted at 36 sites in 10 countries:

- EU (centres): Belgium (3 sites; 11 subjects), France (2 sites; 5 subjects), Germany (1 site; 2 subjects), Hungary (3 sites; 7 subjects), Portugal (3 sites; 8 subjects), Sweden (2 sites; 3 subjects), United Kingdom (3 sites; 6 subjects).
- Canada (10 sites; 41 subjects)
- Russia (5 sites; 19 subjects)
- Ukraine (4 sites; 8 subjects)

The study period was 30 March 2010 to 03 January 2014.

## Conduct of the study Amendments to the protocol

The main global amendment to the protocol on 06 December 2010 included clarification of topical medications/treatments that could affect psoriasis or PASI evaluation: Picrolimus and tacrolimus are topical therapies that may be used in the treatment of psoriasis and concomitant use of these therapies could affect PASI evaluations and present potential safety concerns. Both of these medications were added to the list of medication/treatments that were not permitted within 2 weeks of the first administration of study agent and through Week 60. In addition, the exception clause of allowing subjects to enter the study if they had used low-potency corticosteroids on the face and/or groin was removed to allow for a full evaluation of psoriasis on all affected body areas and to avoid any potential confounding of efficacy by previous topical use.

## Other changes in study conduct

The planned total sample size was approximately 150 subjects. However, due to challenges with subject enrolment, the Stelara PIP and SAP were modified to include a target sample size of 105 subjects.

## Baseline data

The study population was approximately half male and half female, most subjects were Caucasian (89.1%). The median age was 15.5 years with the majority of subjects (70%) 15-17 years of age (figure 4). The median weight was 61.6 kg with over half of the subjects having a body weight of &gt;50kg to ≤70kg (figure 3) and the median body mass index was 22.15 kg/m2.

The study population had moderately to severely active psoriasis, with a median psoriasis duration of 5.29 years. The median age at onset of disease was 10.0 years, and the majority of subjects (57.3%) had ≥ 20% of BSA affected with psoriasis. The median PASI score was 18.8. The majority of subjects (61.8%) had PGA scores of moderate and 38.2% of subjects had a PGA score of marked or severe.

Prior psoriasis medication use was as follows: topical agents (89.1%); conventional systemic agents (PUVA, methotrexate, acitretin, and cyclosporine; 42.7%); ultraviolet B (35.5%); PUVA (6.4%); biologics (10.9%); and conventional systemic agents or biologics (46.4%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As permitted by the protocol, few (6) subjects received concomitant corticosteroids for short-term use for indications other than psoriasis through Week

60.

## Comparison of baseline data in study CNTO1275PSO3006 and the 2 adult pivotal trials

Other than obvious expected differences (e.g. age, weight, and duration of disease), baseline demographic characteristics were similar except for the proportion of males, which was higher in the adult studies.

Prior use of topical agents was similar in all studies, but prior phototherapy, conventional systemics, and biologics use was generally lower in the paediatric population compared with the adult populations.

The numbers of subjects by investigational site were low, and response rates were generally higher in the ustekinumab dosage groups compared with the placebo group across sites.

## Sensitivity analyses

Two sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the primary endpoint and to assess the impact of missing data. An additional sensitivity analysis was also conducted to evaluate the effect of re-randomization.

Results in all 3 sensitivity analyses were similar to the main analysis.

## Major secondary endpoints

## PASI 75 responders at week 12

At Week 12, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in both the half-standard dosage and the standard dosage groups achieved a PASI 75 response compared with subjects in the placebo group, both p&lt;0.001.

## Other secondary endpoints

## Secondary endpoints relating to PGA

Placebo controlled period (through week 12)

At Week 12, significantly greater proportions of subjects in both the half-standard dosage and the standard dosage groups achieved PGA scores of cleared and PGA scores of cleared, minimal, or mild compared with subjects in the placebo group (all p&lt;0.001). A greater proportion of subjects in the standard dosage group achieved a PGA of cleared (0) relative to the half-standard dosage group at Week 12 .

As early as week 4, greater proportions of subjects in both the half-standard dosage and the standard dosage groups achieved PGA scores of cleared, cleared or minimal, and cleared, minimal or mild compared with subjects in the placebo group. The response rates for the ustekinumab groups continued to improve and reached maximum response around Week 8 and maintained response at Week 12.

The results of a sensitivity analysis (LOCF) were generally comparable.

## Through week 52

Efficacy as assessed by PGA scores was generally maintained through week 52.

## Secondary endpoints related to PASI

Placebo controlled period (through week 12)

Through Week 12, significantly greater proportions of subjects in both the half-standard dosage and the standard dosage groups achieved a PASI 50 response (81.1% and 88.9%, respectively) compared with subjects in the placebo group (29.7%), both p&lt;0.001.

A greater proportion of subjects achieved a PASI score of 0 in the standard dosage group relative to the half-standard dosage group (38.9% and 21.6%, respectively), and both were significant compared with subjects in the placebo group (2.7%), p&lt;0.001 and p=0.014, respectively.

As early as week 4, greater proportions of subjects in both the half-standard dosage and the standard dosage groups achieved PASI 50, PASI 75, and PASI 90 compared with subjects in the placebo group.

As early as Week 4, percent improvement from baseline in both the half-standard dosage and the standard dosage groups was significantly greater (median of 53.30 and 63.08, respectively) compared with the placebo group (10.07), both p&lt;0.001. Results remained significant at both Week 8 and Week 12.

## Through week 52

At Week 28 and Week 52, subjects in both the half-standard dosage and the standard dosage groups generally maintained the improvements in the mean total scale scores observed at week 12. At week 28,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects in the placebo → half-standard dosage and the placebo → standard dosage groups showed improvements in the mean total scale scores generally comparable to those observed in the half-standard dosage and the standard dosage groups at Week 12, which were maintained through week 52. The same general pattern was observed in the psychosocial health summary scores over time across dosage groups. The dosage groups did not differentiate from each other in the physical health summary scores over time.

## Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships

To explore the relationship between systemic exposure to ustekinumab and clinical efficacy, the proportions of subjects who achieved PGA cleared (0) or minimal (1), PGA cleared (0), PASI 75, and PASI 90 responses at Week 40 were evaluated with respect to steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentration levels at Week 40 for ustekinumab-treated subjects including the placebo-crossover subjects. The steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentrations at Week 40 were categorized into 3 different levels: all BQL trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were categorized as &lt;0.1688 μ g/mL; the remaining quantifiable trough serum ustekinumab concentrations were divided into 2 groups, yielding equal numbers of subjects in each of the 2 trough concentration categories:

- First quantifiable level: ≥ 0.1688 μ g/mL to &lt;0.51 μ g/mL
- Second quantifiable level: ≥ 0.51 μ g/mL

Similar to the PGA score of cleared (0) or minimal (1) response at Week 40, the PGA score of cleared (0) response at Week 40 also appeared to be associated with steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentration levels at Week 40.

Similar to the PASI 75 response at Week 40, the PASI 90 response at Week 40 also appeared to be associated with steady-state trough serum ustekinumab concentration levels at Week 40.

## Efficacy and antibodies to ustekinumab

Antibody positivity to ustekinumab did not preclude a clinical response. Six of the 9 subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab achieved PGA scores of cleared (0) or minimal (1) at the time when the antibodies to ustekinumab were detected. However, the small number of subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab in each treatment group limits interpretation of these data.

## Ancillary analyses Primary endpoint subgroup analysis

To examine the consistency of treatment effect for the primary endpoint, the proportion difference of the half-standard dosage and the standard dosage groups versus the placebo group and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were provided for predefined subgroups as follows:

- Baseline demographic characteristics: Gender (M/F), Baseline age (≤15y &gt;15y), baseline weight (≤60kg, &gt;60kg ≤100kg, &gt;100kg)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Baseline psoriasis disease characteristics: Age at diagnosis (&lt;10y ≥10y), Psoriasis duration (&lt;5y ≥5y), Baseline PASI (&lt;20 ≥20), baseline BSA (&lt;20% ≥20%), baseline CDLQI (&lt;10 ≥10)
- Psoriasis medication history: Phototherapy (never used/ever used), conventional systemic treatments (never used/ever used).

The treatment effect of both the half-standard dosage and the standard dosage groups versus placebo was substantial and generally consistent across demographic characteristics, psoriasis disease characteristic, and psoriasis medication history. Modest variability in treatment effect in both dosage groups versus the placebo group was observed for PGA scores of cleared (0) or minimal (1) for some subgroups. No consistent impact of body weight on PGA response was observed. The variability noted could be due to the limited sample sizes within each category in each treatment group.

## First main secondary endpoint subgroup analysis

The same subgroup analyses were undertaken for the PASI 75 responders at week 12 as for the primary endpoint.

The treatment effect of both the half-standard dosage and the standard dosage groups versus placebo was substantial and generally consistent across demographic characteristics, psoriasis disease characteristic, and psoriasis medication history. Modest variability was observed for some subgroups. The observed variability could be due to the limited sample sizes within each category in each treatment group.

## Efficacy assessments over time through week 28

Both the paediatric study and the adult studies showed rapid onset of action of ustekinumab, with separation between the ustekinumab groups and the placebo group at the first post-baseline visit (Week 2 or Week 4). The PASI and PGA response rates continued to increase over time and reached a maximum by Week 12 in CNTO1275PSO3006 and Week 20 in the adult studies. In both the paediatric study and the adult studies, efficacy responses were maintained through Week 28.

In both the paediatric and adult studies, there is some variability in the response rates of the ustekinumab groups seen over the 12-week dosage period, but this difference was most pronounced between the standard dosage groups and half-standard dosage groups in CNTO1275PSO3006, where a loss of response for most efficacy measures was seen more consistently among a proportion of subjects in the half-standard dose groups toward the end of each 12 week dosing interval.

Key efficacy endpoints for PASI responses and PGA scores at Week 28 are presented in table 8 below. The half-standard dosage group in CNTO1275PSO3006 generally had lower responses than the ustekinumab groups in the adult studies C0743T08 and C0743T09 while the standard dosage group in the paediatric study had response rates that were similar or modestly higher than those of the ustekinumab groups seen in the adult studies.

## Efficacy and immunogenicity

Overall, in both paediatric and adult psoriasis populations, subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab tended to have lower clinical efficacy. However, antibody positivity to ustekinumab did not preclude a clinical response.

## Persistence of efficacy and/or tolerance effects

The efficacy results in CNTO1275PSO3006 demonstrate that the efficacy of ustekinumab was maintained through 1 year in the treatment of psoriasis in paediatric subjects in both dosages studied, and therefore do not suggest that loss of response or tolerance occurs. This observation is further supported by the long-term efficacy observed in the adult studies. Comparisons with adult data from the adult studies C0743T08 and C0743T09 indicate similar patterns of efficacy response through Week 28 when the study designs are comparable. In the adult studies, improvement in psoriasis was maintained for up to 5 years with continuous q12w maintenance treatment. The applicant has stated that it is therefore reasonable to expect that paediatric subjects treated with ustekinumab for more than 1 year would continue to maintain clinical response as well.

## Duration of response after discontinuation of therapy

This was not assessed in study CNTO1275PSO3006. However, in the C0743T08 adult study, the duration of response and recurrence of psoriasis were evaluated in 2 subpopulations of subjects who were PASI responders at Week 40:

- Subjects randomized at baseline to ustekinumab
- Subjects in the placebo → 45 mg and placebo → 90 mg groups

After withdrawal from therapy at Week 40, evidence of psoriasis recurrence emerged by the first visit after withdrawal of therapy, i.e. by Week 44, PASI 75 response rates progressively declined over time, and the rates of loss of response were generally comparable in all groups. Subjects withdrawn from therapy were followed until loss of therapeutic effect (loss of ≥ 50% of their Week 40 PASI improvement). As expected, while evidence of psoriasis recurrence began to emerge by 4 weeks after therapy withdrawal, loss of therapeutic effect occurred over a longer period of time. Maintenance of response and response over time were significantly superior in subjects who continued q12w maintenance therapy at Week 40 compared with subjects withdrawn from therapy.

In the half-standard dosage group in CNTO1275PSO3006, a periodic reduction in efficacy was observed toward the end of the 12-week dosage interval resulting from waning serum ustekinumab concentrations. Improvement in response with the next dose of ustekinumab provides some direct evidence that, as in adults, continuous treatment with a therapeutic dose of ustekinumab is necessary to maintain an appropriate efficacy response in paediatric subjects.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The paediatric study supporting this extension of indication to the treatment of paediatric patients aged 12 years and above with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multi-centre 3 arm study. The first 12 weeks of the study are placebo controlled, following which the placebo groups cross over to active treatment.

The MAH used a minimisation procedure to allocate patients to the treatment groups. In view of this a re-randomisation test was undertaken in the sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint.

The primary analysis set for the primary endpoint (PGA) and 2 major secondary endpoints relating to PASI 75 and 90 included all randomised subjects. This is acceptable to the CHMP. However, for the secondary endpoint relating to the change from baseline in CDLQI at week 12, the primary analysis was based on efficacy evaluable subjects. The population that has been used is all randomised subjects with a score &gt;1 at baseline and evaluable measures at week 12. Consequently there are 2 groups of excluded patients in this analysis. For the first group who already had a score of 0 or 1 at baseline, as these exclusions are based on baseline data they do not create a bias as they cannot be related to treatment and it can be argued this analysis then includes patients who have improved to 0 or 1 (rather than remaining stable at this level).  For the second group who did not have a score at week 12, such exclusion is not acceptable as such post-baseline exclusions create a bias as this could have been related to treatment. The MAH performed the requested re-analyses and the product information adequately describes the information regarding CDLQI score.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

From a total of 157 subjects screened, 110 were randomised.  Most completed study agent and compliance to therapy was good. The patient population was representative of the target population as described in the SmPC. The majority of subjects (61.8%) had PGA scores of moderate with 38.2% having scores of marked or severe.

In the main single pivotal trial the primary endpoint was met with significantly greater proportions of subjects in the half-standard and standard dosage groups (67.6% and 69.4% respectively) achieving PGA scores of cleared (0) or minimal (1) at week 12 compared with the placebo group (5.4% both p&lt;0.001). These results were robust to sensitivity analyses.

All 3 major secondary endpoints were also met with significantly greater proportions of subjects in both the half-standard and standard dosage groups achieving a PASI 75 response (p&lt;0.001), PASI 90 response (p&lt;0.001) and greater change from baseline in CDLQI (p=0.003 and p&lt;0.001) compared with the placebo group. The analysis set for the CDLQI of 0/1 endpoint was based on efficacy evaluable subjects. The population that has been used is all randomised subjects with a score &gt; 1 at baseline and evaluable measures at week 12.During the procedure, the MAH has re-analysed this efficacy secondary endpoint using the ITT population and also including an analysis with the subjects with a baseline score of 0 or 1. The results of these re-analyses are generally consistent with those of the main analysis.

A separation in efficacy between both ustekinumab dosages and placebo could be seen at the first post-baseline visit (week 4). PGA and PASI responses tended to plateau around week 8 and were generally maintained through to week 52.

During the placebo controlled period up to week 12 the efficacy of both the half-standard and standard dosage group against placebo were generally comparable, although there was a suggestion of some difference when more stringent efficacy criteria were used e.g. PASI 90. Beyond week 12 the data suggests efficacy was generally higher and better sustained in the standard dosage group compared with the half

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dosage group in which a modest loss of efficacy was more frequently observed toward the end of the 12 week dosing interval.

On comparison of the key efficacy endpoints up to week 28 in the paediatric trial with the 2 global pivotal adult psoriasis trials, the half-standard dosage group in the paediatric trial generally had slightly lower responses than the ustekinumab groups in the adult studies C0743T08 and C0743T09 (mainly in relation to PASI 75) while the standard dosage group in the paediatric study had response rates that were similar or modestly higher than those of the ustekinumab groups seen in the adult studies.

Given the limitations of the paediatric efficacy data available (110 subjects over a period of 52 weeks) the MAH also presented supportive efficacy data from the 2 global pivotal adult psoriasis studies. In addition to the above comparison in support of the choice of the standard dosing regimen, this also provided supportive bridging efficacy data for the long-term efficacy of ustekinumab (up to 5 years clinical study data) and withdrawal and re-treatment data.

The MAH provided a detailed discussion to support their opinion that a clinical post-authorisation study to explore possible lower maintenance dosing is not required. On careful consideration of the points discussed by the MAH, together with the responses to the clinical pharmacology questions and noting that the MAH will perform a post-authorisation registry study to further monitor long-term safety of the standard dosing regimen in the paediatric population (as described in the RMP), the CHMP agreed that a post-authorisation study to explore possible lower maintenance dosing is not required. The product information reflects data on both the standard dosage and half-dosage groups at week 12 and 52 with a short statement as to the rationale for why the standard dose was taken forward to clinical practice.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

A well designed trial in paediatric patients aged 12 years and above has been undertaken to support the proposed extension of indication in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis to include paediatric patients aged 12 years and above.

Both the standard dosage and half-standard dosage of ustekinumab provided statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in psoriasis and health-related quality of life in paediatric subjects, with a trend towards generally higher and better sustained efficacy in the standard dosage groups after 12 weeks. Whilst the numbers are small there were more patients with adverse events related to lack of efficacy in the half-standard dosage group when compared with the standard dosage group through 60 weeks.

Given there was no apparent difference seen in the safety and tolerability of both dosage groups and that the exposure in paediatric subjects aged 12 to less than 18 y at the proposed standard dosage results in acceptably comparable exposure data to that seen in adults with the approved dosage, the applicants proposal that the standard dosage is optimal to be used in patients aged 12 years and above is accepted.

In addition, in-line with the current approved indication in adults and taking into consideration the chronic nature of psoriasis and the bridging of the longer-term adult efficacy data up to 5 years, the proposed continuous maintenance treatment is acceptable.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

Since the first approval of ustekinumab in Canada on 12 December 2008 substantial information has been accruing that contributes to the understanding of the overall safety profile of the drug. The Stelara EU marketing authorisation was renewed with unlimited validity on 19 September 2013.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In adults the most common adverse reactions (&gt; 5%) in controlled periods of the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis clinical studies with ustekinumab were nasopharyngitis, headache and upper respiratory tract infection. Most were considered to be mild and did not necessitate discontinuation of study treatment. The most serious adverse reaction that has been reported is serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis.

Supportive safety data in a paediatric population aged 12-18y are provided by the information collected in study CNTO1275PSO3006.

## Patient exposure

The safety population in study CNTO1275PSO3006 consists of 110 subjects who received at least one dose of study medication.

## Reasonably related adverse events

Through Week 12, 16.2% (6), 16.2% (6), and 5.6% (2) of subjects in the placebo, half-standard dosage, and standard dosage groups, respectively, reported 1 or more reasonably related AEs.

Infections and infestations and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were the MedDRA SOCs with the highest proportions of subjects reporting reasonably related AEs (4.1% [3] of subjects each in the ustekinumab combined group). The only reasonably related AEs reported by more than 1 subject in any treatment group were pharyngitis (2 subjects in the half-standard dosage group), nasopharyngitis (3 subjects in the placebo group), and headache (2 subjects in the half-standard dosage group).

## Adverse events through week 60

Through Week 60, 81.8% (90) of subjects in the ustekinumab combined group reported 1 or more AEs; the proportions of subjects reporting AEs were generally consistent across all dosage groups. No trend for an increase in AEs was seen in the placebo → standard dosage and standard dosage groups relative to the placebo → half-standard dosage and half-standard dosage groups.

Infections and infestations was the MedDRA SOC in which the highest proportions of subjects reported AEs, which were reported by 68.2% (75) of subjects in the ustekinumab combined group, and were generally consistent across dosage groups. The most frequently reported Infections and infestations in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ustekinumab combined group were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and pharyngitis (34.5% [38 subjects], 12.7% [14 subjects], and 8.2% [9 subjects], respectively).

When reported by MedDRA preferred term, nasopharyngitis, headache (18.2% [20 subjects]), and upper respiratory tract infection were the most frequently reported AEs through Week 60 in the ustekinumab combined group.

* The PT for all AEs in this SOC was 'Skin papilloma'.

## Reasonably related adverse events

Through Week 60, 23.6% (26) of subjects in the ustekinumab combined group reported 1 or more reasonably related AEs. No trend for an increase in reasonably related AEs was seen in the placebo → standard dosage and standard dosage groups relative to the placebo → half-standard dosage and half-standard dosage groups.

Infections and infestations was the MedDRA SOC in which the highest proportions of subjects reported reasonably related AEs (16.4% [18] of subjects in the ustekinumab combined group), which were generally consistent across dosage groups. The most frequently reported Infections and infestations in the ustekinumab combined group were nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and pyelonephritis (7.3% [8 subjects], 3.6% [4 subjects], 1.8% [2 subjects], and 1.8% [2 subjects], respectively).

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events Deaths

One death was reported through week 60 - a subject in the half-standard dosage group died of injuries sustained in an automobile accident. The subject was a passenger in the automobile and the death was assessed as not related to the study medication.

## Serious adverse events

## Serious adverse events during the placebo-controlled period (through week 12)

One SAE was reported through week 12 - a 12 year old subject in the half-standard dosage group was hospitalised with an exacerbation of psoriasis.

## Serious adverse events through week 60

Through Week 60, a total of 5.5% (6) of subjects in the ustekinumab combined group (5 subjects in the half-standard dosage group and 1 subject in the standard dosage group) reported SAEs. No subject reported more than a single SAE, and no SAE was reported by more than 1 subject.

The 5 additional SAEs reported after Week 12 are as follows:

- Subject 007001-6123 in the half-standard dosage group presented with single laboratory values for ALC, ANC and white blood cells of: 0.53, 0.87 and 1.62 x 103/ μ L, respectively. The subject was undergoing treatment with acyclovir for a concurrent AE of herpes simplex labialis at the time of the SAE. A subsequent blood test 6 days later indicated a recovery of levels to 1.19, 3.65, and 5.41 x 103/ μ L, respectively.
- Subject 011002-6045 in the half-standard dosage group died of injuries sustained in an automobile accident (see deaths above).
- Subject 033004-6050 in the half-standard dosage group had pyelonephritis. This female subject presented with fever, abdominal pain, and right lumbar back pain accompanied by an elevated white blood cell count and elevated CRP, with a urine culture positive for E. coli . Abdominal radiography and ultrasound were also performed. The subject was treated with triple IV antibiotic therapy for 4 days; the subject responded to therapy and was released on oral antibiotic therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Subject 036003-6119 in the half-standard dosage group had acute allergic contact dermatitis due to black hair dye. This SAE was assessed as not related to the study drug.
- Subject 038008-6059 in the standard dosage group had an ear infection of moderate intensity. The subject was hospitalized, treated with a 4-day course of intramuscular ceftriaxone, and the event resolved within 10 days of onset.

## Reasonably related serious adverse events though week 60

Through Week 60, 2.7% (3) of subjects in the ustekinumab combined group (all 3 subjects in the half-standard dosage group) reported reasonably related SAEs. No subject reported more than a single reasonably related SAE, and no reasonably related SAE was reported by more than 1 subject.

The 3 reasonably related SAEs included 1 event each of psoriasis (through week 12), pyelonephritis and leukopenia.

## Other significant events

## Infections

## Any infections

Through Week 12, 37.8% (14), 32.4% (12), and 22.2% (8) of subjects in the placebo, half-standard dosage, and standard dosage groups, respectively, reported 1 or more AEs that were considered to be infections by the investigator.

Through Week 60, 67.3% (74) of subjects in the ustekinumab combined group reported 1 or more AEs that were considered to be infections by the investigator, with the proportions comparable among the placebo crossover groups, the half-standard dosage group, and the standard dosage groups.

No increase in infections was seen in any treatment groups with increased duration of ustekinumab exposure over time.

## Serious infections

Two subjects presented with serious infection - 1 event of pyelonephritis in the half-standard dosage group and 1 event of ear infection in the standard dosage group.

## Infections requiring antimicrobial treatment

Through Week 12, 10.8% (4), 2.7% (1), and 5.6% (2) of subjects in the placebo, half-standard dosage, and standard dosage groups, respectively, reported 1 or more infections which required oral or parenteral antimicrobial treatment. None of the infections was reported in more than 1 subject in any treatment group.

Through Week 60, 25.5% (28) of subjects in the ustekinumab combined group reported 1 or more infections which required oral or parenteral antimicrobial treatment, with the proportions comparable among the groups.

## Injection-site reactions

None of the 9 subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab had an injection-site reaction.

## Adverse events of psoriasis

Through Week 12, 3 subjects (2 [5.4%] in the placebo group and 1 [2.7%] in the half-standard dosage group) reported 1 or more AEs of psoriasis.

Through Week 60, 7 (6.4%) subjects reported 1 or more AEs of psoriasis. Worsening of psoriasis was reported by 5 subjects in the half-standard dosage groups and 2 subjects in the standard dosage groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adverse events of clinical interest

There were no malignancies, major adverse cardiovascular events, reports of TB or opportunistic infection, possible anaphylactic reactions, or possible serum sickness-like reactions.

## Pregnancy

One subject reported a pregnancy that resulted in an elective abortion.

## Laboratory findings

Markedly abnormal changes in hematology and chemistry laboratory values were uncommon, generally single events, and were distributed across treatment groups

## Discontinuation due to adverse events Placebo-controlled period (through week 12)

Through week 12 no subject discontinued study agent due to one or more AEs.

## Through week 60

Through Week 60, 3.6% (4) subjects in the ustekinumab combined group discontinued study agent due to 1 or more AEs. All of these subjects were receiving the half-standard dosage at the time of discontinuation. The AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent were:

- 1 event of toxoplasmosis infection - 13 year old male patient who lived in an area endemic for Toxoplasmosis gondi . The subject presented with increasing fatigue and had positive IgG and IgM titers for Toxoplasma gondi . Subsequent clinical evaluations were negative for systemic manifestations of Toxoplasmosis and a pre-dose serum sample was also positive for both IgM and IgG, suggesting recent primary infection prior to study agent administration. As a precaution, study agent was discontinued and the subject was treated with Bactrim.
- 1 event of fatal injury (see deaths above - automobile accident)
- 2 events of worsening of psoriasis

## Subgroup analysis

To evaluate any effect of intrinsic or extrinsic factors upon safety, analyses of key safety findings (i.e. discontinuations due to an AE and the occurrence of AEs, SAEs, and any infection) were performed for subgroups in CNTO1275PSO3006 through Week 12 and through Week 60, as defined by the following at baseline:

## Intrinsic factors

- Demographic characteristics: age, gender, and weight
- Disease severity: BSA, PGA, and PASI

## Extrinsic factors

- Previous treatment for psoriasis: phototherapy and conventional systemic therapies

As only a few subjects in the overall population discontinued study agent due to an AE (n=4), or had an SAE (n=6) or a serious infection (n=2) during the study, this limits the interpretation of these data by subgroups.

## Supportive safety data from adult clinical trials and Post marketing experience Adverse events

## Through the placebo-controlled period (through week 12)

Within each dataset (paediatric and pivotal adult studies) through Week 12, the proportions of subjects who discontinued study agent due to an AE or had AEs, SAEs, infections, serious infections, or treated infections were comparable between the placebo and ustekinumab groups, with no evidence of a dose effect. The most frequently reported AEs were also generally similar across the datasets and consistent with previously identified ADRs. The proportions of subjects who had SAEs or serious infections were low across both datasets.

Within each dataset through 1 year (week 60 for the paediatric study and week 52 for the 2 adult studies), a disproportional increase was not seen in the numbers of subjects with AEs, infections, or treated infections with increasing follow-up. The proportions of subjects with discontinuations due to AEs, SAEs, and serious infections continued to be low in both datasets, and no dose effect was seen for these types of events in either dataset.

The most commonly reported AEs through 1 year were also generally comparable between the paediatric and adult subjects and with those seen during the placebo-controlled period. No new safety issues were identified in the paediatric subjects studied in CNTO1275PSO3006, or relative to the safety profile observed in the adult psoriasis population treated with ustekinumab.

## Long term safety

## Safety through 5 years in the 2 global adult pivotal trials in adult patients with psoriasis

The incidences of AEs, SAEs, infections, and AEs leading to study agent discontinuation through up to 5 years were evaluated in the adult psoriasis population (C0743T08 and C0743T09). In addition, long-term safety in the adult psoriasis population was evaluated by examining targeted AEs that are considered a population risk, or a potential or identified risk based on clinical study and/or post-marketing data.

Evaluation of the pooled data from the adult psoriasis dataset with up to 5 years of exposure demonstrated that incidences of AEs, SAEs, infections, and AEs leading to study agent discontinuation remained generally

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

comparable between 45 mg and 90 mg and decreased or were stable over time, and did not reveal evidence of risks associated with increasing duration of exposure.

Follow up-adjusted rates of serious infections, malignancies (non-melanoma skin cancer [NMSC] and malignancies other than NMSC), and MACE did not appear to increase over time. These observations suggest that rates of these targeted AEs remain stable over time with increasing duration of exposure. External databases were used to further evaluate rates of serious infections, malignancies other than NMSC, and myocardial infarction and stroke. Based on rates derived from external databases, the rates of these events were lower than or consistent with what would be expected from the general United States population and/or psoriasis populations.

The applicant concludes that these safety results from adult psoriasis subjects treated continuously with ustekinumab for up to 5 years can be reasonably extrapolated to paediatric patients requiring treatment for longer than 1 year.

## Post-marketing registry: PSOLAR

Ustekinumab is also being evaluated in the Psoriasis Longitudinal Assessment and Registry (PSOLAR), a multicentre, prospective, observational study that tracks the long-term safety experience and clinical status of patients with psoriasis who are eligible to receive (or are actively receiving) systemic therapies for psoriasis.8 The post-marketing commitment for PSOLAR was to enrol 12,000 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, including 4,000 receiving ustekinumab, with the rest receiving or eligible to receive other systemic therapies, including other applicant and non-applicant biologics. Patients are to be followed for 8 years. PSOLAR enrolment has completed. As of the most recent data cut-off on 23 August 2013, 12,095 patients have enrolled in PSOLAR, with a median registry follow up of 2.54 years, and an accumulated 31,818 patient-years of follow up.

PSOLAR has enrolled more than 4,100 patients who were exposed to ustekinumab at some time during their treatment for psoriasis. No unfavorable imbalances in cumulative, unadjusted incidence rates of AEs, SAEs, or targeted all-cause mortality, MACE, malignancy, and serious infection were noted for the ustekinumab cohort compared with that for other cohorts.

Protocol-specified statistical analyses indicated that ustekinumab exposure was not a significant predictor of serious infection. Protocol-specified AEs of special interest (i.e. serious depression/suicidality and systemic hypersensitivity, preselected neurologic events [facial palsy, RPLS]), did not reveal any new safety signals, although numbers of events were low for some AEs of special interest.

Overall, the data analysis conducted for the PSOLAR registry has not identified any new safety signals for ustekinumab.

## Proposed post-marketing safety evaluation plan in paediatric patients

Within the agreed PIP for Stelara, under potential long-term safety issues 'Long term safety and long-term impact on growth and development' are included as particular areas of concern. The PIP includes consideration for a post-marketing registry/prospective cohort observational study, to evaluate long-term safety of ustekinumab and the assessment of the impact of ustekinumab on normal growth and development.

Since the initial Marketing Authorization Application and the approval of the PIP, the applicant has accumulated significant long-term safety data in adults treated for psoriasis. The applicant believes that the favourable long-term benefit risk profile of Stelara in adults is also applicable to paediatric patients ≥ 12 years of age when used as recommended in the currently proposed indication because of the following observations:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- No new safety issues were identified in the paediatric subjects in CNTO1275PSO3006 relative to the safety profile observed in the adult psoriasis population treated with ustekinumab. A review of the safety data from CNTO1275PSO3006 has shown a comparable safety profile in subjects ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years of age to that of the known safety profile in adults. The frequency of AEs, SAEs, infections, and discontinuations due to AEs reported by subjects in CNTO1275PSO3006 remained consistent through 1 year with those reported in the global studies of ustekinumab in adults with psoriasis. The most commonly reported AEs were also generally comparable between paediatric and adult subjects.
- The proposed dose regimen for paediatric patients will provide exposure that does not exceed that of the approved adult psoriasis dose regimen.
- Full immunological maturity is reached by adolescence.

The applicant acknowledges that the clinical development program in paediatric patients was of limited duration and the impact of ustekinumab on growth and development is not fully known. The applicant is evaluating additional surveillance activities in order to collect data in paediatric patients ≥ 12 years of age, and specifically, in order to understand the impact, if any, of exposure to ustekinumab on normal growth and development. The applicant has initiated dialogue with a non-profit, international Consortium of centres specialized in the treatment of plaque psoriasis in paediatric patients, with the objective of establishing a partnership. This Consortium, operating under the aegis of the International Psoriasis Council, is currently establishing an international, multicentre, long-term, prospective, observational, disease-based study to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of therapies prescribed by dermatologists to paediatric patients for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. The applicant is currently performing a feasibility assessment and exploring the opportunity to monitor up to 100 patients ≥ 12 years of age on Stelara or the number of patients enrolled in a 4-year time frame, whatever comes first, and a suitable comparator cohort. Patients enrolled in this study will be followed until the age of 18 years.

Routine pharmacovigilance activities will also be conducted to monitor the safety of ustekinumab use in paediatric patients and the applicant will present the results in the annual PSURs.

## Safety of withdrawal and re-treatment

Withdrawal and rebound were not studied in the paediatric psoriasis study but were studied in the adult psoriasis program.

C0743T08 evaluated the safety of withdrawal and retreatment with the 2 ustekinumab dose regimens that began at Week 40. Subjects who were long-term PASI 75 responders (i.e., subjects with a PASI 75 response from baseline at Weeks 28 and 40) to the ustekinumab q12w regimens were randomized to continue maintenance therapy with ustekinumab (q12w) or to withdraw from therapy (i.e. receive placebo) at Week 40. The Week 40 randomization included only subjects treated with ustekinumab for 40 weeks, i.e. the subpopulation randomized to ustekinumab at baseline. In addition, subjects in the placebo group who crossed over and were PASI 75 responders at Week 28 and Week 40 were also withdrawn from ustekinumab at Week 40. These withdrawn subjects are the most appropriate population to evaluate for psoriasis rebound, which was defined as an event of new erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis or a PASI of ≥ 125% of the baseline PASI that occurred within 3 months of the last ustekinumab administration.

No subject who was withdrawn from therapy at Week 40 met the definition of rebound. Thus a pattern of psoriasis exacerbation with either erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis or with PASI ≥ 125% from baseline value was not observed in subjects withdrawn from ustekinumab.

Subjects who lost response after withdrawal of therapy were eligible to be re-treated with ustekinumab. The pattern of AEs following retreatment was generally consistent with the pattern in other study periods. No systemic hypersensitivity-type reactions were observed in subjects re-treated with ustekinumab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These results demonstrate that ustekinumab therapy can be safely stopped and restarted should that be required or desired.

## C0743T09 Vaccine sub-study

A vaccine sub-study was previously conducted in the adult psoriasis study C0743T09 to assess the impact of long-term ustekinumab treatment on the subjects' ability to mount a response to pneumococcal vaccine (T-cell independent response) and tetanus toxoid combined with diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine (T-cell dependent response). The sub-study compared subjects treated with ustekinumab (&gt;3 years) during the long-term extension of C0743T09 (n=60) with control subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis not receiving systemic therapy (n=56). Subjects were vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and tetanus (Tdap) vaccine. Serum samples were collected before and 4 weeks after vaccination and assessed for antibody responses to the vaccinations.

Results indicated that long-term treatment with ustekinumab does not impair immune responses to either tetanus or polysaccharide 23-valent pneumococcal vaccinations in adult subjects with psoriasis. The finding of lack of impact of ustekinumab on these 2 prototypical vaccines suggests that patients requiring a non-live vaccine during ustekinumab treatment are likely to achieve the protective immune response desired.

## Post-marketing safety surveillance

Since the first approval of ustekinumab on 12 December 2008, the estimated cumulative worldwide exposure to ustekinumab from launch to 31 December 2013 is 250,100 person-years.

Substantial safety information has been accrued from clinical studies, registries (including the PSOLAR post-marketing registry described under long-term safety above), and the post-marketing experience that have contributed to the understanding of the overall safety profile of ustekinumab and its overall benefit-risk profile.

In the submission dossier it is noted by the applicant that the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) has identified 2 new ADRs (ie, skin exfoliation and exfoliative dermatitis) and has requested that these be added to the STELARA EU SmPC, and that an accompanying Dear Health Care Professional Communication be issued. In addition, PRAC has requested that erythrodermic psoriasis be classified in the RMP as an important identified risk. A Type II variation procedure to address the PRAC requests was ongoing at the time of submission of this application.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety population in study CNTO1275PSO3006 consists of 110 subjects who received at least one dose of study medication.

Through week 60 there were a total of 26 subjects who reported treatment emergent adverse events that were assessed as reasonably related to the study drug. Infections and infestations was the MedDRA SOC in which the highest proportions of subjects reported reasonably related AEs. The proportions and types of AEs reported were similar between the half-standard and standard dosage groups.

The number of treatment emergent serious AEs and subjects withdrawing from treatment due to adverse events was low throughout the study. Through Week 60, 3 subjects reported reasonably related SAEs (all in the half-standard dosage group) -1 event each of psoriasis (through week 12), pyelonephritis and leukopenia. The report of leukopenia was confounded by concurrent treatment with the co-suspect drug acyclovir.

Through week 60 four subjects discontinued study agent due to adverse events, all of whom were in the half-standard dosage group. The AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent were: 1 event of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

toxoplasmosis infection (pre-dated ustekinumab exposure), 1 event of fatal injury (subject was a passenger in a fatal motor vehicle accident) and 2 events of worsening of psoriasis.

Through Week 60, worsening of psoriasis was reported by 5 subjects in the half-standard dosage groups and 2 subjects in the standard dosage groups.

In the paediatric study CNTO1275PSO3006 there was no apparent difference in the safety profile or tolerability between the half-standard dosage and standard dosage regimes. The safety profile in the paediatric study was generally comparable with that seen in the 2 pivotal adult psoriasis studies and no other new adverse events or safety issues were identified.

Whilst there is only limited safety data available in paediatric patients aged 12 years and over, there is significant safety data available in adult patients from clinical trials and post-marketing data including a post-marketing registry study (PSOLAR). The MAH proposed that ustekinumab be used as a continuous maintenance treatment in paediatric patients aged 12 years and over, in-line with the current approved indication in adults and in-keeping with the chronic nature of psoriasis. The bridging of the longer-term adult safety data to the paediatric population 12 years and above and the data from adults regarding the safety of withdrawal and re-treatment is generally acceptable. However, confirmation of the expectation that the long-term safety in this paediatric population with ustekinumab usage will be similar to that seen in adults together with exploration of whether long-term usage results in any potential effects on growth or development will be explored, as proposed by the MAH in the form of a post-authorisation safety study (as described in the RMP).

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

In the paediatric study CNTO1275PSO3006 there was no apparent difference in the safety profile or tolerability between the half-standard dosage and standard dosage regimes. The safety profile in the paediatric study was generally comparable with that seen in the 2 pivotal adult psoriasis studies and no other new adverse events or safety issues were identified. To confirm the expected long-term safety profile of ustekinumab use in this population and to explore any potential effect on growth and development, the MAH's will undertake a post-marketing study to evaluate these issues (as described in the RMP).

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 12.1 is acceptable.

This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

MAH in-line with article 59(3) of Council Directive 2001/83/EC to ensure that the information is accessible to all patients including adolescent patients from the age of 12 years and older.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The positive benefit risk balance of ustekinumab in the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is well established. At week 12 in the single pivotal paediatric study CNTO1275PSO3006, when compared against placebo, both the standard and half-standard dosages of ustekinumab met the primary end point with a statistically significant greater proportion of the subjects randomised to both the half-standard and standard dosage regimens achieving a PGA score of cleared or minimal compared with subjects in the placebo group (both p&lt;0.001). All 3 major secondary endpoints were also met with significantly greater proportions of subjects in both the half-standard and standard dosage groups achieving a PASI 75 response (p&lt;0.001), PASI 90 response (p&lt;0.001) and greater change from baseline in CDLQI (p=0.003 and p&lt;0.001) compared with the placebo group. PGA and PASI scores tended to plateau around week 8 and were generally maintained through to week 52.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

In-line with the current adult indication the MAH proposed that in patients aged 12 years and above ustekinumab is to be given as a continuous maintenance treatment. There is no data on efficacy in children over 12 years beyond 52 weeks. However there is supportive data from adult patients in clinical trials with up to 5 years of treatment that provides evidence of continued efficacy through this time period. In addition, withdrawal and re-treatment has been studied in a clinical trials in adults, and these studies showed that maintenance of response and response over time were significantly superior in subjects who continued q12w maintenance therapy at Week 40 compared with subjects withdrawn from therapy.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The safety profile of ustekinumab use in adults with moderate to severe chronic psoriasis is well established and continues to be monitored in the post-marketing setting including a post-marketing registry study (PSOLAR). Ustekinumab was generally well tolerated throughout the paediatric study. The number of treatment emergent serious AEs and subjects withdrawing from treatment due to adverse events was low throughout the study. There was no apparent difference in the safety profile or tolerability between the half-standard dosage and standard dosage regimes. The safety profile in the paediatric study was generally comparable with that seen in the 2 pivotal adult psoriasis studies and with the exception of a potential signal of 'Pyelonephritis', no other new adverse events or safety issues were identified.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The safety data available in paediatric patients aged 12 years and above is limited due to the sample size (110) and duration of the paediatric study (1 year). However, significant safety data is available from the adult population both in clinical trials (up to 5 years) and the post-marketing setting including a post-marketing registry study.

The safety profile and tolerability of ustekinumab in the paediatric study was generally comparable to that seen in the 2 pivotal adult psoriasis trials which provide some re-assurance about the longer-term safety in paediatric patients. However, to confirm the expected long-term safety profile of ustekinumab use in this

population and to explore any potential effect on growth and development, the MAH will undertake a post-marketing study to evaluate these issues (as described in the RMP).

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

The beneficial effects of ustekinumab in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients have been well established. Similarly in paediatric patients aged 12 years and above, both the standard and half-standard dosage of ustekinumab resulted in statistically and clinically significant improvements in in psoriasis and health-related quality of life, with a trend towards generally higher and better sustained efficacy in the standard dosage groups after 12 weeks. In the paediatric study ustekinumab treatment was generally well tolerated and the number of treatment emergent serious AEs and subjects withdrawing from treatment due to adverse events was low throughout the study.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

A well designed trial in paediatric patients aged 12 years and above has been undertaken to support the proposed extension of indication in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis to include paediatric patients aged 12 years and above. Both the standard dosage and half-standard dosage of ustekinumab provided statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in psoriasis and health-related quality of life in paediatric subjects, with a trend towards generally higher and better sustained efficacy in the standard dosage groups after 12 weeks. Given there was no apparent difference seen in the safety and tolerability of both dosage groups and that the exposure in paediatric subjects aged 12 to less than 18 y at the proposed standard dosage results in acceptably comparable exposure data to that seen in adults with the approved l dosage the MAH's proposal that the standard dosage is optimal to be used in patients aged 12 years and above is accepted. In addition, in-line with the current approved indication in adults and taking into consideration the chronic nature of psoriasis and the bridging of the longer-term adult efficacy data up to 5 years, the proposed continuous maintenance treatment is acceptable.

Ustekinumab was generally well tolerated throughout the paediatric study. The number of treatment emergent serious AEs and subjects withdrawing from treatment due to adverse events was low throughout the study. To confirm the expected long-term safety profile of ustekinumab use in this population and to explore any potential effect on growth and development, the MAH's will undertake a post-marketing study to evaluate these issues (as described in the RMP).

The benefit-risk balance of ustekinumab for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adolescent patients from the age of 12 years and older, who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies is considered positive.

## 4. Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following changes:

| Variation accepted   | Type                                                                                                                           |    |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Extension of Indication to add treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in paediatric patients from the age of 12 years and older, who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies. As a consequence SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1 and 6.6 have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. A revised RMP version 12.1 was agreed during the procedure.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet.

## Paediatric data

Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0226/2012 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.
