## Elderly population

No dosage adjustment is required in elderly patients based on age alone .

## Paediatric population:

The safety and efficacy of Ketek in children below 12 years of age have not been established (see section 5.2). Ketek is not recommended in this population.

## Renal impairment

No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Ketek is not recommended as first choice in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min) or patients with both severe renal impairment and co-existing hepatic impairment, as an optimal dosage format (600 mg) is not available. If telithromycin treatment is deemed necessary, these patients may be treated with alternating daily doses of 800 mg and 400 mg, starting with the 800 mg dose. In haemodialysed patients, the posology should be adjusted so that Ketek 800 mg is given after the dialysis session (see also section 5.2). Hepatic impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, however the experience in patients with impaired hepatic function is limited. Hence, telithromycin should be used with caution (see also sections 4.4 and 5.2). Method of administration The tablets should be swallowed whole with a sufficient amount of water. The tablets may be taken with or without food. Consideration may be given to taking Ketek at bedtime, to reduce the potential impact of visual disturbances and loss of consciousness (see section 4.4). 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of the macrolide antibacterial agents, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Myasthenia gravis (see section 4.4). Previous history of hepatitis and/or jaundice associated with the use of telithromycin. Concomitant administration with medicinal products that prolong the QT interval and are CYP3A4 substrates, such as cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine, dronedarone, saquinavir (see section 4.5). Concomitant administration with ergot alkaloid derivatives (such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine) (see section 4.5). Concomitant administration with simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin. Treatment with these agents should be interrupted during Ketek treatment (see section 4.5). History of congenital or a family history of long QT syndrome (if not excluded by ECG) and in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In patients with severely impaired renal and/or hepatic function, concomitant administration of Ketek and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as protease inhibitors or azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, fluconazole), is contraindicated.

Concomitant administration of Ketek and colchicine in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## QT interval prolongation

Due to a potential to increase the QT interval, Ketek should be used with care in patients with coronary heart disease, a history of ventricular arrhythmias, uncorrected hypokalaemia and/or hypomagnesaemia, or bradycardia (&lt;50 bpm), during concomitant administration of Ketek with QT interval prolonging agents, or in patients concomitantly treated with potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors or azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, fluconazole) (see sections 4.3 and 4.5). Ventricular arrhythmias (including ventricular tachycardia, torsade de pointes) have been reported in patients treated with telithromycin and sometimes occurred within a few hours of the first dose (see section 4.8).

<!-- image -->

Consideration may be given to taking Ketek at bedtime, to reduce the potential impact of visual disturbances and loss of consciousness.

Clostridium difficile-associated disease Diarrhoea, particularly if severe, persistent and /or bloody, during or after treatment with Ketek may be caused by pseudomembranous colitis (see section 4.8). If pseudomembranous colitis is suspected, the treatment must be stopped immediately and patients should be treated with supportive measures and/or specific therapy. Myasthenia gravis Exacerbations of myasthenia gravis have been reported in patients treated with telithromycin and sometimes occurred within a few hours of the first dose. Reports have included death and life threatening acute respiratory failure with rapid onset (see section 4.8). Hepatobiliary disorders Alterations in hepatic enzymes have been commonly observed in clinical studies with telithromycin. Post-marketing cases of severe hepatitis and liver failure, including fatal cases (which have generally been associated with serious underlying diseases or concomitant medicinal products), have been reported (see section 4.8). These hepatic reactions were observed during or immediately after treatment, and in most cases were reversible after discontinuation of telithromycin. Patients should be advised to stop treatment and contact their doctor if signs and symptoms of hepatic disease develop such as anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus or tender abdomen. Due to limited experience, Ketek should be used with caution in patients with liver impairment (see section 5.2). Visual disturbances Ketek may cause visual disturbances particularly in slowing the ability to accommodate and the ability to release accommodation. Visual disturbances included blurred vision, difficulty focusing, and diplopia. Most events were mild to moderate; however, severe cases have been reported. The onset of the visual reaction may be sudden. It is important that patients prescribed telithromycin should be informed that visual adverse reactions may occur during the treatment (see sections 4.7 and 4.8). Loss of consciousness There have been post-marketing adverse reaction reports of transient loss of consciousness including some cases associated with vagal syndrome (see sections 4.7 and 4.8). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## CYP3A4 inducers

Ketek should not be used during and 2 weeks after treatment with CYP3A4 inducers (such as rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John's wort). Concomitant treatment with these medicinal products is likely to result in subtherapeutic levels of telithromycin and therefore encompass a risk of treatment failure (see section 4.5) .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

## CYP3A4 substrates

Ketek is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and should only be used under specific circumstances during treatment with other medicinal products that are metabolised by CYP3A4. Patients with concomitant treatment of pravastatin, rosuvastatin or fluvastatin should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. (See sections 4.3 and 4.5).

## Resistance

Due to its CYP3A4 inhibitory potential, telithromycin can increase blood concentrations of these CYP34A4 substrates. Thus, when initiating telithromycin in patients already receiving any of theses immunosuppressive agents, cyclosporin, tacrolimus or sirolimus levels must be carefully monitored and their doses decreased as necessary. When telithromycin is discontinued, cyclosporin, tacrolimus or sirolimus levels must be again carefully monitored and their dose increased as necessary.

In areas with a high incidence of erythromycin A resistance, it is especially important to take into consideration the evolution of the pattern of susceptibility to telithromycin and other antibiotics . In community acquired pneumonia, efficacy has been demonstrated in a limited number of patients with risk factors such as pneumococcal bacteraemia or age higher than 65 years. Experience of treatment of infections caused by penicillin/or erythromycin resistant S. pneumoniae is limited, but so far, clinical efficacy and eradication rates have been similar compared with the treatment of susceptible S. pneumoniae .  Caution should be taken when S. aureus is the suspected pathogen and there is a likelihood of erythromycin resistance based on local epidemiology. L. pneumophila is highly susceptible to telithromycin in vitro , however, the clinical experience of the treatment of pneumonia caused by legionella is limited . As for macrolides, H. influenzae is classified as intermediately susceptible. This should be taken into account when treating infections caused by H. influenzae. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. · Effect of Ketek on other medicinal products Telithromycin is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. In vivo studies with simvastatin, midazolam and cisapride have demonstrated a potent inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 and a moderate inhibition of hepatic CYP3A4. The degree of inhibition with different CYP3A4 substrates is difficult to predict. Hence, Ketek should not be used during treatment with medicinal products that are CYP3A4 substrates, unless plasma concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrate, efficacy or adverse reactions can be closely monitored. Alternatively, interruption in the treatment with the CYP3A4 substrate should be made during treatment with Ketek. Telithromycin is also a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. Concomitant administration of Ketek with drugs that are substrates of P-glycoprotein might result in increased exposure to the P-glycoprotein substrates such as digoxin and dabigatran etexilate. If telithromycin is co-administered with dabigatran etexilate close clinical monitoring (looking for signs of bleeding or anaemia) should be exercised. Cyclosporin, tacrolimus, sirolimus Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Metoprolol

When metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate) was coadministered with Ketek, metropolol Cmax and AUC were increased by approximately 38%, however, there was no effect on the elimination half-life of metoprolol. The increase exposure to metoprolol may be of clinical importance in patients with heart

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

failure treated with metoprolol. In these patients, co-administration of Ketek and metoprolol, a CYP2D6 substrate, should be considered with caution.

## Medicinal products with a potential to prolong QT interval

Ketek is expected to increase the plasma levels of cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine, dronedarone, saquinavir. This could result in QT interval prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and torsades de pointes. Concomitant administration of Ketek and any of these medicinal products is contraindicated (see section 4.3).

Caution is warranted when Ketek is administered to patients taking other medicinal products with the potential to prolong the QT interval (see section 4.4). These include Class IA (e.g.quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) and Class III (e.g. dofetilide, amiodarone) antiarrhythmic agents, citalopram, tricyclic antidepressants, methadone, some antipsychotics (e.g. phenothiazines), fluoroquinolones (e.g. moxifloxacin), some antifungals (e.g. fluconazole, pentamidine), and some antiviral drugs (e.g. telaprevir). Ergot alkaloid derivatives (such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine) By extrapolation from erythromycin A and josamycin, concomitant medication of Ketek and alkaloid derivatives could lead to severe vasoconstriction ('ergotism') with possibly necrosis of the extremities. The combination is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Statins When simvastatin was coadministered with Ketek, there was a 5.3-fold increase in simvastatin Cmax, an 8.9-fold increase in simvastatin AUC, a 15-fold increase in simvastatin acid Cmax and an 11-fold increase in simvastatin acid AUC. Ketek may produce a similar interaction with lovastatin and atorvastatin which are also mainly metabolised by CYP3A4. Ketek should therefore not be used concomitantly with simvastatin, atorvastatin, or lovastatin (see section 4.3). Treatment with these agents should be interrupted during Ketek treatment. The exposure of pravastatin, rosuvastatin and to a lesser extent fluvastatin, may be increased due to possible involvement of transporters proteins, but this increase is expected to be lesser than interactions involving CYP3A4 inhibition. However, patients should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when co-treated with pravastatin, rosuvastatin and fluvastatin. Benzodiazepines When midazolam was coadministered with Ketek, midazolam AUC was increased 2.2-fold after intravenous administration of midazolam and 6.1-fold after oral administration. The midazolam halflife was increased about 2.5-fold. Oral administration of midazolam concomitantly with Ketek should be avoided. Intravenous dosage of midazolam should be adjusted as necessary and monitoring of the patient should be undertaken. The same precautions should also apply to the other benzodiazepines which are metabolised by CYP3A4, (especially triazolam but also to a lesser extent alprazolam). For those benzodiazepines which are not metabolised by CYP3A4 (temazepam, nitrazepam, lorazepam) an interaction with Ketek is unlikely. Digoxin Ketek has been shown to increase the plasma concentrations of digoxin, a P-glycoprotein substrate. The plasma trough levels, Cmax, AUC and renal clearance were increased by 20%, 73%, 37% and 27% respectively, in healthy volunteers. There were no significant changes in ECG parameters and no signs of digoxin toxicity were observed. Nevertheless, monitoring of serum digoxin level should be considered during concomitant administration of digoxin and Ketek. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Theophylline

There is no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction of Ketek and theophylline administered as extended release formulation. However, the co-administration of both medicinal products should be separated by one hour in order to avoid possible digestive side effects such as nausea and vomiting.

## Oral anticoagulants

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Increased anticoagulant activity has been reported in patients simultaneously treated with anticoagulants and antibiotics, including telithromycin. The mechanisms are incompletely known. Although Ketek has no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with warfarin after single dose administration, more frequent monitoring of prothrombin time/INR (International Normalised Ratio) values should be considered during concomitant treatment.

## Oral contraceptives

There is no pharmacodynamic or clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction with low-dose triphasic oral contraceptives in healthy subjects.

Ranitidine (taken 1 hour before Ketek) and antacid containing aluminium and magnesium hydroxide has no clinically relevant influence on telithromycin pharmacokinetics.

Colchicine Colchicine intoxication, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with colchicine and strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors. Telithromycin is known to be a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and is also a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. Exposure to colchicine, a CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein substrate, may therefore be expected to increase if Ketek and colchicine are co-administered. Concomitant administration of Ketek and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). Calcium channel blockers that are metabolized by CYP3A4 Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as telithromycin) and calcium channel blockers that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g. verapamil, nifedipine, felodipine) may result in hypotension, bradycardia or loss of consciousness, and should therefore be avoided. In case the combination is considered necessary, the dose of the calcium channel blocker should be reduced and close clinical monitoring of efficacy and safety in the patient should be exercised. Sotalol Telithromycin has been shown to decrease the Cmax by 34 % and AUC of sotalol by 20 % due to decreased absorption. · Effect of other medicinal products on Ketek During concomitant administration of rifampicin and telithromycin in repeated doses, Cmax and AUC of telithromycin were on average decreased by 79% and 86% respectively. Therefore, concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers (such as rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St John's wort) is likely to result in subtherapeutic levels of telithromycin and loss of effect. The induction gradually decreases during 2 weeks after cessation of treatment with CYP3A4 inducers. Ketek should not be used during and 2 weeks after treatment with CYP3A4 inducers. Interaction studies with itraconazole and ketoconazole, two CYP3A4 inhibitors, showed that maximum plasma concentrations of telithromycin were increased respectively by 1.22 and 1.51 fold and AUC by respectively 1.54 fold and 2.0 fold. These changes in the pharmacokinetics of telithromycin do not necessitate dosage adjustment as telithromycin exposure remains within a well tolerated range. The effect of ritonavir on telithromycin has not been studied and could lead to larger increase in telithromycin exposure. The combination should be used with caution. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors must not be co-administered with Ketek in patients with severe renal/or hepatic dysfunction (see section 4.3). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no adequate data from the use of Ketek in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Ketek should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.

Telithromycin is excreted in the milk of lactating animals, at concentrations about 5 times those of maternal plasma . Corresponding data for humans is not available. Ketek should not be used by breastfeeding women. Fertility In studies with rats a reduction in fertility indices was observed at parentally toxic doses (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Ketek may cause adverse reactions such as visual disturbances, confusion or hallucination which may reduce the capacity for the completion of certain tasks. In addition, rare cases of transient loss of consciousness, which may be preceded by vagal symptoms, have been reported (see section 4.8). Because of potential visual difficulties, loss of consciousness, confusion or hallucination, patients should attempt to minimize activities such as driving a motor vehicle, operating heavy machinery or engaging in other hazardous activities during treatment with Ketek. If patients experience visual disorders, loss of consciousness, confusion or hallucination while taking Ketek, patients should not drive a motor vehicle, operate heavy machinery or engage in other hazardous activities (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Patients should be informed that these adverse reactions may occur as early as after the first dose of medicinal product. Patients should be cautioned about the potential effects of these events on the ability to drive or operate machinery. 4.8 Undesirable effects Tabulated list of adverse reactions In 2,461 patients treated by Ketek in phase III clinical trials, and during post-marketing experience, the following undesirable effects possibly or probably related to telithromycin have been reported. This is shown in the table below. Diarrhoea, nausea and dizziness were the most commonly reported adverse reactions in phase III clinical trials. Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Medicinal product no longer authorised

*post-marketing experience Description of selected adverse reactions Visual disturbances (&lt;1%) associated with the use of Ketek, including blurred vision, difficulty focusing and diplopia, were mostly mild to moderate, but severe reactions have also been reported. They typically occurred within a few hours after the first or second dose, recurred upon subsequent dosing, lasted several hours and were fully reversible either during therapy or following the end of treatment. The onset of the visual reaction may be sudden. These events have not been associated with signs of ocular abnormality (see sections 4.4 and 4.7). In clinical trials the effect on QTc was small (mean of approximately 1 msec). In comparative trials, similar effects to those observed with clarithromycin were seen with an on-therapy ΔQTc &gt;30 msec in 7.6% and 7.0% of cases, respectively. No patient in either group developed a ΔQTc &gt;60 msec. There were no reports of TdP or other serious ventricular arrhythmias or related syncope in the clinical program and no subgroups at risk were identified. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the event of acute overdose the stomach should be emptied. The patients should be carefully observed and given symptomatic and supportive treatment. Adequate hydration should be maintained. Blood electrolytes (especially potassium) must be controlled. Due to the potential for the prolongation of the QT interval and increased risk of arrhythmia, ECG monitoring must take place.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antibacterials for systemic use, macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins, ATC Code: J01FA15.

Telithromycin is a semisynthetic derivative of erythromycin A belonging to the ketolides, a class of antibacterial agents related to macrolides.

## Breakpoints

Mode of action Telithromycin inhibits protein synthesis by interacting with domains II and V of the 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S ribosome subunit. Furthermore, telithromycin is able to block the formation of the 50S and 30S ribosomal subunits. The affinity of telithromycin for the 50S ribosomal subunits of organisms susceptible to erythromycin A is 10-fold higher than that of erythromycin A. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship: The AUC/MIC ratio has been shown to be the PK/PD parameter that correlates best with the efficacy of telithromycin. Mechanisms of resistance Telithromycin does not induce expression of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB)mediated resistance in vitro in Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pneumoniae , or Streptococcus pyogenes . In some organisms that are resistant to erythromycin A due to inducible expression of the MLSB resistance determinant, the affinity of telithromycin for the 50S ribosomal subunit is more than 20fold that of erythromycin A. Telithromycin is not active against organisms that constitutively express the MLSB resistance determinant (cMLSB). The majority of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) express cMLSB. In in vitro studies the activity of telithromycin was reduced against organisms that express the erythromycin erm (B) or mef (A) related resistance mechanisms. Exposure to telithromycin in vitro did select for pneumococcal mutants with increased MICs of telithromycin, generally resulting in MIC values of ≤1 mg/l. Streptococcus pneumoniae does not demonstrate cross-resistance between erythromycin A and telithromycin. Streptococcus pyogenes that show high-level resistance to erythromycin A are cross-resistant to telithromycin . Medicinal product no longer authorised

The recommended European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) MIC clinical breakpoints are presented below:

| Pathogen                 | Susceptible   | Resistant   |
|--------------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Streptococcus A, B, C, G | ≤0.25 mg/l    | >0.5 mg/l   |
| Streptococcus pneumoniae | ≤0.25 mg/l    | >0.5 mg/l   |

<!-- image -->

Haemophilus influenzae 1

≤0.12 mg/l

&gt;8 mg/l

Moraxella catarrhalis

≤0.25 mg/l

&gt;0.5 mg/l

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1 The correlation between macrolide MICs and clinical outcome is weak for H. influenzae . Therefore the MIC breakpoint for telithromycin was set to categorise wild-type H. influenzae as having intermediate susceptibility.

## Antibacterial spectrum

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The prevalence of resistance may vary geographically and with time for selected species and local information on resistance is desirable, particularly when treating severe infections. As necessary, expert advice should be sought when the local prevalence of resistance is such that the utility of the agent in at least some types of infections is questionable. Commonly susceptible species Aerobic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus methicillin susceptible (MSSA)* Streptococcus pneumoniae * Streptococcus species Viridans group streptococci Aerobic Gram- negative bacteria Haemophilus influenzae $* Haemophilus parainfluenzae $ Legionella pneumophila Moraxella catarrhalis * Other Chlamydophila pneumoniae* Chlamydia psittaci Mycoplasma pneumoniae * Species for which acquired resistance may be a problem Aerobic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus methicillin resistant (MRSA)+ Streptococcus pyogenes * Inherently resistant organisms Aerobic Gram- negative bacteria Acinetobacter Enterobacteriaceae Pseudomonas ∗ Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated for susceptible isolates in the approved clinical indications. $ natural intermediate susceptibility + Telithromycin is not active against organisms that constitutively express the MLSB resistance determinant (cMLSB). More than 80% of MRSA express cMLSB. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Absorption

Following oral administration, telithromycin is fairly rapidly absorbed. A mean maximum plasma concentration of about 2 mg/l is reached within 1-3 hour after dose with once-daily dosing of telithromycin 800 mg. The absolute bioavailability is about 57% after a single dose of 800 mg. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rate and extent of absorption is unaffected by food intake, and thus Ketek tablets can be given without regard to food.

Mean steady-state trough plasma concentrations of between 0.04 and 0.07 mg/l are reached within 3 to 4 days with once-daily dosing of telithromycin 800 mg. At steady-state AUC is approximately 1.5 fold increased compared to the single dose.

Mean peak and trough plasma concentrations at steady state in patients were 2.9 ± 1.6 mg/l (range 0.02-7.6 mg/l) and 0.2 ± 0.2 mg/l (range 0.010 to 1.29 mg/l), during a therapeutic 800 mg once-daily dose regimen.

## Special populations

Distribution The in vitro protein binding is approximately 60% to 70%. Telithromycin is widely distributed throughout the body. The volume of distribution is 2.9±1.0 l/kg. Rapid distribution of telithromycin into tissues results in significantly higher telithromycin concentrations in most target tissues than in plasma. The maximum total tissue concentration in epithelial lining fluid, alveolar macrophages, bronchial mucosa, tonsils and sinus tissue were 14.9±11.4 mg/l, 318.1±231 mg/l, 3.88±1.87 mg/kg, 3.95±0.53 mg/kg and 6.96±1.58 mg/kg, respectively. The total tissue concentration 24 h after dose in epithelial lining fluid, alveolar macrophages, bronchial mucosa, tonsils and sinus tissue were 0.84±0.65 mg/l, 162±96 mg/l, 0.78±0.39 mg/kg, 0.72±0.29 mg/kg and 1.58±1.68 mg/kg, respectively. The mean maximum white blood cell concentration of telithromycin was 83±25 mg/l. Biotransformation Telithromycin is metabolised primarily by the liver. After oral administration, two-thirds of the dose is eliminated as metabolites and one-third unchanged. The main circulating compound in plasma is telithromycin. Its principal circulating metabolite represents approximately 13% of telithromycin AUC, and has little antimicrobial activity compared with the parent medicinal product. Other metabolites were detected in plasma, urine and faeces and represent less or equal than 3% of plasma AUC. Telithromycin is metabolised both by CYP450 isoenzymes and non-CYP enzymes. The major CYP450 enzyme involved in the metabolism of telithromycin is CYP3A4. Telithromycin is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, but has no or limited effect on CYP1A, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2E1. Elimination After oral administration of radiolabelled telithromycin, 76% of the radioactivity was recovered from faeces, and 17% from the urine. Approximately one-third of telithromycin was eliminated unchanged; 20% in faeces and 12% in urine. Telithromycin displays moderate non-linear pharmacokinetics. The non-renal clearance is decreased as the dose is increased . The total clearance (mean ±SD ) is approximately 58±5 l/h after an intravenous administration with renal clearance accounting for about 22% of this. Telithromycin displays a tri-exponential decay from plasma, with a rapid distribution half-life of 0.17 h. The main elimination half-life of telithromycin is 2-3 h and the terminal, less important, half-life is about 10 h at the dose 800 mg once daily. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## -Renal impairment

In a multiple-dose study, 36 subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment, a 1.4-fold increase in Cmax,ss, and a 2-fold increase in AUC (0-24)ss at 800 mg multiple doses in the severe renally impaired group (CLCR &lt; 30 ml/min) compared to healthy volunteers were observed and a reduced dosage of Ketek is recommended (see section 4.2). Based on observed data, a 600 mg daily dose is approximately equivalent with the target exposure observed in healthy subjects. Based on simulation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

data, an alternating daily dosing regimen of 800 mg and 400 mg in patients with severe renal impairment can approximate the AUC (0-48h) in healthy subjects receiving 800 mg once daily.

The effect of dialysis on the elimination of telithromycin has not been assessed.

## -Hepatic impairment

In a single-dose study (800 mg) in 12 patients and a multiple-dose study (800 mg) in 13 patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh Class A, B and C), the Cmax, AUC and t1/2 of telithromycin were similar compared to those obtained in age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. In both studies, higher renal elimination was observed in the hepatically impaired patients. Due to limited experience in patients with decreased metabolic capacity of the liver, Ketek should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment (see also section 4.4).

<!-- image -->

-Elderly subjects In subjects over 65 (median 75 years), the maximum plasma concentration and AUC of telithromycin were increased approximately 2-fold compared with those achieved in young healthy adults. These changes in pharmacokinetics do not necessitate dosage adjustment. -Paediatric population Limited data, obtained in paediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age, showed that telithromycin concentrations in this age group were similar to the concentrations in patients 18 to 40 years of age. -Gender The pharmacokinetics of telithromycin is similar between males and females. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Repeated dose toxicity studies of 1, 3 and 6 month duration with telithromycin conducted in rat, dog and monkey showed that the liver was the principal target for toxicity with elevations of liver enzymes, and histological evidence of damage. These effects showed a tendency to regress after cessation of treatment. Plasma exposures based on free fraction of active substance, at the no observed adverse effect levels ranged from 1.6 to 13 times the expected clinical exposure. Phospholipidosis (intracellular phospholipid accumulation) affecting a number of organs and tissues (e.g., liver, kidney, lung, thymus, spleen, gall bladder, mesenteric lymph nodes, GI-tract) has been observed in rats and dogs administered telithromycin at repeated doses of 150 mg/kg/day or more for 1 month and 20 mg/kg/day or more for 3-6 months. This administration corresponds to free active substance systemic exposure levels of at least 9 times the expected levels in human after 1 month and less than the expected level in humans after 6 months, respectively. There was evidence of reversibility upon cessation of treatment. The significance of these findings for humans is unknown. In similarity to some macrolides, telithromycin caused a prolongation of QTc interval in dogs and on action potential duration in rabbit Purkinje fibers in vitro . Effects were evident at plasma levels of free drug 8 to 13 times the expected clinical level. Hypokalaemia and quinidine had additive/supraadditive effects in vitro while potentiation was evident with sotalol. Telithromycin, but not its major human metabolites, had inhibitory activity on HERG and Kv1.5 channels. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Reproduction toxicity studies showed reduced gamete maturation in rat and adverse effects on fertilization. Slight reductions in fertility indices were seen in rats at parentally toxic doses higher than 150 mg/kg. At high doses embryotoxicity was apparent and an increase in incomplete ossification and in skeletal anomalies was seen. Studies in rats and rabbits were inconclusive with respect to potential for teratogenicity; there was equivocal evidence of adverse effects on foetal development at high doses.

Telithromycin, and its principal human metabolites, were negative in tests on genotoxic potential in vitro and in vivo . No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with telithromycin.
