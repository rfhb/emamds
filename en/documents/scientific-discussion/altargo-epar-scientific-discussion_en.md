## 1. Introduction

For those SSTIs that are sufficiently superficial to be amenable to topical therapy the most commonly used antibacterial agents are fusidic acid (fucidin) and mupirocin. However, there are problems with increasing resistance to both these agents. Retapamulin has been developed for cutaneous use only in the management of superficial SSTIs.

The claimed indication for retapamulin 1% ointment was the short term treatment of the following uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections:  Impetigo  Secondary skin infections: infected dermatoses (e.g. atopic dermatitis, atopic contact dermatitis, psoriasis), infected traumatic lesions (e.g. small lacerations, sutured wounds, cuts, abrasions, superficial cutaneous abscesses not requiring drainage) The approved indication is short term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: · Impetigo · Infected small lacerations, abrasions or sutured wounds 2. Quality aspects Introduction Altargo is presented as a  smooth off-white ointment containing 1% w/w retapamulin (free base) as active  substance.  The  only  excipient  used  in  the  formulation  of  Altargo  is  white  soft  paraffin containing a trace of antioxidant (BHT), as allowed in the PhEur monograph. Altargo  is  for  topical  administration  and  is  packed  into  either  500 mg  aluminium  foil  sachets  or aluminium tubes (5, 10 and 15 grams) with polyethylene or polypropylene cap. Drug Substance Retapamulin  is  chemically  designated  as  (1 S ,2 R ,3 S ,4 S ,6 R ,7 R ,8 R ,14 R )-4-ethenyl-3-hydroxy-2,4,7,14tetramethyl-9-oxotricyclo[5.4.3.0 1,8 ]tetradec-6-yl{[(3exo )-8-methyl-8 azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3yl]thio}acetate, and its structure is as follows:.

Retapamulin is a white to pale yellow crystalline solid with a melting point range of 125-127 ° C. Two solid state forms exist, Form 1 and Form 2. These are distinguishable by their melting points, such that

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Form 1 has a melting point at 126°C whereas Form 2 has a melting point of 143°C. Form 1 is used commercially.

The solubility of retapamulin in water is 0.07mg/mL at 25 ° C. Its aqueous solubility is pH dependant and it decreases with increased pH. Retapamulin is also soluble in non-aqueous solvents, showing a greater than 10mg/mL solubility in both propylene glycol and ethanol at 25 ° C.

Retapamulin is  milled  to  produce  a  range  of  particle  sizes  which  are  measured  by  laser  diffraction analysis.

Stability studies were performed on three pilot scale batches of retapamulin. Batches were tested under ICH conditions of real time (25 ° C/60%RH) up to 36 months, intermediate (30 ° C/65%RH) up to 24 months  and  accelerated  (40 ° C/75%RH)  for  6  months.  Additionally,  photostability  studies  (ICH conditions: xenon source, 1.2 million lux hrs, UV 200 watts hours/m 2 ) were performed on all batches and  forced  degradation  /  stress  testing  was  performed  on  one  batch  (2  months  storage  at  -20 ° C, 40°C/75% RH/exposed, 50°C and 50°C/exposed). Stress study batches were examined for appearance, retapamulin content (HPLC), drug-related impurities (HPLC) and water content. These parameters as well  as  x-ray  powder  diffraction  were  examined  for  all  other  stability  studies.  Full  analytical  and validation details were provided for all tests. Up to 24 months data were provided.

Manufacture Retapamulin  is  manufactured  by  a  semi-synthetic  process,  starting  with  a  fermentation  step  from Clitopilus passeckerianus CP2 to yield the key intermediate pleuromutilin and then progressing via a 5-step synthetic process to give retapamulin. Details  and  spectra  were  provided  for  elemental  analysis, 1 H-NMR,  13 C-NMR,  MS,  IR  and  X-ray crystallography for the primary reference standard of retapamulin. The data confirmed the proposed structure. Specification The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identity (IR spectroscopy), assay (HPLC), solid state form (X-ray powder diffraction), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content, residue on ignition, optical rotation, microbial purity and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). The analytical methods used were sufficiently described and validated according to the ICH guideline on 'Validation of Analytical Methods'. The methods were suitable to control the active substance on a routine  basis.  The  IR  spectroscopy  method  was  validated  for  specificity,  the  XRPD  method was suitably  validated  with  respect  to  accuracy,  precision  (repeatability  and  intermediate  precision), reproducibility,  specificity,  limit  of  detection  and  robustness.  The  HPLC  method  for  retapamulin content and impurity content was validated with respect to specificity, linearity, precision, quantitation limit and stability of solutions. The GC method was validated respect to specificity, linearity, range, accuracy,  precision,  quantitation  limit  and  robustness. The  water  content  method  was  validated  for specificity,  linearity,  range  and  precision.  The  laser  diffraction  method  was  validated  for  range, accuracy, precision and robustness. Data were provided for four production scale batches manufactured at the proposed commercial site. Data  were  also  provided  for  three  additional  pilot  scale  batches.  All  batches  complied  with  the requirements in the active substance specification. Stability Medicinal product no longer authorised

Long term, intermediate and accelerated studies showed that all batches meet proposed specification limits. No significant changes or trends were observed in any parameters demonstrating chemical and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

physical stability of the active substance. No significant changes were observed for samples stored for two months at -20°C, 40°C/75% RH/exposed, 50°C and 50°C/exposed.

Photostability studies were carried out on three pilot scale batches of retapamulin. The results showed that the active substance is not affected by exposure to light.

Four batches manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site have been placed on stability.

The data provided is sufficient to confirm the proposed re-test period for the active substance. Drug Product Pharmaceutical Development The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  produce  a  topical  formulation  containing retapamulin that was of minimum complexity and displayed good product quality. Retapamulin was chosen for development as a topical antibacterial agent because it showed in-vitro antibacterial activity against  susceptible  and  multi-drug-resistant  organisms  commonly  associated  with  bacterial  skin infections.  It  was  found  that  there  was  minimal  systemic  exposure  and  rapid  metabolism  following topical administration. The  formulation  development  for  Altargo  was  based  on  an  already  approved  ointment  formulation marketed by the Applicant. It consists of the milling of the active substance followed by suspension in white  soft  paraffin.  Three  strengths  of  ointment  were  prepared,  0.5%,  1.0%  and  2.0%.  The  final proposed commercial formulation chosen was1.0% w/w ointment. The product is not sterilised but it is manufactured under clean conditions. The low water activity of the  matrix  is  unlikely  to  support  adventitious  microbial  growth.  The  product  is  also  tested  for microbial purity before release. Adventitious Agents The only excipient used in the formulation of retapamulin ointment is white soft paraffin which is not of animal origin. Manufacture of the Product The manufacturing process for Altargo uses standard pharmaceutical techniques for topical ointments, i.e.,  heating  and  homogenisation  of  the  white  soft  paraffin  followed  by  blending  of  the  active substance. The manufacture of the finished product comprises (1) heating and homogenisation of the white soft paraffin (2) blending of the active substance in the white soft paraffin while stirring (3) cooling of the product while stirring (4) filling process. The  ointment  is  filled  into  aluminium  tubes,  tested  and  released.  For  sachet  filling,  pre-shipping analytical testing is performed (description, identification, retapamulin content, drug related impurities, microbial limit test) before shipping to the filling site in Canada. On receipt at the filling site, ID testing is performed, the ointment sachets filled, tested and released. Medicinal product no longer authorised

There were no in-process controls during the manufacture of the ointment since process development studies showed the manufacturing method to be robust and capable of producing high quality product even  with  some  process  variation.  In-process  controls  applied  for  filling  of  aluminium  tubes  and sachets include weight, seal quality, product and package appearance. Prior to shipping for sachet fill, the bulk ointment is tested to the full release specification except for weight check.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Three  primary  stability  batches  were  prepared  using  three  different  batches  of  active  substances. Samples  taken  from  various  positions  in  the  mixing  vessel  (top,  middle,  bottom,  centre  of  vessel) showed acceptable results for retapamulin content, confirming a homogenous product. Further process scale up and optimisation were performed on eight commercial scale batches to determine the effect of operating parameters and drug particle size . Results confirmed that a reliable product was obtained.

## Product Specification

3.

The  majority  of  non-clinical  studies  were  conducted  with  the  free  base  of  retapamulin  (known  as SB275833), the form proposed for clinical use.

The  product  specifications  include  methods  for  appearance,  identification  and  assay  (HPLC),  drug related impurities (HPLC) and microbial purity. The drug product specifications have been justified and all methods of analysis have been described and adequately validated. Stability of the Product Data  was  provided  for  three  primary  manufactured  at  the  proposed  site  and  packed  into  either aluminium tubes (2.5, 5, 10 and 15g) or the sachet (500mg). All three batches were tested under ICH conditions of real time (25 ° C/60%RH, up to 36 months), accelerated (30 ° C/65%RH, up to 24 months) and stressed (40 ° C/75%RH, 6 months). The following parameters were tested for:  description, active substance content and drug-related impurities by HPLC at one month and then three month intervals. Microbial limit tests were performed initially and at 12, 24 and 36 months. All aluminium pack sizes were placed on stability testing but only 2.5g and 15g tubes were tested. The intermediate presentation sizes  (5g  and  10g)  would only be tested if  significant  change  had  been  seen  in  2.5g  and  15g  tubes stored at 25 ° C/60%RH. Several  additional  tests  were  performed  including  photostability  (four  batches  of  ointment  in aluminium  tubes  and  exposed  in  a  transparent  glass  Petri  dish  and  a  batch  of  bulk  ointment  in  a transparent glass Petri dish were tested (ambient laboratory light, 2 weeks)), stress conditions (four batches  of  ointment  in  aluminium  tubes  tested  at  50 ° C for  2  weeks),  low  temperature  storage  (one batch  of  ointment  in  an  aluminium  tube  was  tested  at  5 ° C  at  0,  1,  3  and  6  months).  Temperature cycling  (freeze  thaw)  and  forced  degradation  studies  were  also  performed.  Temperature  cycling showed no effects on the physical properties of the product. Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions, as stated in the SPC, are acceptable. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and drug product has been presented in a satisfactory way. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. Non-clinical aspects Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

All definitive safety pharmacology and toxicology studies, as well as analyses in support of the studies were performed in compliance with GLP regulations.

## Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamics

Retapamulin is a novel antimicrobial agent that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. The antimicrobial spectrum of activity was studied in vitro against a broad range of organisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes, anaerobes as well as biothreat organisms. In addition, in vivo efficacy of retapulmin  has  been  evaluated  in  animals  using  the  mouse  experimental  surgical  wound  infection model.

Further details of the microbiological properties of retapamulin are provided with the description of the clinical data (Pharmacodynamics). Secondary pharmacodynamics There were few findings in the secondary pharmacodynamic studies and none of clinical relevance in view of the very low systemic exposure in patients. Safety pharmacology programme Retapulmin was evaluated for potential adverse effects in a full series of safety pharmacology studies including cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system. Additionally, supplemental studies were performed to examine effects on renal and gastrointestinal system. Retapulmin  was  found  to  exhibit  some  binding  to  muscarinic  M1  receptor  in  vitro  and  diminished contractile  response  to  acetylcholine  in  isolated  guinea  pig  ileum  segments.  In  mice,  a  decrease  in intestinal  motility  was  seen  following  high  oral  dose,  as  well  as  analgesia  and  a  decrease  in  motor activity. Additional binding studies on muscarinic receptors were reassuring. In mice and rats small decrease in body temperature was noted, and transient and mild effects on blood pressure  and  heart  rate  occurred  following  high  oral  dose.  Intravenous  doses  were  associated  with vomiting,  trembling,  increased  heart  rate  in  the  dog,  and  decreased  blood  pressure  and  body temperature, seizures and deaths in the monkey. However, none of the adverse findings in safety pharmacology studies is of clinical relevance since the doses  administered  to  various  animal  species  would  have  resulted  in  most  instances  in  plasma concentrations several orders of magnitude greater than those achieved clinically. The same applies to the in vitro investigation of potential effects on QTc interval.  In this instance, the inhibition of hERG channels (IC50=3.3µg/ml) occurred at concentrations of at least 150x the highest human plasma concentration. Pharmacokinetics In vivo studies were conducted in the species used in the toxicity programme including rat (adult and neonatal), cynomolgus monkey, rabbit and minipig.  In addition to dermal application, toxicokinetic studies using the oral and intravenous routes were conducted in support of the repeated-dose toxicity studies. In vitro studies included those on metabolism as well as drug-drug interactions. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Absorption and distribution have been well characterised and metabolic studies indicate the existence of  more  than  100  metabolites.    Information  concerning  potential  inhibitory  activity  of  the  monooxygenated metabolites could not be provided because of their large number and low concentrations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Exposure following oral administration to rats  and monkeys established  suitable  safety  margins  for most of the few adverse findings in toxicity studies. Accumulation of drug-related material in some melanin-containing tissues - in particular the uveal tract - should not be of clinical concern.

Interaction  with  the  cytochrome  P450  system  has  been  fully  investigated.  Again,  there  were  no findings  of  clinical  concern  even  though  in  a  clinical  study  in  which  an  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) was co-administered there was an increase in systemic exposure by 81%.

Toxicology Single dose toxicity In rats, oral doses of 450mg/kg and IV doses of 10mg/kg were well tolerated.  In contrast, oral doses of 50mg/kg or greater administered to monkeys resulted in emesis. Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) High oral (450mg/kg) and iv (10mg/kg) doses were administered for 14 days to rats.  The main finding was hepatic enzyme induction with secondary effects on the thyroid. These findings are commonly seen in rats and should be considered a species-specific adaptive response. The main finding in monkeys was emesis at oral doses ≥ 50mg/kg administered for 14 days. Neither of these findings is considered to be of clinical concern. Toxicokinetics  has  been  well  quantified  and  the  data  provide  reassurance  for  the  topical  use  of retapamulin. Genotoxicity There was no evidence of genotoxicity when evaluated in vitro for gene mutation and/or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma cell assay, in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes, or when evaluated in vivo for chromosomal effects in a rat micronucleus test Carcinogenicity No carcinogenicity studies have been submitted Reproduction Toxicity The  applicant  conducted  standard  ICH3  fertility  and  teratogenicity  studies  but  did  not  include  a pre- and post-natal study.  However, juvenile toxicity studies were conducted. In an embryotoxicity study in rats, developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weight and delayed skeletal  ossification)  and  maternal  toxicity  were  observed  at  oral  doses  of ≥ 150  mg/kg/day (corresponding  to ≥ 3  times  the  human  estimated  exposure.    There  were  no  treatment-related malformations in rats Local tolerance Medicinal product no longer authorised

Dermal irritancy (and toxicity) studies on intact and abraded skin of rabbits using concentrations up to 5% revealed  evidence  of  irritancy  even  at  concentrations  lower  than  that  proposed  for  clinical  use (1%).  In contrast, there were no signs of erythema or oedema in minipigs when 5% retapamulin was applied to abraded skin for 10 days.

Other toxicity studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Data from sensitization studies in guinea pig and mouse have been superseded by findings in clinical use which indicate that 1% retapamulin is not a sensitizer in humans.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The environmental risk assessment of retapamulin followed primarily the draft of guidelines related to this issue. From the results obtained, it is concluded that retapamulin for topical use is of no immediate risk to the environment and no proposals for labelling provisions are necessary to reduce any potential environmental risks.

- Study 026 in which daily applications of 0.5%, 1% and 2% ointment were made for up to 7 days to large surface areas of intact skin (400 - 1600cm 2 ) and abraded skin (200cm 2 ). The study  included  an  assessment  of  retapamulin  metabolites  in  plasma  and  urine.  Ointment application was made by study personnel and spread evenly in four demarcated areas on the leg using a metal spatula. The application sites were then occluded with plastic film secured in place using an overlay of transparent dressing. Each dose was applied for 22.5 hours.

Discussion on the non-clinical aspects With the exception of oncogenicity studies and a pre- and post-natal study, the applicant has submitted an  otherwise  complete  and  appropriate  programme  of  toxicity  studies.  Compared  with  many  other xenobiotics  there  were  relatively  few  indications  of  toxicity.  The  most  significant  findings  were hepatotoxicity  with  subsequent  thyroid  toxicity  in  the  rat  and  emesis  in  monkeys.  These  are  given suitable consideration and it is convincingly argued that they are not of clinical concern. Retapamulin was not genotoxic. Reproduction toxicity was only observed in an embryotoxicity study in the rat, in which  reduced  fetal  weights  and  a  delay  in  ossification  of  the  skull  occurred  concurrently  with maternal  toxicity.  Juvenile  toxicity  studies  via  the  dermal  route  in  neonatal  rats  and  the  juvenile minipig did not reveal systemic toxicity.  The only adverse finding was minimal erythema. Contrary to CHMP advice provided during drug development, the applicant did not conduct further repeated-dose toxicity studies. The maximum duration of dosing therefore remains 14 days at the time of  submission  of  the  dossier.    However,  this  issue  is  considered  to  be  largely  superseded  by  the existing clinical data. 4. Clinical aspects Introduction GCP The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. Pharmacokinetics Data  were  obtained  from  healthy  subjects  and  from  patients  to  establish  the  extent  of  systemic exposure  to  retapamulin  after  topical  applications  of  various  strengths  of  ointment  to  intact  and abraded skin or superficial infected lesions.

In study 029 the  range of wound sizes was 0.04~100 cm 2 ,  with a median value of 1.40 cm 2 .  Blood samples were collected over 12 hours on Day 1 and Day 5 after the first daily dose and single samples were collected on Days 3, 4 and 7 to determine plasma levels. Only nine out of 355 samples (from seven out of 35 subjects) had measurable retapamulin concentrations, ranging from 0.5~4.3 ng/ml. All other  samples  were  &lt;  LOQ  (0.5  ng/ml).  There  was  no  trend  for  increasing  retapamulin  plasma concentrations with increasing wound size. The subject with the highest observed plasma concentration (4.3 ng/ml) had a wound size of 2.5 cm 2 while the subject with the maximum wound size (100 cm 2 ) had non-measurable concentrations.

1. n=4, 2. n=5, 3. n=6, 4. n=1 (subject 107), as others in this cohort withdrew before Day 7 Clearly there was higher systemic absorption in abraded vs intact skin with measurable exposures in Cohorts 7-12 on Day 1 but unquantifiable exposures in Cohorts 1-6 on Day 1. Also, after multiple applications to 1-200 cm2 of abraded skin the plasma concentrations were similar to those seen after multiple applications to 4-1600 cm2 of intact skin. With a 4-fold difference in ointment strength between Cohorts 7 and 9 but with the same application area, the AUC(0-24) and Cmax increased by less than 4-fold. For Cohort 8, with twice the application area  and  twice  the  strength  compared  to  Cohort  7,  the  increase  in  exposure  was  considerably  more than  4-fold.  These  findings  suggested  that  surface  area  is  more  important  in  determining  systemic exposure than strength of the ointment formulation. Medicinal product no longer authorised

During studies 30A  and  30B ,  single  plasma  samples  were  to  be  obtained  before  the  first  daily treatment at the on-therapy visit (Day 3 or 4 of treatment) for the first 500 patients ≥ 18 years of age across both studies. Single samples were also to be collected from all paediatric patients ( ≥ 9 months and &lt; 18 years old) that were to be randomly spread in one of three windows (0-4 h, 4-8h or 8-12h) following the first dose on Day 3 or Day 4.

Samples from 516 patients treated with retapamulin were analysed across both studies. These samples were apparently obtained at variable time points across the dosing interval even in adults although the exact spread of timings is not analysed. Nevertheless, the results indicated low systemic absorption following repeat administration of retapamulin 1% ointment twice daily on wounds with a mean area of about 8 cm2 (max up to 112 cm2).

Due  to  the  low  systemic  exposures  observed,  no  specific  studies  have  been  performed  in  special populations.

Thus there was no discernible relationship between plasma concentrations and age. The  percentage  of  patients  with  measurable  concentrations  appeared  to  increase  with  increasing wound size  presumably  due  to  the  larger  total  dose  administered.  However,  there  was  no  apparent relationship between wound size and the magnitude of the observed concentration. The percentage of measurable  samples  was  also  influenced  by  the  type  of  dressing,  with  lowest  proportions  for  nonocclusive,  increasing  to  semi-occlusive  and  again  when  an  occlusive  dressing  was  applied.  Semiocclusive and occlusive dressing groups were associated with higher plasma concentrations than the no dressing group. Distribution No data are available regarding distribution in man Elimination In Study 026, t1/2 could not be estimated due to the variability as well as the relatively flat PK profiles even on sampling for up to 36 h post-dose in Cohorts 6 and 12.

The available date indicated that renal and hepatic impairment and/or increasing age would not result in significantly higher systemic retapamulin exposure after topical application.

With  respect  to  use  in  infants  and  children  aged  from  9  months  to  2  years,  and  in  the  absence  of specific PK data from this age group, a review of relevant issues (such as changes in skin structure and

function  with  age,  CYP3A4  activity  and  renal  function)  supported  a  conclusion  that  the  systemic retapamulin exposures that would occur in patients aged 9 months to 2 years were unlikely to differ significantly from those that were observed in children aged 2-5 years.

· Retapamulin was shown to be a P-gp substrate and inhibited P-gp transport of digoxin with an IC50  of  28.2 µ M or  14601.3  ng/mL.  However,  the  maximum  individual  systemic  exposure  in humans  following  topical  application  of  1%  ointment  on  200  cm 2 of  abraded  skin  (Cmax=  22 ng/mL;  AUC(0-24)  =  238  ng.h/mL)  was  660-fold  lower  than  the  retapamulin  IC50 for  P-gp inhibition. · The in-vitro oxidative metabolism of [ 14 C] retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4 with minor contributions from CYP2C8 and CYP2D6. Co-incubation with the CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole or troleandomycin resulted in complete or partial inhibition of the formation of retapamulin metabolites. In-vitro metabolism of [ 14 C] retapamulin by human skin occurred to a very limited extent. Parent compound was the predominant radio-component with very low amounts of three mono-oxygenated metabolites. · In  human  liver  microsomes,  retapamulin  was  a  strong  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  when  midazolam (Ki 0.42 µ M  or  217.5 ng/mL), nifedipine (Ki 7.3 µ M  or  3779.8 ng/mL)  and  atorvastatin (Ki 0.75 µ M or 388.3 ng/mL) were used as substrates. Inhibition did not appear to be metabolismdependent.  However,  since  systemic  exposures  to  retapamulin  in  most  patients  with  secondary infected traumatic leasions were &lt; 0.5 ng/mL the applicant considered that application of the 1% ointment was unlikely to cause clinically relevant CYP 3A4 inhibition in patients. · The highest systemic exposure to retapamulin with topical application of 1% ointment (Cmax= 22 ng/mL;  AUC(0-24)  =  238  ng.h/mL)  was  3.5-fold  lower  with  respect  to  Cmax  and  similar  with respect to AUC compared to the lowest exposure (Cmax 77 ng/ml, AUC 319 ng.h/mL) that caused a slight induction of CYP enzymes in rats. In-vivo studies In study TOC101825 ,  healthy subjects applied retapamulin 1% ointment over 50 cm2 abraded skin alone and on the 4 th day of dosing with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily. Each application site was occluded for approximately 24 hours. There were statistically significant 1.8-fold increases in AUC(024) and Cmax when retapamulin ointment was administered with ketoconazole. However, none of the individual Cmax or AUC(0-24) values exceeded the highest values observed in study 026 (i.e. Cmax 22.12 ng/mL and AUC(0-24) 358 ng.h/mL) or the NOAEL for oral administration in monkeys. Despite the effect of ketoconazole on plasma levels this is unlikely to increase the incidence of adverse events so that no dose adjustment for retapamulin is recommended when it is co-administered with CYP-3A4 inhibitors. Pharmacodynamics Mechanism of action Medicinal product no longer authorised

Pleuromutilins inhibit the elongation phase of bacterial protein synthesis by interacting at a specific site  on  the  50S  subunit  of  the  prokaryotic  ribosome  that  is  distinct  from  binding  sites  of  other antibacterial  agents  with  a  ribosome-directed  mechanism  of  action.  This  binding  site  involves ribosomal protein L3 and is in the region of the ribosomal P site and peptidyl transferase centre. As a result the pleuromutilins block P-site interactions as well as inhibiting peptidyl transfer.

Inhibition of fmet-tRNA binding to the P-site in vitro suggests that pleuromutilins also have an effect on  translation  initiation  and  they  have  been  shown  to  prevent  the  normal  formation  of  active  50S

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ribosomal  subunits.  Therefore  inhibition  of  bacterial  protein  synthesis  possibly  occurs via multiple mechanisms.

## Primary pharmacology

Most of the in-vitro data on the antibacterial activity of retapamulin are derived from a large, global surveillance study of 6747 isolates collected from community- and hospital-associated skin and soft tissue  infections  (SSTIs)  in  2004  to  2005.  Testing  was  by  broth  microdilution  according  to  CLSI standard methodology.

¾ For S.  aureus retapamulin MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.06 and 0.12 µ g/ml, respectively, irrespective of the geographic region and all isolates were inhibited by 0.5 µ g/ml. Activity was unaffected  by  presence  of  the lukS and lukF genes  that  encode  for  the  Panton-Valentine Leucocidin (PVL) toxin or by resistance to methicillin, macrolides, fusidic acid or mupirocin. ¾ Against  1,918  isolates of S.  pyogenes the  MIC50/MIC90  values  for  retapamulin  were 0.03/0.03 µ g/ml. The highest MIC recorded was 0.25 µ g/ml. ¾ The  MIC50  and  MIC90  values  for  retapamulin  against  the  975  global  isolates  of  coagulasenegative staphylococci were both 0.06 µ g/ml and all were inhibited by 0.5 µ g/ml. ¾ Against  941  isolates  of S.  agalactiae, the  MIC50  and  MIC90  values  were  0.03 µ g/ml  and 0.06 µ g/ml and all were inhibited by 0.25 µ g/ml. ¾ Against  226  isolates  of  various  anaerobic  bacteria  the  overall  MIC90  for  retapamulin  was 2 µ g/ml. least susceptible were Bacteroides and Clostridium species. ¾ With  the  exception  of Haemophilus  influenzae and Moraxella  catarrhalis , retapamulin showed poor activity against Gram-negative organisms. Resistance to pleuromutilins appears to be possible through point mutations in ribosomal protein L3 (encoded by the rplC gene), which reduce binding at the peptidyl transferase centre. In laboratory studies two S. aureus isolates were consistently less susceptible to pleuromutilins relative to others in the species (MICs of 1 and 2 µ g/ml compared to ≤ 0.016-0.06 µ g/ml). Decreased activity seemed to be due to the presence of a transposon-borne gene (previously named vgaAv )  encoding a putative ABC transporter. Of 36 S. aureus confirmed to be quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant amongst  a  specific  collection  of  resistant  strains  from  the  SENTRY  programme,  30  possessed  the vgaAv gene and these,  but  not  the  other  6,  had  elevated  pleuromutilin  MICs  including  retapamulin MICs from 2-32 µ g/ml.  The  reduced  susceptibility  (retapamulin  MIC  of  64 µ g/ml)  exhibited  by  a single S. aureus isolate from global surveillance studies was due to the presence of a 5,782 base pair plasmid containing the vgaA efflux pump.

There were four cohorts in this study, each of which received 2, 14, or 21 days repeat dosing under an occlusive patch on either intact or abraded skin as follows:

- Cohort 1 received two 24-h topical applications of retapamulin and controls on intact skin.
- Cohort 2 as in 1 but on tape-stripped ( abraded ) skin
- Cohort 3 received twenty-one 24-h topical applications on intact skin
- Cohort 4 received fourteen 24-hour topical applications on tape-stripped ( abraded ) skin

Only  one  subject  demonstrated  sensitisation  to  retapamulin  at  concentrations  of  1%  and  2%.  No reaction was observed against placebo. This subject had challenge scores at 1 h and 48 h of 0.5 and 1  for  0.5%  retapamulin,  2  and  2  for  1%  and  1  and  2  for  2%  ointment  compared  to  0.5  and  0  for placebo.  After  re-challenge  the  readings  at  the  two  time  points  were  0  and  0.5  for  0.5%  ointment, 0 and 1 for 1%, 0.5 and 1 for 2% and 0 and 0.5 for placebo.

The 2% formulation and the positive control (0.5% SLS) were associated with a higher level of irritation relative to the patch control for both the average and maximum irritation scores. o The degree of cumulative irritation of induced by retapamulin (0.5%, 1% or 2%) on intact skin (Cohort 3) was less than that with the positive control (0.1% SLS). o For the abraded skin (Cohort 4), the score for the 2% retapamulin ointment was similar to that for the 0.1% SLS positive control the scores for 0.5% and 1% ointments were similar to the vehicle and sterile water controls. Study 027 assessed the potential for sensitisation of three strengths of retapamulin ointment (0.5%, 1% and 2%) and a vehicle placebo when applied under occlusion to a single cohort of subjects. There was  a  three-week  induction  period  during  which  time  there  were  nine  repeated  occluded  patch applications,  each  application  representing  approximately  48  or  72  h  skin  contact  time.  This  was followed by a 14-17 day rest phase and then a challenge phase that consisted of a parallel application of each study medication to naïve skin sites for approximately 48 hours. The challenge phase could be repeated once (with a second rest period of at least 4 weeks and one re-challenge using naïve test sites) for subjects with an intermediate, equivocal skin response to the first challenge. Each subject (N=232) received all four treatments in parallel during the induction, challenge and re-challenge (if applicable) phases. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Since it appeared that retapamulin has a low propensity to cause sensitisation and irritation and since study 027 included a challenge phase it seemed unlikely that there would be a marked increment in sensitisation  of  irritation  with  repeated  treatment  courses.

## Clinical efficacy

Dose response studies

The choice of 1% ointment has been based on achieving a balance between efficacy as demonstrated with various strengths in animal models of infection and the local irritation potential as demonstrated in  healthy  subjects.  The  choice  of  twice  daily  applications  was  based  on  animal  studies  in  which administration of ointment twice daily was as good as three times daily.

The restriction on the maximum area to be treated in all the studies and SPC (100 cm2 and/or 2% BSA in persons aged &lt; 18 years) was chosen based on considerations of systemic exposures and use across all age groups from 9 months upwards. Main studies The Phase III clinical development programme consisted of five double blind (placebo controlled or double dummy) studies in which retapamulin 1% ointment was applied twice daily for 5 days. 1 The primary population is Per Protocol Clinical (PPC) for all studies, except for 103469, for which it is IntentTo-Treat Clinical (ITTC). Numbers shown are those included in the primary analysis (i.e. primary population at the chosen primary endpoint) METHODS Study Participants Studies enrolled adults, adolescents, children and infants from the age of 9 months. An Independent Data  Monitoring  Committee  (IDMC)  reviewed  unblinded  safety  data  from  the  initial  600  patients enrolled into the two SITL studies (030A and 030B), which were initially limited to patients aged ≥ 13 years. Following the data review, the IDMC recommended that it was safe to reduce the minimum age  to  9 months.  In  studies  030A,  030B  and  the  SIDs  study  032,  enrolment  was  then  extended  to include patients from 9 months up to 13 years. The two studies in impetigo (TOC103649 and TOC 100244) were initiated later and so enrolled patients from 9 months of age from the outset. o In each indication a Skin Infection Rating Scale (SIRS) score ≥ 8 was required for study entry.

- o In  the  Impetigo  studies  (TOC103469  and  TOC100224) patients  had  a  clinical  diagnosis  of primary  impetigo  (bullous  or  non-bullous),  defined  as  a  lesion  or  group  of ≤ 10  lesions characterised  by  red  spots  or  blisters  without  crusts  that  later  progressed  to  lesions  which oozed and formed yellow or honey-coloured crusts surrounded by an erythematous margin.
- o In the SITL studies (030A and 030B) lesions were to include surgical wounds, burns, minor cuts and abrasions, lacerations and crush injuries, with local abscess formation subsequently possible.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o In  the  SID  study  (032) patients  were  to  have  secondarily-infected  atopic  dermatitis  [AD], psoriasis or allergic contact dermatitis [ACD]).

## Treatments

Retapamulin 1% ointment was applied twice daily for 5 days.  Sodium fusidate ointment was applied three  times  daily  for  7  days  and  cephalexin  was  given  for  10  days  at  500  mg  twice  daily  (or 12.5 mg/kg twice daily in children aged &lt; 13 years).

Use of gauze, bandage or similar to cover the lesions was permitted. Treatment was to continue for the full  duration  even  if  the  lesion(s)  had  fully  healed  but  could  be  terminated  at  any  time  if  the investigator decided that the infected lesion(s) had failed to respond. Systemic  antibacterial  agents  (other  than  the  assigned  comparator  in  SITL  and  SID  studies)  and steroids (other than up to 10 mg daily prednisolone or equivalent in the SIDs study) were prohibited during therapy and for 7 days after the end of therapy. Other systemic medications were allowed as usual. The use of topical therapeutic agents (including glucocorticoids, antibacterials and antifungals) was prohibited from 24 h (72 hours for the SID study)prior to study entry until the end of the study except that non-infected lesions in the SIDs study could be treated as deemed appropriate by the investigator. Antibacterial/antiseptic soaps, lotions or wipes were prohibited for use on the infected lesion(s) during the course of the study. In the SIDs study bleach baths were banned. Randomisation Randomisation was in a 2:1 ratio (retapamulin: placebo or active comparator). Objectives In each study the primary objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of retapamulin with active or placebo treatments (as appropriate) for the treatment of the indications under study. TOC103469  was  a  superiority  study  that  compared  retapamulin  with  placebo.  A  conclusion  of superior efficacy for retapamulin was to be drawn if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment difference in the ITTC population was greater than zero. TOC100224 was a non-inferiority study that compared retapamulin with sodium fusidate 2% ointment. A conclusion of non-inferior efficacy was to be drawn if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the treatment difference in the PPC population was ≥ -10%. 030A, 030B and 032 These  were  non-inferiority  studies  that  compared  retapamulin  with  cephalexin.  A  conclusion  of non-inferiority was to be drawn if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the treatment difference in the PPC population was ≥ -10%. Outcomes/endpoints Four patient populations were defined as follows: o Intent to Treat Clinical (ITTC): All randomised and treated (at least one dose). Medicinal product no longer authorised

- o Intent to Treat Bacteriology (ITTB): All ITTC patients with a baseline pathogen isolated from the primary lesion and sent to the central laboratory.
- o Per Protocol Clinical (PPC ): ITTC patients who did not violate the protocol.
- o Per Protocol Bacteriology (PPB): ITTB patients who did not violate the protocol.

In all studies the primary efficacy endpoint was the clinical response (success or failure).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o In the impetigo studies the primary endpoint was to be determined at the end of treatment (EOT) Visit in the ITTC (TOC103649) or PPC (TOC100224) population.
- o In the SITL (030A and 030B) and SIDs (032) studies the primary endpoint was to be determined at the follow-up visit in the PPC population.

In impetigo studies and SIDs studies, failures could be associated with either the principal lesion or other lesions and this was denoted in the classification of failures.

At  the  follow-up  visit,  success  rates  with  retapamulin  were  again  superior  to  those  in  the  placebo group in all four analysis populations. Failures at EOT were carried forward such that overall failure rates were 24.5% [34/139] for retapamulin and 60.6% [43/71] for placebo. Twelve retapamulin and 6 placebo group ITTC patients were deemed failures due to clinical recurrences.

Statistical methods The normal approximation, without continuity correction, was to be used to construct all confidence intervals. In addition to the comparisons made between treatments as described above each study included an evaluation  of  the  effect  of  age,  compliance,  centre,  baseline  SIRS  score  and  wound/lesion  size  at baseline. All of these covariates except for centre were included in logistic regression models. RESULTS Impetigo TOC103469 enrolled 213 patients of which 210 were treated, 84% were included in the PPC, 81% in the ITTB and 71% in the PPB populations. Most patients (81.3% retapamulin and 84.5% placebo) had non-bullous impetigo. The results at EOT were similar in the defined populations and in all cases the difference vs placebo exceeded 33% with lower 95% CI that exceeded 20%. Clinical Response at End of Therapy by Analysis Population No  statistically  significant  association  was  detected  between  any  of  age,  gender,  bullous  or  nonbullous impetigo, number of lesions, racial and ethnic groups and clinical response in the ITTC or PPC populations.

Clinical response by pathogen (next table) reflected the overall differences seen between active and placebo groups except for Gram-negative pathogens, which were not likely to have been true causative pathogens in this and other studies. Microbiological responses by patient and by pathogen were similar to  those  for  clinical  success  rates  since  eradication  was  almost  always  presumed  due  to  lack  of material for culture. Clinical response at EOT by pathogen (ITTC) Study TOC100224 enrolled 519 patients of which 517 were treated. The PP population accounted for 87% of the total  treated,  the  ITTB  population  consisted  of  394/517  (76%)  and  the  PPB  population contained 66% of the total treated. Nearly 80% of patients had non-bullous impetigo. Clinical success rates at EOT were numerically higher for retapamulin. In each comparison the lower limit  of  the  95%  CI  for  the  treatment  difference  was  greater  than  -1%.  In  the  PPC,  PPB  and  ITTB populations the lower limit of the confidence interval was greater than zero. Clinical response at EOT by analysis population Medicinal product no longer authorised

Due to the high efficacy rate, the normality assumption may not have been valid.

Baseline SIRS scores were shown to be a significant predictor of clinical and microbiological response with  higher  scores  resulting  in  lower  probabilities  of  success.  The  observed  data  indicated  no difference  in  retapamulin  success  rates  at  EOT  between  bullous  (69/70;  98.6%)  and  non-bullous (245/247; 99.2%) impetigo or between age strata (all 98-100%).

Clinical response at follow-up resulted in smaller differences between groups than seen at EOT. The lower  95%  CIs  were  within  -4%  for  all  populations  described  but  did  not  exceed  zero.  Of  the 35 retapamulin and 22 sodium fusidate patients in the ITTC population who had failed by the time of the follow-up visit 11 and 8 in respective groups had failed due clinical recurrence.

Clinical response at follow-up (Day 14) Clinical responses by pathogen showed numerical advantages for retapamulin against the two major species. Clinical success rate at EOT by pathogen (PPC) Microbiological success rates by patient and pathogen were very similar to clinical success rates. The fact that the applicant conducted one placebo-controlled and one active controlled study in this indication  was  considered  to  be  highly  appropriate.  The  placebo-controlled  study  established  the advantage of applying retapamulin in this condition. In the active-controlled study non-inferiority with respect to sodium fusidate was established satisfactorily. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Secondarily infected dermatoses (SID)

Study 032 enrolled 545 ITTC patients of which 85% were included in the PPC population. There was no baseline pathogen isolated from 41.3% retapamulin and 36.6% cephalexin patients and 10% of the ITTB population was excluded from the PPB population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the primary efficacy analysis (PPC population) patients with an outcome of Unable to determine (UTD) at EOT or at follow-up (FU) were counted as failures. Based on this analysis the lower CI for the  treatment  difference  was  just  within  -10%.  In  other  pre-defined  patient  populations  retapamulin gave consistently lower clinical success rates than cephalexin and the lower 95% CI were between -9.7 and -13.9.

Using the primary analysis approach the clinical success rates by underlying disease group at followup suggested that there might be a particular problem in atopic dermatitis as shown below. Clinical success at follow-up by underlying skin disease (PPC) The overall and sub-group treatment differences after removal of UTD patients were smaller and the 95% CI for the overall analysis were -6.4, 4.9.  Thus, removing the patients who were UTD at EOT and so declared failures at FU reduced the difference in success rates between treatments. However, both  types  of  analyses  would  be  expected  and  would  be  compared  for  consistency.  Thus,  there remained the problem that the findings were inconsistent. The reason for this inconsistency seemed to be the imbalance between groups in numbers and percentages that actually had an outcome of UTD at EOT that defaulted to failure at FU. However, this imbalance could not be explained, the discrepancy between analyses could not be dismissed and so the indication has not been granted. Secondarily infected traumatic lesions (SITL) Study 030A enrolled 996 patients of which 988 were treated. The PPC population consisted of 83.6% (826/988) of the ITTC population. Most of the patients (87% retapamulin and 86% cephalexin ITTC patients) had secondarily infected open wounds while the remainder had simple abscesses. At  follow-up  in  the  PPC  population  clinical  success  was  achieved  in  88.7%  (525/592)  treated  with retapamulin compared to 91.9% (239/260) treated with cephalexin.

.

At the EOT visit, the clinical success rates in  the  PPC  population  were  90.6%  for  retapamulin  and 93.0% for cephalexin. Similar findings applied to the ITTC, ITTB and PPB populations.

The logistic regression analysis found that clinical success was more likely when baseline SIRS scores were low. There was also a statistically significant association (Fisher's exact test) between clinical response and exudate/pus SIRS scores at follow-up (p&lt;0.001 for the retapamulin group and p=0.001 for the cephalexin group). The response rates in the PPC/PPB population suggested that retapamulin was particularly less efficacious than cephalexin in abscesses as shown in the table below.

The  tests  for  association  between  diagnosis  and  clinical  or  microbiological  outcomes  were  not significant  but  the  response  rates  in  the  PPC/PPB  population  suggested  that  retapamulin  was  less efficacious than cephalexin in abscesses as shown in the assessors' table below.

For  those  with  methicillin-susceptible S.  aureus or S.  pyogenes at  baseline  the  success  rates  at follow-up were similar between the treatment groups. However, against MRSA clinical success rates were 72.0% (18/25) for retapamulin and 81.8% (9/11) for cephalexin. Study 030B enrolled  922  patients  of  which  916  were  treated  and  the  PPC  population  consisted  of 83.6% [766/916] of the ITTC population. Most patients (around 85%) had secondarily infected open wounds rather than simple abscesses. At follow-up, clinical success was achieved in 90.4% retapamulin and 92.0% cephalexin patients in the PPC population. Clinical Response Rate at Follow-Up by Analysis Population At  the  EOT  visit  the  clinical  success  rates  in  the  PPC  population  were  92.7%  for  retapamulin  and 91.5% for cephalexin with 95% CI of -2.8%, 5.2%.

* Assessor's calculation derived using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. For S. aureus or S. pyogenes isolated at baseline the success rates at follow-up were generally similar between  the  treatment  groups  although  rates  for  those  with  MRSA  were  lower  (65.4%,  17/26)  for retapamulin compared to cephalexin (93.3%, 14/15), despite the fact that all laboratories would report all MRSA as resistant to cephalexin. Microbiological success rates  by patient  and  by  pathogen  at  follow-up  in  the  PPB  population  were very similar to clinical success rates. Pooled data from studies 030A and 030B showed that the clinical success rates at follow-up were 89.5% for retapamulin and 91.9% for cephalexin, with 95% CI of -5.4, 0.5. However: o For  secondarily-infected  open  wounds  95%  CI  around  the  observed  treatment  difference  of -2.2% were -5.4%, 1.0%. o For the -4.2% treatment difference for simple abscesses the 95% CI were -12.8%, 4.4%. While  these  studies  were  not  stratified  by  diagnosis  and  were  not  powered  to  provide  reliable comparisons between treatments within each diagnostic category, there appeared to be some problem for retapamulin in treating abscesses. . Pooled  data  reflected  the  individual  studies  in  showing  that  the  success  rates  for  retapamulin  were lower among patients enrolled in N. America and against MRSA compared to cephalexin despite the fact that all MRSA are deemed to be resistant to currently available cephalosporins. Tying up these observations, the applicant noted that the success rate for retapamulin against MRSA was considerably lower in North America (56%) than elsewhere (80% to 92%). In the SITL studies combined 86% had a secondarily infected open wound (SIOW) and 14% had a diagnosis  of  abscess.  Overall  a  higher  proportion  of  abscesses  were  associated  with S.  aureus and, specifically, with MRSA infections than seen with SIOW and this finding applied in both treatment groups. Therefore,  there  was  an  association  between  a  clinical  presentation  of  abscess  and  infection  with MRSA  and,  particularly,  with  Panton  Valentine  Leucocidin  (PVL)-positive  USA300  Community Acquired -MRSA. Based  on  the  findings  retapamulin  has  not  been  approved  for  treating  abscesses  and  has  not  been approved for treating any infection when due to MRSA (regardless of PVL status and clone).

## Clinical safety

Patient exposure

In the studies in healthy subjects the maximum exposure was to 2% ointment applied to 1600 cm2 intact skin or to 100 cm2 abraded skin once daily for 7 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  Phase  III  studies  there  were  2115  patients  treated  with  retapamulin  1%  ointment.  In  studies 030A, 030B and 032 the double blind design meant that these patients were also exposed to matching placebo to cephalexin (suspension or tablet). Another 35 patients were exposed to retapamulin 1% ointment in the Phase II study 029.

## Adverse events

Healthy subjects Multiple  applications  to  intact  skin  and  single  and  multiple  applications  to  abraded  skin  were occasionally accompanied by folliculitis, vesicles, burning or warmth, pruritus, oedema or erythema at the application site. Contact dermatitis was reported in one subject. In the three studies that examined local  irritation  and  sensitisation  potential  the  only  AEs  of  note  that  were  recorded  as  related  to retapamulin were TSH increase, LFT increase, myalgia, pruritus and maculopapular rash. Continuous  Lead-II  cardiac  monitoring  and  multiple  scheduled  12-Lead  ECGs  were  analysed automatically and after  manual readings by a cardiologist. No clinically significant association was found between retapamulin applications and ECG changes. Patients The overall incidence of AEs among retapamulin-treated patients was similar to total AE rates in other treatment groups. Incidences of individual AEs were low for all treatment groups, with the majority occurring in &lt;1% of patients. The majority of AEs were mild to moderate in intensity and only 1-2% in total per treatment group had an AE that was rated as severe.

AEs coded to the general disorders and administration site conditions were reported by 3% of pooled retapamulin patients [95% CI:  2.0%, 3.4%] and 4% in the placebo group [0.88%, 11.86%] of study TOC103649.  However,  AEs  in  this  SOC  were  reported  by  &lt;1%  in  the  pooled  cephalexin  group [0.34%, 1.75%] even though the dummy ointment applied was the same as the placebo ointment in TOC103649.  Application  site  AEs  were  not  reported  by  any  patient  who  applied  sodium  fusidate ointment. AEs related to application and instillation site (ITTC: Phase III Combined) Logistic  regression  analyses  performed  on  patients  treated  with  retapamulin  did  not  show  any correlation  between  AEs  (and  in  particular  AEs  related  to  application  site  reactions)  and  the  total wound  size  at  baseline.  There  did  not  appear  to  be  a  relationship  between  dressing  type  and application  site  irritation  but  due  to  the  small  numbers  no  definitive  conclusion  can  be  drawn.  For retapamulin  there  were  generally  similar  AE  reporting  rates  across  the  different  age  categories  and between  genders. Logistic regression analyses performed  for the retapamulin group did not demonstrate any relationship between age and AEs. There were differences between racial groups and regions but these followed a similar pattern as for the other treatment groups and so more likely reflect different patient/investigator attitudes to reporting.

The  overall  frequency  of  drug-related  AEs  was  low,  with  the  highest  rate  of  7%  reported  in  the cephalexin  group.  The  only  individual  drug-related  AEs  that  were  reported  in  at  least  1%  were application site irritation (1%) in the retapamulin group and diarrhoea (2%) in the cephalexin group. The drug-related AEs in the placebo group included application site pruritus (1%) and application site paraesthesiae (1%).

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

There were two deaths reported in Phase II/III studies, both of which occurred in study 030A and in the retapamulin group. However, these were considered to be unrelated to retapamulin.

There were no SAEs in study 029 or in the sodium fusidate ointment or placebo groups in Phase III studies while &lt; 1% of patients had SAEs in the retapamulin and cephalexin groups. The only SAE reported in &gt; 1 patient was cellulitis, which occurred in two patients treated with retapamulin and one treated with cephalexin. However, in each case the cellulitis was not related to the wound that was being treated in the study.

Laboratory findings Healthy subjects In  study  026 ,  thyroid  function  (TFT)  was  monitored  (free  T3  and  T4  and  TSH).  Overall 8  retapamulin  patients  had  any  treatment  emergent  elevation  in  LFTs  and  four  had  any  abnormal TFT. However, there was no relationship between exposure to retapamulin and abnormalities in these or  any  other  laboratory  test.  Four  retapamulin  subjects  had  elevations  in  liver  function  tests  of potential clinical concern that were treatment emergent. One of these had the elevation noted as an AE although the most marked abnormality was an ALT of 141 IU/L. However, he was in the group allocated to 2% ointment to 1600 cm2 of intact skin and he did have the highest plasma exposure in the  study  (day  7  AUC  358  ng.h/ml)  with  the  second  highest  Cmax  (20  ng/ml).  Two  others  had abnormal glucose values and two had raised potassium levels on a single day. In  study  025 abnormalities  of  potential  clinical  concern  included  two  with  elevated  LFTs  but  the highest values were &lt; 200 IU/L. TSH, free T3 and free T4 were obtained at screening and at 24 h after  the  last  patch  application  for  all  subjects.  Levels  were  also  measured  on  Day  8  of  dosing  for subjects  that  received  14  or  21  days  of  repeat  dosing.  No  significant  changes  were  noted  in  the median values of free T3, free T4 or TSH. Two subjects had slightly elevated TSH at FU but normal free T3 and T4. In the ketoconazole interaction study ( TOC101825 )  TSH was measured at screening and FU (7-14 days  after  dosing  ended)  and  at  pre-specified  times  during  each  regimen.  Free  T4  values  were obtained  for  subjects  with  abnormal  TSH  values.  No  trends  in  median  TSH  were  noted  but  two subjects at one time-point each had TSH abnormalities during ketoconazole dosing alone. In  study  034 there  were  several  subjects  with  raised  blood  glucose  at  follow-up  but  none  was considered to be clinically significant. Patients For all the clinical laboratory values, there were no large mean changes from baseline for the total population or for the individual age strata. Also, numbers of patients with values outside the normal reference range was low throughout the study for all treatment and age groups. The  incidence  of  shifts  from  normal  to  high  or  low  blood  glucose  values  was  similar  across  the treatment groups in each age category.

Healthy subjects

In  026  there  were  5  subjects  discontinued  retapamulin  due  to  AEs  and  all  were  in  the  maximum exposure group (2% ointment once daily for 7 days to 100 cm2 abraded skin) of which four subjects had papules and vesicles and one had erythema at the application site.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Patients

In Phase III studies, AEs leading to withdrawal were reported with a similar and low incidence ( ≤ 2% in  any  group)  with  each  treatment.  The  most  commonly-reported  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  were cellulitis and diarrhoea, each occurring in two patients in the retapamulin and cephalexin groups, while vomiting led to withdrawal in four patients in the cephalexin group only.

Discussion on clinical safety

There were no major concerns raised by the data. 5. Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system The  CHMP considered that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements. Risk Management Plan The MAA submitted a risk management plan. The applicant proposed that the low systemic exposure and rapid clearance of retapamulin means that the potential for adverse reactions is small. It is acknowledged that hypersensitivity reactions resulting in systemic effects such as angioedema, urticaria and anaphylaxis could occur. Contact dermatitis was encountered  in  clinical  studies.  There  will  be  monitoring  of  literature  and  spontaneous  reports  to investigate  any  possible  association  between  retapamulin  use  and  hypersensitivity  reactions.  It  is considered that there is no need for a specific risk minimisation plan. Table Summary of the risk management plan Medicinal product no longer authorised

| Development of resistance to retapamulin Medicinal | GSK will conduct a European surveillance study. The objective of this surveillance study will be to monitor for changes in the in vitro activity of retapamulin against pathogens relevant to the approved indications (i.e. S. aureus and beta- haemolytic streptococci). The study will begin two years after the approval of Altargo, and will be conducted in compliance with CHMP guidelines. Isolates studied will be confined to those very recently recovered from patients. If possible, the data will predominantly reflect community-acquired infections. These investigations will be supplemented by provision of publicly available data on susceptibility derived from reliable sources (e.g. reference public health laboratories) in EU Member States. Regarding the CHMP's requests to seek patients who have failed to respond to retapamulin for testing and to include genetic characterisation of S. aureus , GSK agree to discuss these formally with the Rapporteur, Co-Rapporteur and CHMP product | No risk minimisation strategies are necessary at this time |

| Off-label use in very young paediatrics | GSK will conduct a PK study in paediatric subjects aged 2 months and older to determine whether there is an increase in systemic exposure in these subjects. GSK will monitor prescription data in Europe and USA, in order to identify the extent of off-label prescribing and use in the paediatric population, and to aid the analysis of adverse events. GSK will perform this analysis on an annual basis for the first five years post-launch. | No risk minimisation strategies are necessary at this time |

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation Quality The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted.   However, retapamulin is not shown to be genotoxic. In an embryotoxicity study in rats, developmental toxicity and maternal toxicity were observed at oral doses  of ≥ 150  mg/kg/day.    No  studies  to  evaluate  effects  of  retapamulin  on  pre-/postnatal development were performed.  Appropriate warnings have been incorporated in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the Summary of Product Characteristics. Efficacy The  efficacy  of  Altargo  has  been  shown  in  randomised,  controlled  studies  in  which  retapamulin achieved similar clinical and microbiological success rate to comparative therapies for the treatment of impetigo  and  infected  small  lacerations,  abrasions  or  sutured  wounds.    However,  the  efficacy  of retapamulin in abscesses and in infections due to MRSA was inadequate.  Hence, retapamulin has not been approved for the treatment of abscesses or for the treatment of any infections known or thought likely to be due to MRSA.  In addition, retapamulin was not approved for the treatment of secondary infected dermatoses. From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Medicinal product no longer authorised
