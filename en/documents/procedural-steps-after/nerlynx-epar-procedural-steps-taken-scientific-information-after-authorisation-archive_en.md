2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0029             | Update of section 5.2 of the SmPC in order to add information on distribution and on the effect of neratinib on CYP substrates based on non-clinical studies XT218036 and 20325317; Study XT218036 was designed to evaluate neratinib as a substrate of the human transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and study 20325317 objective was to determine the inactivation kinetic constants (kinact and KI) of Neratinib and M6 for the human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes 2B6 and 3A4 using pooled human liver microsomes (HLM). In addition, MAH is also taking this opportunity to introduce editorial changes. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 10/11/2022 | 26/05/2023 | SmPC     | In vitro studies demonstrated that neratinib and its main metabolite M6 are not substrates of hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1*1a and OATP1B3 at relevant clinical concentration. Neratinib and metabolite M6 were not potent direct inhibitors of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, or 3A4 and no time-dependent inhibition is expected.

The MAH has also taken the opportunity to make some corrections in the SmPC and package leaflet. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 15/10/2020   | 25/10/2021 | SmPC and PL | The median OS follow-up time in study 3144A2-3004-WW was 8.03 years in the neratinib arm and 8.10 years in the placebo arm, with 746 (52.5%) patients in the neratinib arm and 796 (56.1%) patients in the placebo arm followed up for survival for 8 or more years. The number of deaths was 127 (8.9%) in the patients treated with neratinib and 137 (9.6%) in the patients treated with placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the Nerlynx and the placebo arm [HR 0.96 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.22)] in the ITT population at a median follow-up of 8.06 years. In the hormone receptor positive population who were less than one year from completion of trastuzumab therapy, the median follow-up was 8.0 years in the neratinib arm and 8.1 years in the placebo arm, with 671 (23.6%) patients in the neratinib arm and 668 (23.5%) patients in the placebo arm followed up for survival for 8 or more years.

Update of sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update the pharmacokinetics properties of neratinib and amend drug-drug interaction (DDI) information with CYP3A4/P-gp inducers and inhibitors based on two ADME studies (PUMA-NER-0105 and PUMA-NER-0102), a PBPK model report and in vitro studies; the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make minor corrections to the PI and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10 and SmPC Guideline. Update of sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update DDI information with H2- receptor antagonists and add DDI information with loperamide based on two DDI studies (PUMA-NER- 0104, PUMA-NER-0103); the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance | 25/06/2020 | 27/07/2020 | SmPC and PL | Concomitant treatment with strong or moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors is not recommended due to risk of increased exposure to neratinib. If the inhibitor cannot be avoided, Nerlynx dose adjustment should be applied. Nerlynx dose should be reduced to 40 mg taken once daily with a strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor. Nerlynx dose should be reduced to 40 mg taken once daily with a moderate CYP3A4/P-gp. If well tolerated, the dose can be increased to 80 mg for at least 1 week, then to 120 mg for at least 1 weeks, and to 160 mg as a maximal daily dose. Patient should be monitored carefully, especially GI effect including diarrhoea and hepatotoxicity. After discontinuation of a strong or moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor, the previous dose of Nerlynx 240 mg can be resumed. Concomitant treatment with moderate CYP3A4 and P-gp inducer is not recommended as it may lead to a loss of neratinib efficacy. Co-administration with the following medical products that are strong inducers of the CYP3A4/P- gp isoform of cytochrome P450 is contraindicated: carbamazepine, phenytoin (antiepileptics); St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) (herbal product); rifampicin (antimycobacterial). |
