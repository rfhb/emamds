## 1. Introduction

On November 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for pregabalin, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The  MAH  stated  that  Study  A0081231  titled  'A  6-Month,  Open-Label  Safety  Trial  of  Pregabalin  in Adolescent Patients with Fibromyalgia' is an open-label extension study of the double-blind randomized fibromyalgia parent Study A0081180 (hereafter referred to as the 'parent study').

The document provides data regarding the safety and efficacy of pregabalin in adolescent patients (12 years to 17 years old at time of enrolment in the parent study). No claims are attached to this study.

Pregabalin (LYRICA) is an α 2δ ligand that binds with high affinity to this auxiliary subunit of voltagegated calcium channels in central nervous system tissues. Pregabalin has been developed clinically for neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, anxiety, and epilepsy. It is approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain in adults, as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalization, and for the treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder in adults. Pregabalin is not approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia in the EU.

In  the  United  States  (US),  LYRICA  is  approved  for  fibromyalgia,  neuropathic  pain  (associated  with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, spinal cord injury, or post herpetic neuralgia), and adjunctive therapy for adult patients with partial onset seizures. LYRICA is approved for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in Japan.

## 2.2. Clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report(s) for Study A0081231 (hereafter study 1231) titled 'A 6-Month, Open-Label Safety Trial of Pregabalin in Adolescent Patients with Fibromyalgia' in which 63 subjects were enrolled which was an open-label extension study of the double-blind randomized fibromyalgia parent Study A0081180 thereafter referred to as the 'parent study'). Patients were 12 to 17 years old at  time  of  enrolment  in  the  parent  study.  The  last  subject's  last  study  visit  (LSLV)  in  this  trial  was completed on 01 June 2015.

Pregabalin is indicated in the EU only in adults for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain, as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation, and for Generalised Anxiety Disorder. The indication fibromyalgia has been rejected in the past because the effect was only demonstrated in the US population but not in EU studies.

## 2.2.2. Clinical study

## Description

Study  1231  was  an  open-label  extension  study  of  the  double-blind  randomized  fibromyalgia  parent Study A0081180, thereafter referred to as the 'parent study'. Altogether 63 subjects were enrolled. They were 12 to 17 years old at the time of enrolment in the parent study. The last subject's last study visit (LSLV) in this trial was completed on 01 June 2015.

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The objective of this study was to further evaluate the safety of pregabalin in a flexible dose regimen.

## Study design

After the termination visit and study drug taper in the parent study, subjects had an option of starting open-label treatment in Study 1231. The study consisted of 3 phases: dose optimization (3 weeks), flexible dose (21 weeks), and follow-up/taper (1 week).

## Study population /Sample size

Eligible subjects in Study 1231 had to meet the inclusion criteria from the parent study (age 12 years to  17  years  old  at  time  of  enrolment  in  the  parent  study,  and  the  Yunus  and  Masi  criteria  for fibromyalgia), received double-blind study drug in the parent study, completed the study and wished to take open-label pregabalin.

A  total  of  63  subjects  were  screened,  enrolled,  and  treated  with  pregabalin  in  this  study.  The  first subject was enrolled on 01 September 2010, and the LSLV was on 01 June 2015. The 63 subjects were recruited at 19 study centers: US (14 centers; 40 subjects), India (4 centers; 20 subjects), and Czech Republic (1 center; 3 subjects). Of the 63 subjects, 33 (52.4%) subjects had previously been treated in the parent study with pregabalin, and 30 (47.6%) subjects with placebo.

## Treatments

Subjects initiated pregabalin dosing at 75 mg/day and, based on tolerability and response, had their dose optimized over 3-weeks with continuation of 75 mg/day or had their dose escalated to 150, 300, or 450 mg/day. At the end of the study, subjects tapered the pregabalin dose over a 1-week period.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint in this study was the Pain Numeric Rating Scale (pain NRS).

## Statistical Methods

The efficacy analysis set included all subjects who had received at least 1 dose of study drug. There was no specific, predetermined sample size and the number of subjects enrolled was determined by the number of subjects who wanted to receive open-label pregabalin after participating in the parent study. Data for all subjects treated in the study were combined and labelled as pregabalin.

Pain NRS results were listed and summarized by treatment using descriptive statistics: n, arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, maximum and range.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No inferential or statistical testing was performed. The pain NRS is a 0 to 10 scale, with higher scores reflecting worse pain.

The baseline for pain NRS summaries was defined as the last score prior to pregabalin treatment, as follows:

· For subjects randomized to pregabalin in the parent study, the baseline was defined as the last score prior to treatment in that study (Visit 2, randomization).

· For subjects randomized to placebo in the parent study, the baseline was defined as the last score prior to treatment in Study 1231 (Visit 1).

## Results

## Baseline data

Baseline data are presented in table 1. The majority of subjects (53 of 63) were female. All but 2 of the female subjects (3.8%) had experienced menarche. Mean (range) age of all subjects was 14.8 (12 to 17) years. The majority of subjects were White (55.6%) or Asian (31.7%). All 63 subjects had been experiencing fibromyalgia symptoms for a mean of 2.5 years (range: 0.6 years to 11.5 years) and were diagnosed with fibromyalgia for a mean of 0.8 years (range: 0.3 years to 3.9 years) prior to study start, based on the medical history data provided at the start of the parent study. All 63 subjects met the Yunus and Masi criteria at the start of the parent study.

## Efficacy results

Table 2 presents improvement in pain during the study. A mean (SD) pain score improvement from baseline of 2.1 (2.51) points was observed at Week 3, the first post-treatment assessment. Similar levels of pain improvement were maintained throughout the study. Mean  (SD) pain score improvements were 1.8 (2.95) points at Week 8, and 2.1 points at Weeks 16, 24, and at last visit on study  (SD:  2.60,  2.56,  and  2.47,  respectively).  Pain  score  improvements  were  observed  and maintained regardless of whether subjects had previously received pregabalin or placebo in the parent study.

## Safety results

The safety analysis set consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.

There were no deaths in this study.

AE: Table 3 presents Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) which were experienced by ≥ 5% of subjects. A total of 45 (71.4%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE; these were considered related to study drug in 29 (46.0%) subjects. The most frequently reported TEAEs were dizziness and fatigue, reported for 14 (22.2%) and 8 (12.7%) subjects, respectively.

The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. At least 1 severe TEAE was reported for 6 (9.5%)  subjects:  pneumonia,  migraine,  appendicitis,  mood  swings,  arthralgia,  joint  instability,  and disturbance  in  attention,  of  which  migraine,  mood  swings,  and  disturbance  in  attention  were considered to be related to the study drug

SAE: There were 3 (4.8%) subjects who had serious adverse events (SAEs) during the study. These resulted in hospitalization due to: migraine, appendicitis, and joint instability, all of which were severe events. The SAEs of appendicitis and joint instability were not considered related to the study drug and resolved.  The  SAE  of  severe  migraine  was  considered  related  to  the  study  drug  and  resolved  with sequelae; the sequela of the SAE was a moderate migraine not considered by the investigator to be an SAE.

There were 2 (3.2%) subjects who had TEAEs leading to discontinuation of the study drug.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Dizziness,  fatigue  and  nausea  in  1  subject  were  considered  related  to  the  study  drug,  and  spinal stenosis in 1 subject was  considered  related to the disease process. All events  leading to discontinuation resolved.

There  were  no  AEs  related  to  suicidal  ideations  or  behaviour,  including  no  suicide  attempts  or completed  suicides.  Suicidality  assessments  (STS,  C-SSRS)  did  not  report  any  suicidal  behaviour. During  the  study,  6  (9.5%)  subjects  reported  suicidal  ideation  without  plan  or  intent  on  the  STS questionnaire; these 6 subjects had a history of suicidal ideation on the STS at the baseline of the parent study.

Weight gain of at least 7% was reported for 18 (29.0%) subjects. There were no clinically relevant findings in physical examination, neurological examination, vital signs, laboratory test results, Tanner staging, and ECG. There were no positive pregnancy test results or pregnancies during the study.

Notes: If the same subject in a given treatment had more than 1 occurrence in the same preferred term event category, only the most severe occurrence was taken. Subjects were counted only once per treatment in each fow. For the algorithm, any missing severities have been imputed as severe unless the subject experienced another occurrence of the same event in a given treatment for which severity was recorded. In this case, the reported severity was summarized. Missing baseline severities were imputed as mild. Includes data up to 999 days after last dose of study drug. Percentages of gender specific events were calculated using the corresponding gender count as denominator. Preferred terms ordered by incidence. Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), v18.0, coding applied.

Abbreviations: MedDRA = Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities; N = total number of subjects; n = number of subjects within a category (expressed as a percent).

## 2.2.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The adverse event (AE) profile observed in this study was consistent with the known safety profile for pregabalin as reported in the SPC.

Pregabalin is not indicated for children and adolescents and the SPC indicates that safety and efficacy of pregabalin has not been established in children and adolescents and that therefore no recommendation  on  a  posology  can  be  made.  The  SPC  also  indicates  that  pregabalin  safety  profile observed in two paediatric studies was similar to that observed in the adult studies.

It  is  considered  that  although  some  of  the  safety  issues  observed  in  the  study,  specifically  mood swings  and  weight  gain,  may  have  different  implications  for  children  as  compared  to  adults,  since

pregabalin is not indicated for the paediatric population, the new evidence does not change the B/R balance  of  pregabalin.  In  addition,  the  evidence  observed  in  this  study  is  already  reflected  in  the product information of pregabalin and therefore, no further actions are required in this respect.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The MAH has submitted a paediatric safety study for pregabalin which included 63 adolescents with fibromyalgia. The results show no new safety issue and the MAH is not requesting any changes to the product information based on this study.

Pregabalin is not indicated for children and adolescents and the SPC indicates that safety and efficacy of pregabalin has not been established in children and adolescents and that therefore no recommendation  on  a  posology  can  be  made.
