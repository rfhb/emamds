## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Patients were administered nilotinib 230 mg/m2 bid, administered hard capsules in dosage strengths of 50 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

CAMN107A2120,  'A  multi-center,  open-label,  pharmacokinetic  study  of  oral  nilotinib  in  paediatric patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase (CP) Ph+ CML, with CP or accelerated phase (AP) Ph+ CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, or with refractory/relapsed Ph+ ALL'.

At  present  Tasigna  (nilotinib)  is  indicated  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  for  the  treatment  of  adult patients with:

- newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase,
- chronic phase and accelerated phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib.

Nilotinib is administered orally and is available as hard capsule in dosage strengths of 150 mg and 200 mg.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study CAMN107A2120

CAMN107A2120,  'A  multi-center,  open-label,  pharmacokinetic  study  of  oral  nilotinib  in  paediatric patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase (CP) Ph+ CML, with CP or accelerated phase (AP) Ph+ CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, or with refractory/relapsed Ph+ ALL'.

## Description

## Methods

## Objective

The  primary  objective  of  the  multi-center,  open-label  phase  I  [Study  CAMN107A2120]  was  to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of nilotinib in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed CP-Ph+ CML, or CP or AP-Ph+ CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, or relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) treated at the proposed dose of 230 mg/m2 twice daily (bid). The dose of 230 mg/m2 bid in this population was based on the adult recommended dose (400 mg bid) scaled to body surface area (BSA).

The secondary objectives included the assessment of safety and activity (hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular responses) of nilotinib in paediatric patients.

## Study design

Study CAMN107A2120 was a multi-center, open-label study to characterize the PK of nilotinib in the study population administered as 230 mg/m2 bid to paediatric patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study population /Sample size

The planned study population was 14 paediatric patients (maximum of 24 patients): 7 patients ages 1 year  to  &lt;  10  years  (Group  1)  and  7  patients  ages ≥ 10  years  to  &lt;  18  years  (Group  2)  with imatinib/dasatinib resistant/intolerant Ph+ CML in CP or AP, or Ph+ ALL refractory/relapsed to standard therapy.  The  analyzed  study  population  included  15  paediatric  patients:  8  patients  (7  were  PKevaluable) ages 1 year to &lt; 10 years (Group 1) and 7 patients ages ≥ 10 years to &lt; 18 years (Group 2).

## Treatments

Patients were administered nilotinib 230 mg/m2 bid (except for Cycle 1 Day1 in which a daily dose was administered), orally, rounded to the nearest 50 mg (maximum single dose 400 mg) for 28 days (1 cycle) for up to 12 cycles prior to protocol amendment 3 and up to 24 cycles post amendment 3. Upon completion of a minimum of 12 cycles (28 days per cycle) of treatment, patients who were benefiting from the treatment with nilotinib, as determined by the Investigator, were offered the option to receive extended therapy with nilotinib.

The selection of dose was based on the following:

The approved adult dose of nilotinib for the treatment of imatinib resistant / intolerant Ph+ CML in CP or  AP  is  400  mg  bid.  The  equivalent  dose,  based  on  an  average  BSA  of  1.73  m2  in  adults,  is  230 mg/m2  bid,  which  was  the  dose  investigated  in  this  study.  Additional  reasons  for  the  use  of  230 mg/m2 bid include:

- The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nilotinib was determined to be 600 mg bid (equivalent to approximately 350 mg/m2), and the proposed 230 mg/m2 bid dose for paediatric patients is below this MTD.
- It  is  desirable  to  achieve  the  same  exposure  in  paediatric  patients  as  in  adult  patients, considering similar pathology of the disease and expression of BCR-ABL oncoprotein in both adult and paediatric patients.
- The use of 400 mg bid in adults and either 300 mg bid or 400 mg bid in a limited number of paediatric patients in the Compassionate Use Program revealed a favorable safety profile.

On Day 1, only a single  230  mg/m2  dose  of  nilotinib  was  administered  in  the  morning  in  order  to obtain the full PK profile over 24 hours.

## Statistical Methods

Full analysis set (FAS): consists of all patients who passed the screening and are enrolled into the study. Patients may or may not have taken study drug. The FAS is used for all demographic and baseline characteristics, unless otherwise specified.

Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PAS): consists of all patients who received the nilotinib dose on Day 1, had an evaluable Day 1 PK profile or provided at least one evaluable steady state trough concentration. The PK set was used for all the concentration summaries and plots, and all the PK parameter summaries and analyses unless otherwise specified.

Safety set: consists of all patients who received at least one dose of nilotinib. The Safety set was used for all core safety summaries and all Section 14 listings, unless otherwise specified.

Fifteen patients in two age groups were enrolled in the study (Group 1: ages 1 year to &lt; 10 years: 8 patients; Group 2: ages ≥ 10 years to &lt; 18 years: 7 patients).

Overall, 7 (7/15, 46.7%) patients completed treatment as per protocol (Group 1: 5 (62.5%) patients; Group  2:  2  (28.6%)  patients).  The  primary  reason  for  treatment  discontinuation  was  new  cancer therapy in 6 (40%) patients (Group 1: 3 (37.5%) patients; Group 2: 3 (42.9%) patients). Of note, among the 6 patients with new cancer therapy, 1 patient with Ph+ ALL had a CRp and then had a stem cell transplant with subsequent treatment with chimeric antigen receptor, and five patients with CML were considered to have an inadequate response, four of whom went onto stem cell transplant, and the fifth patient, was switched to dasatinib. Additionally, 1 (14.3%) patient in Group 2 discontinued treatment due to an AE and disease progression.

## Data sets analyzed

The data analysis sets are shown in Table 11-1:

- FAS: all eligible patients enrolled in the study. Patients may or may not have taken study drug.
- PAS: all patients who received the nilotinib dose on Day 1, had an evaluable Day 1 PK profile or provided at least one steady-state trough concentration.
- Safety set: all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.

The FAS was used for all efficacy analyses, demographic and baseline characteristics, and listings. The safety set was used for safety analysis. Of note, in this study, because all enrolled patients actually received study medication, the FAS and safety sets are identical and include all patients. The PAS was used for the PK analysis. One patient in Group 1: ages 1 year to &lt; 10 years had PK samples collected that were deemed not evaluable due to a storage temperature excursion at the investigative site.

## Disease history

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, 11 Ph+ CML patients had a median time since initial diagnosis of Ph+ CML of 25.30 months with a range from 3.7 to 84.9 months. Four Ph+ ALL patients had a median time since initial diagnosis of Ph+ ALL of 37.90 months with a range from 14.8 to 46 months.

In Group 1, the median time since initial diagnosis of Ph+ CML was 45.2 months with a range from 11.4 to 84.9 months. The median time since initial diagnosis of Ph+ ALL was 42.7 months with a range from 33.1 to 46 months.

In Group 2, time since the initial diagnosis of disease was much more recent than time reported in Group 1. The median time since initial diagnosis of Ph+ CML was 22.9 months.

The time since initial diagnosis of Ph+ ALL was 14.8 months for the 1 patient in Group 2.

## Prior antineoplastic therapy

All 15 patients had a prior regimen of at least one antineoplastic medication. Additionally, of the 8 patients in Group 1, 1 (12.5%) patient had prior radiotherapy, and of 7 patients in Group 2, only 3 (42.9%) patients had prior surgery (i.e. stem cell transplantation).

## Pharmacokinetic results

The full PK profiles of nilotinib in paediatric patients were assessed using serial sampling following a single 230 mg/m2 dose on Cycle 1 Day 1. The steady-state PK of nilotinib in paediatric patients was evaluated  with  the  trough  concentrations  obtained  on  Cycle  1  Day  8,  15,  22,  and  28  following  the administration of 230 mg/m2 bid.

The PK exposure of nilotinib following the single dose appeared to be comparable between Group 1 (1 year  to  &lt;  10  years)  and  Group  2  ( ≥ 10  years  to  &lt;  18  years).  The  geometric  means of  maximum blood/serum concentration  (Cmax),  AUC  from  time  zero  to  the  last  quantifiable  concentration  point (AUClast) and AUC0-12h were approximately 405 ng/mL, 4161 and 2796 ng*h/mL in Group 1, and 403 ng/mL, 5707 and 3393 ng*h/mL in Group 2, respectively.

The coefficient of variation (CV; %) for the geometric means was 30% or higher in both groups (Table 2-1).

Steady-state  PK  parameters  were  then  compared  with  reference  data  obtained  in  adult  patients  in [Study CAMN107A2101]. The reference data used from the adult study consisted of all patients who received 400 mg bid, and had valid steady state PK parameters on Cycle 1 Day 15. The steady-state PK exposure and clearance of nilotinib in the paediatric patients administered 230 mg/m2 bid were similar  (within  2-fold)  to  those  observed  in  adult  patients  administered  400  mg  bid.  The  geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of steady-state AUC (paediatrics divided by adults) was 0.885 (0.683, 1.145),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

0.841  (0.650,  1.089),  and  0.863  (0.701,  1.061)  for  Group  1,  Group  2  and  all  paediatric  patients, respectively  (Table  2-3).  The  geometric  mean  ratio  (90%  confidence  interval  (CI))  of  BSA-adjusted CL/F was 1.276 (0.971, 1.677), 1.323 (1.007, 1.739), and 1.300 (1.044, 1.618) for Group 1, Group 2, and all paediatric patients, respectively.

The PK of nilotinib was similar between 1 year to &lt; 10 years and ≥ 10 years to &lt; 18 years after either single or multiple doses. The PK results in all patients in this study dosed with nilotinib 230 mg/m2 bid demonstrated that the AUCtau and BSA-adjusted CL/F of nilotinib at steady state were within a twofold range of the reference data for nilotinib 400 mg bid in adult Ph+ CML patients. This dose provided similar PK exposure to that of reference data for nilotinib 400 mg bid in adult Ph+ CML patients.

## Efficacy results

Efficacy was measured through hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses. A summary of the efficacy evaluation (best calculated response status during study treatment) is shown in Table 2-4.

Of 11 Ph+ CML patients (5 patients in Group 1, 6 patients in Group 2), 10 (90.9%) patients achieved confirmed complete haematological response (CHR), and 1 patient satisfied CHR criteria which was not confirmed  at  another  visit  within  4  weeks.  Of  11  Ph+  CML  patients,  4  (36.4%)  patients  achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), 2 patients in each age group (Group 1 (2, 40%); Group 2 (2, 33.3%). One patient in Group 2 (1, 16.7%) achieved partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) and another 1 patient (1, 16.7%) achieved minor cytogenetic response (mCyR). Major cytogenetic response (CCyR or PCyR) was achieved in 2 patients in Group 1 (40%) and 3 patients in Group 2 (50.0%).

MMR was achieved in 3  Ph+  CML patients (27.3%), 1 patient in  Group  1  (20%)  and  2  patients  in Group 2 (33.3%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the 4 Ph+ ALL patients, complete remission with platelet recovery (CR) was achieved in 3 patients (75%): 2 patients in Group 1 (66.7%) and 1 patient in Group 2 (100%). Stable disease was observed in the 1 remaining Group 1 patient (33.3%).

## Safety results

## Exposure

For all 15 patients, the median time on treatment was 10.87 months and similar in both age groups (10.96 vs 10.78 months for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively). The majority (12, 80%) of patients were treated for at least 12 months. The median duration of exposure was 10.64 months and similar in both age groups (10.55 vs 10.78 months for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively).

For all patients, the median actual dose intensity was 453.9 mg/m2/day which is close to the actual planned  dose.  The  median  relative  dose  intensity  was  98.68%  and  comparable  between  both  age groups (101.1% vs 97.86% for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively).

## Adverse events

All 15 patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) during the study.

## Serious adverse events

Five  patients  (33.3%)  experienced  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  all  of  which  resolved,  7  patients (46.7%)  experienced  AEs  requiring  dose  interruption  and/or  modification,  and  1  patient  (6.7%) withdrew due to multiple AEs. No deaths occurred during the study. Of the 8 patients in Group 1, 2 (25%)  patients  experienced  SAEs:  1  (12.5%)  patient  reported  appendix  disorder  and  1  (12.5%) patient reported influenza-like illness and pyrexia. All SAEs were considered not suspected to be studydrug related. Of the 7 patients in Group 2, 3 (42.9%) patients experienced SAEs: 2 (28.6%) patients reported neutropenia (2 SAEs in 1 patient) and 1 (14.3%) patient experienced renal failure. The SAEs of neutropenia were considered suspected to be study-drug related.

No deaths occurred during the study.

## Adverse Events of special interest (AESI):

No cases of Hy's Law or potential Hy's Law were observed. AESI requiring dose interruption occurred in 3 patients of 8 in Group 1 (37.5%): ALT increased, blood bilirubin increased, hyperbilirubinemia and hypoalbuminemia.  Of  7 patients in Group  2, 1 patient experienced a dose  interruption for thrombocytopenia (1/7, 14.3%).

One patient of 8 in Group 1 (12.5%) had a grade 0 to grade 2 shift from baseline in lipase increased. No associated AEs were reported and the lipase elevation improved to normal without any intervention.

No episodes of torsades de pointes were reported during the study. Three patients overall (20%) had a QTcF post-baseline increase &gt; 30 ms (1 patient of 8 in Group 1 (12.5%) and 2 patients of 7 in Group 2 (28.6%)). No patients reported a QTcF post-baseline increase &gt; 60 ms. One patient in Group 2 (1, 14.3%) had a new QTcF interval &gt; 450 ms and no patients had a new QTcF interval &gt; 480 ms.

## MAH' s Discussion on clinical aspects

The PK of nilotinib was similar between 1 year to &lt; 10 years and ≥ 10 years to &lt; 18 years after either single or multiple doses. The PK results in all patients in this study dosed with nilotinib 230 mg/m2 bid demonstrated that the AUCtau and BSA-adjusted CL/F of nilotinib at steady state were within a twofold range of the reference data for nilotinib 400 mg bid in adult Ph+ CML patients. This dose provided similar PK exposure to that of reference data for nilotinib 400 mg bid in adult Ph+ CML patients.

Of 11 Ph+ CML patients (5 patients in Group 1, 6 patients in Group 2), 10 (90.9%) patients achieved confirmed CHR, and 1 patient had CHR which was not confirmed at another visit within 4 weeks. Of 11 Ph+ CML patients, 4 patients (36.4%) achieved CCyR, 2 patients in each age group (Group 1 (2, 0%); Group 2 (2, 33.3%)). One patient in Group 2 (1, 16.7%) achieved PCyR and another 1 patient (1, 16.7%) achieved mCyR. Three patients in Group 1 and 1 patient in Group 2 had no Ph+ marrow at baseline. Major cytogenetic response in this study includes CCyR or PCyR. Major cytogenetic response was achieved in 2 patients in Group 1 (40%) and 3 patients in Group 2 (50.0%). MMR was achieved in 3 Ph+ CML patients (27.3%) 1 patient in Group 1 (20%) and 2 patients in Group 2 (33.3%). In the 4

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ph+ ALL patients, CR was achieved in 3 patients (75%): 2 patients in Group 1(66.7%) and 1 patient in Group 2 (100%). Stable disease was observed in the 1 remaining patient in Group 1 (33.3%).

The  safety  profile  of  paediatric  patients  dosed  with  nilotinib  230  mg/m2  bid  is  consistent  with  the already well-known safety profile of adult patients treated with nilotinib. There were some low grade shifts  in  hepatic  transaminases  as  isolated  laboratory  findings.  There  was  no  evidence  of  vascular morbidities. No deaths were reported.

In  conclusion,  the  study  results  confirm  230  mg/m2  bid  as  the  recommended  dose  in  paediatric patients  (1  year  to  &lt;  18  years)  with  newly  diagnosed  CP-Ph+  CML,  or  CP  or  AP-Ph+  CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, or relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

The MAH has provided a completed paediatric study for Tasigna (nilotinib), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

The  provided  study;  CAMN107A2120,  a  multi-center,  open-label,  pharmacokinetic  study  of  oral nilotinib  in  paediatric  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  chronic  phase  (CP)  Ph+  CML,  with  CP  or accelerated phase (AP) Ph+ CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, or with refractory/relapsed Ph+ ALL, with the primary objective to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of nilotinib in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed CP-Ph+ CML, or CP or AP-Ph+  CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, or relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia)  along  with  secondary  objectives  of  safety  and  activity  (hematologic,  cytogenetic  and molecular  responses)  of  nilotinib  in  paediatric  patients,  will  be  a  part  an  upcoming  extension application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e. containing several studies) and is expected to be submitted by 12/2016. The preliminary discussion and conclusion, as provided by the MAH, is endorsed.  As  such,  the  full  evaluation  of  whether  the  benefit/risk  of  nilotinib  in  the  paediatric population in the treatment of newly diagnosed chronic phase (CP) Ph+ CML, with CP or accelerated phase (AP) Ph+ CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, or with refractory/relapsed Ph+ ALL, awaits the submission of the complete data package.

The benefit/risk of the use of nilotinib in the currently approved adult population remains positive.

## X  Fulfilled:

No further action required, however further data are expected in the context of an extension prior any conclusion on product information amendments is made. The MAH has informed that the application is expected for December 2016.
