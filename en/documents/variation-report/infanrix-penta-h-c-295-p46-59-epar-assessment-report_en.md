## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The  MAH  reported  the  safety  data  accrued  in  the  Hib-MenCY-TT-011  study,  which  is  the vaccination phase of a larger study evaluating the safety of the Hib-Men-CY-TT vaccine, which also includes the safety evaluation of the booster vaccination (Hib-MenCY-TT-012, not part of this overview). In addition, this report includes the extended safety follow-up phase of the HibMenCY-TT-011 study (preceding the booster vaccination) and pooled safety data from the HibMenCY-TT-009 study. Overall, the Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine has a similar safety profile as ActHib in the extended safety follow-up period with regard to the occurrence of serious adverse events, new onset of chronic disease, rash and emergency room visits.

No SmPC and PL changes are proposed. II. RECOMMENDATION 1 The  paediatric  studies  submitted  by  the  MAH  aimed  at  defining  the  safety  profile  of  the  HibMenCY-TT vaccine with respect to infrequent adverse events (i.e.  SAEs,  rash,  ER  visits  and NOCD)  in  comparison  with  a  US-licensed  monovalent  Hib  control  group.  Overall,  the  safety profiles  of  the  investigational  Hib-MenCY-TT  vaccine  and  the  monovalent  Hib  vaccine  were comparable  regardless  of  the  country  in  which  the  vaccinations  were  administered,  the  covaccination status or vaccination with other routinely administered vaccines, both in the single Hib-MenCY-TT-011 study data and the pooled study data (Hib-MenCY-TT-011 and -09). Based on these results, discussed in detail by the MAH, the safety profile of the investigational vaccine is considered acceptable and no further action is required. III. INTRODUCTION On 29 th November 2012, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Infanrix Penta, in accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended,  on  medicinal products for paediatric use. A short critical expert overview has also been provided. The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric studies do not influence the benefit risk for Infanrix Penta and that there is no consequential regulatory action. IV. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION IV.1 Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies Pharmaceutical  formulations  used  in  the  study  can  be  found  in  Table  3,  dosage  and administration of each vaccine are present in Table 4.

IV.2 Clinical aspects 1. Introduction The  MAH  submitted  a  final  report(s)  for:  105987  (Hib-MenCY-TT-011  [Primary  study])  and  a pooled results report for studies Hib-MenCY-TT-009 and -011. 2. Clinical studies under review A phase III, single-blind, randomized, controlled, multinational study for the evaluation of safety of GSK Biologicals' Haemophilus influenzae type b and Neisseria meningitidis serogroups C and Y-tetanus  toxoid  conjugate  vaccine  combined  (Hib-MenCY-TT)  compared  to  monovalent Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) control vaccine in healthy infants at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months  of  age. Note:  This  study  was  conducted  in  two  phases:  primary  vaccination  (105987 [Hib-MenCY-TT-011])  and  booster  vaccination  (105988  [Hib-MenCY-TT-012]).  This  report presents  the  results  of  the  primary  vaccination  phase,  including  an  extended  safety  follow-up and pooled safety data from Hib-MenCY-TT-009 study. This report does not discuss results of the booster vaccination study 105988 [Hib-MenCY-TT-012]).  Description The purpose of this study is to complement study Hib-MenCY-TT-009/-010 in order to assess the  safety  profile  of  Hib-MenCY-TT  vaccine  with  respect  to  infrequent  adverse  events  (i.e. serious adverse events, emergency room [ER] visits, rash [e.g. hives, idiopathic thrombocytopenic  purpura,  petechiae],  and  new  onset  of  chronic  illnesses  [e.g.  autoimmune disorders, asthma, type I diabetes and allergies]). Therefore, the primary study objective will be exploratory and based on data from this study pooled with the data from study Hib-MenCY-TT009/-010. Data from each study will be analyzed separately prior to pooling. Study Hib-MenCYTT-009/010 is a multinational, Phase 3 safety, immunogenicity, and lot-to-lot consistency study of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine versus monovalent Hib vaccine control.  Methods · Objective(s) Medicinal product no longer authorised

To evaluate the safety profile of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine compared to ActHIB with respect to the occurrence  of  serious  adverse  events,  new  onset  of  chronic  illnesses  (e.g.  autoimmune disorders, asthma, type I diabetes and allergies), rash (e.g. hives, idiopathic thrombocytopenic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

purpura, petechiae) and ER visits within the primary vaccination course (from dose 1 up to Day 30 after dose 3 and from dose 1 up to the day preceding booster dose at 12-15 months of age).

## The secondary objective relates to the booster Vaccination - Pooled dataset (i.e. Hib-MenCYTT-012 and all subjects in Hib-MenCY-TT-010)

To evaluate the safety profile of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine compared to PedvaxHIB with respect to the  occurrence  of  serious  adverse  events,  new  onset  of  chronic  illnesses  (e.g.  autoimmune disorders, asthma, type I diabetes and allergies), rash (e.g. hives, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, petechiae) and ER visits within the booster vaccination course (from booster dose up to Day  30  after  booster  vaccination  and  from  booster  dose  up  to  6  months  after  booster vaccination).  (Amended:  22-JAN-2007). Note:  the  secondary  objective  pertains  to  the  booster dose  and  is  presented  in  a  separate  clinical  report,  and  will  not  be  further  discussed  in  this report.

- Blinding: Single-blind.

· Study design The Hib-MenCY-TT-011 study is a phase III, randomized, controlled, multinational study, with two parallel treatment groups: · Treatment  allocation:  Central  Randomization  call-in  System  on  internet  (SBIR)  with unbalanced allocation (3:1).

- Investigational group: Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine.
- Control:  Monovalent  Hib  vaccine  ( ActHIB for  the  Primary  Phase; PedvaxHIB for  the Booster Phase). (Amended: 22-JAN-2007)
- Co-administered vaccines:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Primary vaccination - Licensed Pediarix/Infanrix penta to subjects in all study groups. Subjects enrolled  in  the  US  should  receive Prevnar according  to  a  2,  4,  and  6  month  schedule concomitantly with study vaccines if Prevnar is available. If Prevnar is in short supply, Prevnar should be given to study subjects according to revised recommendations as issued by the CDC. Administration of study vaccines should not be delayed if Prevnar is  in  short  supply.  Because Prevnar is  routinely  covered  by  US  insurance  plans,  and  because  GSK  has  had  difficulty obtaining enough Prevnar to conduct the current study, US investigators will supply Prevnar on their  own  accord  to  US  subjects.  For  non-US  subjects,  only  countries  in  which Prevnar ( Prevenar ) is licensed and permitted to be given according to the primary US schedule (2, 4, and 6  months)  will  participate  in  this  study.  Subjects  enrolled  in  non-US  countries  should  receive their primary series of Prevnar ( Prevenar ) at 2 ,4, and 6 months of age concomitantly with study vaccines.  If Prevnar ( Prevenar )  is  in  short  supply  in  non-US  countries, Prevnar ( Prevenar ) should  be  given  according  to  local  recommendations  and  availability.  Administration  of  study vaccines  should  not  be  delayed  if Prevnar ( Prevenar )  is  in  short  supply.  GSK  may  provide Prevnar ( Prevenar )  to  selected  non-US  countries  if Prevnar ( Prevenar )  would  be  difficult  to obtain  or  would  otherwise  represent  a  financial  hardship  to  the  parents  of  study  subjects. Coadministration  of  Synagis®  (Palivizumab,  MedImmune),  influenza  vaccine  and  rotavirus vaccine are also permitted. Booster vaccination (results not discussed in this report) All  subjects enrolled  in  the  booster phase should receive hepatitis A vaccine and influenza vaccine according to local recommendations. All subjects will receive Prevnar, M-M-R II and Varivax as study vaccines. MM-R II and Varivax must be given according to current US labelling and ACIP recommendations (i.e.  M-M-R  II  must  be  administered  between  12  to  15  months  of  age.  Varivax  should  be administered  between  12  to  18  months  of  age).  It  is  preferred  that  subjects  receive  Prevnar concomitantly at the booster phase between 12 to 15 months of age according to current US labelling and ACIP recommendations. It is the preference for subjects to receive Prevnar, M-M-R II and Varivax with the booster dose of Hib-MenCY-TT/PedvaxHIB. (Amended: 22-JAN-2007). · Study population /Sample size Target enrolment for this study was 4,352 subjects (3,264 in the Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine group and 1,088 in  the  Hib  control  group).  There  were  approximately  1,352  US  subjects  and  3,000 non-US subjects expected to participate in this study. · Treatments Vaccination schedule: Primary Vaccination - Infants receiving Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine or ActHIB , each co-administered with Pediarix/Infanrix penta , will be vaccinated at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. Booster  Vaccination  Infants  receiving  Hib-MenCY-TT  vaccine  or PedvaxHIB/ActHIB will  be vaccinated at 12 to 15 months of age. · Outcomes/endpoints Primary endpoints Primary Vaccination - Pooled dataset: Hib-MenCY-TT-011 and all subjects in Hib-MenCY-TT009 Medicinal product no longer authorised

Secondary endpoints Booster Vaccination - Pooled dataset: Hib-MenCY-TT-012 and all subjects in Hib-MenCY-TT010 From booster dose up to Day 30 after booster vaccination · Occurrence of SAEs. · Occurrence  of  new  onset  of  chronic  illness(es)  (e.g.,  autoimmune  disorders,  asthma, type I diabetes and allergies). · Occurrence of rash (e.g. hives, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, petechiae). · Occurrence of ER visits. From booster dose through the end of the 6-month safety follow-up · Occurrence of SAEs. · Occurrence  of  new  onset  of  chronic  illness(es)  (e.g.,  autoimmune  disorders,  asthma, type I diabetes and allergies). · Occurrence of rash (e.g. hives, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, petechiae). · Occurrence of ER visits. · Statistical Methods Safety: The safety analysis was performed on the Primary Total Vaccinated cohort (pre-defined primary analysis),  which  included  all  enrolled  subjects  who  had  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study vaccine. In accordance with the protocol, a second analysis based on the Primary ATP safety cohort was not performed since less than 5% of enrolled subjects were not eligible for inclusion in the Primary ATP cohort for safety analysis. Safety analyses presented in this report include data collected from Day 0 (first visit, first dose) through the day preceding the booster dose, which includes the ESFU (extended safety followup) which began the day after the 30 day follow-up for dose 3 and extended up until the booster dose administration. Primary phase, within group analyses: From Dose 1 up to Day 30 after the third dose and from Day  0  through  the  ESFU,  the  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  the  different categories of AEs were tabulated by group with exact 95% CI. The percentage of subjects with these  different  categories  of  AEs  from  Day  0  through  the  ESFU  and  its  exact  95%  CI  were tabulated by group and by MedDRA preferred term. Primary phase, between group analyses: The differences between the Hib-MenCY group and the Hib group were evaluated in terms of relative risks. The country specific relative risks were presented with their asymptotic 95% CI and their corresponding 2-sided P-value. The common relative risk across countries, its 95% CI and the corresponding 2-sided P-value were estimated based  on  exact  conditional  likelihood  adjusted  for  the  country  effect.  Potential  safety  signals were based on nominal P-value below 5%. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Safety  analyses  were  also  performed  in  subpopulations  defined  by  the  co-administration/ absence  of  co-administration  of  specified  vaccines  ( Pediarix and Prevnar , RotaTeq ,  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

influenza vaccines). Statistical testing between treatment groups for these sub-categories was not performed. Acceptability of the pooling across countries and studies was checked by means of Breslow and Day tests.

Potential  safety  signals  were  based  on  nominal  P-value  below  5%.  Considering  the multiplicity of comparisons and the exploratory nature of the evaluation, the risk of false safety  signals  is  much  larger  than  5%.  Therefore,  any  signal  was  further  examined  for clinical plausibility and relevance.

The demographic profile was similar between groups. The mean age for the Hib-MenCY and Hib groups at Visit 1 (dose 1) was 58.7 days (ranging from 42 to 96 days) with a mean age of 58.6 days in the Hib-MenCY group and 59.0 days in the Hib group. The distribution of males and females  were  comparable  between  groups:  the  percentage  of  males  was  51.9%  in  the  HibMenCY group and 50.0% in the Hib group. The predominant ethnicity in both groups for the Primary Total Vaccinated cohort was American Hispanic/Latino (73.3% in the Hib-MenCY group and 71.7% in the Hib  group). The  predominant  race  was  Hispanic  (70.4%  in  the  Hib-MenCY group and 69.2% in the Hib group), followed by Caucasian (23.9% in the Hib-MenCY group and 24.3% in the Hib group).

## Primary analysis - pooled studies Hib-MenCY-TT-011 and Hib-MenCY-TT-009

The  summary  of  demographic  characteristics  is  presented  in  Table  13  for  the  Primary  Total Vaccinated cohort for the pooled studies.

The demographic profile of the two treatment groups of subjects in the pooled studies (Primary Total  Vaccinated  cohort)  was  comparable  with  respect  to  mean  age,  gender  and  racial distribution. The mean age at the time of the first vaccination visit was 61.0 and 61.1 days, HibMenCY and Hib groups, respectively and just over half of the subjects in each group were male (51.7% and 51.1%, respectively). The predominant ethnicity in both groups for the Primary Total Vaccinated cohort was American Hispanic/Latino (50.9% in the Hib-MenCY group and 50.1% in the Hib group). The predominant race was Hispanic (46.8% in the Hib-MenCY group and 46.3% in the Hib group), followed closely by Caucasian (43.5% in the Hib-MenCY group and 44.3% in the Hib group). African heritage/African American represented 4.5% per group.

On a per country basis for the pooled studies, the mean age at the time of the first dose in each of the three countries ranged from 57.9 days to 63.7 days for the Hib-MenCY group and from 58.1 days to 64 days in the Hib group. The percentage of males ranged from 51.4% to 52.5% in the Hib-MenCY group, and from 47.0% to 52.8% in the Hib group. Race distribution varied by country: Caucasian was the predominant race for both groups in the US and Australia (77.2% and 93.6% for the Hib-MenCY group, US and Australia, respectively and 77.9% and 96.7% for the Hib group, respectively). In Mexico for pooled studies, 99.8% of the Hib-MenCY group and 99.7% of the Hib group were Hispanic. The demographic profile of the pooled Primary ATP Cohort for Safety was comparable to the pooled Primary Total Vaccinated cohort. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Within  group  analysis  Hib-MenCY-TT-011  data analyzed  separately  and for  pooled  data  from both studies

From Dose 1 (Day 0) through the Day 30 after the third dose and from Day 0 through the ESFU, the  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  SAEs,  NOCD,  rash  and  ER  visits  were tabulated by group with exact 95% CI.

The verbatim reports of each AE were reviewed by a physician and the signs and symptoms were  coded  according  to  the  MedDRA  Dictionary  for  Adverse  Reaction  Terminology.  The assessment of an AE as a NOCD was reviewed by the GSK Medical Monitor and clarified with the investigator as necessary.

The percentage of subjects with AEs from Day 0 through Day 30 and from Day 0 through the ESFU and its exact 95% CI were tabulated by group and by MedDRA preferred term for the HibMenCY-TT-011 data  analyzed  separately  and  the  pooled  data;  however,  for  the  pooled  data analysis, only the percentage of subjects with SAEs were tabulated by group and by MedDRA preferred term for data collected within 30 days after vaccination. Between groups analysis Hib-MenCY-TT-011 data analyzed separately and for pooled data from both studies. Differences between the Hib-MenCY and Hib groups were evaluated from Day 0 through the ESFU for the primary phase and from Day 0 until 30 days after dose 3 and for SAEs, within 31 days after each dose. Per  the  RAP,  differences  were  quantified  in  terms  of  relative  risk.  Using  these  relative  risk differences, the common relative risk across study-countries, its 95% CI and the corresponding 2-sided  P-value  were  based  on  exact  conditional  likelihood  approach  adjusted  for  the  studycountry effect. A test for homogeneity between study-countries was based on the exact Breslow &amp; Day test. Differences of the relative risk of SAEs, rash, NOCD and AEs resulting in ER visits, reported from Day 0 through the ESFU, between the Hib-MenCY group and the Hib group with exact 95% CI and 2-sided P-value, were evaluated taking into account the study and country effects. These differences were also evaluated by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term for each specific SAE/AE. In  order  to  assess  the  effect  of  co-/concomitant  vaccination  on  the  incidence  of  SAEs  and specific  AEs  several  logistic  analyses  were  performed  [Hosmer,  2000].  Logistic  models  were fitted from the pooled safety data from studies Hib-MenCY-TT-009 and Hib-MenCY-TT-011 (no logistic analysis was performed for individual studies). A logistic model was fitted for each of the endpoints (occurrence of any SAE, NOCD, rash and AE resulting in ER visit, from Day 0 through the ESFU). Only  the  occurrence  of  any  (SAE/Specific  AE)  event  was  considered.  If  however,  statistically significantly different incidences of specific AE SOC/preferred terms was found between the two groups (from the statistical comparisons performed in the pooled data), a logistic regression was considered for these cases. Each logistic model aimed at explaining the occurrence or not of a selected event by means of the different variables (i.e., study vaccine, priming status, study and country). Logistic regression with Maximum Likelihood estimates and Wald significance tests were fitted. Due to the high skewness and correlation between several prognostic factors, the impact of covaccination of a specific vaccine was considered independently from the co-vaccination status of the other vaccines. It was then studied whether the difference between incidences in the HibMenCY group and the Hib group, were varying significantly according to the co-vaccination of certain vaccines or not. Hence, each logistic regression model consisted in the occurrence or not of a specific adverse event regressed on: Medicinal product no longer authorised

*the country

*the study

*the co-vaccination status (of interest)

*The interaction between the treatment and the co-vaccination status (of interest).

The  safety  profiles  of  Hib-MenCY-TT/ ActHib vaccines  were  evaluated  with  respect  to  the occurrence specific AE categories (SAEs, NOCD, rash and AEs prompting ER visits) from dose 1 (Day 0) up to Day 30 after dose 3 and from Day 0 through the ESFU for the Primary Total Vaccinated cohort. Comparisons between groups were performed on data collected from Day 0 through the ESFU. Separate analyses were not planned or performed for data collected only during the ESFU period (from Visit 4 up through the end of the primary ESFU period).

As shown in Table 19 there were no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of  the  total  number  of  adverse  events  reported,  as  well  as  the  percentages  of  SAEs,  NOCD, rash and AEs leading to an ER visit. No statistically significant differences were found with the Breslow and Day tests indicating that the differences between Hib-MenCY and Hib did not vary across countries.

Overall incidence AE by category A comparison of percentages of subjects reporting each event category by treatment group is presented in Table 19. During the period from Day 0 through the ESFU, 20.0% of the subjects in the Hib-MenCY group and 20.8% subjects in the Hib group reported at least one symptom within one of the specified categories.  Rash  was  the  most  frequently  reported  adverse  event  (11.8%  and  12.0%,  HibMenCY and Hib groups, respectively). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## SAEs

A  comparison  of  the  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  SAEs  from  Day  0  through  the  ESFU classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term for study Hib-MenCYTT-011 is provided in Table 20 (not shown in this report). The percentages of subjects reporting SAEs from Day 0 through Day 30 after the third dose, classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term are provided in Supplement 35 (not shown in this report).

At least one SAE was reported by 157 subjects (4.8%) in the Hib-MenCY group and 48 subjects (4.3%) in the Hib group. None of the SAEs were related to or possibly related to vaccination as assessed by the investigators.

Differences based on p-values were observed for the following SAEs (using preferred MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term): *Bronchiolitis (1.2% for Hib-MenCY vs. 0.5% from Hib, p=0.0081). *Viral infection (0.0% for Hib-MenCY vs. 0.2% from Hib, p=0.0088). *Dehydration (0.2% for Hib-MenCY vs. 0.4% from Hib, p=0.0335). All  other  SAEs  were  comparable  between  the  two  groups.  Approximately  70  SAEs  were included in Table 20. Fatal SAEs As  shown  in  Table  34  (Subjects  with  SAEs  reported  from  Day  0  through  the  day  preceding booster dose, by country (Primary Total Vaccinated cohort, Study Hib-MenCY-TT-011)), of the 205 subjects in both groups who experienced at least one SAE during the study period through the ESFU, 12 subjects died (seven in the Hib-MenCY group and five in the Hib group). Nine of the deaths were reported within the 30 day study interval after each vaccine dose (four in HibMenCY group and five in Hib group). Three additional deaths (two in the Hib-MenCY group and one in the Hib group) were reported outside of the 30 day interval after vaccination (one of which occurred during the ESFU period). None of the fatalities were vaccine-related according to the investigator. Fatalities reported in the Hib-MenCY-TT-011 study, per group, with day of onset, duration and outcome are shown in Table 21.

New onset of chronic disease A comparison of the percentages of subjects reporting NOCD, from Day 0 through the ESFU classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term are listed in Table 22. The  percentages  of  subjects  reporting  NOCD  for  the  Hib-MenCY-TT-011  study,  from  Day  0 through the ESFU classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term on a per  country  basis,  are  provided  in  Supplement  36  (US)  and  Supplement  37  (Mexico).  The percentages  of  subjects  reporting  NOCD,  from  Day  0  through  Day  30  after  the  third  dose classified  by  MedDRA  Primary  System  Organ  Class  and  Preferred  Term  are  provided  in Supplement 38 (Supplements not shown in this report). Overall, the number of subjects experiencing NOCD was comparable and uncommon between the two groups: 2.0% and 2.2%, Hib-MenCY group and Hib group, respectively (Table 22). There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  groups  with  regard  to  any  specific NOCD reported except for milk allergy which was reported with a higher incidence in the Hib group although the incidence in both groups was very  low (1/3278  [0.0%] for Hib-MenCY  vs. 3/1113 [0.3%] for Hib, p=0.0099).

Overall,  the  number  of  subjects  experiencing  rash  was  comparable  between  the  two  groups (11.8% of the subjects in the Hib-MenCY group and 12% in the Hib group, Table 23). The most common type of rash reported was \"rash\" followed by diaper rash and eczema in both groups. There was one case of petechiae reported in the Hib-MenCY group and none in the Hib group, urticaria (hives) was reported by 0.8% and 0.9% of the subjects in the Hib-MenCY group and Hib group, respectively, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was not reported.

## Emergency room (ER) visits

Table  24  (not  shown  here)  presents  a  comparison  of  the  percentage  of  subjects  reporting adverse events resulting in an ER visit, reported from Day 0 of the first dose through the ESFU period for study Hib-MenCY-TT-011, classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Table 24 contains approximately 100 different types of adverse events resulting in an ER visit.

<!-- image -->

The percentage of subjects reporting AEs resulting in an ER visit, presented on a per country basis are provided in Supplement 43. The percentage of subjects reporting AEs resulting in an ER visit from day 0 after dose 1 through Day 30 after dose 3, classified by MedDRA Primary System  Organ  Class  and  Preferred  Term  (Primary  Total  vaccinated  cohort)  is  presented  in Supplement 44 (Supplements not shown in this report). Overall, the number of subjects with an AE resulting in an ER visit was comparable between the two groups: (6.0% of the subjects in the Hib-MenCY group and 6.2% in the Hib group). In both groups, pyrexia (0.9% in the Hib-MenCY group and 0.8% in the Hib group), bronchiolitis (0.8% in both groups) and gastroenteritis and otitis media (0.8% and 1.0%, Hib-MenCY and Hib groups, respectively  for  each  AE)  were  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  resulting  in  an  ER  visit.  All other AEs resulting in an ER visit were infrequently reported (&lt;1.0% of subjects) in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences between groups for any type of AE resulting in an ER visit reported except for the following: *Abnormal faeces (0.0% for Hib-MenCY vs. 0.2% from Hib, p=0.0088). *Constipation (0.0% for Hib-MenCY vs. 0.3% from Hib, p=0.0099). *Hair-thread tourniquet syndrome (0.0% for Hib-MenCY vs. 0.2% from Hib, p=0.0088). Incidence of adverse events in sub-groups defined by coadministration of other vaccines- within group analyses for Study Hib-MenCY-TT-011 Co-administration for the rotavirus vaccine, Pediarix and Prevnar vaccines was defined, per the RAP, as administration on the same day of a study vaccine dose. Concomitant administration for the influenza vaccines was defined, per the RAP, as administration between 28 days before to 7 days after a study vaccine dose. A summary of the concomitantly administered vaccines by dose for the Primary Total Vaccinated cohort, Study Hib-MenCY-TT-011 is presented in Table 25. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

At least 99.5% of the subjects in each group were fully co-vaccinated with Pediarix and Prevnar during the Hib-MenCY-TT-011 study. Most subjects (at least 98.7%, overall) did not receive a concomitant influenza vaccine and most did not receive a concomitant rotavirus vaccine (at least 80.7%, overall) during the study. Only 0.9% of all subjects in both groups received a concomitant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

influenza vaccine, which was only given with dose 3 of the Hib-MenCY-TT and ActHib vaccines. Rotavirus  vaccine  was  co-administered  with  17.3%  to  18.2%  of  each  dose  of  Hib-MenCY-TT and ActHib vaccines.

On  a  per  country  basis,  co-administration  of  other  vaccines  ( Pediarix , Prevnar, rotavirus  and influenza)  with  Hib-MenCY-TT  and ActHib vaccines  with  each  of  the  three  doses  was  similar between countries except for rotavirus vaccine which was given with approximately 60% of each of the three doses of Hib-MenCY-TT and ActHib vaccines in the United States vs. 0% in Mexico.

<!-- image -->

Thus,  the  analysis  per  rotavirus  co-vaccination  status  was  performed  for  the  United  States subjects only. All subjects enrolled in Mexico were fully co-vaccinated with Pediarix and Prevnar vaccines and thus  the  analysis  per  full  co-vaccination  status  was  performed  for  the  United  States  subjects only. None of the Mexican subjects received an influenza vaccine co-administered with a study dose and therefore, the analysis per influenza co-vaccination status was only performed for subjects enrolled in the United States. Rap's comment :  The marked wording above is somewhat confusing in that all co-vaccination analyses were performed on United States subjects only. Presentation based on Pediarix and Prevnar vaccination status Subjects  were  grouped  according  to  whether  they  were  fully  co-vaccinated  with Pediarix and Prevnar (both vaccines co-administered with all Hib-MenCY-TT/ ActHib vaccines doses) or not fully  co-vaccinated  ( Pediarix or Prevnar not  co-administered  with  all  Hib-MenCY-TT/ ActHib vaccines doses). The percentage of subjects (United States sites only) with SAEs, NOCD, rash and AEs resulting in ER visits from Day 0 through the ESFU, grouped according to whether or not a subject was fully co-vaccinated with Pediarix and Prevnar vaccines are presented in Supplement 46. The  percentages  of  subjects  reporting  specific  SAEs,  NOCD,  rash  and  AEs  resulting  in  ER visits, respectively, from Day 0 through the ESFU by Primary Organ System Class and Preferred Term,  based  on Pediarix and Prevnar vaccination  status,  in  United  States  (Primary  Total Vaccinated  cohort)  are  presented  in  Supplement  47,  Supplement  48,  Supplement  49  and Supplement 50 . For the fully co-vaccinated sub-category, the percentages of subjects in each treatment group reporting SAEs, NOCD, rashes, and AEs leading to ER visits were comparable. There were some observed differences between groups for the subset who were not fully covaccinated with Pediarix and Prevnar ; however, the numbers of subjects in this group were small (18 and 4 subjects in the Hib-MenCY and Hib groups, respectively), and so clinically meaningful conclusions cannot be drawn.

Presentation based on rotavirus vaccination status Subjects were grouped according to whether they received the rotavirus vaccine, RotaTeq coadministered  with  all  three  Hib-MenCY-TT/ ActHib vaccines  doses  ( completely  covaccinated), RotaTeq vaccine  co-administered  with  at  least  one  but  not  all  Hib-MenCYTT/ ActHib vaccines doses  (partly  co-vaccinated)  or RotaTeq vaccine  not  co-administered  with  any  Hib-MenCYTT/ ActHib vaccines dose (not co-vaccinated). The percentages of subjects  reporting  specific  SAEs,  new  onset  of  chronic  illness,  rash,  and AEs resulting in ER visits through the entire ESFU period, based on rotavirus vaccination status, for US subjects by Primary Organ System Class and Preferred Term (Primary Total Vaccinated cohort)  are  presented  in  Supplement  51.  Results  in  rotavirus  fully-co-vaccinated,  partially  covaccinated and no-co-vaccinated cohorts were clinically within the same range for each category of AE. The  percentages  of  subjects  reporting  specific  SAEs,  NOCD,  rash  and  AEs  resulting  in  ER visits,  respectively,  from  Day  0  through  the  ESFU,  by  priming  rotavirus  vaccination  status,  in United States (Primary Total Vaccinated cohort) are presented in Supplement 52, Supplement 53,  Supplement  54,  Supplement  55.  The  rates  of  reported  SAEs,  NOCD,  rashes,  and  AEs resulting  in  ER  visits  were  clinically  within  the  same  range  in  subjects from the  United  States regardless of rotavirus co-vaccination status.

Presentation based on influenza vaccination status Subjects  were  grouped  according  to  whether  they  received  concomitant  influenza  vaccine ( influenza vaccine concomitantly administered with at least one Hib-MenCY-TT/ ActHib vaccine dose) or not (influenza vaccine not concomitantly administered with any Hib-MenCY-TT/ ActHib vaccine dose).

Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study vaccine and/or study study Hib-MenCY-TT-011 Among the 4391 subjects of the Primary Total Vaccinated cohort, 14 subjects were withdrawn from the active phase (9 in the Hib-MenCY group and 5 in the Hib group) due to an SAE and 1 subject (in the Hib group) due to an AE. Individual case narratives for these adverse events are provided in the SAE CIOMS Section 12. The 15 withdrawals (9 in the Hib-MenCY group and 6 in the Hib group) were caused by the following AEs: *five subjects died from sudden infant death syndrome, that occurred after the first dose (subject numbers 7729, 1403, 4021 in the Hib-MenCY group and numbers 3420 and 3786 in the Hib group)- not related to vaccination. *four subjects died from pneumonia (number 4302 in the Hib-MenCY group and numbers 1325 [pneumonia and congestive heart failure], 3381, and 4241 in the Hib group). These four cases occurred after the first or second dose. None were related to vaccination. *one subject (number 28 in the Hib-MenCY group) died from hypovolaemic shock 14 days after the first dose- not related to vaccination. *one subject (636 in the Hib-MenCY  group) died from bronchiolitis, dehydration and gastroenteritis 24 days after the second dose- not related to vaccination. *one subject (number 3535 in the Hib-MenCY group) experienced nystagmus eight days after the first dose - not related to vaccination *two subjects (numbers 4111 and 8922, in the Hib-MenCY group) experienced febrile seizure . 57  days  after  the  first  dose,  and  65  days  after  the  second  dose,  respectively  not  related  to vaccination. *one subject (number 6031, Hib group) experienced a non serious AE (pyrexia) on the day of the second dose which led to an ER visit. The parents withdrew their child from the study following this event. The AE was considered to be related to vaccination. One  additional  subject  (number  1359  in  the  Hib-MenCY  group),  experienced  an  AE  that occurred 77 days after the third vaccine dose (i.e., during the ESFU period). This subject died following a diagnosis of pneumonia: this AE was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to vaccination. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Safety conclusions for Hib-MenCY-TT-011

There were no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of the total number of adverse events reported, as well as the percentages of SAEs, NOCD, rash and AEs leading to an ER visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At least one SAE was reported by 157 subjects (4.8%) in the Hib-MenCY group and 48 (4.3%) in the Hib group. None of the SAEs were related to or possibly related to vaccination as assessed by the investigators.

Differences  for  the  individual  SAE,  NOCD,  rash,  and  AE  leading  to  ER  visit  terms  were calculated  based  on  relative  risks,  with  statistical  significance  assigned  to  a  p-value  ≤0.05. Because of the large  number  of  comparisons made,  and  because  no multiplicity  adjustments were made, the risk of detecting differences due to chance alone was high.

For  each  specific  AE  category,  the  detailed  descriptive  and  comparative  analyses  on  the incidence of each AE classified by MedDRA for the period from Day 0 through the ESFU are presentedin section 7.3.1.2 to 7.3.1.5. The descriptive analyses from Day 0 to Day 30 after the third dose were performed on each dataset separately; see study report Hib-MenCY-TT-009 for data  for  that  study  and  Section  7.2  for  Hib-MenCY-TT-011.  A  comparison  of  percentage  of subjects  with  SAEs  reported  within  the  31-days  (Days  0-30)  post-vaccination  period  was provided in Supplement 67referred to in section 7.3.1.2.

Nonetheless, incidences of SAEs using preferred MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred  Term  were  comparable  (p-value  &gt;0.05)  between  the  two  groups  except  for  the following: *SAE: Bronchiolitis (1.2% for Hib-MenCY vs. 0.5% from Hib, p=0.0081). *SAE: Viral infection (0.0% for Hib-MenCY vs. 0.2% from Hib, p=0.0088). *SAE: Dehydration (0.2% for Hib-MenCY vs. 0.4% from Hib, p=0.0335). There were 12 fatalities reported during the study (seven in the Hib-MenCY group and five in the Hib group), none of which were vaccine-related according to the investigator. Overall,  the  percentage  of  subjects  experiencing  NOCD  was  uncommon  and  comparable between the two groups: 2.0% and 2.2%, Hib-MenCY group and Hib group, respectively. There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  groups  with  regard  to  any  specific NOCD reported except for milk allergy (0.0% for Hib-MenCY vs. 0.3% from Hib, p=0.0099). Overall, the percentage of subjects experiencing any type of rash was comparable between the two groups (11.8% of the subjects in the Hib-MenCY group and 12.0% in the Hib group). There were no statistically significant differences between groups for any type of rash reported. The number of subjects with an AE resulting in an ER visit was comparable between the two groups: (6.0% of the subjects in the Hib-MenCY group and 6.2% in the Hib group). All other adverse events resulting in an ER visit were infrequently reported (&lt;1.0% of subjects) in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences between groups for any type of AE resulting in an ER visit reported except for the following: *Abnormal feces (0.0% for Hib-MenCY vs. 0.2% from Hib, p=0.0088). *Constipation (0.0% for Hib-MenCY vs. 0.3% from Hib, p=0.0099). * Hair-thread tourniquet syndrome (0.0% for Hib-MenCY vs. 0.2% from Hib, p=0.0088). No statistically significant Breslow and Day test was found either overall per unsolicited symptom type or by preferred MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term indicating that the differences between Hib-MenCY and Hib groups did not vary across countries. The few statistically significant differences did not amount to a clinically significant trend in the occurrence of any specific pathology and therefore, the overall safety profile regarding specific unsolicited symptoms of Hib-MenCY group is similar to that of the Hib group. Total vaccinated cohort analysis- pooled studies Hib-MenCY-TT-009 and -011 Incidence of adverse events- within group analyses on pooled data The primary study objective for the pooled data set was to evaluate the safety profile of HibMenCY-TT vaccine compared to ActHib vaccine with respect to the occurrence specific adverse event categories from Day 0 through Day 30 after the third dose and from Day 0 through the ESFU. The descriptive and comparative analyses were conducted on the incidence of each category of AE for the period from Day 0 up to day 30 after the third dose and from Day 0 through the ESFU and are presented in section 7.3.1.1 (section not shown in this report).

There were no statistically significant differences in the overall rates of SAEs, NOCD, rashes, and AEs leading to ER visits between the two groups. The overall incidences of the specified categories of AEs per group reported from Day 0 through the  ESFU  for  the  (Primary  Total  Vaccinated  cohort,  pooled  studies  Hib-MenCYTT-009  and  011), presented on a per country basis are provided in Supplement 61. Overall, AE reporting appeared to be less frequent among subjects in Mexico compared to those in the US and Australia (for at least one symptom, NOCD, rash and ER visits). SAEs appeared to be reported similarly among the three countries. The Breslow and Day tests were not statistically significant, indicating that the differences between Hib-MenCY and Hib did not vary across countries. SAEs - pooled studies A comparison of the percentages of subjects reporting SAEs in the pooled studies, classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term for the period from Day 0 through the ESFU are presented in Table 28. The percentages of subjects reporting SAEs in the pooled studies, classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term for the period from  Day  0  through  the  ESFU  are  provided  in  Supplement  62,  overall  and  per  country  in Supplement 63 (United States) and Supplement 64 (Mexico) and Supplement 65 (Australia). A summary of subjects reporting SAEs within the 31 day follow-up after any Hib-MenCY-TT or ActHib vaccine  dose  per  study  is  provided  in  Supplement  66.  Supplement  67  provides  a comparison of percentage of subjects with SAEs reported within the 31-days (Days 0-30) postvaccination  period,  overall  corrected  by  study  and  country  (Primary  Total  Vaccinated  Cohort, Studies Hib-MenCY-TT-009 and -011). A listing of subjects with fatal SAEs by study and country are presented in Table 29. The SAE Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) reports and Summary of SAEs  reported  (Table  35)  are  provided  in  Section  12.1.  One  SAE  (bronchiolitis  in  the HibMenCY-TT-009  study,  subject  007)  was  erroneously  attributed  to  the  Hib-MenCY  group instead of the Hib group. More detail is provided in the HibMenCY-TT-009 study report. Medicinal product no longer authorised

At  least  one  SAE  was  reported  for  4.4%  of  the  subjects  from  the  pooled  studies  in  the  HibMenCY  group  and  for  4.5%  in  the  Hib  group.  Based  on  the  p-values,  the  difference  in  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

percentages of each type of SAE reported by preferred MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term were not statistically significant between groups except for the following: Incidences of SAEs that were statistically higher in the Hib-MenCY group:

*SAE:  bronchiolitis  (0.9%  vs.  0.5%,  p=0.0155)  and  urinary  tract  infection  (0.2%  vs.  0.0%, p=0.0491).

Incidences of SAEs that were statistically higher in the Hib group:

*SAE:  vomiting  (0.0%  vs.  0.1%,  p=0.0409)  and  influenza  (0.0%  vs.  0.1%,  p=0.0083)  and bronchopneumonia ((0.3% vs. 0.6%, p= 0.0157).

The incidences of developmental delay (0.0% vs. 0.1%, p=0.0030) and bronchial hyperactivity (0.2% vs. 0.5%, p=0.0027) were statistically significantly lower in the Hib-MenCY group vs. the Hib group, respectively.

As  shown  in  Table  35,  all  except  two  SAEs  were  unrelated  to  vaccination  according  to  the investigator. The two subjects with a vaccine-related SAE (numbers 342 and 4822 from the -009 study, Hib-MenCY group) experienced pyrexia on the day of the first dose, lasting three days with a maximum temperature of 103.3 °F rectal for subject 342 and 103.0 °F axillary for subject 4822. Both subjects recovered without sequelae. The incidences of SAEs in each group appeared similar among the three countries. At least one SAE was reported within 31 days after a study vaccine dose for 1.8% (113/6414) subjects in the Hib-MenCY group and for 1.9% (41/2157) subjects in the Hib group. There were no statistically significant differences in the percentages of subjects reporting any specific SAE between groups based  on  p-values.  Pyrexia  reported  after  dose  1  in  the  Hib-MenCY-009  for  two  subjects (subject 342 and 4822), lasting three days, was determined by the investigator to be vaccinerelated (Supplement 67). Fatal SAEs - pooled studies As shown in Table 29, for the pooled studies, 16 fatalities were reported (10 in the Hib-MenCY group  and  six  in  the  Hib  group).  All  were  determined  by  the  investigator  to  be  unrelated  to vaccination according to investigators. Eleven of the 16 fatalities reported in the pooled studies occurred within the 30 day study interval after  each  vaccine dose (six  in the Hib-MenCY group and five in the Hib group) as shown in Supplement 66. New onset of chronic disease - pooled studies A comparison of the percentages of subjects reporting NOCD, from Day 0 through the ESFU, classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term, for the pooled data are listed in Table 30 . The percentages of subjects reporting NOCD, from Day 0 through the ESFU, classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term, for the pooled data, provided on a per country basis, are shown in Supplement 68 (US), Supplement 69 (Mexico) and Supplement 70 (Australia). AE listings were reviewed by a GSK Medical Monitor for preferred terms potentially representing a  NOCD,  and  these  events  were  subsequently  clarified  with  the  investigator.  The  NOCD checkbox on the CRF was the ultimate definition for the inclusion of an event as an NOCD in this analysis. Overall, the number of subjects experiencing NOCD was comparable and uncommon between the two groups: 3.6% of the subjects in each group reported at least one NOCD. Based on p-values, percentages of the following NOCDs were shown to be statistically different between groups: The incidence of food allergy was statistically higher in the Hib-MenCY group than in the Hib group (0.3% vs. 0.0%, p=0.0030).

## Rash - pooled studies

Comparisons  of  the  percentages  of  subjects  reporting  rash,  from  Day  0  through  the  ESFU, classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term, for the pooled data are

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

listed in Table 31. The percentages of subjects reporting rash, from Day 0 through the ESFU, classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term, for the pooled data, provided on a per country basis, are shown in Supplement 71 (US), Supplement 72 (Mexico) and Supplement 73 (Australia).

Overall,  the  number  of  subjects  experiencing  rash  was  comparable  between  the  two  groups: 13.3% and 13.4% of the subjects in the Hib-MenCY and Hib groups, respectively, reported at least one rash.

All  subjects  from  the  pooled  database  were  fully  co-vaccinated  with Prevnar and Pediarix in Mexico and in Australia; thus, the analyses per full co-vaccination status were performed for the United States subjects only. Because 93.0% of the Mexican subjects and 99.7% of the Australia subjects did not receive an influenza vaccine concomitant with a study dose, the analysis per influenza co-vaccination status was only performed for the United States subjects. Likewise, for the  analysis  per  rotavirus  co-vaccination  status  was  only  performed  for  the  United  States subjects since 100% of the Mexican subjects and 96.9% of the Australia subjects did not receive a rotavirus co-vaccination.

Based  on  p-values,  the  only  statistically  significant  difference  between  groups  was  in  the incidence  of  dry  skin  which  was  higher  in  the  Hib-MenCY  group  compared  to  the  Hib  group (0.1% vs. 0.0%, p=0.00351, respectively). There were two cases of petechiae reported in the studies (Hib-MenCY group, subject 7596 in the  Hib-MenCY-TT-011  study  and  subject  4861  in  the  Hib  group  of  the  Hib-MenCY-TT-009 study): the first case occurred 103 days after the third dose, lasted for 15 days, was graded as 2 and resolved within 15 days. This event was not considered as vaccine-related and the subject had no other symptom. The second case of petechiae occurred 20 days after the third dose and lasted  for  14  days.  This  event  was  not  considered  to  be  vaccine-related  according  to  the investigator. Urticaria  (hives)  was  reported  by  0.7%  of  the  subjects  in  each  group,  urticaria  popular  was reported by 0.0% and 0.1% of the subjects in the Hib-MenCY and Hib groups, respectively, and purpura was only reported by one subject (Hib-MenCY group, 1/6414=0.0%). Emergency room (ER) visits- pooled studies A comparison of the percentage of subjects reporting adverse events resulting in an ER visit reported from Day 0 through the ESFU, classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term for the pooled studies is presented in Table 32. The percentages of subjects with an AE resulting in an ER visit were the same for both groups (6.5% of the subjects in each group). The most frequently reported AEs resulting in an ER visit in both  groups, Hib-MenCY  and  Hib,  respectively, were  bronchiolitis (0.7%, both groups), gastroenteritis  (0.6%  and  0.8%),  otitis  media  (0.9%  and  0.7%),  pyrexia  (0.8%  and  0.7%)  and upper respiratory tract infection (0.8% and 0.6%). Based on p-values, the following statistically significant differences were found between groups with regard to AEs resulting in ER visits: The  incidences  of  viral  gastroenteritis  (0.2%  vs.  0.0%,  p=0.0059)  and  head  injury  (0.2%  vs. 0.0%,  p=0.0075)  were  higher  in  the  Hib-MenCY  group  vs.  the  Hib  group.  Whereas  the incidences  of  abnormal  faeces  (0.0%  vs.  0.1%,  p=0.0086),  acute  sinusitis  (0.0%  vs.  0.1%, p=0.0083), infectious croup (0.2% vs. 0.4%, p=0.0203), pharyngitis (0.0% vs. 0.1%, p=0.0410), arthropod bite (0.0% vs. 0.1%, p=0.0083) and hair-thread tourniquet syndrome (0.0% vs. 0.1%, p=0.0086) were higher in the Hib group. The percentages of subjects reporting AEs leading to an ER visit, from Day 0 through the ESFU, classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term, for the pooled data, provided on a per country basis, are shown in Supplement 74 (US), Supplement 75 (Mexico) and Supplement 76 (Australia).

Co-administration  for  the  rotavirus  vaccine, Pediarix and Prevnar vaccines  was  defined,  per RAP, as administration on the same day of a study vaccine dose. Concomitant administration for the influenza vaccines was defined, per RAP, as administration between 28 days before to 7 days after a study vaccine dose.

A summary of concomitantly administered vaccines by dose, for the Primary Total Vaccinated cohort, pooled studies Hib-MenCY-TT-009 and -011 is provided in Table 33.

## Presentation based on Rotavirus vaccination status

Most subjects (99.3%) were co-administered both Pediarix and Prevnar with either Hib-MenCYTT  or  Hib  vaccine.  Only  12.7%  of  all  subjects  in  the  pooled  studies  received  a  concomitant influenza  vaccination  and  12.2%  received  full  vaccination  course  of  coadministered  rotavirus vaccine (another 3.7% received partial co-administration of rotavirus vaccine). Presentation based on Pediarix and Prevnar vaccination status The percentage of subjects with SAEs, NOCD, rash, and AEs resulting in ER visits from Day 0 through  the  day  preceding  the  booster  dose,  based  on  full  co-vaccination  status  with  coadministered Pediarix and Prevnar (i.e.  fully  co-vaccinated  or  not),  for  US  subjects  (pooled Primary  Total  Vaccinated  cohort,  studies  Hib-MenCY-TT-009  and  -011)  are  presented  in Supplement 78. The percentage of subjects reporting specific SAEs, NOCD, rash and AEs resulting in ER visits, based  on  whether  subjects  received  co-administered Pediarix and Prevnar are  presented  in Supplement 79, Supplement 80, Supplement 81 and Supplement 82, respectively, from Day 0 through the day preceding the booster dose, by priming full covaccination status, for US subjects (Primary Total Vaccinated cohort, pooled studies Hib-MenCY-TT-009 and -011). For the fully co-vaccinated sub-category, the percentages of subjects in each treatment group for  the  pooled  studies,  reporting  SAEs,  NOCD,  rashes,  and  AEs  leading  to  ER  visits  were comparable. There were some observed differences between groups for the subset who were not fully co-vaccinated; however, the numbers of subjects in this group were small (47 and 16 subjects in the Hib-MenCY  and  Hib  groups,  respectively),  and  so  clinically  meaningful conclusions cannot be drawn.

rash  and  AEs  resulting  in  ER  visits,  based  on  whether  subjects  received  co-administered rotavirus vaccine are presented in Supplement 84 through Supplement 87, respectively. Results in  fully-co-vaccinated,  partially  co-vaccinated  and  no-co-vaccinated  cohorts for  subjects  in  the US were within the same range for each category of AE for the two treatment groups.

## Presentation based on Influenza virus vaccination status

The percentage of subjects with SAEs, NOCD, rash, and AEs resulting in emergency room visits from  Day  0  through  the  ESFU  period  based  on  influenza  vaccination  status,  for  US  subjects (Primary Total Vaccinated cohort, pooled studies Hib-MenCY-TT-009 and -011) are presented Supplement 88 . The percentage of subjects reporting specific SAEs, NOCD, rash and AEs resulting in ER visits, based  on  whether  subjects  received  co-administered  influenza  vaccine  are  presented  in Supplement 89 through Supplement 92, respectively. For US subjects who were not given concomitant, influenza vaccine the percentages of subjects in  each  treatment  group  reporting  SAEs,  NOCD,  rashes,  and  AEs  leading  to  ER  visits  were comparable. There were some observed differences between groups for the subset who was given concomitant influenza vaccine; however, the numbers of subjects in this group was small (27  and  14  subjects  in  the  Hib-MenCY  and  Hib  groups,  respectively),  and  so  clinically meaningful conclusions cannot be drawn. Logistic regression analysis Logistic  regression  analyses  were  performed  in  order  to  evaluate  any  differences  between incidences in the Hib-MenCY group and the Hib group with regard to concomitant administration of Prevnar , Pediarix ,  rotavirus  and  influenza  virus  vaccinations.  Analyses  by  specific  AE  type, model selection are provided  in Supplement 93 through Supplement 131. Note that a logistic regression  model  was  performed  of  each  AE  type  and  for  each  preferred  term  for  which statistically significantly different incidences between the two groups were found. Based on these comparisons, differences between incidences in the Hib-MenCY group and the Hib group did not vary significantly according to the co-vaccination of Prevnar , Pediarix , rotavirus and influenza virus vaccines. Safety conclusions for pooled studies Hib-MenCY-TT-011 and -009 data, within group analyses Overall, the Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine appeared to be comparable to the US-licensed ActHib with respect to AEs reported during the period from Day 0 through the ESFU (end of ESFU period). A total of 22.0% subjects in the Hib-MenCY group and 22.6% subjects in the Hib group reported at least one symptom within one of the specified categories, during the protocol defined followup period for the pooled studies. Specific categories of AEs were reported as follows: SAEs : At least one SAE was reported for 4.4% and 4.5% of the subjects from the pooled studies in the Hib-MenCY group and Hib group, respectively. NOCD: Overall, the number of subjects experiencing NOCD was comparable and uncommon between the two groups: 3.6% of the subjects in each group reported at least one NOCD. Rash :  rash  was  the  most  frequently  reported  AE  (13.3%  and  13.4%,  Hib-MenCY  and  Hib groups, respectively). AEs leading to ER visits: The percentages of subjects with an AE resulting in an ER visit were the same for both groups (6.5% of the subjects in each group). The most frequently reported adverse events resulting in an ER visit in both groups, Hib-MenCY and Hib, respectively, were bronchiolitis (0.7%, both groups), gastroenteritis (0.6% and 0.8%), otitis media (0.9% and 0.7%), pyrexia (0.8% and 0.7%) and upper respiratory tract infection (0.8% and 0.6%).

Specific SAEs reported by preferred MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term Differences  for  the  individual  SAE,  NOCD,  rash,  and  AE  leading  to  ER  visit  terms  were calculated  based  on  relative  risks,  with  statistical  significance  assigned  to  p-value  ≤0.05. Because of the large  number  of  comparisons made,  and  because  no multiplicity  adjustments

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were made, the risk of detecting differences due to chance alone was high. Nonetheless, based on  p-values,  the  difference  in  the  percentages  of  each  type  of  SAE  reported  by  preferred MedDRA  Primary  System  Organ  Class  and  Preferred  Term  were  not  statistically  significant between groups except for the following:

- The incidence in the Hib-MenCY group was statistically significantly lower than in the Hib group for vomiting (0.0% vs. 0.1%, p=0.0409) and influenza (0.0% vs. 0.1%, p=0.0083).

The incidence in the Hib-MenCY group was statistically significantly higher than in the Hib group for bronchiolitis (0.9% vs. 0.5%, p=0.0155) and urinary tract infection (0.2% vs. 0.0%, p=0.0491). Note that one case of bronchiolitis was inadvertently attributed to the Hib-MenCY group instead of the Hib group; however, this would not have changed the finding of statistical significance. All  except  two  SAEs  were  unrelated  to  vaccination  according  to  the  investigator.  The  two subjects  with  a  vaccine-related  SAE  experienced  pyrexia  on  the  day  of  the  first  dose,  lasting three days. Both subjects recovered from the event. Sixteen fatalities were reported: 10 in the Hib-MenCY group and six in the Hib group, none of which were determined by the investigator to be vaccine-related. Specific  NOCDs  reported  by  preferred  MedDRA  Primary  System  Organ  Class  and  Preferred Term Based  on  p-values,  the  percentages  of  the  following  NOCDs  were  shown  to  be  statistically different between groups: · The incidence of food allergy was statistically higher in the Hib-MenCY group than in the Hib group (0.3% vs. 0.0%, p=0.0030) · The  incidences  of  developmental  delay  (0.0%  vs.  0.1%,  p=0.0030)  and  bronchial hyperactivity (0.2% vs. 0.5%, p=0.0027) were statistically significantly lower in the HibMenCY group vs. the Hib group. Specific  cases  of  rash  reported  by  preferred  MedDRA  Primary  System  Organ  Class  and Preferred Term Based  on  p-values,  the  only  statistically  significant  difference  between  groups  was  in  the incidence  of  dry  skin  which  was  higher  in  the  Hib-MenCY  group  compared  to  the  Hib  group (0.1% vs. 0.0%, p=0.00351, respectively). There were two cases of petechiae reported in the studies (one occurred 103 days after the third dose,  and  the  other  occurred  20  days  after  the  third  dose).  Neither  case  was  related  to vaccination according to the investigator. Urticaria  (hives)  was  reported  by  0.7%  of  the  subjects  in  each  group,  urticaria  popular  was reported by 0.0% and 0.1% of the subjects in the Hib-MenCY and Hib groups, respectively, and purpura  was  reported  by  one  subject  in  the  Hib-MenCY  group  (0.0%  of  the  subjects  in  each group). Specific AEs leading to an ER visit reported by preferred MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term Based on p-values, the following statistically significant differences were found between groups with regard to an AE resulting in an ER visit: The incidences of viral gastroenteritis (0.2% vs. 0.0%,  p=0.0059)  and  head  injury  (0.2%  vs.  0.0%,  p=0.0075)  were  higher  in  the  Hib-MenCY group vs. the Hib group. The incidences of abnormal feces (0.0% vs. 0.1%, p=0.0086), acute sinusitis (0.0% vs. 0.1%, p=0.0083), infectious croup (0.2% vs. 0.4%, p=0.0203), pharyngitis (0.0% vs. 0.1%, p=0.0410), arthropod bite (0.0% vs. 0.1%, p=0.0083) and hair-thread tourniquet syndrome (0.0% vs. 0.1%, p=0.0086) were higher in the Hib group.

## Homogeneity of results across countries and co-vaccination status

No statistically significant Breslow and Day test was found either overall per unsolicited symptom type or by preferred MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term indicating, that the differences between Hib-MenCY and Hib did not vary across countries.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

According to the results of the logistic regressions differences between incidences of AEs in the Hib-MenCY group and the Hib group, did not vary significantly with coadministration of the other planned vaccines ( Pediarix , Prevnar , RotaTeq and influenza virus vaccines).

Given the small observed differences (even in the statistically significant differences), the overall safety profile regarding specific unsolicited symptoms of Hib-MenCY group is very similar to the one of the Hib group.

3. Discussion on clinical aspects This clinical report represents pooled data from the studies Hib-MenCY-TT-011 and -009, which included  8873  enrolled  subjects  from  the  US,  Mexico  and  Australia,  and  of  which  8571  were vaccinated (6414 received Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine and 2157 received Hib vaccine), 8011 that completed the study and 7986 that completed the ESFU (extended safety follow-up). The  demographic  profile  of  the  two  treatment  groups  of  subjects  in  the  pooled  studies'  Total Vaccinated Cohort was comparable with respect to mean age, gender and racial distribution. Of the  8571  subjects  vaccinated  with  either  Hib-MenCY-TT  or  Hib  vaccine,  99.3%  received  coadministration of Prevnar and Pediarix, 12.7% received coadministration of an influenza vaccine and 15.9% were co-administered at least one dose of rotavirus vaccine. The purpose of this study is to complement study Hib-MenCY-TT-009/-010 in order to define the safety profile of the Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine with respect to infrequent adverse events (i.e. SAEs, rash, ER visits, and new onset of chronic illnesses). Conclusions for the pooled dataset are as follows: Overall, the Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine was comparable to the US-licensed ActHib with respect to AEs reported during the period from Day 0 through the ESFU period. AEs that had a statistically higher incidence in the Hib-MenCY group were reported with a frequency of less than 1% and were unrelated to the Hib-MenCY-TT vaccination. There  were  no  vaccine-related  SAEs  reported  in  the  Hib-MenCY-TT-011  study.  In  the  HibMenCY-TT-009 study, two SAEs were related to vaccination according to the investigator. Both were cases of pyrexia on the day of the first dose, lasting three days, reported in the Hib-MenCY group. Both subjects recovered from the event. None of the fatalities reported in the pooled studies were determined by the investigator to be vaccine-related. No statistically significant Breslow and Day test was found either overall per unsolicited symptom type  or  by  MedDRA  Primary  System  Organ  Class  and  Preferred  Term  indicating  that  the (absence of) difference between Hib-MenCY and Hib did not seem to vary across country. Based  on  results  of  the  logistic  regressions,  the  differences  between  incidences  in  the  HibMenCY group and the Hib group did  not  vary  significantly  according  to  the  co-vaccination  of Pediarix , Prevnar , influenza and RotaTeq vaccines. Hib-MenCY-TT was found to have a clinically-acceptable safety profile in the pooled studies and in the Hib-MenCY-TT-011 study. Thus, the overall comparability of safety profiles between the investigational Hib-MenCY group and the US-licensed monovalent Hib control group was demonstrated regardless of the country where vaccinations  were administered or of the co-vaccination of other routinely-administered vaccines. There were very few statistically significant differences in the relative risks for specific AE  terms.  These  differences  must  be  interpreted  with  caution,  given  the  large  number  of comparisons made, and the fact that no multiplicity adjustments were made. For  example,  bronchiolitis  as  an  SAE  was  the  only  SAE  that  was  reported  statistically significantly more frequently in the Hib-MenCY group, yet the incidence of other clinically related AEs such as bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, croup, bronchial hyper reactivity and bronchospasm were not statistically different between the groups. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Additionally, the incidence of the bronchiolitis reported was low (39/3278 subjects) and none of the cases were causally related to vaccination, according to the investigator.

Given  the  large  sample  size,  the  likelihood  of  even  a  small  difference  becoming  statistically significant is greater than with a small sample size. Note that there was one case attributed to the  Hib-MenCY  group  instead  of  Hib  group,  although  this  would  not  have  changed  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

significance based on the p-value. Moreover, the incidence of NOCD of bronchial hyperreactivity (a chronic illness associated with wheezing that is on the clinical continuum with bronchiolitis) was statistically significantly lower in the Hib-MenCY group as compared to the Hib group.

With  regard  to  NOCDs,  food  allergy  as  an  NOCD  for  the  pooled  dataset  was  statistically significantly higher in the Hib-MenCY group than in the Hib group, yet for the Hib-MenCY-TT011 study, milk allergy was statistically significantly lower in the Hib-MenCY group than in the Hib group.

In  summary,  based  on  the  pooled  datasets  of  Hib-MenCY-TT-009  and  Hib-MenCY-TT-011 studies, a priming schedule at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with Hib-MenCY-TT coadministered with routinely-recommended paediatric vaccines is clinically acceptable. V. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION  Overall conclusion The  paediatric  studies  submitted  by  the  MAH  aimed  at  defining  the  safety  profile  of  the  HibMenCY-TT vaccine with respect to infrequent adverse events (i.e.  SAEs,  rash,  ER  visits  and NOCD)  in  comparison  with  a  US-licensed  monovalent  Hib  control  group.  Overall,  the  safety profiles  of  the  investigational  Hib-MenCY-TT  vaccine  and  the  monovalent  Hib  vaccine  were comparable  regardless  of  the  country  in  which  the  vaccinations  were  administered,  the  covaccination status or vaccination with other routinely administered vaccines, both in the single Hib-MenCY-TT-011 study data and the pooled study data (Hib-MenCY-TT-011 and -09).  Recommendation Based on these results, discussed in detail by the MAH, the safety profile of the investigational vaccine is considered acceptable and no further action is required.
