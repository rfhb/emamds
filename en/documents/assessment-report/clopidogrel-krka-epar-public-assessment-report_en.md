This  generic  application  contains  a  different  salt lopidogrel  hydrochloride)  of  the  active  substance  used  in  the  reference  product  (clopidogrel C toxicological  properties  are  well (c hydrogensulphate). A summary of the literature information on non-clinical data of clopidogrel and the  results  of  two  new  non-clinical  studies  (acute  and  chronic  toxicity)  conducted  with  clopidogrel hydrochloride  were  provided.  Furthermore,  on  the  basis  of  the  CHMP  Guidance  for  users  of  the centralised  procedure  for  generic  application  (EMEA/CHMP/225411/2006),  when  different  salts  of the  active  substance  of  the  reference  medicinal  product  are  used,  additional  information  providing proof that their non-clinical safety and/or efficacy profile is not different from that of the reference medicinal  product  is  needed.  Thus,  information  that  the  different  clopidogrel  salt  (clopidogrel hydrochloride)  does  not  differ  significantly  in  non-clinical  properties  with  regards  to  safety  and efficacy  of  the  reference  product  were  requested  by  the  CHMP  in  accordance  with  the  relevant guideline.

lopidogrel  hydrochloride vs clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate.  The  repeated  dose  toxicity tudy  reports  were  in  accordance  with  GLP  standards  and  regulatory  guidelines  (please  see  section The  response  referred  to  the  results  of  the  toxicity  and  genotoxicity  studies  to  examine  the  safety profile  of  c s Toxicology ).  The  13-week  toxicity  study  report  did  not  detect  major  differences  in  the  same  safety profile for the hydrochloride and hydrogen sulphate salt; liver was determined as the target organ in both salts. Regarding the genotoxicity testing, clopidogrel hydrochloride tested at a higher concentration level than clopidogrel hydrogen  sulphate, turned to be not clastogenic in the chromosome aberration test. In the micronucleus test, at the same dose levels, neither the hydrogen sulphate  salt  nor  the  hydrochloride  salt  was  found  clastogenic/aneugenic.  Thus,  based  on  the  data provided,  similar  safety  profile  was  demonstrated  for  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  and  clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate.

## Single-dose toxicity

he acute toxicity study on rats was performed with clopidogrel hydrochloride. Results of single dose t  doses  10,  100,  1000 g/kg.  No  clinical  signs  of  toxicity  and  mortality  were  reported  in  rats  after  the  administration  of differences in body weight gain were seen between the control and treated groups. T toxicity  studies  in  rats  revealed  low  toxicity  of  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  a m drug. No significant At  terminal  necropsy,  no  apparent  macroscopic  changes  attributed  to  clopidogrel  hydrochloride administration were observed in any animal. The majority of tissue was macroscopically unremarkable. LD50 values were over 1500mg /kg for both sexes.

. After a single oral administration of clopidogrel in mice, rats and baboons, toxicity occurred only at very high doses and the target organs were mainly the gastrointestinal tract, the kidney and the lung. The oral LD50 values of clopidogrel were over 2 g/kg in all species

## Repeated-dose toxicity

The study was conducted 1 body weight/day. Treatm lack of treatment related clinical signs and the normal growth of the animals. Some treatment related changes  in  haematology,  e.g.  thrombocytes,  and  clinical  chemistry,  e.g.  cholesterol,  triglycerides, bilirubin,  total  protein,  etc.,  were  revealed.  Decreased  thymus  weights,  increased  adrenal,  kidney, seminal vesicles and liver weights and hypertrophy of centrilobular hepatocytes were also observed. The  no-observed-adverse-effect  level  (NOAEL)  for  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  was  considered  12.5 mg/kg body weight/day. There appears to be no additional toxic effects of clopidogrel hydrochloride although no direct comparative data between the clopidogrel hydrochloride and clopidogrel hydrogensulphate were provided. Furthermore, any potential differences in the non-clinical toxicokinetic  profile  would  be  apparent  in  the  clinical  pharmacokinetic  profile  addressed  by  the bioequivalence studies.

## Genotoxicity

In Ames test of clopidogrel's main metabolite S-carboxylic acid derivative was The  eventual mutagenic activity of clopidogrel hydrochloride was investigated in the The in  vitro  Salmonella  typhimurium reverse  mutation  assays  of  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  was performed  and  revealed c also negative. bacterial reverse mutation assay with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA 1535 and  TA102,  without  and  with  metabolic  activation.  The  tested  substance  was  considered  non mutagenic. Clopidogrel was not genotoxic in micronucleus test in mice. Incidence of micronucleated polychromatic red blood cells (RBs) was not elevated in mice received clopidogrel at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg daily, for three consecutive days. Ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic RBCs was also normal which indicates that there was no bone marrow cytotoxicity. There was no evidence of any clastogenic activity for clopidogrel.

## POPULATION(S) STUDIED

I  18.00 8.00 kg/m2 were included in the study. These were medically healthy subjects with clinically normal signs  and  ECGs.  Of  the  96  subjects,  4  subjects  were  withdrawn  or iscontinued. 92 subjects finished the study and were included in the analysis. Adequate inclusion and A total of 96 healthy, non-smoking, adult male volunteers aged 18-55 years and with BM 2 laboratory  profiles,  vital d exclusion  criteria  were  followed.  The  choice  of  the  selected  population  in  this  clinical  trial  was considered appropriate.

## ANALYTICAL METHODS

The plasma samples were assayed for clopidogrel and its carboxylic acid metabolite using LC/MS/MS ethod.  The  analytical  technique  was  initially  validated  at  a  CRO  in  Canada,  and  transferred in Canada. A partial validation was conducted successfully in order to allow is transfer. However, there were insufficient data submitted with respect to the pre-study validation m afterward to another CRO th and validation of the bio-analytical technique used for determination of clopidogrel, and the CHMP questioned the validity of the bioequivalence study. Thus, a GCP inspection was requested.

## PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES

The primary pharmacokinetic parameters defined in the protocol were AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and maximal plasma clopidogrel concentration Cmax.

## TATISTICAL METHODS S

ried out on ln-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax for both nalytes:  clopidogrel  and  the  main  inactive  metabolite.  A  non-parametric  test  was  carried  out  to between  treatments.  The  statistical  model  included  sequence,  period  and eatment factors as fixed effects and subject within sequence as random effect. The statistical methods Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was car a compare  the  Tmax  values tr used were acceptable.

## Discussion on Clinical aspects

lopidogrel Krka application, analysing the arent prodrug clopidogrel. The demonstration of the unchanged safety/efficacy profile of clopidogrel ith Plavix (clopidogrel hydrogensulphate) was raised by the CHMP s a major issue for this generic product. In response, further discussion on the comparability of the One clinical bioequivalence trial 07-197 was provided for C p hydrochloride when compared w a efficacy  and  safety  profiles  of  clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate  and  clopidogrel  hydrochloride  was provided. Pharmacokinetics, dissolution, adverse events profile and other clinical data were considered and it was concluded that the two salts of clopidogrel have a comparable safety/efficacy profile.

e metabolite clopidogrel thiol. Thus, the pharmacokinetic profile was established based on the harmacokinetics of clopidogrel carboxylic acid, which is the non-active metabolite.  In the meantime, At  the  time  of  approval  of  the  reference  product  Plavix,  there  was  no  reliable  and  validated methodology for the determination of the pharmacokinetics of the parent prodrug clopidogrel, or of the activ p a reliable bioanalytical method for determination of clopidogrel in plasma and urine was developed. Since  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  the  active  metabolite  is  still  not  well  established,  the  CHMP accepted the proof of bioequivalence based on the clopidogrel parent compound data in study 07-197. Thus,  data  related  to  pharmacokinetics  of  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid  are  considered  supportive, whereas data on clopidogrel parent drug is important for the confirmation of bioequivalence.

The indication of Clopidogrel Krka is different from that of the reference medicinal product, Plavix (please see section 2.1). Thus, the Product Information has been adequately amended to reflect this change and this is considered acceptable.

ondition  compared  to  the  fasted  condition.  The  currently resented clinical studies were conducted in fasted state and thus, the CHMP requested a clarification Furthermore, the recently published literature data indicate that the bioavailability of a single oral dose of clopidogrel and the pharmacokinetic parameters of clopidogrel, especially Cmax and AUCinf, might be  increased  by  several  folds  in  the  fed  c p of  this  approach  and  adequate  justification  why  bioequivalence  for  the  generic  product  should  be demonstrated only under fasting condition was provided. Bioequivalence studies in fasting conditions are  normally  recommended  as  mentioned  in  the  Questions  &amp;  Answers  on  the  Bioavailability  and Bioequivalence Guideline (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006) document as the drug product is to be administered  under  fasting  as  well  as  fed  conditions.  In  addition  to  the  dissolution  studies  using clopidogrel  hydrogen  sulphate,  conducted  at  three  different  pH  values  (1.2,  4.5,  6.8),  the  applicant provided an additional in vivo bioequivalence study conducted under fed conditions.

bioequivalence  study  did  not  reveal  any  major  differences  when  compared  to  the  reference  drug product.

The  bio-analytical  technique  and  methodology  applied  in  the  analysis  of  the  samples  during  the bioequivalence  studies  included  validation  with  the  analysis  of  calibration  curves  and  controls  at various concentrations. The CHMP questioned whether there is a potential for back-conversion of the uantitatively  major  metabolite  clopidogrel  carboxylic  acid  to  the  parent  drug.  Considering that the q plasma levels of clopidogrel carboxylic acid are considerably higher than those of the parent drug, a minimum back-conversion of the metabolite would lead to a significant over-estimation of clopidogrel plasma levels and would bias the outcome of the bioequivalence study. The back-conversion could occur in the presence of alcohol used in sample preparation and analysis. It was, indeed, reported that a possible back-conversion of clopidogrel metabolite to clopidogrel parent drug was evidenced in the presence  of  methanol.  In  order  to  avoid  this  process,  the  extraction  procedure  was  changed  and methanol-free conditions employed. Although it has been indicated that stability tests were performed in  order  to  prove  the  reproducibility  and  accuracy  of  clopidogrel  concentration  measurements,  the CHMP  questioned  these  results  since  no  clear  description  of  the  analytical  technique  including extraction procedure actually used in the initial pre-study validation process was  provided. Information on the validation procedures in study 07-197 was requested by the CHMP. In response, details of the bio-analytical methodology and full validation details were provided demonstrating that no methanol, which is needed for the conversion the acid metabolite to clopidogrel, was used and thus, no  source  of  methylation  exists  within  the  entire  methodology,  including  all  solution  preparation, plasma sample processing,  handling  storage  and  LC-MS/MS determination. The CHMP considered this issue resolved.

oequivalence study was requested by the CHMP, which was of the opinion that sults  of  this  inspection  and  the  satisfactory  responses  to  its  findings  were  an  integral  part  of  the Considering the above difficulties in the determination of clopidogrel in plasma especially the issue related  to  the  possible  back-conversion  of  the  metabolite  to  the  parent  drug,  a  triggered  GCP inspection of the bi re evaluation procedure. The inspection identified major and minor findings that seem not to affect the overall results of the trial.

The  parameters  used  to  establish ioavailability included the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the maximal plasma The  bioequivalence  study  07-197  and  its  statistical  evaluation  were  in  accordance  with  accepted standards  for  bioequivalence  testing,  as  stated  in  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of Bioavailability  and  Bioequ b concentration  of  the  parent  compound  of  clopidogrel.  The  90%  confidence  intervals  for  these parameters  were  within  the  recommended  80-125%  range  for  clopidogrel,  required  by  the  above mentioned guideline. The proposed widening of the 90% confidence interval for clopidogrel Cmax to 75%-133% was found to be unacceptable by the CHMP; nevertheless, since the confidence intervals for Cmax values of clopidogrel were within the required 80-125% range, the need for widening of the intervals was not applicable. The bioequivalence with Plavix was proven.
