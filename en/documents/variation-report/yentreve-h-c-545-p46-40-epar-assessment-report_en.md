## I. INTRODUCTION

On 2 March 2012, the MAH submitted the final clinical study report for study F1J-MC-HMCL (HMCL), 'A Double-Blind, Efficacy and Safety Study of Duloxetine versus Placebo in the Treatment of Children and Adolescents  with  Major  Depressive  Disorder',  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 1901/2006, as amended. On 11 April 2012 a second study, F1J-MC-HMCK (HMCK), 'A Double-Blind, Efficacy and Safety Study of Duloxetine versus Placebo in the Treatment of Children and Adolescents with  Major  Depressive  Disorder'  was  submitted  accompanied  by  a  clinical  overview  discussing  the results of both studies and any considerations for the Product Information.

These studies are provided in line with the current 6 months reporting timeline.

The MAH stated that a brief summary of the now submitted paediatric studies results will be proposed for inclusion in the SmPC (Sections 4.2. and 5.1) within 2 months of the CHMP's assessment of this Article 46 filing, in order to provide appropriate SmPC wording taking into consideration the CHMP's review of the data.

## II. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## II.1 Information on the development program

Duloxetine is a combined serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor. It weakly inhibits dopamine  reuptake  with  no  significant  affinity  for  histaminergic,  dopaminergic,  cholinergic  and adrenergic receptors.

Duloxetine is authorised in EU in adults for the treatment of major depressive episodes; the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain; the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder and for women for the treatment of moderate to severe stress urinary incontinence.

Studies HMCK and HMCL were conducted to comply with a US postmarketing requirement.

The Phase 2 paediatric study (F1J-MC-HMFN [HMFN1]) that preceded HMCK and HMCL was conducted as part of a paediatric plan committed with the FDA and submitted per Article 46 in April 2009 with CHMP outcome on 30 June 2009 (EMEA/412163/2009).

On 19 October 2009 the applicant submitted to the European Medicines Agency an application for a paediatric investigation plan including a deferral and a waiver for Duloxetine hydrochloride in diabetic neuropathic  pain,  chronic  pain,  major  depressive  disorder,  generalized  anxiety  disorder  and  stress urinary  incontinence.  The  European  Medicines  Agency  adopted  a  decision  granting  a  waiver  for duloxetine hydrochloride for all subsets of the paediatric population from birth to less than 18 years of age; on the grounds that the specific medicinal product is likely to be unsafe. [EMA decision P/21/2010 of 02 March 2010 revised 17 November 2010 (P/268/2010)].

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rapporteur's comments:

At the time of submitting the application for the paediatric investigation plan, the phase II study HMFN was yet completed and the two phase III studies (HMCL and HMCK) were on-going.

The EMA Paediatric Working Party in their Assessment of the Paediatric Needs - Psychiatry (EMEA/288917/2007), considered duloxetine to be devoid of interest to be developed in paediatric psychiatric indications or below the authorised age group.

Two separate reports will be provided by the Company with pooled data from duloxetine paediatric studies:

- a report on population PK
- a report discussing observations regarding growth and development.

No additional on-going or planned studies for the indication are declared.

## II.2 Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Duloxetine is authorised as 30 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg, hard gastro-resistant capsules. Duloxetine is not indicated for use in children. No suitable paediatric formulation is available.

30-mg capsules of duloxetine hydrochloride (size 3 capsule) were dispensed in these two phase III studies.

## Rapporteur's comments:

Patients involved in the studies now submitted were treated with the currently marketed formulation. The commercial formulation seems to be acceptable for older children.

20 and 30 mg capsules of duloxetine enteric-coated pellets were administered to patients participating in Phase II HMFN study, which included children and adolescents form 7 up to 18 years old. No further data on PK bioequivalence between both formulations are provided.

## II.3 Non-clinical aspects

No information provided.

## Rapporteur's comments:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH should submit relevant data from completed juvenile studies in order to evaluate the inclusion of this information in the SPC.

## II.4 Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

The MAH provides an overview of 2 completed Phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled studies  of  duloxetine  [F1J-MC-HMCK (HMCK)] and F1J-MC-HMCL (HMCL)] in paediatric patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).

The design of both studies are the same with the only difference that HMCK is a flexible dosing study (60 mg to 120mg once daily) whereas HMCL is a fixed-dose study during the acute treatment period (30  mg  and  60  mg  once  daily).  Both  studies  included  a  fluoxetine  treatment  arm  to  test  assay sensitivity.

A number  of plasma samples were collected in both studies in order to characterize the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine at steady-state.

## · Pharmacokinetic results

The findings related to the descriptive summary statistics of duloxetine steady-state concentrations in Studies HMCL and HMCK have been summarized.

## HMCL Study

A total of 1157 plasma samples (collected throughout the full 36-week study) were obtained from 268 patients  for  the  measurement  of  duloxetine  concentrations.  730  quantifiable  plasma  concentrations from 214 patients were included in the PK evaluation.

Of the 214 patients that contributed quantifiable plasma concentrations, 37% were children (aged 7 to 11 years) and 63% were adolescents (aged 12 to 18 years). The number of males and females were similar at 48% and 52%, respectively. The majority of the patients were nonsmokers (92%), extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers (84%) and White (59%). Seventy percent (70%) of female patients had attained menarche.  Disposition  of  doses  for  the  quantifiable  plasma  concentrations  included  in  the  PK assessment was 20%, 30-mg; 46%, 60-mg; 14%, 90-mg; and 20%, 120-mg duloxetine administered once  daily.  Summary  statistics  for  duloxetine  concentrations,  age,  and  body  weight  by  dose  are presented in Table HMCL.11.25 below

Typical duloxetine plasma concentrations increased in proportion to the increase in dose. This apparent dose proportionality was observed for both children and adolescents. For a given dose, the median duloxetine concentrations as well as the range of concentration were similar in children and adolescents. Because the PK of duloxetine are linear, dose-normalized plasma concentrations were utilized for subsequent evaluation of the effect of the various patient factors on duloxetine plasma concentrations.

## HMCK Study

A  total  of  793  plasma  samples  were  obtained  from  the  patients  for  the  measurement  of  duloxetine concentrations.  532  quantifiable  plasma  concentrations  from  152  patients  were  included  in  the  PK evaluation.

Of the 152 patients that contributed quantifiable plasma concentrations, 36% were children (7 to 11 years old) and 64% were adolescents (12 to 18 years old). The number of males and females were similar at 51% and 49%, respectively. The majority of the patients were nonsmokers (89%), extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers (93%) and Caucasian (84%). Sixty-four percent (64%) of female patients had attained menarche. Disposition of doses for the 532 quantifiable plasma concentrations included in the PK  assessment  was  &lt;1%,  30-mg;  48%,  60-mg;  13%,  90-mg;  and  39%,  120-mg  duloxetine administered  once-daily.  Summary  statistics  for  duloxetine  concentrations,  age  and  body  weight  by dose are presented in Table HMCK.11.25 below.

Duloxetine plasma concentrations appeared to increase in a linear manner with increasing doses in the dose  range  of  60  to  120  mg  as  shown  in  Table  HMCK.11.25.  For  a  given  dose,  there  were  no discernible differences in median duloxetine concentration in children and adolescents; the distribution and  range of concentration were  similar in the 2 populations.  The  median  dose-normalized concentration  in  females  is  similar  to  that  in  males  along  with  the  distribution  range  of  duloxetine concentration.  Similarly,  dose-normalized  steady  state  duloxetine  concentrations  were  similar  in subgroups defined  by  ethnicity,  race,  age  and  body  weight.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  number  of patients is low for certain ethnicity (Hispanics) and race (Native American, Black, Multi-racial) relative to Caucasians.

## Rapporteur's comments:

The results of the phase II study (HMFN) showed that duloxetine plasma concentrations increased in proportion to the increase of the dose, and that gender (and not age, body weight, creatinine clearance, CYP2D6 status, or dose) was the only characteristic that seemed to influence the pharmacokinetic of duloxetine. As it was observed in adults the inter- and intrapatient variability is very high, with an overlap in duloxetine concentration-time profile in females and males.

In Studies HMCL and HMCK now submitted subjects received 30 to 120 mg duloxetine doses regardless of they were children or adolescents (30 to 120 mg in HMCL; 60 to 120 mg in HMCK). The steady-state duloxetine plasma concentrations increased with increasing dose in both children and adolescents. No relevant differences in Cmax and AUC were observed between the two age groups. Patient characteristics such as CYP2D6 metabolizer status, ethnicity, sex, age, and body weight did not appear to have an effect on steady-state duloxetine plasma concentrations. No dose adjustment seems to be required in the adolescent population with respect to the younger group.

The MAH states that a comprehensive report on the population PK of duloxetine in children and adolescents using data collected from this study and others will be provided as a separate report. In that report, PK data from this study will be analysed using population modelling approaches along with data from Studies HMFN, HMCL and HMCK.

##  Methods

## · Study design

The two studies had 4 periods and employed stratified randomization by age (children aged 7 to 11 years; adolescents aged 12 to 17 years) to allow a separate assessment of efficacy and safety in these 2 distinct subsets of the paediatric population. Enrolment was monitored to ensure at least 40% of the patient population was children.

- Study period I: screening phase of no more than 30 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Study period II: 10-week acute treatment phase which included a 2-week titration period aimed to improving tolerability
- Study period III: a 6-month double-blind extension period.
- Study period IV: a 2-week tapering phase to minimize discontinuation AEs.

Placebo assigned patients in study period II were assigned to duloxetine flexible doses for study period III.  Patients discontinued the study if at any time they could not tolerate the study drug sufficiently to remain compliant based on the investigator's judgment. Additionally, patients discontinued the study if in their or in the investigator's opinion there was no adequate response or if patient safety may have been compromised.

## Study HMCK  (Flexible-dose study) .

During the acute and extension phases, the duloxetine dose could be adjusted within the study range (60 mg to 120 mg) based on the investigator's clinical judgment of treatment response and tolerability at the current dose. If a dose decrease occurred, no further dose increases were permitted.

<!-- image -->

## Study HMCL (Fixed-dose study)

Three fixed-dose arms were included: duloxetine 30 mg, duloxetine 60 mg, and fluoxetine 20 mg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

- Objectives

## Primary Objective

To assess the efficacy of duloxetine (60 mg once daily for Study HMCL; 60 mg to 120 mg for Study HMCK) compared with placebo, as measured by CDRS-R total score, in the acute treatment of children (aged 7 through 11 years) and adolescents (aged 12 through17 years) with major depressive disorder without psychotic features, single or recurrent episode.

## Secondary Objectives

- To test assay sensitivity by comparing fluoxetine with placebo during the acute treatment.
- To evaluate the efficacy of treatment of duloxetine (30 and 60 mg or 60-120 mg QD) compared with placebo during acute treatment phase as measured by CDRS-R total score, CDRS-R subscales, Remission rates, Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) scale.
- To assess changes in depressive symptoms during a 6-month, double-blind extension phase
- using the above measures
- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of treatment with duloxetine compared with placebo during acute treatment phase
- To assess safety
-  a n d   t o le r a b ilit y   o f d u lo x e t in e   d u r in g   a   6 -month, double-blind extension phase.
- To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of duloxetine at steady-state.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

· To compare the steady-state duloxetine PK with historical adult duloxetine PK using duloxetine steady-state concentration data and PK parameters.

· To investigate the relationship between duloxetine exposure and efficacy endpoints during acute treatment using steady-state duloxetine plasma concentrations and CDRS-R total score.

## · Study population /Sample size

## Inclusion Criteria

Male and female outpatients 7 to17 years of age who met DSM-IVTR criteria for MDD, with a severity defined by CDRS-R Total Score of &gt;40 and a Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) of &gt;4 at each screening and randomization visit.

The  Mini  International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  for  children  and  adolescents  (MINI-KID)  was  also administered to support the diagnosis of MDD.

## Exclusion Criteria

·Any  lifetime  psychotic  disorders,  bipolar  disorder  (or  those  with  1  or  more  first  degree  relatives [parents  or siblings] with  diagnosed  Bipolar  I  disorder),  OCD,  eating  disorders,  or  pervasive development disorder.

·Suicide attempt within 1 year of Visit 1 or, in the opinion of the investigator, were currently at risk of suicide.

·Any changes in psychotherapy within 6 weeks of Visit 1. Patients requiring changes to psychotherapy during Study Period II may have been discontinued from the study if such changes could confound assessment of efficacy. Changes to psychotherapy were allowed during Study Period III.

## Sample size

A sample size of 100 patients in each group was calculated to have adequate power (approximately 80% power) to detect an effect size of 0.40 (duloxetine efficacy relative to placebo on CDRS-R total score) using a 2-group t-test with a 0.05 2-sided significance level. Allowing for 10% of patients to have missing post-baseline data, at least 112 patients were randomized to each treatment arm.

## · Treatments

Enrolled patients were assigned to duloxetine once daily (30 mg or 60 mg for Study HMCL; 60 mg to 120 mg for Study HMCK), fluoxetine once daily (20 mg for Study HMCL; 20 mg to 40 mg for Study HMCK)  or  placebo.  Duloxetine  30  mg  and  Fluoxetine  10  mg  were  administrated  for  titration  and tapering.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Concomitant  medications  with  primarily  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  activity  were  not  allowed. Cough  and  cold  medications  containing  pseudoephedrine  and  antihistamines  (eg,  diphenhydramine) were allowed for ≤3 consecutive days or 15 cumulative days during Study Period II or 10 cumulative days per month in Study Period III.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  contrast  between  duloxetine  and  placebo  at  the  last  visit  in Study Period II (Visit 8, Week 10), based on a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis on change from baseline in the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) total score.

Secondary efficacy endpoints:

- Change from baseline to endpoint for CDRS-R total score, CDRS-R Item 13 (suicidal ideation), and CGI-S
- Change from baseline at each postbaseline visit for CDRS-R total score (Study Periods II/III and  III),  CDRS-R  Total  Score  (excluding  age  and  age*visit  covariates),  CDRS-R  Subscale (mood, somatic, subjective, behavior) and Item 13 scores, CGI-S
- Categorical variable for Remission Rate (CDRS-R) at endpoint, CDRS-R Remission Rate at last 2 nonmissing visits, 30% Response Rate (CDRS-R total score), 50% Response Rate (CDRS-R total score), Continuous Responder Analysis (CDRS-R total score), and CGI-S Response Rate
- Categorical  Variable  at  each  postbaseline  Visit  Visitwise  for  Remission  Rate,  30%  Response Rate  (CDRS-R  total  score),  50%  Response  Rate  (CDRS-R  total  score),  and  CGI-S  Response Rate
- Time to event for time to first remission (defined by the first visit that CDRS-R total score of ≤ 28), and time to first - 50% Response on CDRS total score

## Safety endpoints:

- Percentages of patients that reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), discontinuation emergent adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and discontinuations due to AEs
- Mean  change  in  laboratory  analytes,  height,  weight,  vital  signs,  and  ECG  intervals  from baseline to endpoint
- Categorical analyses of potentially clinically significant (PCS) changes in vital signs and ECG
- Proportion of patients with treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory values
- Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) serious adverse events (SAEs), treatmentemergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs),  vital  signs  and  weight,  discontinuation  due  to  adverse

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

events, laboratory measurements and ECGs. Suicide risk and suicide-related events (behaviour and/or ideation) were assessed via the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).

## Efficacy Measures

- Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) (Poznanski et al. 1983, 1984, 1985) is a clinician-rated  instrument  designed  to  measure  the  presence  and  severity  of  depression  in children. The scale was modeled after the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) for adults (Hamilton 1960) and includes questions about school. The scale consists of 17 items scored on a 1-to-5- or 1-to-7-point scale. A rating of 1 indicates normal functioning. Total scores range from 17 to 113. In general, scores below 20 indicate an absence of depression, scores of 20 to 30 indicate borderline depression, and scores of 40 to 60 indicate moderate depression.
- Clinical Global Impressions of Severity (CGI-S) Scale (Guy 1976): Evaluation of the severity of illness at the time of assessment. The score ranged from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). The CGI-S had to be administered by a study physician in the presence of the patient or after having been in the presence of the patient.
- Remission rate (CDRS-R): CDRS-R total score of ≤ 28 at endpoint
- 30% Response Rate (CDRS-R total score): ≥ 30% reduction from baseline to LOCF endpoint
- 50% Response Rate (CDRS-R total score) 050% reduction from baseline to LOCF endpoin

## · Statistical Methods

Efficacy  and  safety  analysis  were  conducted  on  an  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  basis  unless  otherwise specified. All tests of hypotheses were to be based on the significance level of 0.05. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made.

The  primary  analysis  method  was  a  repeated  measures  analysis;  that  is,  a  restricted  maximum likelihood (REML)-based, mixed-effects repeated measures (MMRM) analysis using all the longitudinal observations at each post-baseline visit. Significance tests between duloxetine (60 mg for HMCL, 60 mg to 120 mg for HMCK) and placebo were based on least-squares means (LSMean) using a 2-sided α=0.05.

LSMean was used for the statistical comparison using ANOVA or ANCOVA. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used for these analyses.

Categorical  comparisons  between  treatment  groups  were  performed  using  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH),  controlling  for  pooled  investigative  site,  and  Fisher's  exact  tests,  where  appropriate,  or Pearson's chisquared test

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  secondary  efficacy  analyses  was  performed  on  the  secondary  variables  mentioned  above. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize these variables by treatment (fluoxetine and duloxetine) group  during  Study  Period  III.  The  treatment-by-investigator  interaction  was  tested  using  a  full ANCOVA model. When the interaction was statistically  significant,  the  nature  of  the  interaction  was investigated and the appropriate statistical approaches were adapted based on the findings from the investigation.

## Rapporteur's comments:

These two efficacy studies included children and adolescents diagnosed of Major Depressive Disorder according to standard criteria. Patients were required to have a minimum severity degree to be enrolled. No specific requirement regarding the concomitant or previous use of  psychotherapy was made.

The main proof of efficacy relies on the relief of the depression symptoms after 10 weeks of treatment. In addition to the comparison with placebo an active arm (fluoxetine) was included in order to provide assay sensitivity to the trial. Fluoxetine is authorized in EU countries by Mutual Recognition Procedure with the indication in children and adolescents aged 8 years and above (Moderate to severe major depressive episode, if depression is unresponsive to psychological therapy after 4-6 sessions). It can be accepted as an adequate control treatment. After the acute phase, patients entered in an extension phase where only active treatments (duloxetine and fluoxetine) were administered.

Standards methods of measurement were employed. Relief of MDD symptoms were measured through the CDRS-R  total score as primary endpoint and a global assessment (CGI-I) was included among the secondary endpoints. Additionally the relevance of the changes was estimated as remission and responder rates, which is agreeable.

According to the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of depression (CPMP/EWP/518/97) and also to the current draft revision (Rev.1) differentiation should be made between children and adolescents either in separate studies or stratifying for age group in the case of an only trial. In these studies stratification has been employed although no sample size calculation for demonstration of efficacy in each group independently has performed.

## Rapporteur's comments

Patients with moderate levels of depression were preferably recruited. Patients had a mean CDR-S total score around 60 and a CGI-Severity score around 4.5 at baseline. Diagnosis was confirmed by the Mini International Neuro psychiatric Interview for paediatric population. No relevant baseline differences between groups with respect to demographic characteristics (age, gender, baseline severity) are observed. However, no data regarding the use of non-pharmacological treatment (psychotherapy) have been provided.

Patients were mainly recruited from non-EU regions (mainly USA). Only 130 patients (17 from Western Europe - Finland, France and Germany -; and 113 from Eastern Europe - Slovakia, Ukraine, Estonia and Russia) out of the total 800 randomised patients represent the European population included in both trials. The extrapolation of the results may be object of concern.

Study designs were very similar except for the different regimen of drug administration (fixed dose in HMCL and flexible dose in HMCK).  No formal dose finding study has been performed in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

children/adolescents. Doses of duloxetine and fluoxetine were those already administered to the adult population. Posology was determined by pK results. It was suggested that drug exposure was not influenced by factors such as the age, the gender or weight.  No dose adjustment was subsequently implemented.

## · Efficacy results

## F1J-MC-HMCL Study

## 10-week acute treatment phase

Mean improvement in depression symptom severity was observed for the duloxetine 60 mg-treated group  compared  with  the  placebo-treated  group  at  Week  10;  however,  the  difference  in  the  mean change  (baseline  to  Visit  8)  between  the  duloxetine  60  mg  treatment  group  and  placebo  was  not statistically significant.

Similarly, mean improvement in depression symptom severity was observed for the duloxetine 30 mgtreated group compared with the placebo-treated group at Visit 8; however, the difference in the mean change (baseline to Week 10) between the duloxetine 30 mg treatment group and placebo was not statistically significant.

Mean improvement in  depression  symptom  severity  was  observed  for  the  fluoxetine  20  mg-treated group compared with the placebo-treated group at Visit 8; however, the difference in the mean change (baseline to Visit 8) between the fluoxetine 20 mg treatment group and placebo was not statistically significant.

The  study  is  considered  to  be  inconclusive  as  neither  the  investigational  drug  (duloxetine)  nor  the active  control  (fluoxetine)  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  separation  from  placebo  on  the primary efficacy analysis of mean change from baseline to Week 10 on the CDRS-R total score.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Secondary efficacy analyses of the 10-week acute treatment period generally showed no statistically significant  differences  between  the  active  drugs  (duloxetine  and  fluoxetine)  or  between  the  active drugs and placebo; except for a few exceptions.

a)  both  the  duloxetine  60  mg  and  30  mg  treatment  arms  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant difference from placebo in the overall main effect of treatment analysis, b)  in  the  subgroup  analysis  of  mean  change  in  the  CDRS-R  total  score  by  gender,  statistically significant improvement was observed for duloxetine 60 mg- and for duloxetine 30 mg-treated females compared with placebo-treated females.

c) in a cumulative responder analysis, there was a statistically significant difference for the distribution of responders between duloxetine 60 mgtreated patients and placebo-treated patients d) there was a statistically significantly greater remission rate at endpoint for the duloxetine 30 mgtreated group compared to the placebo treated group.

e) a statistically significantly greater proportion of duloxetine 60 mg-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients met remission criteria at the last 2 nonmissing visits.

Two sensitivity analyses on the primary efficacy analysis were performed:

1. A  repeated measures analysis to address the impact of missing data (Missing at Random (MAR) versus Missing Not at Random (MNAR))
2. A repeated measures analysis of the CDRS-R total score mean change from baseline, excluding age as a covariate.

The results of these sensitivity analyses on the primary measure are consistent with the results of the primary analysis. The secondary analysis of mean change from baseline to acute period endpoint on the CDRS-R using LOCF methodology also did not result in a statistically significant separation between duloxetine and placebo.

In  the  subgroup  analyses  based  of  mean  change  in  the  CDRS-R  total  score  during  acute  period (ANCOVA), the treatment-by-age, race, ethnicity, pooled investigator, and region interaction, was not statistically  significant.  The  treatment-by-gender  interaction  was  not  statistically  significant,  but  a statistically significant difference in LS mean change from baseline to endpoint (LOCF) in CDRS-R total score  was  observed  for  duloxetine  60  mg-treated  females  compared  with  placebo-treated  females (p=.039) and for duloxetine 30 mg-treated females compared with placebo-treated females (p=.017).

No  statistically  significant  differences  at  Week  10  were  observed  for  the  duloxetine  60  mg-  or  the duloxetine  30  mg-treated  groups  compared  with  the  placebo-treated  group  for  any  of  the  CDRS-R subscales  (mood,  somatic,  subjective,  behavior)  and  item  13  score  (suicidal  ideation),  with  the exception of the CDRS-R somatic subscale where a statistically significant difference was observed at Week 10 for the duloxetine 30 mg-treated group compared with the placebo-treated group (p=.023).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Response rates: there was not a statistically significant difference in the probability of meeting 30% or 50%  response on the CDRS-R for the duloxetine 60 mg-, duloxetine 30 mg-, or fluoxetine 20 mgtreated groups compared with the placebo-treated group at the last visit of acute period (Week 10) /endpoint (LOCF).

There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  on  remission  rate  (CDRS-R  total  score  of ≤ 28  at LOCF  endpoint)  between  the  duloxetine  60  mg-treated  group  and  the  placebo-treated  group  (34% versus 24%, respectively; p=.071) or between the fluoxetine 20 mg-treated group and the placebotreated group (28% versus 24%, respectively; p=.606). There was a statistically significant difference on remission rate at endpoint between the duloxetine 30 mg-treated group and the placebo-treated group (36% versus 24%, respectively; p=.041).

There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  observed  for  the  duloxetine60  mg-,  duloxetine  30 mg-, or fluoxetine 20 mg-treated groups compared with the placebo-treated group on the CGI-S mean change from baseline to Week 10 (MMRM).

## · Extension phase

For patients initially randomized to duloxetine 60 mg QD or fluoxetine 20 mg QD for the 10-week acute treatment period and continued on flexibly-dosed duloxetine (60 to 120 mg QD) or fluoxetine (20 to 40 mg QD) during the 6-month extension period, improvement in MDD symptoms was observed for both treatment  groups  based  on  the  mean  improvement  on  the  CDRS-R  total  score  and  CGI-S  score; however,  there  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  DLX60120-treated  group compared with the FLX2040-treated group at any time point during the 36-week study. Similarly, for both treatment groups (DLX60120 and FLX2040), there were no statistically significant differences at any timepoint in the probability of achieving remission during the 36-week study.

## Rapporteur's comments:

After 10 weeks of treatment neither duloxetine nor fluoxetine did separate from placebo. No relevant differences were observed when the investigator made the global assessment of the response. The secondary endpoints results were consistent with the results of the primary analysis. In addition, no dose-response relationship could be identified when duloxetine 30 mg and 60 mg were administered.

When doses were increased during the extension phase, both groups experienced an improvement in symptoms. The lack of a placebo arm and the flexible regimen of dosing administered hamper drawing sound conclusions.

## · 10-week acute treatment phase

Mean  improvement  in  depression  symptom  severity  was  observed  for  the  duloxetine-treated  group over  the  10-week  course  of  acute  treatment;  however,  the  difference  in  the  mean  change  from baseline  between  the  duloxetine  treatment  group  and  placebo  was  not  statistically  significant  at endpoint (Week 10), or at any timepoint during Study Period II.

Mean improvement in depression symptom severity was observed for the fluoxetine-treated group over the 10-week course of acute treatment; however, the difference in the mean change from baseline between the fluoxetine treatment group and placebo was not statistically significant at endpoint (Week 10), or at any timepoint during Study Period II

The  study  is  considered  to  be  inconclusive  as  neither  the  investigational  drug  (duloxetine)  nor  the active  control  (fluoxetine)  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  separation  from  placebo  on  the primary efficacy analysis of mean change from baseline to Week 10 on the CDRS-R total score.

Secondary efficacy analyses of the 10-week acute treatment period generally showed no statistically significant  differences  between  the  active  drugs  (duloxetine  and  fluoxetine)  or  between  the  active drugs and placebo; however, there was 1 exception. In the subgroup analysis of mean change in the CDRS-R total score by race, the treatment by race interaction was statistically significant (p=.011) due

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

to  different  responses  to  drug  vs.  placebo  within  each  race  subgroup.  In  Black  or  African  American patients, the placebo group had greater improvement than either active drug group. In White patients, both drug groups had greater improvement than the placebo group. In the pooled race (including

Two sensitivity analyses on the primary measure were performed:

1. A repeated analysis to address the impact of missing data (Missing at Random (MAR) versus Missing Not at Random (MNAR))
2. A repeated measures analysis of the CDRS-R total score mean change from baseline, excluding age as a covariate.

The results of these sensitivity analyses on the primary measure are consistent with the results of the primary analysis. The secondary analysis of mean change from baseline to acute period endpoint on the CDRS-R using LOCF methodology also did not result in a statistically significant separation between duloxetine and placebo.

In  the  subgroup  analyses  based  of  mean  change  in  the  CDRS-R  total  score  during  acute  period (ANCOVA), the treatment-by-age, gender, ethnicity, pooled investigator, and region interaction, was not statistically significant. The treatment-by-race interaction was statistically significant (p=.011). In Black or African American patients, the placebo group had greater improvement than either active drug group. In White patients, both drug groups had greater improvement than the placebo group. In the pooled  race  group,  duloxetine  had  greater  improvement  compared  with  placebo,  and  placebo  had greater improvement compared with fluoxetine.

No  statistically  significant  differences  were  observed  at  Week  10  for  the  duloxetine-treated  group compared  with  the  placebo-treated  group,  on  all  CDRS-R  subscales  (mood,  somatic,  subjective, behavior) and item 13 score (suicidal ideation). No statistically significant differences in mean changes from baseline (MMRM) in the CDRS-R subscale scores at Week 10 were observed for the fluoxetine treated  group  compared  to  the  placebo-treated  group.  A  statistically  significant  mean  improvement from baseline (MMRM) in the CDRS-R Item 13 (suicidal ideation) score was observed for the placebotreated  group  (0.4  point  improvement)  compared  with  the  fluoxetine-treated  group  (0.2  point improvement) at Week 10 (p=.007). No statistically significant differences were observed at endpoint (LOCF)  for  the  duloxetine-treated  group  compared  with  the  placebo-treated  group  on  all  CDRS-R subscales (mood, somatic, subjective, behavior) and Item 13 score (suicidal ideation). A statistically significant mean improvement at endpoint was observed for the placebo-treated group compared with the fluoxetine-treated group for the CDRS-R Item 13 score (suicidal ideation [p=.045]).

No statistically significant difference was observed in the probability of meeting 30% or 50% response on the CDRS-R for duloxetine-treated patients or fluoxetine-treated patients compared with placebotreated patients at the last visit of the acute period (Week 10) / endpoint (LOCF).

There were no statistically  significant  differences  on  remission  rate  between  the  duloxetine  -treated group  and  the  placebo-treated  group  (35%  versus  36%,  respectively;  p=.990)  or  between  the fluoxetine -treated group and the placebo group (30% versus 36%, respectively; p=.817).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At Week 10, no statistically significant differences on the CGI-S mean change from baseline to Week 10  were  observed  for  the  duloxetine-  or  the  fluoxetine-treated  groups  compared  with  the  placebotreated group.

## · Extension phase

For  patients  initially  randomized  to  flexible  dose  duloxetine  or  fluoxetine  for  the  10-week  acute treatment  period  and  continued  on  flexibly  dosed  duloxetine  or  fluoxetine  during  the  6  month extension period, improvement in MDD symptoms was observed for both treatment groups based on the mean improvement on the CDRS-R total score and CGI-S score; however, there was no statistically significant difference between the DLX60120-treated group compared with the FLX2040-treated group at  any  time  point  during  the  36-week  study  on  the  CDRS-R  total  score.  There  was  a  statistically significantly  greater  improvement  observed  for  fluoxetine  compared  with  duloxetine  at  36-Weeks (study endpoint) on the CGI-Severity. There were no statistically significant differences between the duloxetine and fluoxetine treatment groups at any timepoint in the probability of achieving remission during the 36-week study. The probability of achieving remission at 36 weeks was 72% for duloxetine and 83% for fluoxetine.

## Rapporteur's comments:

Similarly, in this study both active treatments (duloxetine and fluoxetine) did not behave differently from placebo after10 weeks of treatment. Almost  44% of patients titrated up to 120 mg, the remaining receiving 30 mg ( 11.1%); 60 mg ( 17.1%) or 90 mg ( 27.4%).The magnitude of the effect is similar to that observed in Study HMCL. The response measured by the secondary endpoints as well as the sensitivity analyses conducted by the MAH also mirror the primary effect.

When patients were treated for further 6 months with duloxetine or fluoxetine showed an improvement in symptoms although of similar magnitude for both drugs.

## Overall conclusions on clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetic

The  paediatric  clinical  development  for  duloxetine  in  the  treatment  of  Major  Depressive  Disorder consists  of  two  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel  trials.  These  studies  featured  a  10  week-  placebo and active (fluoxetine) controlled acute phase following a 6 month period of active controlled extension treatment. Study designs were very similar except for the different regimen of drug administration: fixed dose in HMCL (duloxetine 30 mg, duloxetine 60 mg, fluoxetine 20 mg and placebo; and flexible dose in HMCK (duloxetine 60 mg to 120 mg, fluoxetine 20 mg to 40 mg and placebo).  Posology was determined according pK results, in which drug exposure appears not to be influenced by factors such as age, gender or weight.

Children and adolescents (7 to 17 years) included had a MDD of moderate severity. Although accepted, the concomitant or previous use of psychotherapy was not standardised. The studies were stratified by age  although  no  sample  size  calculation  for  demonstration  of  efficacy  in  children  and  adolescents groups independently was performed.

After 10 weeks of treatment neither duloxetine nor fluoxetine did separate from placebo in none of the studies. No relevant differences were observed when the investigator made the global assessment of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the response. The secondary endpoints results were consistent with the results of the primary analysis. In addition, no dose-response relationship could be identified when duloxetine 30 mg and 60 mg were administered. When doses were increased during the extension phases, both groups experienced an improvement in symptoms. The lack of a placebo arm and the flexible regimen of dosing administered hamper drawing sound conclusions. Subgroup analysis by age does not suggest benefit in a particular stratum. The antidepressant effect of duloxetine in children and adolescents has not been demonstrated.

According  to  the  MAH  the  extension  of  the  therapeutic  indication  cannot  be  granted.  However,  it  is considered that the inclusion of a brief description of the studies (including the inconclusive results) in the product information could be of help for prescribers.

## · Safety results

The safety data from Study HMCK and Study HMCL was pooled into an integrated paediatric safety database.  Subgroup  analyses  by  paediatric  subset  (ie.  7  to  11  years;  12  to  17  years)  were  also performed for TEAEs of individual studies in the HMCK and HMCL CSRs.

## Exposure

In  Study  HMCK, flexible dosing of duloxetine from 60 to 120 mg QD was allowed during acute and extension  treatment,  and  most  patients  were  escalated  to  higher  doses  (90  mg  to  120  mg).  The duloxetine dose was initiated at 30 mg QD for 2 weeks. During acute treatment, the mean duloxetine total dispensed dose was 66.1 mg and the last prescribed dose for duloxetine patients was a 30 mgtitration  dose  (11.1%),  60  mg  (17.1%),  90  mg  (27.4%)  and  120  mg  (43.6%),  while  74%  of fluoxetine-treated  patients  had  a  final  dose  of  40  mg  QD.  During  extension  treatment,  the  mean duloxetine total dispensed dose was 88.8 mg. The last prescribed dose of duloxetine for patients in the DLX60120/DLX60120  group  was  60  mg  (14.5%),  90  mg  (16.9%)  and  120  mg  (68.7%).  The  last prescribed  dose  of  duloxetine  for  patients  in  the  PBO/DLX60120  group  was  a  30-mg  titration  dose (3.5%),  60  mg  (49.4%),  90  mg  (16.5%)  and  120  mg  (30.6%).  A  total  of  105  duloxetine-  and  56 fluoxetine-treated patients had ≥ 6 months of exposure to the drug.

In Study HMCL, the acute treatment phase included 2 duloxetine fixed dose arms (30 mg and 60 mg QD). During the extension phase of Study HMCL, flexible dosing of duloxetine from 60 to 120 mg QD was  allowed,  and  most  patients  were  escalated  to  the  higher  doses  (90  mg  to  120  mg).  During extension treatment, the mean duloxetine total dispensed dose was 84.3 mg. The last prescribed dose of duloxetine was 60 mg, 90 mg and 120 mg for 30.8%, 20.9% and 46.2% of patients, respectively. 70% of fluoxetine-treated patients had a final dose of 40 mg QD. A total of 125 duloxetine- and 45 fluoxetine-treated patients had ≥ 6 months of exposure to the drug.

## Rapporteur's comment

In  order  to  assess  the  safety  profile  of  duloxetine  in  the  paediatric  population  the  global  number  of subjects (and by age subgroups) exposed to study medication should be provided. Information on the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

study drug exposure by total daily dose (acute and extended administration), and a summary of the demographic characteristics of the involved population is also expected.

## Adverse Events

## Acute treatment phase

No deaths due to completed suicides or other causes were reported during either study.

No statistically significant difference in the frequency of patients reporting at least 1 SAE was observed between duloxetine and placebo during the acute treatment phase of either study. The frequency of SAEs for the pooled acute phases was 2.6% duloxetine vs. 1.3% placebo.

As it would be expected based on previous duloxetine studies, more patients in the duloxetine group discontinued  due  to  an  AE  compared  with  those  in  the  placebo  group  (8.2%  duloxetine  vs.  3.1% placebo, p=.013 for pooled acute data)

## Rapporteur's comments

Depressed children and adolescents treated with duloxetine were more prone to withdraw for safety reasons than patients treated with placebo.  Duloxetine showed a higher incidence of adverse events, of SAEs and discontinuations with higher doses. The corresponding figures for fluoxetine should be provided in a global analysis of the studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  TEAEs  reported  at  least  twice  as  a  reason  for  discontinuation  in  Study  HMCK  or  HMCL  for duloxetine-treated  patients  were  (HMCK;  HMCL):  nausea  (2;  4),  intentional  overdose  (0;  2),  and depression (1; 2).

A similar frequency of TEAEs was observed between duloxetine (63%) and placebo (62%) based on pooled acute phase data from both studies. The nature of the reported TEAEs was consistent with the know safety profile of duloxetine and/or the patient population, primarily involving the system organ classes  of  gastrointestinal  disorders,  psychiatric  disorders  and  nervous  system  disorders.  For  the analysis of pooled data from both studies, individual TEAEs of nausea, diarrhoea, and abnormal dreams were  reported  statistically  significantly  more  frequently  with  duloxetine  (17%,  5.3%,  and  1.8%, respectively) than placebo (9.8%, 1.8%, and 0%, p-value&lt;.05%).

## Extension treatment phase

No deaths due to completed suicides or other causes were reported during either study.

A  similar  frequency  of  SAEs  (1to  5%  across  duloxetine  treatment  arms)  was  observed  between treatment groups in the individual studies.

The  frequency  of  discontinuation  due  to  an  AE  during  extension  treatment  was  consistent  with  the known profile of duloxetine.

A  similar  frequency  of  TEAEs  was  observed  between  treatment  groups  and  across  both  studies. Consistent with the known safety profile of duloxetine, the nature of the reported TEAEs were similar to that observed during acute treatment though with a greater frequency of events in the infections and  investigations  system  organ  classes  during  the  extension  than  the  acute  treatment  phase.  The frequency of infections  and  infestations  was  similar  in  all  treatment  groups  and  was  not  considered clinically meaningful.

## Rapporteur's comments:

Nature of adverse events reported, involving primarily gastrointestinal, psychiatric and nervous system disorders, is consistent with that of adult studies as stated in the SmPC. Nausea, headache, abdominal pain, somnolence, dizziness, decreased appetite, fatigue, diarrhoea, vomiting and insomnia were the most frequent reported AEs (&gt;5%). All but headache and insomnia were also more frequently reported in duloxetine treated patients than those reported with fluoxetine.

## Suicide-Related Events

With regard to suicidal ideation, behaviour, and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour, the results of the C-SSRS provide the most complete information on which to base conclusions for Studies HMCK and HMCL,  and  differences  between  the  AE  database  and  the  C-SSRS  results  do  not  change  the interpretation  of  the  study  results  with  regard  to  suicide  related  events  (ideation  and  behaviour)  or non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour.

## C-SSRS Results (Acute - 10 weeks, placebo-controlled):

Suicide-related  events  (ideation  or  behaviour)  as  well  as  non-suicidal  self-injurious  behaviour  were analyzed  compared  to  lead-in  baseline  to  determine  whether  the  events  were  treatment  emergent. That is, events during treatment that were new or more severe compared to baseline (study screening period  also  referred  to  as  lead-in)  were  considered  to  be  treatment-emergent.  In  addition,  suicidal ideation  was  analyzed to determine if there was treatment-emergent improvement for patients who had suicidal ideation during the study screening period. The frequency of treatment-emergent suiciderelated events (ideation or behaviour) as well as nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviour reported during acute treatment are presented in Table 5.3.

There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  duloxetine  and  placebo  groups  with regard  to  treatment-emergent  suicide-related  events  (ideation  or  behaviour)  as  well  as  nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviour reported during acute treatment.

## C-SSRS Results (Extension - 26 weeks, double-blind):

During the extension phase for Studies HMCK and HMCL, all patients received duloxetine or fluoxetine. Patients  initially  randomized  to  placebo  were  transitioned  to  duloxetine  in  the  extension  phase (referred  to  as  the  PBO/DLX  group).  Statistical  comparisons  between  treatment  groups  were  not conducted for the extension phase analyses because of selection bias. In other words, only patients who completed the acute phase of the study were included in the extension phase analyses, therefore patient characteristics at the beginning of the extension phase were expected to be different between treatment groups due to lack of randomization. Suicide-related events (ideation or behaviour) as well as  non-suicidal  self-injurious  behaviour  were  analyzed  compared  to  lead-in  baseline  to  determine whether  the  events  were  treatment  emergent  during  the  extension  phase.  For  analyses  of  the extension  phase,  'lead-in'  baseline  refers  to  Visits  7  to  8  (that  is  the  end  of  the  acute  treatment phase). The frequency of treatment emergent suicide-related events (ideation or behaviour) as well as non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour reported during extension treatment are presented in Table 5.4.

Results from Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale reveal 0 (duloxetine), 2 (fluoxetine) and 1 (placebo) suicidal behaviour events during the acute phase and 7 (duloxetine), 1 (fluoxetine) events

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

during the extension phase. Given these apparent differences between both products, a global comparison of duloxetine versus fluoxetine is of interest and deserves further discussion by the MAH.

## Cardiovascular-Related Events

Acute Results (10 Weeks)

## · Blood Pressure and Pulse

Results  from  the  analyses  of  pooled  categorical  data  did  not  reveal  any  statistically  significant differences in potential clinical significant increases of blood pressure or pulse between duloxetine and placebo during acute treatment (Table 5.5). For HMCK, there was a statistically significant increase of pulse in duloxetine 60/120 group compared with placebo group. The mean increase in blood pressure observed with paediatric patients is also noted as a risk in the SmPC for adult patients.

One  potential  cardiovascular-related  SAE  of  syncope  was  reported  in  a  duloxetine-treated  female patient who had previous episodes of syncope prior to entering the study. The etiology of the syncopal episodes is unknown. Syncope is included as an undesirable effect in the duloxetine SmPC. No other serious cardiovascular events were reported during Studies HMCK and HMCL.

## · Electrocardiogram

In acute pooled data, a statistically significant (p=.002) mean increase in heart rate of 2.4 bpm was observed for the duloxetine group, compared with a mean decrease in heart rate of 1.1 bpm in the placebo group. Abnormal high heart rate was reported in 1 (0.4%) duloxetine-treated patient and 1

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(0.6%) placebo-treated  patient  during  acute  treatment.  Abnormal  low  heart  rate  was  reported  in  2 (0.8%) duloxetine-treated patients and 5 (2.9%) placebo-treated patients during acute treatment. In the pooled mean change analysis of QTcF, patients in the duloxetine group had a mean decrease in QTcF, which is not considered clinically relevant.

With  respect  to  categorical  analyses  of  QTcF,  1  male  patient  (0.6%)  in  the  duloxetine  group experienced an abnormal QTcF interval increase of &gt;40 msec from baseline to a value 408 msec during acute treatment, which did not meet the gender-specific abnormal threshold of &gt;450 msec. This was the  only  duloxetine-treated  patient  with  a  QTcF  observation  that  met  abnormal  criteria  (increase  or gender-specific) at anytime during the 10-week acute-treatment period of the studies. No duloxetinetreated patients had a potentially clinically significant QTcF observation (&gt;500 msec) at anytime during the 10-week acute treatment period of the studies.

## Combined Acute and Extension Results (up to 36 Weeks)

## · Blood Pressure

During the 36 weeks of treatment, the frequency of either potential clinical significant high systolic or diastolic blood pressure at any time was 15.9% and 18.3%, respectively, in the duloxetine group. The majority  of  these  events  resolved  during  the  study,  as  evidenced  by  the  lower  frequency  of  events noted at endpoint (4.2% high systolic and 3.4% high diastolic). For patients in the duloxetine group, less than 2% of patients (N=4 systolic, N=5 diastolic) with normal systolic or diastolic blood pressure at baseline met criteria for sustained elevation of systolic or diastolic blood pressure, which is less than the  rate  of  sustained  elevation  of  blood  pressure  reported  in  duloxetine-treated  adult  MDD  patients (Hudson et al. 2005). Of these patients, the majority met the sustained criteria at endpoint. The SmPC already includes language that duloxetine has been associated with an increase in blood pressure and clinically significant hypertension in some patients.

## · Pulse

With respect to pulse, 1 patient in the duloxetine group met potential clinical significant high criteria during long-term treatment. Patient HMCL 149-5901, who was on duloxetine 120 mg with a baseline pulse of 94 beats per minute (bpm), experienced a potential clinical significant  increase at Week 32 to 126  bpm  that  decreased  to  a  non-potential  clinical  significant  value  of  108  bpm  at  the  36-week endpoint.

## · Electrocardiogram

In  pooled  data  across  36  weeks,  a  mean  increase  in  heart  rate  of  2.9  bpm  was  observed  for  the duloxetine group. In addition to the 2 duloxetine-treated patients who experienced abnormal low heart rate  during  the  10-week  acute  treatment  period,  abnormal  low  heart  rate  was  reported  in  3  more duloxetine-treated  patients  during  extension  treatment.  No  duloxetine-treated  patients  experienced abnormal high heart rate after the 10-week time point. One duloxetine-treated patient met criteria for abnormal increase in QTcF (&gt;40 msec) to 408 msec during the acute treatment period. This was the only duloxetine treated patient with a QTcF observation that met criteria for abnormal increase (&gt;40 msec from baseline) or gender-specific  abnormal  value  ( ≥ 470 msec for females or ≥ 450 msec for males)  at  anytime  during  the  36-week  studies.  No  duloxetine-treated  patients  had  a  potentially clinically significant QTcF observation (&gt;500 msec) at anytime during the 36-week studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conclusion

The above data are consistent with the cardiovascular safety profile of duloxetine in adult patients; the increase in blood pressure is an identified risk and is included in the SmPC.

## Rapporteur's comments:

The effect of duloxetine on blood pressure, cardiac frequency and ECG data (including QT interval) has been assessed in this paediatric population. The variations observed in cardiovascular parameters were apparently minimal and did not derive in major clinical events.

## Growth-Related Events

Duloxetine has been known to lead to acute mean weight loss in adult patients followed by recovery to baseline values. As the impact of this known weight loss risk could be greater for paediatric patients compared with adult patients, due to active physiological growth, analyses of pooled data from HMCK and  HMCL  were  performed  to  assess  mean  and  individual  weight  changes  over  time  (Table  5.6). Weight loss was not reported as an SAE during either study and no patient discontinued from the study due to weight loss.

It  is  important  to  evaluate  growth  relative  to  the  general  population  using  standardized  height  and weight  scores.  A  z-score  (or  the  standard  deviation  score)  is  one  such  analysis;  that  is,  a  z-score analysis  normalizes  a  patient's  weight  to  their  age  and  sex-matched  peers  (specifically,  the  US population for the analyses below, since reference data from other countries were not available). A zscore of zero, therefore, would be equivalent to the median weight of the reference population; a zscore of -0.67 and 0.67 are approximately equivalent to the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile, respectively, of the reference population. This analysis was performed for the mean change of weight, height, and body-mass index (Tables 5.7 and 5.8)

On an individual patient level, when plotting the weight z-scores over time for all duloxetine patients meeting PCS weight loss criteria ( ≥ 3.5% decrease at any time during 36 weeks of acute and extension treatment), their weight z-score decrease did not persist. Even though some patients, such as those meeting PCS criteria at endpoint (8.4%), had not yet recovered to their baseline weight value, most patients trended towards recovery to their baseline weight z-scores by their study endpoint.

## Rapporteur's comments:

In principle there appear to be no signal of safety concerns on potential growth effect in paediatric patients treated with duloxetin. The MAH is committed to provide a report discussing observations regarding growth and development from pooled data obtained in paediatric studies.

## Overall conclusions on safety

A  total  of  341  patients  were  randomized  to  duloxetine  in  these  to  studies.  Mean  duloxetine  total dispensed dose during extension treatment was 88.8 mg in study HMCK and 84.3 mg in study HMCL. The  MAH  should  provide  the  global  number  of  subjects  (and  by  age  subgroups)  exposed  to  study medication.  Information  on  the  study  drug  exposure  by  total  daily  dose  (acute  and  extended administration), and a summary of the demographic characteristics of the involved population is also expected.

In principle there appear to be no new signal of safety concerns in children and adolescents related to duloxetine treatment. The nature of the adverse events reported, involving primarily gastrointestinal, psychiatric  and  nervous  system  disorders,  is  consistent  with  that  of  adult  studies  as  stated  in  the SmPC.  Nausea,  headache,  abdominal  pain,  somnolence,  dizziness,  decreased  appetite,  fatigue, diarrhoea,  vomiting  and  insomnia  were  the  most  frequent  reported  AEs  (&gt;5%).  Qualitatively, duloxetine and fluoxetine appear to be similar; however, duloxetine safety profile seems to be more adverse than that reported for fluoxetine. Duloxetine showed a higher incidence of most of adverse events;  children  and  adolescents  treated  with  duloxetine  were  more  prone  to  withdraw  for  safety reasons than patients treated with fluoxetine.

The clinical differences in safety profile across the age subgroups, if any, should also be provided.

According  to  the  findings  identified  during  the  continuous  safety  assessment  of  duloxetine  in  its different indications in adults a number of key events are closely monitored. Among them:

a)  Suicidality:    Results  from  Columbia  Suicide  Severity  Rating  Scale  reveal  0  (duloxetine),  2 (fluoxetine) and 1 (placebo) suicidal behaviour events during the acute phase and 7 (duloxetine), 1 (fluoxetine)  events  during  the  extension  phase.  Given  these  apparent  differences  between  both products,  a  global  comparison  of  duloxetine  versus  fluoxetine  is  of  interest  and  deserves  further discussion by the MAH.

- b)  Hepatic  risk:  Neither  the  effect  of  duloxetine  on  laboratory  parameters  nor  the  changes  in  liver enzymes/hepatic adverse events have been described.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

c) Cardiovascular events: The effect of duloxetine on blood pressure, cardiac frequency and ECG data (including QT interval) has been assessed in the paediatric population. The data on the cardiovascular safety profile are consistent with that of duloxetine in adult patients; the increase in blood pressure is an identified risk and is included in the SmPC.

c) Severe cutaneous reactions: No data have been provided.

d) Growth effect: In principle there appear to be no signal of safety concerns on potential growth effect in paediatric patients treated with duloxetine.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Duloxetine is authorised in EU in adults for the treatment of major depressive episodes; the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain; the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder and for women for the treatment of moderate to severe stress urinary incontinence. It is not recommended for use in children and adolescents due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.

The  MAH  has  submitted  the  results  of  two  phase  III  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled studies of duloxetine in paediatric patients with major depressive disorder (F1J-MC-HMCL and F1J-MCHMCK). A fluoxetine control arm was included for assay sensitivity.

After 10 weeks of treatment neither duloxetine nor fluoxetine did separate from placebo in none of the studies. No relevant differences were observed when the investigator made the global assessment of the response. The secondary endpoints results were consistent with the results of the primary analysis. In addition, no dose-response relationship could be identified when duloxetine 30 mg and 60 mg were administered. When doses were increased during the extension phases, both groups experienced an improvement in symptoms. The lack of a placebo arm and the flexible regimen of dosing administered hamper drawing sound conclusions. Subgroup analysis by age does not suggest benefit in a particular stratum. The antidepressant effect of duloxetine in children and adolescents has not been demonstrated.

Respecting  pharmacokinetics,  the  steady-state  duloxetine  plasma  concentrations  increased  with increasing  dose  in  both  children  and  adolescents.  No  relevant  differences  in  Cmax  and  AUC  were observed  between  the  two  age  groups.  Patient  characteristics  such  as  CYP2D6  metabolizer  status, ethnicity,  sex,  age,  and  body  weight  did  not  appear  to  have  an  effect  on  steady-state  duloxetine plasma concentrations. No dose adjustment seems to be required in the adolescent population with respect  to  the  younger  group.  For  enrichment  of  these  data,  an  additional  analysis  population  PK modelling on the integrated dataset from HMFN, HMCK and HMCL studies comprised by the company is expected.

In principle there appear to be no new signal of safety concerns in children and adolescents related to duloxetine  treatment.  With  regard  to  the  comparison  with  fluoxetine,  both  medications  products appear to be qualitatively similar; however, duloxetine safety profile seems to be more adverse than that reported for fluoxetine. This information is deemed useful for prescribers and therefore it should be translated to the SmPC. Additional data for clarification is requested.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Product Information

Currently,  the  SmPC  of  duloxetine  reflects  that  it  is  not  recommended  for  use  in  children  and adolescents due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy (4.2) / should not be used in the treatment of children and adolescents under the age of 18 years (4.4).  The MAH proposes to reflect the clinical relevant data obtained in these two studies in the SmPC (sections 4.2 and 5.1).

According  to  the  MAH  the  extension  of  the  therapeutic  indication  cannot  be  granted.  However,  it  is considered that the inclusion of a brief description of the studies (including the inconclusive results) in the product information could be of help for prescribers. The Rapporteur also considers that submission of the two pending additional PK and safety analysis before completting the ongoing procedure, in case the timeline is not very delayed, will contribute to finally present  a more complete information in the SmPC.

## III. Rapporteur's Overall Conclusion and Recommendation

##  Overall conclusion

Given the results of these two phase III efficacy and safety trials in which neither the investigational drug  nor the active control separated  significantly from  placebo, the studies are considered inconclusive.  A  positive  benefit  of  duloxetine  in  the  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  with  major depressive disorder has not been demonstrated. There appear to be no new signal of safety concerns in children and adolescents related to duloxetine treatment.

##  Recommendation

As a positive benefit for paediatric population has not been demonstrated with these two studies, no recommendation about the use of duloxetine in paediatric population can be made. For reflecting the clinical  relevant  data  obtained  in  the  product  SmPC,  sections  4.2,  4.4,  4.8,  5.1  and  5.2  should  be updated.

In this sense, the MAH should commit to submit the responses to the questions below together with a type II variation to include the comments no the SPC proposed. This information should be received in September 2012.

## FUM not fulfilled

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## IV. ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS REQUESTED

## List of questions adopted

The results of these studies demonstrate that:

- The general toxicity profile of duloxetine in juvenile rats was similar to that in adult rats.
- The main effects occurred at 45 mg/kg/day and included: significantly decreased body weight and food consumption; hepatic enzyme induction; and hepatocellular vacuolation.
- There was no effect on male or female fertility.
- Minor, transient effects on neurobehaviour at 45 mg/kg/day, consisted of an increased number of errors in the Path B configuration of the Cincinnati water maze test performed during the treatment period, suggesting that these animals had difficulty with 'elective-choice' sequential learning. The number of errors and the time taken to complete the maze (both Path A and Path B)  were  comparable  to  controls  at  all  dose  levels  during  the  posttreatment  period.  Motor activity and auditory startle habituation were unaffected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on these changes, the no-adverse effect level was determined to be 20 mg/kg/day.

In conclusion, the toxicology studies in juvenile rats demonstrated that the general toxicity profile of duloxetine in juvenile rats was similar to that in adults. There was no effect on fertility in the juvenile rat studies. Minor effects on neurobehaviour at 45 mg/kg/day in a water maze test were transient and did not persist. Therefore, these findings have no clinically meaningful impact and do not indicate any safety concerns relevant to a paediatric population. We propose to add the important clinical safety information from the paediatric studies in the SmPC as per CHMP's request. For duloxetine, the MAH consider the paediatric clinical data to be the most relevant information for the prescriber, as opposed to the nonclinical juvenile data which did not reveal any safety concerns or clinically relevant findings. Additionally, since the duloxetine paediatric data do not support an indication in this population, it is our view that the inclusion of the juvenile toxicity data, even if it were for completeness' sake, is not warranted. Thus, results from the nonclinical juvenile rat studies are not proposed for inclusion in the SmPC.

## Rapporteur's comment

The MAH's response is mainly endorsed, nonetheless data on the juvenile studies should be adequately mentioned and updated in section 5.3 of the SmPC.

## Clinical Request 2

The MAH is encouraged to submit within this procedure, the two additional planned analysis claimed:

- A population PK modelling on the integrated dataset from HMFN, HMCK and HMCL.

- A report discussing growth and development using pooled data from several studies.

## MAH Response

## 1.- Population PK Report

- The PK of duloxetine were well characterised by a 1 compartment model parameterised with first-order absorption, clearance (CL/F) and volume  of distribution (V/F). Unexplained interpatient  variability  remained  high  for  CL/F  (68%),  V/F  (87%),  and  the  residual  error (57%).
- Body weight, age, sex, CYP2D6 predicted phenotype, race and ethnicity did not appear to have a clinically meaningful effect on duloxetine exposure. Dose, body surface area (BSA) and race were  the  only  factors  found  to  have  a  statistically  significant  effect  on  duloxetine  PK parameters; however, these did not appear to have a clinically meaningful effect on duloxetine exposure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The  model-predicted  duloxetine  concentration-time  profile  at  steady  state  concentrations  in paediatric patients appear to be slightly lower than those in adults and are mostly within the concentration range observed in adult patients.
- No conclusions related to dosing recommendations can be made because of the inconclusive efficacy results of Studies HMCK and HMCL.

## Rapporteur's comments:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The steady-state duloxetine plasma concentrations increased with increasing dose in both children and adolescents being concentration-time profile lower than in adults although mostly  within the concentration range observed in them. Interpatient variability was seen for clearance and volume of distribution. None patient-related characteristics appear to have an effect on duloxetine exposure that could  result  in  a  clinical  relevant  effect.  Although  no  dose  recommendation  is  proposed,  these pharmacokinetic data should be reflected in the SmPC.

## 2.- Growth Report

Patients in the duloxetine group (initially randomised to duloxetine and continuing on duloxetine during extension  treatment)  experience  a  mean  decrease  in  weight  upon  initiating  treatment  followed  by weight recovery. These data further support the observations from the previously provided analyses. Similar results were observed for fluoxetine. The mean change (MMRM) by the end of the study was 1.4 kg (standard error [SE] 0.18) for duloxetine and 2.1 kg (SE 0.18) for fluoxetine.

the long-term analyses set

The  quartile  analysis  of  mean  change  in  z-score  by  weight  quartiles  also  indicated  a  trend  towards baseline weight z-score upon continued duloxetine treatment in the long-term analyses set. Patients in the upper 3 duloxetine quartiles (of weight) experienced a smaller mean decrease in weight z-scores (see table below) by the end of longterm treatment compared with the mean weight z-score at end of acute treatment. For patients in which a decrease in weight would be of most concern, those in the first quartile ( ≤ 25 th percentile), the weight z-score actually increased by study endpoint.

Analyses  of  mean  change  in  height  indicated  a  similar  height  increase  between  the  duloxetine  and placebo  groups  during  acute  treatment,  with  continued  increase  during  extension  treatment.  While notable differences between patients in the duloxetine and placebo groups were observed, the majority of patients who lost weight during acute treatment experienced recovery or a trend towards recovery

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

by  the  end  of  the  study,  whether  assessed  by  mean  change  over  time  or  by  z-score  as  a  way  to normalise results to age- and sex-matched peers. Additionally, no serious adverse events (SAEs) or discontinuations due to weight-related events were reported during either study.

## Rapporteur's comment:

Mean decrease in weight gain was observed mainly during short term treatment with duloxetine. It is not known whether weight recovery in the long-term is completed. Also the effect of duloxetine on weight gain during treatment periods longer than the studied is unknown. Height was not affected by duloxetine treatment during the study period. No data are available respecting sexual maturation (pubertal development). Adverse effects of duloxetine on growth should be reflected in section 4.8 as well as in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

## Clinical Request 3

The MAH should provide the global number of subjects (and by age subgroups) exposed to study medication. Information on the study drug exposure by total daily dose (acute and extended  administration),  and  a  summary  of  the  demographic  characteristics  of  the involved population is also expected.

## MAH Response

The mean days of duloxetine exposure were comparable between children and adolescents. Children had fewer patient years of  exposure,  driven  by  the  smaller  proportion  of  children  than  adolescents within  the  overall  patient  population.  Approximately  half  of  both  children  and  adolescents  patients remained on drug for at least 6 months.

With regards to duloxetine dosing during the studies (acute and extension phases), the mean dose for adolescents  was  higher  at  endpoint  than  the  mean  dose  for  children  in  both  the  DLX  and  PLA/DLX groups. This result was driven by adolescents being on a 120-mg dose for longer than children, as evidenced by a greater proportion of adolescents than children having a modal dose of 120 mg.

No statistically significant differences in patient demographics or baseline characteristics were observed between duloxetine or placebo in the complete patient population or within the age subgroups. Within the  adolescent  subgroup,  the  observed  statistically  significant  differences  between  duloxetine  and fluoxetine  was  mean  age  (greater  mean  age  for  fluoxetine,  p=.043)  and  race  distribution  (larger proportion of white patients for fluoxetine, p=.040). These differences, however, were likely to have little  to  no  impact  on  the  interpretation  of  safety-related  results.  Overall,  therefore,  this  study population was representative of the general child and adolescent population with MDD. No clinically meaningful differences were observed between treatment groups.

## Rapporteur's comments:

The mean duration of the patients in the studies was about 5 months being similar in children and adolescents.  Approximately  half  of  both  children  and  adolescents  remained  on  drug  for  at  least  6 months. Mean daily dose was between 64-75 mg with higher doses in adolescents than in children at endpoint. There were not meaningful demographic differences between treatment groups or between age groups that could affect the trials outcome.

## Clinical Request 4

The clinical  differences  in  safety  profile  across  the  age  subgroups,  if  any,  should  also  be provided.

## MAH Response

The analyses provided in this response are subject to increased Type I error due to the fact that we have conducted multiple analyses and there was no multiplicity adjustment. In addition, conclusions are limited due to small numbers within the subgroups. Because the primary focus of this section is to assess whether the safety profile is similar between the children and adolescent subgroups, the results discussed here include treatment by-subgroup interactions and within-subgroup treatment (duloxetine versus placebo) comparisons.

Overall,  during  the  acute-  or  extension-treatment  phases,  few  statistically  significant  treatment-bysubgroup interaction were observed in the analyses of SAEs, DC due to AE, TEAEs, standard laboratory and vital signs, indicating that the safety profile of duloxetine was similar between age subgroups.

The reported SAEs during the acute treatment phase in the adolescent duloxetine group were drug abuse,  hallucination,  intentional  overdose  (2  reports),  panic  attack,  self-injurious  behaviour,  social phobia,  suicidal  ideation,  and  syncope.  In  the  children  duloxetine  group,  the  2  reported  SAEs  were depressive symptoms and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Of note, the SAE of IBS is captured in both Study Period II and Study Period III because the patient had the preexisting event of irritable bowel at

study  entry  but  the  event  did  not  become  serious  until  hospitalization  during  Study  Period  III.  In summary, no new safety signals were identified.  The only statistically  significant  finding  was  more discontinuations due to adverse events in the adolescent duloxetine group (9.5%) than the adolescent placebo group (2.2%, p=.009) during acute treatment. This rate of DC due to an AE is consistent with, and lower than, that observed in adult clinical studies of duloxetine. The only event reported by more than  2  patients  in  one  subgroup  was  nausea,  which  was  more  frequent  in  the  duloxetine-treated adolescent (4 events) than child (2 events) subgroup, with no discontinuations due to nausea in either placebo group. When compared with the adult patient population, the rate of discontinuation was lower in  paediatric  patients.  The  frequency  of  TEAEs  was  similar  between  treatment  groups  and  across subpopulations  and  no  statistically  significant  treatment-by-subgroup  interaction  was  observed. Headache was the most frequently reported TEAE in duloxetine-treated adolescents (n, %: 41, 20% duloxetine;  11,  8.0%  placebo),  followed  closely  by  nausea  (n,%:  38,  19%  duloxetine;  15,  11% placebo). Nausea was the most frequently reported TEAE in duloxetine-treated children (n,%: 21, 15% duloxetine; 7, 8% placebo), followed by headache (n,%: 17, 12% duloxetine; 14, 16% placebo). The other TEAEs reported in duloxetine-treated patients also were consistent with the know safety profile of duloxetine. Thus, no notable differences in the nature or frequency of TEAEs were observed between subgroups.

During  extension  treatment  phase  two  children  and  2  adolescents  reported  a  suicide  attempt.  One male adolescent patient was hospitalized for the SAE of suspected Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. The other reported SAEs are either not unexpected in a psychiatric population or most likely not related to study drug. The frequency of DC due to an AE and TEAEs was similar between treatment groups and between subgroups. No single event was reported more frequently as the reason for discontinuation in either  treatment  group  or  subpopulation.  These  DC  due  to  an  AE  rates  are  comparable  to  those observed  in  longer-term  adult  clinical  studies  of  duloxetine.  The  most  commonly  reported  ( ≥ 5%) TEAEs  in  the  duloxetine-treated  adolescent  subgroup  were  nausea,  headache,  vomiting,  abdominal pain upper, nasopharyngitis, and dizziness. The first 4 of these TEAEs were also commonly reported in the  duloxetine-treated  children  subgroup.  Additionally,  children  commonly  reported  pyrexia  and influenza. Overall, however, the reported TEAEs did not form an obvious differential pattern between children  and  adolescents.  As  noted  above,  these  events  are  consistent  with  the  safety  profile  of duloxetine within the adult population.

## Analyses of Laboratory Data

Abnormal laboratory values were defined as outside of the Covance reference range of normal. Overall, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between duloxetine and placebo (acute) or DLX and PLA/DLX (extension) groups with regards to abnormally high or low laboratory values. Similarly, while statistically  significant  treatment-by-subgroup  interactions  were  observed  for  some  analytes,  the differences  were  not  considered  clinically  meaningful  either  due  to  the  direction  of  the  abnormal change or the apparent resolution of abnormal values at endpoint. Further, no SAEs or discontinuations related to abnormal laboratory values were reported.

During  the  acute  treatment  phase  one  statistically  significant  interaction  was  noted  for  low  total bilirubin. This finding was driven by a greater duloxetine/placebo difference in children compared with duloxetine/placebo  difference  in  adolescents.  However,  low  total  bilirubin  was  not  considered  a clinically relevant finding. The frequency of patients meeting abnormal criteria on any laboratory value at endpoint was lower, in general, than that observed at any time. Abnormally high platelet count and abnormal red blood cell morphology was observed statistically significantly more frequently at endpoint

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

within the adolescent duloxetine group compared with the adolescent placebo group; however, these were not considered a clinically relevant finding.

For extension-phase analyses, the baseline is the end of the acute phase. In general, the frequency of patients meeting abnormal criteria at any time and at endpoint was lower during extension treatment than acute treatment. The following abnormal criteria at any time occurred more frequently in children than adolescents and were reported by at least 5% of patients in the total duloxetine group (DLX/DLX plus PLA/DLX arms): high alanine aminotransferase, low bilirubin total, high calcium, high cholesterol, high creatinine, high eosinophils, high platelet count, and high hematocrit. Conversely, the following abnormal criteria were met at any time by at least 5% of patients in the total duloxetine group and by adolescents  more  frequently  than  children:  high  albumin,  high  alkaline  phosphatase,  high  creatine phosphokinase,  low  glucose,  high  uric  acid,  low  erythrocyte  count,  low  mean  cell  hemoglobin (concentration), urinalysis (UA) occult blood, UA protein. Overall, when considering results from the acute  and  extension  treatment,  while  the  frequency  of  patients  meeting  some  abnormal  laboratory analyte  criteria  was  higher  in  one  subgroup  over  another,  no  clinically  meaningful  pattern  was observed. Therefore, no clinically meaningful differences in the safety profile were observed between the children and adolescent subgroups.

## Analyses of Vital Signs and Electrocardiogram Results

Analyses of categorical data were performed in addition to mean change from baseline to identify the frequency  of  patients  meeting  Potentially  Clinically  Significant  (PCS)  increases  for  the  specified parameters.  Overall, the results did not reveal a clinically meaningful differences between adolescents or  children  with  respect  to  vital  signs  or  ECGs.  Nevertheless,  these  data  should  be  interpreted  with caution due to the limited number of patients meeting abnormal categorical criteria.

No  statistically  significant  differences  in  mean  change  in  systolic  blood  pressure,  diastolic  blood pressure,  pulse  were  observed  between  duloxetine  and  placebo  in  either  the  children  or  adolescent subgroups.  Both  duloxetine-treated  children  and  duloxetine-treated  adolescents  experienced  mean decrease in weight that was statistically significant when compared with placebo-treated children and adolescent  patients,  respectively.  A  statistically  significant  within-subgroup  difference  in  low  systolic blood  pressure  was  observed  in  children,  but  the  frequency  was  higher  in  placebo  (3,  3.6%)  than duloxetine  (0,  0%).  No  other  within-subgroup  differences  in  blood  pressure  or  pulse  were  observed during  the  acute-treatment  period.  Few  patients  in  any  treatment  group  met  criteria  for  sustained elevation (that is,  meeting  PCS criteria  for  at  least  3  consecutive  visits)  during  the  acute-treatment period. For sustained elevation in diastolic blood pressure, a total of 2 adolescents, both in the placebo group,  and  1  child  in  the  duloxetine  group  met  sustained  diastolic  blood  pressure  criteria.  No discontinuations due to sustained elevation in blood pressure were reported. For sustained elevation in systolic blood pressure, 1 adolescent in the duloxetine group and 2 adolescents in the placebo group met sustained criteria. No children met sustained elevation in systolic blood pressure criteria during acute treatment. Treatment-by-subgroup interaction test could not be performed due to no events in some subgroups. Overall,  however,  few  patients  experienced  sustained  elevation  in  blood  pressure, suggesting that elevations in blood pressure during acute treatment were sporadic.

For electrocardiogram results, few treatment-by-subgroup interactions were calculated due to lack of events in at least 1 treatment arm.

For  patients  randomised  to  duloxetine  and  remaining  on  duloxetine  during  extension  treatment, children generally experienced a greater mean increase in blood pressure and pulse when compared with  adolescents.  However,  the  differences  in  the  mean  changes  were  small  ( ≤ 2  mm Hg) and not likely clinically significant. These results observed during extension treatment are consistent with those observed during acute treatment. Conversely, for patients initially randomised to placebo and switched to  duloxetine  during  the  extension  treatment,  the  mean  increase  in  blood  pressure  and  pulse  was generally greater in adolescents than children. These observations are not likely clinically significant because  the  adolescents  transitioning  from  placebo  to  duloxetine  had  vital-sign  changes  similar  to those  seen  by  the  adolescents  treated  with  duloxetine  in  the  acute  phase.  A  greater  frequency  of children (13%) met PCS high diastolic blood pressure at any time when compared with adolescents (9%) in the duloxetine group. A similar result was observed for PCS high systolic blood pressure at any time, where children (12%) met the criteria more frequently than adolescents (9%) in the duloxetine group.  Few  duloxetine-treated  patients  met  criteria  for  PCS  high  pulse,  with  a  total  of  2  (0.8%) adolescents  meeting  criteria  at  any  time  during  extension  treatment.  These  observations  do  not support a differential tolerability regarding blood pressure between  the  child and  adolescent duloxetine-treated subgroups. No duloxetine-treated children or adolescents met criteria for sustained elevation  in  diastolic  blood  pressure  during  extension  treatment.  One  adolescent  in  the  duloxetine group met criteria  for  sustained  elevation  in  systolic  blood  pressure  during  extension  treatment.  As with the acute-treatment phase, few patients met criteria, limiting the ability to draw conclusions and suggesting that any noted abnormal elevations in blood pressure were sporadic. A total of 2 (0.9%) duloxetine-treated adolescents and 4 children (3%) in the duloxetine group met low heart rate criteria. For QTcF results, no duloxetine-treated children or adolescents met high or abnormal increase criteria.

## Rapporteur's comments:

Adverse events, laboratory data, vital signs and electrocardiogram were analyzed. Overall, the safety profile  of  duloxetine  was  similar  between  age  subgroups.  Statistical  significant  interactions  were founded although  they  were  not  considered  clinically  relevant.  Adverse  events  were  consistent  with those in the adult population.  There was more discontinuation due to adverse events in the adolescent duloxetine  group  than  in  the  adolescent  placebo  group  (statistically  significant).  Children  and adolescent  treated  with  duloxetine  experienced  a  statistically  significant  mean  decrease  in  weight compared with placebo. Suicide-related events (by subgroup) are not discussed in this section. Safety profile of fluoxetine by age-subgroups is not presented.

## Clinical Request 5

Further  discussion  on  the  global  comparison  of  duloxetine  versus  fluoxetine  is  expected, including  the  disposition  of  the  patients  and  the  AEs  reported.  A  specific  discussion  for suicide-related events is expected.

## MAH response

For the acute-treatment phase, completion rates were comparable across treatment groups in Study HMCL  (approximately  70%)  and  Study  HMCK  (75%  and  78%  for  duloxetine  and  fluoxetine respectively). The most frequently reported reason for discontinuation was an AE, with patients in the duloxetine group DC due to AE more frequently than patients in the fluoxetine group, primarily due to the  event  of  nausea.  For  the  extension  period,  completion  rates  were  approximately  60%  across treatment  groups  in  Study  HMCL  and  approximately  80%  in  Study  HMCK.  The  most  frequently reported reason for discontinuation in the duloxetine and fluoxetine groups was patient or caregiver decision.

Because the comparison of interest is between duloxetine and fluoxetine, characterization of the safety profiles  over  long-term  treatment  requires  analysis  of  only  those  patients  initially  randomised  to duloxetine or to fluoxetine. This avoids selection bias by not including patients initially randomised to placebo who are then switched to duloxetine during extension treatment.

The frequency of DC due to an AE in the acute treatment phase was statistically significantly higher with duloxetine than with fluoxetine. This difference was primarily driven by discontinuations due to nausea: 6 (1.8%) reports with duloxetine and 0 reports with fluoxetine. The frequency of TEAEs was also similar across the treatment groups. The individual TEAEs of nausea (17%, 11%) and dizziness (8.5%, 3.8%) were reported statistically significantly more frequently with duloxetine compared with fluoxetine. Discontinuation due to an AE remained higher in the duloxetine group than the fluoxetine group  at  study  endpoint;  as  noted  above,  this  was  primarily  driven  by  the  greater  frequency  of discontinuations due to nausea with duloxetine (7, 2.2%) than fluoxetine (0, 0%, p=.032). The median time to discontinuation due to nausea was 41 days. Of note, 6 of the 7 nausea events reported as a reason  for  discontinuation  from  duloxetine  occurred  during  the  acute-treatment  period.  This  is consistent  with  the  known  profile  of  duloxetine,  where  nausea,  a  commonly  reported  AE  upon duloxetine initiation, tends to resolve with continued duloxetine treatment. The only other AEs reported by  more  than  2  patients  in  a  treatment  group  as  a  reason  for  discontinuation  was  depression  for duloxetine (4, 1.2%, versus 0, 0% with fluoxetine) and aggression for fluoxetine (3, 1.3% versus 1, 0.3% with duloxetine).

Analyses  of  mean  change  in  laboratory  analytes  during  acute  treatment  revealed  few  significant differences  between  duloxetine  and  fluoxetine.  Due  to  the  direction  or  magnitude  of  change,  these were  not  considered  clinically  meaningful.  Analyses  of  treatment-emergent  abnormal  laboratory analytes did not reveal any statistically significant differences between duloxetine and fluoxetine during acute treatment. During extension treatment, low levels of lymphocytes and neutrophils were observed at  least  2  times  more  frequently  with  fluoxetine  than  duloxetine  (that  is,  the  DLX/DLX  group).  Low levels of mean cell hemoglobin and neutrophils, as well as high neutrophil and abnormal protein levels occurred at least 2 times more frequently with duloxetine than fluoxetine. These differences were not considered clinically meaningful, however.

With respect to mean change from baseline (blood pressure and pulse), PCS abnormalities (blood pressure and pulse) and sustained elevations of blood pressure, no statistically significant differences were observed between duloxetine and fluoxetine. A statistically significant difference for mean change in  QTcF  was  observed  between  duloxetine  and  fluoxetine,  with  patients  in  the  duloxetine  group experiencing a mean decrease and those in the fluoxetine group experiencing a mean increase. Overall mean changes were small (increase or decrease of less than 4 msec), however, and not considered clinically relevant for either drug. Categorical analyses of QTcF identified 1 male patient (0.4%) in the duloxetine  group  who  experienced  an  abnormal  increase  in  QTcF  interval  (that  is,  an  increase  of greater than 40 msec from baseline). One male patient (0.6%) in the fluoxetine group met the genderspecific high QTcF criteria ( ≥ 450 msec). Neither patient met PCS criteria for QTcF (an absolute interval &gt;500 msec). Abnormal high heart rate was reported in 1 (0.4%) duloxetine-treated patient and no fluoxetine-treated  patient  during  acute  treatment.  There  were  no  SAEs  or  TEAEs  related  to  QTc

Longer-term data are important for assessing cardiovascular risk. To this end, data from the combined acute and extension phase treatment periods (36 weeks) were pooled from both studies to ascertain the frequency and duration of PCS vital signs and sustained elevation in blood pressure. In this pooled analyses,  only  patients  randomised  to  duloxetine  or  fluoxetine  at  the  beginning  of  the  studies  were analysed.  In  other  words,  patients  randomised  to  placebo  were  excluded  since  these  patients  were only exposed to duloxetine for 26 weeks and not the complete study duration. Categorical analyses of blood pressure at endpoint compared with at any time suggest that the majority of PCS events at any time  occurring  in  the  duloxetine  and  fluoxetine  groups  tended  to  resolve  during  the  studies,  as evidenced  by  the  lower  frequency  of  events  at  endpoint  (Table  8.3).  With  respect  to  sustained elevation  of  blood  pressure,  less  than  2%  of  patients  in  the  duloxetine  and  fluoxetine  groups  met criteria for sustained elevation of systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Overall, therefore, no new signal with respect to pulse and blood pressure was identified.

With respect to ECG results, a mean increase in heart rate of 2.8 bpm was observed for the duloxetine group, while a mean decrease (-2.3 bpm) was observed in the fluoxetine group over the 36 weeks of the study. Patients in the duloxetine group experienced a mean decrease in QTcF (-1.9 msec) while those  in  the  fluoxetine  group  experienced  a  mean  increase  (2.3  msec).  The  difference  between treatment  groups  for  both  heart  rate  and  QTcF  were  both  statistically  significant  (&lt;.001  and  .005, respectively). Over the entire study, 1 duloxetine-treated patient experienced abnormal high heart rate and  1  duloxetine-treated  patient  experienced  abnormal  increase  in  QTcF  interval,  and  both  events occurred  during  acute  treatment.  There  were  3  patients  in  the  fluoxetine  group  who  experienced gender-specific high QTcF ( ≥ 470 msec for females and ≥ 450 msec for males), with 1 event occurring during acute treatment. There were 3 patients in the fluoxetine group with abnormal increase in QTcF interval (&gt;40 msec increase) from study baseline.

In  order  to  provide  more  robust  comparisons  for  suicide-related  events  between  duloxetine  and fluoxetine  accounting  for  differences  in  number  of  patients  assigned  to  each  treatment  group  and duration of exposure, an exposure adjusted analysis was conducted for the overall population, and also for  each  age  subgroup  (children  and  adolescent).  Exposure  adjusted  incidence  rate  (EAIR),  that  is, number of patients with events divided by the total patient years, was calculated separately for acute phase, extension phase, as well as acute and extension phase combined. EAIR was compared between treatment  groups  for  acute  phase  or  acute  and  extension  phase  combined  using  Miettinen  and Nurminen  (MN)  method  (Miettinen  and  Nurminen  1985;  Chan  and  Wang  2009).  There  were  no completed suicides in Studies HMCK and HMCL. The frequency of treatment emergent suicidal ideation and  non-suicidal  self-injurious  behaviour  as  collected  via  CSSR-S  was  similar  across  all  treatment groups  during  acute  treatment.  Suicidal  ideation  occurred  in  a  similar  proportion  of  patients  in  all

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

treatment groups and occurred in both children and adolescents, with the frequency being greater in adolescents.  Suicidal  behaviour  as  collected  via  CSSR-S  occurred  in  &lt;1%  of  patients  within  any treatment group during acute treatment. Three cases of suicidal behaviour were reported during acute treatment  with  2  cases  for  fluoxetine,  1  case  for  placebo,  and  0  cases  for  duloxetine.  Regarding exposure  adjusted  analyses  for  the  acute-treatment  phase,  there  were  no  statistically  significant differences  between  duloxetine  and  fluoxetine  for  EAIR  for  overall  population  or  for  the  adolescent subgroups.

The frequency of treatment emergent suicidal ideation as collected via C-SSRS was similar across all treatment  groups  during  the  extension-treatment  period.  Suicidal  ideation  occurred  in  a  similar proportion of patients in all treatment groups and occurred in both children and adolescents, with the frequency generally being greater in adolescents. Suicidal behaviour as collected via C-SSRS occurred in &lt;1% of patients within the PBO/DLX and FLX/FLX treatment groups and in 2.6% of patients in the DLX/DLX treatment group during extension treatment. A total of 8 cases of suicidal behaviour were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reported  during  extension  treatment  with  7  cases  for  duloxetine-  and  1  case  for  fluoxetine-treated patients.

Regarding  exposure  adjusted  analyses  for  the  extension-treatment  phase,  the  number  of  events (ideation or behaviour) per patient years was similar for duloxetine and fluoxetine. More specifically, even  though  the  actual  number  of  suicide  behaviours  was  greater  for  duloxetine  compared  with fluoxetine,  the  difference  between  duloxetine  and  fluoxetine  treatment  groups  in  the  exposure adjusted incidence rate was smaller due to greater number of patients exposed to duloxetine.

An additional exposure adjusted analysis using data from C-SSRS over the 36-week study for patients initially randomised to duloxetine or fluoxetine shows no statistically significant difference in the EAIR between duloxetine and fluoxetine in the overall patient population or within the child or adolescent subgroup. As noted in the discussion of the extension dataset above, even though the actual number of  suicide  behaviours  was  greater  for  duloxetine  compared  with  fluoxetine,  the  difference  between

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

duloxetine and fluoxetine treatment groups in the exposure adjusted incidence rate was smaller due to greater number of patients exposed to duloxetine.

No  new  signals  were  identified  with  regard  to  suicide-related  events  or  non-suicidal  self-injurious behaviour. Results with regard to the frequency of suicidality (ideation or behaviour) for Studies HMCK and HMCL are fairly consistent with previously published studies of antidepressants in the treatment of children  and  adolescents  with  MDD.  The  SmPC  currently  contains  a  class  labelling  warning  for  both duloxetine  and  fluoxetine  regarding  use  in  paediatric  patients  and  suicide-related  events  (ideation, behaviour)  (SmPC  section  4.4).  The  recommendation  for  carefully  monitoring  of  paediatric  patients with MDD for the appearance of suicidal symptoms remains a suitably cautious clinical approach.

Overall,  no  clinically  important  differences  in  safety  and  tolerability  findings  were  noted  between duloxetine  and  fluoxetine  except  for  a  higher  rate  of  DC  due  to  an  AE  with  duloxetine,  which  was driven by nausea. Results of laboratory analyses of mean change and treatment-emergent abnormal values reveal similar mean changes and frequencies of abnormal laboratory values between duloxetine and  fluoxetine,  but  these  differences  were  not  considered  clinically  meaningful.  Similarly,  with  the possible exception of modest mean increase of QTcF interval with fluoxetine, no meaningful differences between duloxetine  and  fluoxetine  were  observed  from  analyses  of  vital  signs  and  ECG  parameters during acute treatment or over the entire study. No new safety signals were identified with regard to suicide-related  events  (ideation,  behaviour)  or  non-suicidal  self-injurious  behaviour  during  acute treatment or extension treatment. Even though the actual number of suicide behaviours was greater for duloxetine compared with fluoxetine, the difference between duloxetine and fluoxetine treatment groups in the exposure adjusted incidence rate was smaller due to greater number of patients exposed to duloxetine.

## Rapporteur's comments:

More patients in the duloxetine than the fluoxetine group discontinued due to an adverse events in the acute treatment, principally due to nausea. Discontinuation rates due to an AE remained higher in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

duloxetine group at study endpoint. A higher frequency of nausea and dizziness were reported with duloxetine compared with fluoxetine. These results are consistent with the known profile of duloxetine. Differences between duloxetine and fluoxetine observed in laboratory-related data were not considered clinically meaningful. Differences in results from analyses of vital signs (blood pressure, pulse) and ECGs were small for both duloxetine and fluoxetine in these studies, generally not considered clinically meaningful, and concordant with known safety profile of both compounds. A mean increase in heart rate and a mean decrease in QTcF were observed for the duloxetine group over the 36 weeks of the study (statistically significant compared with fluoxetine).

An exposure adjusted analysis was conducted for suicide-related events including those patients initially randomized to placebo and switched to duloxetine in the extension phase. Suicidal ideation occurred in a similar proportion of patients in all treatment groups and occurred in both children and adolescents, with the frequency being greater in adolescent. In the acute phase the number of events (suicidal ideation or behaviour) per patient years was similar for duloxetine and fluoxetine. During extension treatment the number of suicidal behaviours was greater for duloxetine (2.6% ) compared with fluoxetine (0.6%) and placebo/fluoxetine (0.6%).

When the incidence rate was adjusted by exposure, these differences between treatment for the extension-treatment phase were smaller (duloxetine: 0.04 Events per PY; fluoxetine: 0.01 Events per PY; placebo/duloxetine: 0.01 Events per PY). It must be due to greater number of patients exposed to duloxetine. When looking at the exposure adjusted analysis over the 36-week study, no statistically significant differences in the exposure-adjusted incidence rates for suicidal behaviour were observed between duloxetine and fluoxetine in the overall patient population or within the child or adolescent subgroup (duloxetine: 0.04 Events per PY; fluoxetine: 0.03 Events per PY; p=.646). There were not remarkable differences respecting non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour.

The higher numbers of suicidal behaviour in patients treated with duloxetine compared with those receiving fluoxetine can be considered as a safety signal that, although it is not possible to objectively assign to duloxetin, could represent a matter of concern.

In view of all of these uncertainties this information is considered sufficiently relevant for physicians to be included in the SmPC.

## Clinical Request 6

The  MAH  should  provide  the  data  regarding  monitoring  of  some  key  events  that  has  not been discussed in this report:

- -Hepatic  risk:  effect  of  duloxetine  on  laboratory  parameters  and  changes  in  liver enzymes/hepatic adverse events.
- Severe cutaneous reactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## MAH response

## 1. Hepatic Risk.

In Studies HMCK and HMCL, no patient had an SAE related to laboratory results, and no patient discontinued  due  to  abnormal  laboratory  values.  A  new  analysis  of  spontaneously  reported  hepaticrelated  TEAEs was performed using pooled data from HMCK and HMCL. Based on this analysis, few patients were identified who experienced a hepatic-related TEAE during the 36 weeks of either study. Specifically, during the acute phase, 1 patient in each treatment group experienced 1 hepatic-related TEAE: In the duloxetine group, ALT increased; in the fluoxetine group, hepatic steatosis; in the placebo group,  hepatic  enzyme  increased.  During  the  extension  phase,  1  (0.6%)  patient  who  continued duloxetine in the extension phase (DLX/DLX group) and 2 (1.1%) patients who continued fluoxetine in the extension phase experienced ALT increase. One patient who switched from placebo to duloxetine for  the  extension  phase  experienced  ALT  increase.  An  analysis  of  mean  change  in  chemistry  and hematologic laboratory analytes was performed using the acute analyses set. For chemistry analytes related  to  hepatology,  the  difference  between  duloxetine  and  placebo  was  statistically  significant (p&lt;.05) only for GGT (-1.20, -0.32). However, this finding is not considered clinically meaningful since a  decrease  is  not  indicative  of  liver  injury.  No  clinically  meaningful  differences  were  noted  between duloxetine and fluoxetine. No patients met Hy's Rule criteria. Treatment-emergent ALT ≥ 3 times ULN was  reported  in  the  extension  analyses  set  for  1  patient  in  the  duloxetine  group  and  1  patient  in fluoxetine group. The patient in the duloxetine group (17 year old male) was initially randomised to placebo and then transitioned to duloxetine for the extension period. The patient had an abnormal ALT value  at  baseline  and  experienced  a  treatment  emergent  ALT  increase  to ≥ 3  times  ULN  at  the  last study visit while taking duloxetine (Week 36). The patient completed the study by entering the taper phase, during which time the patient's ALT levels decreased towards normal values by the end of the taper phase. For the patient in the fluoxetine group, a 17 year old male, had a treatment-emergent ALT ≥ 3  times  ULN  that  reached  levels ≥ 5  times  during  ULN  Study  Period  III.  The  patient's  ALT elevation  persisted  for  approximately  9  weeks  reaching  a  maximum  of  216  U/L  (5  times  ULN) approximately  6  weeks  after  the  initial  ALT  elevation.  The  patient's  ALT  returned  to  normal  at approximately the 28- and 32-week time points while the patient continued on fluoxetine 40 mg QD. Overall,  therefore,  no  new  hepatic-related  safety  concerns  for  duloxetine  were  noted  within  the paediatric population in these studies.

## 2. Severe Cutaneous Reactions

A standard MedDRA query was performed using the acute and long-term analyses sets. One possible case  of  Stevens-Johnson  Syndrome  was  identified  (this  case  was  reported  in  the  Risk  Management Plan (RMP) v9 submitted in October 2011). As summarised in the HMCL Study Report, this 15-year-old male in the duloxetine group was hospitalized for suspected SJS 137 days after starting duloxetine, and discontinued treatment on the day of hospitalization. The patient was experiencing symptoms of sinus  infection,  temperature,  fatigue,  and  headache  for  approximately  2-3  months  prior  to  the hospitalization. The patient also developed blisters in the mouth, cough, and conjunctivitis. No rash or other signs of allergic reaction were reported. The patient recovered from the event. The investigator judged  the  event  to  be  possibly  related  to  the  drug.  The  risk  of  SJS  is  already  a  labeled  adverse reaction in the SmPC and an important identified risk noted within the RMP.

## Rapporteur's comments:

No new hepatic-related safety concerns for duloxetine were noted within the paediatric population in these studies. One possible case of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome was identified. The risk of SJS is already a labelled adverse reaction in the SmPC.

## SmPC Related Request and Responses

The MAH should submit a proposal for the SmPC including modifications in the wording of the following sections : 4.2; 4.4; 4.8; 5.1; 5.2

Please refer to WS0334 procedure (Ariclaim-EMEA/H/C/000552/WS0334/0054/G, CymbaltaEMEA/H/C/000572/WS0334/0056/G, Xeristar-EMEA/H/C/000573/WS0334/0059/G

Yentreve-EMEA/H/C/000545/WS0334/0043/G -Type II Variation: Safety Update to SmPC and Package Leaflet - Company Core Data Sheet (CCDS) Update &amp; Addition of Clinically Relevant Paediatric Data) for the final SmPC wording.

## VI. CONCLUSION

With the responses submitted by the MAH, all questions have now been resolved and this procedure could be considered finalized.

As a positive benefit for paediatric population has not been demonstrated with the submitted studies, the use of duloxetine in the paediatric population is not recommended.

However, changes in the PI other than section 4.1of the SmPC are being considered. These are being assessed within the procedure submitted in parallel: EMEA/H/C/ xxxx/WS/0334/G.
