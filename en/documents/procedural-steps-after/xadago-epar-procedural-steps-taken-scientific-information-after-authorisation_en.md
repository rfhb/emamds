1 Notifications  are issued for  type I variations  and Article  61(3) notifications  (unless part of a group including a type II variation  or extension  application  or a worksharing  application).  Opinions are  issued for all  other procedures.

2 A Commission  decision  (CD) is issued for procedures  that affect  the terms of the marketing  authorisation  (e.g.  summary of  product characteristics,  annex  II, labelling,  package  leaflet).  The CD is issued within two  months of  the opinion  for variations  falling  under the scope of  Article  23.1a(a)  of Regulation  (EU) No.  712/2012, or within  one year  for other procedures.

| II/0027             | Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order to implement information regarding interaction of safinamide and rosuvastatin, following results from study CRO-PK-17-318. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives for Ireland in the Package Leaflet and to include editorial changes in the English, German and Spanish product information. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 18/10/2018   | 18/07/2019   | SmPC and PL     | Safinamide may transiently inhibit BCRP in vitro. In drug- drug-interaction studies in human, a weak interaction was observed with rosuvastatin (AUC increase between 1.25 and 2.00 fold) but no significant interaction was found with diclofenac. It is recommended to monitor patients when safinamide is taken with medicinal products that are BCRP substrates (e.g., rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, ciprofloxacin, methotrexate, topotecan, diclofenac or glyburide) and to refer to their SmPCs to determine if a dose adjustment is needed.   |

| II/0005             | Update of Section 4.5 of the SmPC for Xadago based on the results of the final report of the in vitro studies 'In vitro Interaction Studies of Safinamide and NW-1153 with Selected human BCRP Efflux (ABC) Transporter, and with human OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP1A2, OAPT2B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1 and MATE2-K Uptake Transporters'. C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission of studies to the competent authority | 26/05/2016 | 11/01/2017 | SmPC        | In an in vitro Study, the non-specific binding of safinamide and whether safinamide is a substrate for BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 were investigated. Based on the results of this and previous studies, it can be concluded that safinamide did not show any non-specific binding and safinamide is not a substrate for BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations. Safinamide is, however, an inhibitor of OCT1 at clinically relevant portal vein concentrations and may lead to interactions with concomitantly taken drugs that are also substrates of OCT1. Therefore, Information that Safinamide may lead to interactions when taken concomitantly with drugs such as metformin, acyclovir, ganciclovir was added to Section 4.5 |

| II/0008               | Update of sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC to introduce information on safinamide effects on BCRP based on the results of a drug-drug interaction study (category 3 study in the RMP). The RMP is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of Local Representatives for Ireland and UK in the PL. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 28/01/2016   | 11/01/2017 | SmPC and PL | Safinamide may transiently inhibit BCRP in vitro. However, in a drug-drug-interaction study with diclofenac in humans no significant interactions were observed. Therefore, no precautions are necessary when safinamide is taken with medicinal products that are BCRP substrates (e.g., pitavastatin, pravastatin, ciprofloxacin, methotrexate, topotecan, diclofenac or glyburide). |
