## Scientific discussion

## Introduction

## About the product

KIOVIG is  a  plasma-derived  product  consisting  of  a  highly  purified  preparation  of  human  IgG.  It  is supplied as a ready-to-use liquid formulation with a pH of 4.6 to 5.1. 98% of the protein is gamma globulin  with  a  normal  subclass  distribution.  The  manufacturing  process  results  in  an  intact  IgG molecule with complete functional activity. The final product contains only trace amounts of IgA and IgM. Glycine is used as a stabiliser. KIOVIG is supplied in single-dose vials that nominally contain 1g, 2.5g, 5g, 10g, 20g and 30g protein per vial.

In the EU, KIOVIG  is currently licensed for replacement therapy in a number  of primary immunodeficiency  disorders  (PID),  for  immune  modulation  in  idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  purpura (ITP), Guillain Barré syndrome and Kawasaki disease, and for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation according to the current Core SmPC for human normal immunoglobulin for intravenous administration (IVIg) (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/094038/2007).

## About the disease

Multifocal  motor  neuropathy  (MMN)  is  a  rare,  probably  immune-mediated  disorder  characterized  by slowly progressive, asymmetric, distal weakness of one or more limbs, most commonly the arms, with no objective loss of sensation. Multifocal motor neuropathy was described in detail in 1988 for the first time (Parry GJ, Clarke S. Multifocal acquired demyelinating neuropathy masquerading as motor neuron disease. Muscle Nerve 1988;11:103-7). This weakness may be accompanied by muscle atrophy in later stages of  the  disease,  and  cramps  and  fasciculation  are  reported  to  occur  in  approximately  50%  of patients with MMN. Tendon reflexes are often decreased or absent in the affected limb. The hallmark of the disease is the presence of multifocal conduction block on electrophysiological testing outside the usual sides of nerve compression.

Almost 80% of people with MMN are between 20 and 50 years of age at onset of the disease, and men are  more  frequently  affected  than  women  (2.6:1).  The  prevalence  is  estimated  to  be  1  to  2  per 100,000.

MMN seems to be an immune mediated disorder. Serum IgM GM1 antibodies are detectable in 30% to 80%  of  the  patients,  furthermore  increased  signal  intensities  on  T2-weighted  MR  images  of  the brachial plexus have been observed suggesting an inflammatory process.

Treatment  options  for  MMN  patients  are  sparse.  Patients  with  MMN  do  not  respond  to  steroids  or plasma exchange, and may even worsen with these treatments.

Cyclophosphamide  and  interferon-beta  1a  have  been  suggested  beneficial  in  several  uncontrolled studies, but cyclophosphamide has serious long-term side effects and interferon-beta 1a has only been tested in a very limited number of patients.

Previous  studies  on  the  use  of  IVIg  in  patients  with  MMN  suggest  variable  effects  on  disability  or muscle  impairment,  which  is  partly  due  to  the  small  patient  populations  studied.  In  addition,  the disability scales and scores for muscle weakness used have their limitation in that they are not adapted specifically for MMN resulting in changes in overall strength and disability parameter are comparably small.

Limitations  regarding  the  available  data  on  the  efficacy  of  IVIg  treatment  in  patients  with  MMN  are essentially  related  to  the  rare  nature  of  the  condition,  and  the  interindividual  variability  in  response

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rates. Furthermore, the use of different disability scales in the studies, for instance the modified Norris scale  by  Azulay  (Intravenous  immunoglobulin  treatment  in  patients  with  motor  neuron  syndromes associated  with  anti-GM1  antibodies.  Neurol.  1994;  44:429-432),  modified Rankin  scale  by  van  den Berg  (Improvement of  multifocal  motor  neuropathy  during  long-term  weekly  treatment  with  human immunoglobulin. Neurology.1995; 45:987-988.) and a self-evaluation scale score from 0 to 5 by Léger (Intravenous  immunoglobulin  therapy  in  multifocal  motor  neuropathy.  Brain.2001;124:145-153) contribute to impression of divergent results.

An  analysis  (Cochrane  Review)  across  all  randomized  controlled-trials  on  IVIg  treatment  in  MMN demonstrated a non-significant trend towards improvement in disability after intravenous immunoglobulin compared with placebo, and a significant improvement in muscle strength (van Schaik IN,  van  den  Berg  LH,  de  Haan  R,  Vermeulen  M.  Intravenous  immunoglobulin  for  multifocal  motor neuropathy. Cochrane Database Syst.Rev. 2005, CD004429).

## Treatment guidelines / recommendations

The treatment of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) with IVIg is recommended by the Guideline on Management of Multifocal Motor Neuropathy and the European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral  Nerve  Society  (EFNS/PNS)  Guideline  for  the  Use  of  IVIg  in  the  Treatment  of Neurological Diseases. The EFNS/PNS Guideline recommends IVIg dosage regimens of 1 g/kg every 24 weeks or 2 g/kg every 4-8 weeks. Treatment strategies that aim to detect the lowest effective dose and the longest tolerated interval may lead to insufficient dosing in the long-term in many patients.

The use of IVIg in the treatment of MMN is supported by the 2009 assessment of off-label-use expert panel convened by the German Ministry of Health. The expert panel concluded that IVIg therapy in patients  with  MMN  was  recommended  despite  recognized  weaknesses  of  published  studies,  since  a positive safety profile and a response rate to IVIg of approximately 80% have been established and alternative therapies are lacking.

Distinct IVIgs have been approved for the treatment of MMN in a few European Countries on a national basis (France, the Netherlands, and Belgium).

The present variation application has been submitted to add the treatment of MMN to the approved indications for Kiovig in 4.1 of the SmPC. It considers the CHMP guideline on the clinical investigation of human normal immunoglobulin for the intravenous administration (IVIg) (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94033/2007 rev.2).

The  Applicant  did  not  seek  scientific  advice  from  CHMP  for  the  development  in  this  indication.  The applicantion  included  a  summary  of  published  literature  and  the  results  of  two  completed  clinical studies in patients with MMN.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

This variation did not fall under Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006, as amended ('Paediatric Regulation').

The Applicant has provided a statement confirming the absence of EU patent coverage for the product which was recognised by EMA as the reason for being exempt from the formal PIP requirements posed by the Article 8 of the regulation.

## Placebo-controlled Studies on IVIg Products in MMN

The use of IVIg for MMN was the subject of an extensive review by the Cochrane Collaboration. The Cochrane  search  retrieved  285  studies  including  a  total  of  484  MMN  patients,  383  of  whom  were treated with IVIg. Four controlled, double-blind studies were identified, in which a total of 46 patients with MMN received treatment with IVIg (Table 2). In a meta-analysis of these studies conducted by van Schaik et al. (2005), an improvement in strength was reported in 78% of patients following IVIg treatment compared to 4% following a placebo. Improvement in disability was observed in 39% and 11% of patients following IVIg therapy and placebo, respectively.

## Long-term Treatment of MMN with IVIg products

Several studies, involving a total of 89 patients, have assessed the long-term efficacy (up to 12 years) of treatment of MMN with IVIg (Table 3). The beneficial effects of treatment appeared within days or 14 weeks, and declined within 4 to 8 weeks, requiring repeat dosing at variable intervals. Maintenance treatment,  guided  by  the  functional  disability  of  the  individual  patient,  is  therefore  necessary  to maintain the beneficial effect on muscle strength in most cases.

The response to IVIg treatment decreased in some subjects over time, which is likely to be a result of progressive axonal loss. However, increasing monthly doses appeared to restore treatment response. Notably,  despite  general  disease  progression  and  increases  in  muscle  weakness  over  time,  MMN patients on long-term maintenance treatment with IVIg had improved strength scores at the end of observation period compared to baseline.

Nonetheless, disease progression is inherent in the natural course of MMN, and cannot be completely halted by IVIg treatment. For example, in a long-term observational study in 11 patients receiving IVIg (GAMMAGARD  SD,  Baxter)  over  4-8  years,  the  average  slope  of  the  MRC  sum  scores  was  -0.2 (standard deviation [SD] 0.2). With respect to Guy's disability scores, the average slopes were -0.1 (SD  0.8)  for  upper  limbs,  and  -0.4  (SD  0.7)  for  lower  limbs.  Statistically,  the  declines  were  not different from zero, and reflected intra-, and inter-individual variation. Overall, muscle strength tended to be slightly lower at the end of the observation period, compared to the initial response, but was still higher than before IVIg initiation. These findings are similar to other long-term observational studies.

## Uncontrolled Studies

Many open and uncontrolled studies on the efficacy of IVIg therapy in patients with MMN have been published.  An  analysis  conducted  by  van  Schaik  (2005)  showed  that  383  of  the  487  MMN  patients described were treated with IVIg. Improvement in muscle strength was reported in 303/373 patients (81.2%), an improvement in disability was reported in 91/23 IVIg treated patients (74.0%).

In  a  national  MMN  database  in  the  Netherlands  described  by  van  den  Berg,  90/94  (96%)  of  MMN patients received an initial IVIg course at a cumulative dose of 2g/kg. Seventy-four (79%) patients responded to initial treatment and received IVIg maintenance treatment. This clinical response to initial treatment with IVIg is comparable to that reported in placebo-controlled studies.

The  available  data  on  the  efficacy  of  IVIg  treatment  in  patients  with  MMN  have  limitations  from  a biometrical perspective with respect to patient number, cross-over design and duration of the postobservation periods. These limitations are essentially related to the rare nature of the condition and the inter-individual variability in response rates. The use of different disability scales in the studies (for instance the modified Norris scale by Azulay 1994, modified Rankin scale by van den Berg 1995 and a self-evaluation scale score from 0 to 5 by Léger 2001 contribute to impression of divergent results, but an analysis across all studies on IVIg treatment in MMN demonstrated maintained muscle strength and functionality.

## Comparability of different IVIg products

Human  normal  immunoglobulins  are  produced  from  a  pool  of  donations  from  1,000  to  more  than 50,000  healthy  donors  (depending  on  the  manufacturer)  and  hence  contain  principally  IgG,  with  a subclass distribution that largely reflects that of IgG in normal subjects. The large number of pooled

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

donations provides a large array of antibodies that cover specificities for infectious agents to provide replacement therapy for immune deficiencies. The large array of antibodies from multiple donors also provides naturally occurring antibodies that are cross-reactive to self antigens or pathologic antibodies.

Some  investigators  consider  the  latter  to  be  the  basis  of  immune  effects  of  IVIg  therapy  in autoimmune disease. Although all IVIgs have to adhere to the European Pharmacopoeia monograph 0918,  some  differences  in  the  pharmaceutical  composition  between  products,  but  also  between batches of one product do exist. These differences may impact IVIg tolerability and safety. The extent of the impact on therapeutic efficacy is not known exactly. However, it can be expected to be small, given the similarity in the active ingredients composition, namely in IgG content and half-life (Cherin et al. 2010).

To assess if different IVIg brands, or different lots of the same brand, may affect efficacy, Zhang et al examined  the  protective  efficacy  of  8  different  brands  of  IVIg  and  different  lots  of  two  brands: GAMMAGARD  S/D  (Baxter),  Iveegam  EN  /  Endobulin  (Baxter),  Flebogamma  (Grifols)  (3  different batches), Panglobulin NF (American Red Cross), Carimune NF (ZLB Bioplasma), Octagam (Octapharma), Gamunex (Bayer Healthcare) and Gammar-PLV (ZLB Behring) (4 different batches).

The  efficacy  model  used  by  Zhang  et  al.  is  an  anti-ganglioside  antibody-mediated,  complementdependent neurotoxicity assay considered to be relevant notably for MMN. In this cell culture model of autoimmune nerve injury, the results showed that a) the eight different commercial brands of IVIg have similar protective efficacy and b) for 2 IVIg products (Endobulin and Gammar-PLV) there is no lot-to-lot variability. These results suggest that efficacy of different IVIg products is comparable in a standardized model.

## Clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacokinetics

Baxter has not performed pharmacokinetic studies in MMN, but has submitted pharmacokinetic data on KIOVIG in 22 patients with PID in the course of the centralized licensing procedure in Europe. There is no evidence suggesting that the pharmacokinetic characteristics of KIOVIG in patients with MMN are different to those in patients treated for approved indications. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of IVIg products are also well described in the literature.

## Pharmacodynamics

The  mechanism  of  action  of  KIOVIG  in  indications  other  than  replacement  therapy  has  not  been elucidated,  but  may  include  a  variety  of  immunomodulatory  effects.  MMN  seems  to  be  an  immune mediated  disorder.  Serum  IgM  GM1  antibodies  are  detectable  in  30%  to  80%  of  the  patients, furthermore increased signal intensities on T2-weighted MR images of the brachial plexus have been observed suggesting an inflammatory process. There are no conclusive data on the specific mode of action of IVIg in patients with MMN.

## Clinical efficacy

## Introduction

The  evaluation  of  the  efficacy  is  based  on  two  investigator-initiated,  open-label  clinical  studies evaluating the efficacy of KIOVIG treatment in patients with MMN:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. MMN Conversion  study  (Study  I) :  a  prospective  open-label,  non-controlled study over 12 months  in  20  MMN  patients,  in  order  to  demonstrate  clinical  equivalence  in  two  IVIg preparations (KIOVIG vs. GAMMAGARD S/D) in maintenance treatment. 19 of the 20 patients entered  a  two-year  follow-up  period  to  document  long-term  efficacy  and  adverse  effects  of KIOVIG.

GAMMAGARD  S/D  is  a  freeze-dried  5%  (50  g/l)  IVIg  preparation  for  reconstitution  prior  to infusion;  it  is  approved  for  use  in  the  indication  MMN  in  the  Netherlands.  KIOVIG  is  a  liquid concentrated (10%, 100 g/l) ready-to-use IVIg preparation for infusion.

2. A prospective, open-label, non-controlled study was conducted in 2007-2010 to investigate the efficacy of KIOVIG for initial  treatment in 8 patients with newly diagnosed MMN ( Study II ). Seven of the eight patients were administered long-term treatment following completion of the initial 5-day course.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study (Baxter clinical study 160604) is currently being conducted to investigate the efficacy of KIOVIG in the treatment of subjects with MMN. A total of 40 subjects are planned to be enrolled in this study. Efficacy data were not yet available at the time of assessment of this application.

## Dose response study

No  formal  dose-finding  studies  have  been  conducted  with  KIOVIG.  As  recommended  by  the  EFNS guideline for the Use of IVIg in Treatment of Neurological Diseases and the EFNS/PNS Guideline on Management of MMN, the doses for the two MMN studies described above were 2g/kg (given over 2-5 days) as fist line treatment and individual dosing for subsequent infusions (guided by responses, e.g. 0.4g/kg every 1-2 weeks or 2g/kg every 4-8 weeks).

## Main studies

## Methods

##  Study Participants

## MMN Conversion Study (Study I)

The study was to included 20 adult subjects with a diagnosis of 'definitive MMN' or 'probable MMN' according to published criteria (Van den Berg, 2000; Asseldonk et al., 2005) that were responsive to IVIg  treatment    and  had  received  maintenance  treatment  with  freeze-dried  5%  IVIg  (GAMMAGARD S/D) for a period of at least one year prior to inclusion. Patients had to have normal sensory nerve conduction  in  segments  with  motor  conduction  block  (CB)  and  normal  distal  sensory  nerve  action potential  amplitudes  at  the  first  nerve  conduction  study.  Exclusion  criteria  included  treatment  with immunosuppressive  drugs  in  the  three  preceding  months,  a  history  of  severe  adverse  reactions  to immunoglobulin  treatment,  IgA  deficiency,  chronic  heart  failure  or  renal  dysfunction;  pregnant  or breast-feeding women were also excluded.

## Initial treatment of MMN (Study II)

8 adult (1 female, 7 male) subjects who had been newly diagnosed with MMN were enrolled in the study. The duration from first onset of clinical symptoms of MMN (reported muscle weakness) and start of treatment varied from 1 to 12 years.

##  Treatments

## MMN Conversion Study (Study I)

After enrolment, patients were treated with their regular maintenance dose of GAMMAGARD S/D for 3 months. During this time, patients visited the outpatient clinic three times: at baseline (t = -2), after 6 (t=-1) and after 12 weeks (t=0), at which time treatment with KIOVIG was initiated. Patients were then treated for a further 9 months with KIOVIG at an equivalent dose (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Study design of MMN Conversion study (Study I)

<!-- image -->

After 9 months of treatment with KIOVIG, patients could be continued on maintenance treatment with KIOVIG. A two  year  follow-up  study was conducted in these patients to document the long-term efficacy and tolerability of KIOVIG. During this follow-up period, efficacy was evaluated by measuring the same parameters of impairment and disability as those monitored during the main phase of the study.

The treatment doses per patient are indicated in the table below.

In  comparison  with  infusion  times  for  the  GAMMAGARD  S/D  treatment,  infusion  time  for  KIOVIG remained the same in 3 patients (15%), was reduced up to two-fold in 12 patients (60%) and was reduced more than two-fold in 5 patients (25%). As it would be expected of a 10% solution, mean infusion time with KIOVIG was significantly shorter than with GAMMAGARD S/D (2.5 hours compared to 4.5 hours).

## Initial treatment of MMN (Study II)

Patients received a first five-day course of KIOVIG at a cumulative dose of 2 g/kg body weight (0.4 g/kg  for  5  consecutive  days).  To  document  the  extent  and  duration  of  the  effect  of  this  first  IVIg treatment course, the patients were followed until muscle strength returned to pre-treatment levels. At that time, a second full course of IVIg treatment (0.4 g/kg for 5 consecutive days) was given and IVIg maintenance treatment was then initiated (0.4 g/kg every 2-4 weeks).

##  Objectives

## MMN Conversion Study (Study I)

This  study  aimed  to  switch  MMN  patients  who  were  successfully  treated  with  GAMMAGRAD  S/D  to treatment with KIOVIG.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The primary objective was to demonstrate that KIOVIG was clinically equivalent to GAMMAGARD S/D in the maintenance treatment of MMN. This was evaluated by muscle strength, which was documented using a modified Medical Research Council (MRC) scale.

Additionally, functional impairment was assessed using Guy's Neurological Disability Scale (GNDS) and Self Evaluation Scales and long-term efficacy and adverse effects were evaluated.

## Initial treatment of MMN (Study II)

The primary objective was to evaluate whether KIOVIG was effective in the initial treatment of MMN. Efficacy was evaluated using MRC sum scores.

Secondary objectives of this study were the evaluation of long-term efficacy (up to 3 years).

##  Outcomes/endpoints

Efficacy in both studies was evaluated using two primary endpoints:

(a) Muscle  strength :  A  modified  Medical  Research  Council  (MRC)  sum  score  of  ten  muscle  groups (shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, elbow extension, wrist flexion, wrist extension, hip flexion, knee flexion, knee extension, foot dorsiflexion, foot plantar flexion, on both sides) to measure impairment. MRC scores range from 0 (no contraction) to 5 (normal power) and the total score (max. 100) was calculated by summing up the individual scores. Subjects are defined as responders if the MRC sum scores remain stable.

(b) Disability ('functional  impairment')  as  monitored  using  the  Guy's  Neurologic  Disability  Scale (GNDS) and a Self-Evaluation Scale.

MRC scores were tested 10 days after IVIg administration. For patients in the treatment initiation study, a second full course of IVIg was administered when muscle strength returned to pre-treatment levels and initiation of maintenance treatment is provided.

Clinical efficacy was evaluated by using the definitions of clinical improvement, decline and stability in the patient's condition listed in following table. Endpoints were evaluated by the same investigator at all visits.

Table 7. Definition of Assessment Criteria

| Improvement   | 1. either the upper or lower limb score of the GNDS, OR the score of two or more motor activities on the self evaluation scale decreases by 1 point AND 2. if muscle strength increases ≥ 1 MRC grade in at least two muscle groups without a decrease in other muscle groups.   |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Decline       | 1. either the upper or lower limb score of the GDNS, OR the score of two or more motor activities on the self evaluation scale increases by 1 point AND 2. if muscle strength worsens one grade on the MRC scale in at least two affected muscles or muscle groups.              |
| Stable        | Patient demonstrates neither decline nor improvement                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A patient was considered as a responder if muscle strength remained unchanged when switching from Gammagard SD to KIOVIG (Conversion study I) or if IVIg could not be stopped without worsening of muscle strength (Study I and II).

## MMN Conversion Study (Study I)

MRC sum scores as measured with GAMMAGARD at baseline (t=-2), after 6 (t=-1) and after 12 (t=0) weeks were compared with scores at 6 (t=1), 18 (t=2) and 36 weeks (t=3) after initiation of KIOVIG treatment as well as at the end of the 2 year maintenance phase in a descriptive manner.

## Initial treatment of MMN (Study II)

MRC sum scores were provided for five time points:

- -at baseline (before the 1st course of treatment)
- -4-6 weeks after the 1st course of treatment (when the maximal effect on muscle strength was observed)
- -Before the 2nd treatment course (return of muscle strength to pre-treatment level)
- -After the 2nd course of treatment
- -At last follow-up examination (after 1-3 years of maintenance treatment)

Additionally,  a  descriptive  analysis  of  the  response  to  KIOVIG  on  functional  impairment  (regarding daily life activities) was presented for each of the eight subjects.

## Dynamometry

In addition to the MRC sum score, the isometric strength of muscles was also evaluated by hand-held dynamometry (HHD). HHD measurements were obtained on a selection of those muscles with an MRC score  &gt;3  and  &lt;5  at  any  time.  This  range  was  chosen  because  muscles  with  an  MRC  of  5  (normal strength)  are  unlikely  to  demonstrate  improvement,  and  those  with  an  MRC  of ≤ 3  are  too  weak  to adequately measure using a hand-held dynamometer.

As  with  MRC  scores,  an  average  of  3  measurements  after  treatment  with  GAMMAGARD  S/D  (and before treatment with KIOVIG) was compared to the average of 3 measurements post-treatment with KIOVIG.

##  Sample size

There was no formal sample size calculation.

##  Randomisation

Not applicable as both studies were uncontrolled single-arm trials.

##  Blinding (masking)

Not applicable as both studies were open-label.

##  Statistical methods

Only a descriptive analysis was presented for both clinical studies.

For statistical analysis the mean of 3 MRC sum scores was calculated. The rationale was to test the hypothesis  that  the  mean  MRC  sum  score  was  similar  during  GAMMAGARD  and  KIOVIG  treatment periods.  Because  of  non-normality  of  the  data  distribution  and  the  relatively  small  sample  size,  a conservative approach using the Wilcoxon signed rank test was chosen. The Wilcoxon signed rank test

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was  used  because  distributional  assumptions  of  parametric  tests,  including  the  t-test,  could  not  be satisfied.

## Results

##  Conduct of the study

No major amendments were made to the protocol.

The MMN Conversion study (Study I) was conducted between 2007-2008 (follow-up study: 2007-2010) at the University Medical Centre in Utrecht, The Netherlands. The study protocol received IEC approval in March 2006. The Initial Treatment of MMN study (Study II) was conducted at the same site between 2007-2010.

##  Baseline data

## MMN Conversion Study (Study I)

The study population consisted of 20 adults (4 female, 16 male) with definite or probable MMN who were in a stable clinical condition and had been receiving maintenance therapy with GAMMAGARD S/D for at least 12 months. The mean age of the patients included was 53 (range: 37-67) and there was a male to female ratio of 4:1. MRC sum scores as assessed prior to KIOVIG treatment ranged from 81.06 to 98.38. Dosing of GAMMAGARD varied from 0.10 g/kg/week to 0.49 g/kg/week.

##  Numbers analysed

## MMN Conversion study (Study I)

The data of all 20 patients were analysed throughout the 12 month maintenance study (intent-to-treat population, ITT). Nineteen (19) of them continued on KIOVIG with the two-year follow up period. One patient  (pt  number  10)  decided  to  switch  back  to  GAMMAGARD  S/D  due  to  dizziness  that  he experienced on KIOVIG.

## Initial treatment of MMN (Study II)

Data of 8 patients were analysed regarding efficacy after a first full course of KIOVIG (cumulative dose 2 g/kg). Seven of those continued KIOVIG treatment for the subsequent follow-up period. One patient remained stable after an initial loading dose and did not start on maintenance treatment. Therefore he was not further assessed during the follow-up phase.

##  Outcomes and estimation

## MMN Conversion study (Study I)

Results were presented as a tabular listing and a descriptive comparison of the MRC sum scores as measured with GAMMAGARD at baseline (t=-2), after 6 (t=-1) and after 12 (t=0) weeks and 6 (t=1), 18 (t=2) and 36 weeks (t=3) after KIOVIG was initiated (2007).

In  the  conversion  study  (Study  I),  GAMMAGARD  maintenance  treatment  could  be  converted successfully to long-term KIOVIG maintenance treatment in 19 out of 20 (95% (95% CI 85.5 - 100%)) MMN patients. The MAH concluded that results of this study show that muscle strength and disability ('functional impairment') were comparable between the treatment period with GAMMAGARD S/D and KIOVIG (Wilcoxon signed-rank test for MRC sum score analysis, p=0.126) (Cats et al 2008). There is no data documenting on- and off-treatment with KIOVIG since the study was not designed to assess such  fluctuations.  Nevertheless,  the  results  from  another  clinical  MMN  trial  have  been  submitted  as supportive data (see below).

The presented results indicate that the majority of patients remained relatively stable after switching from  GAMMAGARD  to  KIOVIG,  with  an  identical  number  of  patients  either  worsening  or  improving slightly within the observation period.

## Long-term effect of KIOVIG (MMN conversion study):

Nineteen out of 20 MMN patients participated in the long-term follow up part of the study. The results after 2 additional years of KIOVIG treatment (2010) are presented in the table below.

LEGEND: MRC Sum= Medical Research Coumcil sum score of 10 muscle groups (shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, elbow extension, wrist flexion and wrist extension, hip flexion, knee flexion, knee extension, foot dorsiflexion and foot plantar flexion, both sides, max score 100): GGDS: Gammagard SD; *Patient wanted to switch back to GAMMAGARD S/D because this patient experienced dizziness on KIOVIG, even at a low infiusion rate.

One  patient  (pt  number  10)  did  not  enter  the  long-term  follow-up  phase  because  he  experienced dizziness on KIOVIG, even at a low infusion rate. This patient was switched back to GAMMAGARD S/D. Twenty percent of subjects required slightly higher doses of KIOVIG compared with GAMMAGARD. One patient was clinically stable while using a slightly lower dose.

The MAH concluded that three patients worsened &gt;1 MRC grade on their MRC sum score (pt number 1, 2, 20) on KIOVIG in 2010 compared to 2007. Three patients improved &gt;1 MRC grade on their MRC sum score (pt number 4, 14, 19) on KIOVIG in 2010 compared to 2007. Three patients worsened 1 point on the Guy's disability score on KIOVIG in 2010 compared to 2007 (pt number 9, 17, 20) and three patients worsened one point on the Self Evaluation Scale on KIOVIG in 2010 compared to 2007 (pt number 9, 17,18). Four patients with MMN used a slightly higher dose (5 g per 1 to 3 weeks) of KIOVIG in 2010 compared to 2007 (pt number 1, 2, 4, 20). One patient used a slightly lower dose of KIOVIG in 2010 compared to 2007 (pt number 11).

The  MAH  pointed  out  that  disease  progression  cannot  be  completely  halted  by  IVIg  treatment  and response to IVIg treatment mildly decreases over time, which is likely to be a result of progressive axonal loss. Additionally, the MAH clarified that in the GAMMAGARD to KIOVIG conversion study the dose of IVIg remained the same without worsening of muscle strength over a nine months follow-up of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

KIOVIG treatment. After another two years of KIOVIG treatment the dose had to be increased slightly (5 gram per 1-3 weeks) in 4 patients (patient 1: from 0.18 in 2007 to 0.21 g/kg/wk in 2010; patient 2: from 0.49 in 2007 to 0.56 g/kg/wk in 2010; patient 4: from 0.15 in 2007 to 0.17 g/kg/wk in 2010; and patient 20: from 0.27 in 2007 to 0.30 g/kg/wk in 2010). Taken together, a slight increase of IVIg dose was not specific for a liquid formulation such as KIOVIG, but due to the natural course of the disease.

## Dynamometry data

Supplemental post-hoc analysis of data was provided by the applicant during the procedure. The MAH stated  that  in  all  but  one  of  the  20  patients  monitored,  pooled  dynamometry  measurements  for  all muscle groups tested indicated improved muscle strength when switching from GAMMAGARD S/D to KIOVIG.  The  average  improvement  in  muscle  strength  for  all  20  patients  was  ~36%  in  proximal muscles (shoulder abductors; elbow flexors and extensors; hip flexors; knee extensors and flexors and ~18% in distal muscles (wrist flexors and extensors; foot dorsiflexors and plantar flexors).

- Patient 8 remained stable after the initial full course treatment and did not start maintenance treatment. He decided to return to the local neurologist for follow-up care and therefore no follow-up data are available.

-For patient 4, efficacy data are not available for 2 timepoints because the patient was followed-up in another hospital.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  maximal  effect  of  IVIg  treatment  was  reported  at  4-6  weeks  after  the  first  full  course  of  IVIg treatment. Before the second treatment course (5-12 weeks after the first full course), the MRC sum score returned to the pretreatment levels in all patients; the MRC sum scores were inferior to the MRC sum score measured at baseline in 6 patients (data not available for patients 4 and 8). The maximal effect  of  IVIg  treatment  after  the  1 st and  the  2 nd full  course  of  IVIg  treatment  were  identical  for  6 patients (data not available for patients 4 and 8).

After one to three years of maintenance treatment, the MRC sum score was equal (n=6 patients) or superior  (n=1  patient)  to  the  score  measured  at  the  maximal  effect  (4-6  weeks  after  the  1st  full course) (data not available for patient 8). According to the MAH, these individual results demonstrate that muscle strength decreased when IVIg infusions were withheld and therefore that fluctuations were related to phases on-treatment and off-treatment.

As seen with the MRC sum score, there was an improvement in disability for the upper limbs (Guy's score decreased) after the first full IVIg course in 7 out of the 8 patients, which then deteriorated to the pretreatment levels before the second treatment (for patient 8, the score remained the same). The maximal effect of IVIg treatment for the upper limb Guy's score after the 1 st and the 2 nd full course of IVIg treatment were identical for 6 patients (data not available for patients 4 and 8). After one to three years of maintenance treatment, the upper limb Guy's score was equal (n= 7 patients) to the score measured after the maximal effect (4-6 weeks after the 1 st full course) (data not available for patient 8).

The  lower  limb  disability  score  at  baseline  was  low  (0  or  1)  in  7  out  of  8  patients  and  remained unchanged throughout the study. In patient 2 (the only patient who had onset of the disease in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lower  limbs),  the  Guy's  score  was  2  at  baseline,  decreased  to  1  after  the  1st  full  IVIg  treatment, returned  to  the  pretreatment  levels  before  the  2nd  treatment  and  responded  to  the  2nd  IVIg  full course with a score of 1, a score which was maintained throughout the long-term follow-up period.

In summary, the MAH concluded that the response rate in the treatment initiation study (Study II) was 100%.  The  response  to  KIOVIG  was  similar  to  experience  with  GAMMAGARD  and  consistent  with published literature on other products.

Regarding the overall efficacy of KIOVIG in MMN, the Applicant argued that the efficacy results from Study  I  and  Study  II  are  consistent  with  the  published  results  from  other  studies  that  document efficacy  fluctuation  related  to  IVIg  infusion  (Van  den  Berg  et  al.,  1995;  Van  den  Berg  et  al.  1998, Harbo et al., 2009).

One of the four placebo-controlled studies submitted as supportive evidence for the efficacy of KIOVIG in MMN evaluated the effect of an IVIg from the Central Laboratory Blood Transfusion, Amsterdam, in six  patients  with  MMN  (Van  den  Berg  et  al.,  1995).  Although  this  study  was  not  performed  with KIOVIG, 5 out of 6 patients in this study continued in a 'maintenance study', in which they received regular  IV  infusions  of  GAMMAGARD  (Baxter).  The  MAH  argued  that  the  efficacy  results  with GAMMAGARD can be extrapolated to KIOVIG for the following reasons:

- -The results of the MMN Conversion study (Study I) had shown that clinical efficacy of Kiovig and Gammagard  was  comparable,  and  that  changes  in  muscle  strength  observed  were  reflective  of normal fluctuations for MMN patients treated with IVIg.
- -Gammagard is similar to Kiovig in their IgG subclass distribution and in their efficacy (pre-clinical)

Furthermore,  a  randomised  single-blinded  cross-over  study  conducted  on  10  MMN  IVIg  pre-treated patients reported efficacy of 2 IVIg products from Baxter: Subcuvia, administered subcutaneously and Endobulin  (Harbo  et  al.,  2009).  During  pre-study  phase,  a  prolonged  treatment  free-IVIg  interval (maximal 10 weeks) was initiated in order to confirm responsiveness to IVIg for all patients (defined as at  least  10%  dynamometric  decline  of  strength  of  one  or  more  muscle  groups  as  compared  to  a baseline value assessed half way between the two previous regular doses of IVIg). During this period, a significant decrease in muscle strength of 14% ± 11% (P&lt;0.005) was observed, which subsequently improved during the randomised part of the study (with IVIg responsive patients).

##  Ancillary analyses

In response to the CHMP's request to further justify the robustness of the clinical data provided, the MAH provided the results of a post-hoc analysis comparing the efficacy results from Study II against a historical placebo control.

Data from the randomized, placebo-controlled trial in MMN patients published by Léger et al (2001) were used to provide a historical placebo group. In this placebo-controlled study 18 treatment-naïve patients were included (9 were treated with Endobulin and 9 received placebo). Treatment response was evaluated after an initial 3 months of placebo/IVIg treatment and 'responders' were defined as patients with an improvement of at least one point on the MRC score in at least two muscles together with a reduction of at least 1 point in two activities of daily life compared to baseline. This definition is identical  to  the  definition  of  'improvement'  in  the  two  Baxter  studies  submitted.  According  to  the results from the study by Léger et al 78% (95% CI= 44-93%) of IVIg-treated patients (7/9) and 22% (95% CI= 7-55%) of placebo-treated patients (2/9) were responders. The results from Study II show that  all  8  patients  (100%,  95%  CI=66-100%)  experienced  improvement  in  muscle  strength  and disability  following  an  initial  course  of  treatment  with  KIOVIG  (2g/kg).  This  improvement  rate,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

expressed  as  mean  with  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs),  was  compared  with  the  historical  placebo responder  rate.  The  66%  lower  CI  for  treatment  improvement  in  Study  II  was  significantly  greater than the 22% responder rate in the historical placebo group (p&lt;0.0001), indicating that KIOVIG was more effective than the historical placebo control in the treatment of MMN. In addition, the percentage of  responders  in  BAXTER's  Study  II  and  the  IVIg-treated  group  from  Léger  et  al  (2001)  were comparable: 100% (95% CI=66-100%) for KIOVIG vs. 78% (95% CI= 44-93%) for Endobulin.

## Feasibility of KIOVIG home treatment

Thirty-six  (36)  MMN  patients  who  receive  KIOVIG  maintenance  treatment  at  home  filled  out  a questionnaire regarding time, dose, adverse events, and practicality of home treatment. Advantages indicated  by  these  patients  were:  time  gain  (72%)  and  convenience  (94%)  or  other  (autonomy, presence  of  next  of  kin,  less  time  off  from  work,  no  hospital  atmosphere)  (19%).  Reported disadvantages were: absence of medical staff in case of an adverse event (28%), problems with IV access or the infusion system (6%) or other (different nurses, logistic problems) (11 %). Six patients reported mild adverse events following IVIg infusions: headache (three patients), chills (two patients) and mild skin rash (one patient). No serious adverse events occurred during KIOVIG home-therapy over a 3 year period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discussion of clinical efficacy

A formal dose-finding study has not been conducted with KIOVIG in this indication, and the mechanism of  IVIg  in  autoimmune  disorders  has  not  been  fully  elucidated.  However,  the  doses  chosen  for  the submitted  clinical  trials  are  in  line  with  available  recommendations  and  treatment  guidelines  and therefore are considered acceptable by CHMP.

CHMP noted that MMN is a chronic condition and patients  may  worsen  long  term,  hereby  requiring continuous therapy. Therefore, the concept of the presented clinical study reports to demonstrate that KIOVIG is efficacious in both treatment initiation and maintenance therapy was endorsed by the CHMP. However, the MAH chose an open-label design with a single treatment arm, arguing that the lack of active comparator was dictated by EU clinical practices. The CHMP commented that generally, in order to  obtain  an  unbiased  estimate  of  the  size  of  the  treatment  effect,  randomization  to  placebo  or  an active control group would be considered necessary; however, the difficulties in conducting placebocontrolled  MMN  trials  in  the  EU  were  acknowledged.  Given  the  open-label  study  design  of  the submitted studies with KIOVIG in MMN, the CHMP emphasized the need for a reliable endpoint in such a setting. Furthermore, the MAH was requested to further demonstrate how the potential risks of bias have been minimized. CHMP also requested the MAH to further justify the robustness of the clinical data provided (see below).

GCP  compliance  of  the  submitted  study  data  was  initially  questioned  by  the  CHMP.  During  the procedure, the MAH has provided further data to clarify the Committee's questions, and a separate declaration has been provided by the MAH confirming that the KIOVIG studies in MMN submitted with this application have been conducted in compliance with GCP principles.

CHMP  acknowledged  that,  given  the  rareness  of  the  condition,  a  sample  size  smaller  than  usually expected for confirmatory clinical trials might be acceptable.

With regard to the chosen outcome measures, the MAH clarified that the two primary endpoints were muscle strength (MRC sum score) and functional impairment (Guy's Neurological Disability Scale, Self Evaluation Scale) that were evaluated by the same investigator at all visits in order to reduce possible bias.  The  CHMP  concurred  that  muscle  strength  is  the  only  driver  of  disability  in  MMN  condition, therefore  an  evaluation  by  MRC  sum  score  is  an  acceptable  primary  outcome  measure.  MRC  sum scores are in widespread use in the published literature and routine clinical practice, although different numbers of muscle groups have been used in previous studies and a modified MRC scale (assessing only ten pairs of muscles) was chosen for the two presented clinical trials.

The MRC sum score was originally reported by Kleyweg et al. in 1991 (using 6 bilateral muscle groups) and has since been used in modified forms with up to 28 muscles in various other clinical studies in MMN. However, the CHMP expressed concerns that the MRC score assessing only 20 muscles as used by the MAH fails to take into account several distal motor functions which are considered important for impairment due to MMN, such as fist closure, and thumb abduction. This might cause difficulties with ensuring a comprehensive and clinically meaningful assessment of the treatment effect.

In their initial response, the MAH argued that additional testing of intrinsic hand muscles would not add any value, since these muscles were most likely to have suffered axonal damage and would be the least likely to respond to treatment. Neck muscles were not affected in MMN, therefore assessing these would be unessential. In the second response, the applicant submitted data showing that grip strength had improved in response to Kiovig administration. The CHMP considered the response on grip strength acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Addressing an initial concern from CHMP, the MAH confirmed during the procedure that the efficacy data for KIOVIG submitted with this application was collected from prospectively-designed studies. In addition,  the  MAH  detailed  a  number  of  precautionary  measures  which  were  undertaken  in  order  to minimize  bias  and  to  improve  quality  of  data  (e.g.  assessments  by  same  investigator  at  all  visits, analysis of ITT population, evaluation of 10 pre-defined muscle pairs). Furthermore, dynamometry was performed  in  selected  muscle  groups  and  the  results  provided  during  the  procedure;  the  data  is considered supportive for clinical improvement in the opinion of the CHMP.

Regarding the results of the MMN Conversion study, the CHMP had questioned whether the observation that  patients  remained  stable  after  switching  from  GAMMAGARD  to  KIOVIG  could  be  considered sufficient evidence, since efficacy in MMN treatment has not been established with GAMMAGARD so far. Therefore,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  longitudinal  data  from  both  studies  which  could demonstrate that muscle strength decreased when IVIg infusions were withheld.

Additional longitudinal data has subsequently been provided by the MAH for Study II in the treatment initiation setting (see below). There was no data documenting on- and off-treatment with KIOVIG from Study I since the study was not designed to assess such fluctuations. However, the MAH argued that considering that the treatment effect with IVIg lasts 5-12 weeks after an infusion (as shown in Study II), in case of loss of treatment effect, KIOVIG would have been shown to be ineffective, especially in the 2 year follow-up period, a result that was not observed in this study.

The efficacy of KIOVIG in treatment initiation was determined in 8 patients with MMN, whose treatment was  started  after  the  year  2007.  All  8  patients  experienced  improvement  in  muscle  strength  and functionality  following  initial  course  of  treatment  with  KIOVIG  (2  g/kg).  A  single  individual  did  not require continued treatment, while the remaining 7 patients receive continued KIOVIG treatment. The data  obtained  from  those  8  patients  were  compared  with  a  historical  control,  i.e.  patients  who  had received  their  initial  courses  with  GAMMGARD  S/D.  None  of  these  patients  were  non-responders  to KIOVIG. Based on the experience with IVIg in general, a response rate of approx. 80% to initial IVIg treatment is expected. The literature review provided by the company is supportive of the IVIg efficacy in MMN patients.

The lack of long-term follow-up data for patient no. 8 was noted. This data would have been helpful to better  understand  the  'natural  course  of  the  disease'  without  a  continuous  maintenance  treatment, especially as this is a single-arm study and no patients have been randomized to a control-group.

However, taken altogether, the Applicant provided sufficient longitudinal data to demonstrate a decline in  muscle  strength  after  cessation  of  both  KIOVIG  and  GAMMAGARD  infusions.  This  effect  has  also been observed with another IVIg preparation (Subcuvia). These data are considered supportive and the Applicant's argumentation is considered acceptable.

Given the available published literature on IVIg use in MMN, the MAH was asked to justify to which extent the efficacy data from other IVIg products could be extrapolated. The MAH provided a summary of  published  evidence  and  guidelines  from  various  learned  bodies  that  advocate  IVIg  as  first-line therapy  for  the  treatment  of  MMN  and  concluded  that  different  IVIg  preparations  -  despite pharmaceutical  differences  such  as  osmolality,  product  concentration  and  composition  -  can  be considered therapeutically equivalent, but may differ in safety profiles. Indeed, recommendations for off-label  use  of  intravenous  immunoglobulin  products  are  also  not  product-specific,  and  therefore suggest product interchangeability and therapeutic equivalence.

The  CHMP  concurred  with  the  Applicant's  argumentation  that  the  extrapolation  of  efficacy  data generated with different IVIg products could be supportive for the approval of KIOVIG in addition to the efficacy data specifically generated with KIOVIG.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  applicant  presented  data  on  use  of  IVIg  in  CIDP  as  supportive  for  the  current  application.  The presented CIDP study is considered by the CHMP as useful for a comparison of the safety of both IVIg preparations, but it is not considered adequate for making a conclusion on the efficacy of KIOVIG in MMN patients.

The  Applicant provided  during  the  assessment  data  from  the  Dutch  national  MMN  database demonstrate  that  IVIg  already  are  widespread  used  in  MMN  therapy.  The  data  are  considered supportive  for  the  high  acceptance  of  this  treatment  by  both  patients  and  treating  physicians. However, CHMP did not consider them adequate to draw conclusions on the efficacy of IVIg in MMN, especially when taking the remarkable number of clinically stable patients without IVIg treatment into account.

Based on the available data from the studies with KIOVIG and the supportive data published for other IVIg preparations, it can be accepted that sufficient evidence has been generated to show that KIOVIG is effective in the treatment of MMN. Overall, the available data is considered limited. The Committee noted that another clinical study is currently being conducted by the applicant (study 160604). This is a randomized placebo-controlled study using grip strength as primary endpoint. As of January 2011, 32  patients  have  completed  the  study  of  44  that  were  able  to  participate;  a  final  study  report  is expected  in  September  2012.  The  Committee  considered  it  important  to  review  these  data  once available  as  it  would  further  substantiate  the  available  data  from  prospective  clinical  trials  in  this indication. The MAH was therefore asked to provide this study report and also to commit to providing detailed safety and efficacy data from study 160604 in KIOVIG PSURs.

## Conclusion on the clinical efficacy

Overall,  results  for  KIOVIG  from  2  prospective  studies  with  this  product  and  supportive  data  from randomized, placebo-controlled MMN trials with other IVIg products provide evidence indicating that KIOVIG is effective in the treatment of MMN.

In  summary,  CHMP  considers  that  the  MAH  has  provided  data  obtained  from  prospectively  planned clinical trials, that the data comply with relevant EMA guidelines and that the data are of a standard that would support the current application. Acknowledging the limitations of the available efficacy data for KIOVIG in MMN the CHMP considers the results of the randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Study 160604) currently ongoing in the US as critical to corroborate the efficacy and safety of KIOVIG in the treatment of patients with MMN.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

In order to further substantiate the efficacy and safety of KIOVIG in the treatment of Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), the MAH shall submit the final Clinical Study Report of the ongoing randomized placebo-controlled study in MMN patients (Study 160604) by 30 September 2012.

## Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

In the EU, KIOVIG (ready to use solution for infusion) was approved for the indications of the Core SmPC on 19 January 2006. The safety and tolerability of KIOVIG in the currently approved indications is well established and are similar to those of other marketed IVIg products.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  estimated  patient  exposure  from  completed  studies  with  KIOVIG  in  MMN  (Study  I  +  II)  is summarized in the table below.

## Adverse events

In the MMN Conversion study 7 out of 19 patients (35%) reported side effects with 10% liquid IVIg. All events  were  classified  as  non-serious  and  included  skin  reactions,  fatigue  and  -  most  commonly  headache. One patient switched back to GAMMAGARD due to dizziness even with low infusion rates.

Data on Safety as reported in the Cochrane Database review on IVIg in MMN:

Adverse events reported following IGIV treatment in patients with MMN generally reflect safety data listed in the Core SmPC for IVIg as well as in the SmPC for KIOVIG that has been approved in Europe. The most common reactions are headache, rash, fever and shivering. Only 2 serious adverse events have been reported in literature (1 case of transient ischemic attack and 1 case of aseptic meningitis.)

Three  randomized,  controlled  studies  have  examined  the  safety  of  IVIg  products  for  short-term treatment of patients with MMN. With respect to long-term use of IVIg products in patients with MMN, safety data are available from four placebo-controlled clinical studies.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

Only two SAEs in MMN patients have been reported in literature (one case of transient ischemic attack, and one case of aseptic meningitis). No deaths were reported.

## Discussion of clinical safety

The  safety  and  tolerability  of  KIOVIG  for  the  currently  approved  indications  are  well  studied  and accompanied with substantial post-marketing safety database.

An analysis of controlled studies on IVIg therapy in MMN 10 estimated a pooled relative risk of adverse events for IVIg therapy compared to placebo of 10.33 (95% CI interval: 2.15-49.77).

Only limited data on safety for KIOVIG in MMN are available. The safety data reported in patients with MMN in published studies included all AEs listed in the current SmPC. Main reported AEs were skin rash, headache, dizziness, fever, shivering and fatigue. It is not expected that the AE profile for KIOVIG in MMN will significantly differ from that already known for immunoglobulin treatment from literature and what was seen with KIOVIG in clinical studies. Although the AE profile of IVIg also depends on dosage and infusion rates, neither more AE nor more severe AE have been seen with KIOVIG compared with GAMMAGARD in the MMN Conversion study. Equivalent safety profiles for KIOVIG and GAMMAGARD for maintenance treatment have even been reported in CIDP patients.

The applicant is currently conducting another clinical study in MMN patients (study 160604). This is a randomized  placebo-controlled  study  therefore  providing  additional  safety  data  for  this  patient population.  The  Committee  considered  it  important  to  review  these  data  once  available  as  it  would further substantiate the available safety data.

CHMP is of the opinion that adverse events reported following IVIg treatment in patients with MMN generally reflect the safety data listed in the Core SmPC for IVIg as well as in the SmPC for KIOVIG that is currently approved in Europe.

## Conclusion on clinical safety

The nature and frequency of adverse events reported by the applicant for KIOVIG when administered to  subjects  with  multifocal  motor  neuropathy  is  in  accordance  with  the  pattern  of  adverse  events described in the literature for other IVIg products. All adverse events are already included in the SPC.

Additional data on safety will be submitted by the applicant as part of the final Clinical Study Report that results from the ongoing randomised placebo-controlled study (study 160604) on use of KIOVIG in subjects with multifocal motor neuropathy. Study 160604 is expected to be completed in September 2012.

## Pharmacovigilance

## Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAH submitted a risk management plan (RMP).

## Overall conclusion and Benefit-risk assessment

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Multifocal motor neuropathy is a recently-described motor neuropathy with an incidence of (about) 6 per  million  people  and  that  affects  adults  in  the  age  range  20  to  55yrs.  Men  are  more  commonly affected than women. There are not any known pre-disposing factors and the underlying aetiology is uncertain. Motor nerves are affected in a piece-meal fashion leading to an asymmetric weakness that (in  about  70%  of  cases)  presents  with  weakness  of  the  intrinsic  muscles  of  a  hand.  Symptoms  are more evident than signs in the initial stages of the illness. The natural history of the disease is for slowly progressive weakness and atrophy of affected muscles with associated impaired quality of life.

Diagnosis of multifocal motor neuropathy is by a combination of a typical clinical history supplemented by nerve conduction studies and assessment of muscle strength. The presence of anti-GM antibodies may supplement the diagnosis.

Acceptable outcome measures of treatment of multifocal motor neuropathy would be increased muscle strength (of those muscles affected) and less functional disability associated with improved quality of life.

Evidence of benefit of treatment with IVIg is thus far limited. For this reason, all applications for IVIg in  the indication for multifocal motor neuropathy required to be accompanied by persuasive data on increased muscle strength in response to treatment.

In  the  present  application,  the  results  from  two,  prospective,  uncontrolled,  open-label,  investigatorinitiated  trials  were  submitted  showing  that  intermittent  intravenous  infusion  of  KIOVIG  in  (i)  the initiation  and  (ii)  maintenance of treatment of patients with multifocal motor neuropathy resulted in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

increased muscle strength (assessed by MRC scores, dynamometry and grip strength) and a reduction in reported disability (as assessed by the Guy's scale of disability and self-assessment).

The initiation trial involved 8 subjects who were naïve to treatment with IVIg. Patients received a fiveday course of KIOVIG at a cumulative dose of 2g/kg body weight. Maintenance doses for the 7 subjects entering  the  long-term  follow-up  phase  of  the  study  were  chosen  by  individual  response.  MRC  sum scores were measured at baseline, after the first full course of IVIg (cumulative dose 2g/kg) and after the last follow-up examination of the long-term treatment phase. Additionally, a descriptive analysis of the  response  to  KIOVIG  on  functional  impairment  (regarding  daily  life  activities)  was  presented  for each  of  the  eight  subjects.  Subjects  achieved  up  to  4  points  increase  in  MRC  score  in  response  to Kiovig treatment: response was persistent for the duration of the trial (12 months).

The maintenance trial involved 20 subjects who were transferred from GAMMAGARD s/d (an alternate IVIg  preparation  licensed  for  use  in  MMN  in  the  Netherlands)  to  KIOVIG  at  an  equivalent  dose. Treatment with KIOVIG was shown to maintain muscle strength for the duration of the conversion (9 months).

The  MAH also  submitted  a  review  of  published  literature  on  the  use  of  IVIg  in  the  management  of multifocal motor neuropathy.

The numbers of subjects enrolled into the two studies submitted were too small to consider sub-group analysis. The applicant justified not doing a comparator study on the grounds that cyclophosphamide (the only recognised comparator with reported efficacy) would be easy for investigator and subject to tell apart from KIOVIG on the basis of side-effects.

Overall, the data package provided was considered sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of KIOVIG in  MMN,  and  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  the  EMA  guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of IVIgs.

It was considered that additional data submitted by the applicant on the efficacy of KIOVIG use in CIDP and on the Dutch national database of subjects with multifocal motor neuropathy did not support the current application.

Furthermore,  the  MAH  provided  information  showing  that  home-infusion  of  KIOVIG  was  widely accepted by patients and that although only a minority self-infused, patients welcomed advantages of home-treatment such as time gain and convenience. Occurrence, frequency and severity of adverse events in home treated patients were comparable to those in the hospital setting.

As home IVIg administration has been in existence since the 1980s, and guidance material already exists, no additional risks associated with KIOVIG for MMN or any other indication foreseen, and risk minimisation activities are therefore not required. However, the available safety information on home infusion and criteria for patient selection should be included in the next RMP update.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The mechanism of action of IVIgs in MMN has not been elucidated, leaving an uncertainty as to the pharmacodynamics.  This  is  true  for  all  'immunomodulatory'  indications  and  therefore  more  basic research  would  be  of  essence.  Nevertheless,  the  use  of  IVIg  in  MMN  is  recommended  in  relevant treatment guidelines, and some efficacy data has been obtained for different formulations.

The data on the efficacy of KIOVIG for the treatment of patients with MMN was derived from two openlabel, single arm clinical trials. There was no dose finding study; however, dose and dosing intervals in the chronic immunomodulatory setting are generally tailored to the patient's needs. The open-label,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

uncontrolled nature of the two studies inherently did raise concerns regarding the robustness of the efficacy  data  submitted. Also there were uncertainties regarding the MRC score system used by the applicant  and  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  results  obtained.  However,  the  applicant  has  provided supplemental data on (i) dynamometry of large muscle groups and (ii) grip strength in response to treatment. These data did mitigate these uncertainties leading to the conclusion that the limited data are reasonable re-assuring.

There is lack  of  knowledge  of  the  long-term  use  of  KIOVIG  in  the  management  of  multifocal  motor neuropathy  (beyond  the  timescale  of  the  currently  submitted  trials)  and  whether  or  not  muscle weakness  may  remain  improved  or  continue  to  weaken  in  spite  of  treatment.  There  is  lack  of knowledge  on  whether  or  not  use  of  KIOVIG  would  prevent  involvement  of  motor  nerves  not  yet affected. Furthermore, there is lack of knowledge on the overall impact of KIOVIG on the long-term quality  of  life  and  long-term  survival.  However,  it  may  be  expected  that  knowledge  of  the consequences  of  long-term  use  of  KIOVIG  may  be  gathered  through  surveillance  during  market exposure.

Overall, it  is  considered  the  available  data  for  KIOVIG  in  MMN  that  is  specifically  generated  for  this product  is  limited;  the  data  is  supported  by  data  from  other  IVIg  preparations  which  was  deemed acceptable.  Overall,  the  available  data  is  considered  sufficient  for  granting  the  indication  but  this limitation  has  been  reflected  in  the  RMP  as  important  missing  information.  Consequently,  the  CHMP considers the results of the randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Study 160604) currently ongoing in the US as relevant to corroborate the efficacy and safety of KIOVIG in the treatment of patients with MMN.  The  provision  of  the  final  CSR  of  this  study  is  therefore  requested  as  a  condition  to  the marketing authorisation.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The  AE  reported  with  KIOVIG  in  patients  with  MMN  reflect  what  has  been  reported  with  KIOVIG  in other indications. Side effects were reported in 35% of patients and included skin reactions, fatigue and - most commonly- headache. All events were classified as non-serious and were reversible. All AE reported with KIOVIG in MMN patients are already listed in the SmPC.

Therefore  it  is  not  expected  that  the  use  of  KIOVIG  for  the  treatment  of  MMN  will  have  an  altered safety profile.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The safety database from completed clinical trials with KIOVIG in MMN only covers 20 patients and is therefore relatively small. However, the data as provided with this application as well as what is known from other IVIgs in the treatment of MMN does not indicate a relevant change in the safety profile.

The limited clinical  data  regarding  treatment  in  patients  with  MMN  has  been  identified  as  important missing  information  in  the  RMP.  Additional  safety  and  efficacy  data  will  be  provided  in  the  KIOVIG PSURs (reverted to 6 monthly cycle) as well as in the final CSR of the randomized, placebo-controlled study currently ongoing (Study 160604).

## Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

MMN is a rare, progressive debilitating disease that most commonly affects distal upper limb muscles. Though rarely fatal, the disease causes significant functional disability that interferes with daily activity such as independent eating, grooming, writing, opening and locking doors and holding objects. Any therapy  to  increase  muscle  strength  and  allow  the  patient  to  regain  independence  and  resume  a normal daily life is therefore essential.

In the last 10 years literature studies and case reports have repeatedly shown a benefit for the use of IVIgs in this condition. Generally, the response rate seen is around 75%; over time an increase in IVIg dose  may  become  necessary  to  maintain  the  desired  effect.  This  has  now  been  confirmed  by  a 'patchwork' approach of the company who submitted data with two forerunner products (Endobulin, GAMMAGARD)  and  their  current product (KIOVIG) in initiation and maintenance settings, a comprehensive analysis of the literature, and of the feasibility of extrapolation between products.

Alternative treatment options are limited. Patients with MMN rarely respond to treatment with steroids and plasma exchange and may even worsen. Mycophenolate mofetil is ineffective. Very limited data are available showing a weak positive effect of interferon and natalizumab, and a more positive effect with  rituximab.  Cyclophosphamide  appears  to  be  the  most  effective  treatment  apart  from  IVIg. However, long-term treatment with cyclophosphamide is restricted due to its safety profile and high toxicity.

Given that this is a chronic, progressive disease that affects young adults and that there is not any suitable,  alternate  treatment  then  the  increased  muscle  strength  and  lessened  disability  with associated  improved  quality  of  life  in  response  to  KIOVIG  is  considered  to  be  important  from  the clinical perspective. Moreover, since there is not at present an IVIg that is licensed across Europe for management  of  multifocal  motor  neuropathy  then  this  would  be  considered  to  be  a  product  that addresses an unmet medical need.

There are no high toxicity risks related to the use of IVIgs. In general they are well tolerated even if given  life-long  as  e.g.  in  replacement  therapy.  Risks  such  as  hypersensitivity  reactions,  aseptic meningitis, thromboembolic events, or renal failure are grave but rare and risk minimisation efforts are undertaken by the company to address these side-effects. The unfavourable effects of skin reaction, fatigue  and  headache  have  been  well  described  and  documented  for  KIOVIG  in  its  use  for  other indications and would not be considered to detract from the favourable effects.

## Benefit-risk balance

It  is  considered  that  the  increased  muscle  strength  in  response  to  KIOVIG  treatment  of  multifocal motor neuropathy and the potential for this increase  to  persist  over  time  with  associated  improved quality of  life  outweigh  both  the  negative  impact  of  adverse  effects,  as  described,  and  the inconvenience of needing to administer an intravenous preparation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment

There  remain  uncertainties  in  the  full  impact  of  treatment  muscle  weakness  of  multifocal  motor neuropathy with KIOVIG: it is anticipated that these uncertainties may be addressed by the ongoing randomised, controlled study being conducted in the USA.

There  is  uncertainty  in  the  ability  of  KIOVIG  to  maintain  increased  muscle  strength  over  time. Progressive  weakness  in  any  one  subject  would  lead  to  a  shift  in  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  that subject  with  further  treatment  being  considered  to  be  futile.  Since  subjects  receiving  KIOVIG  for management  of  multifocal  motor  neuropathy  will  be  under  continuing  physician  management  and review then it may be expected that the development of lack of response in any one subject to KIOVIG will be addressed promptly.

Overall, however, it is considered that the MAH has provided acceptable data to support the application for the use of KIOVIG in the indication for multifocal motor neuropathy. Against this background, the CHMP considered  that  the  benefit-risk-profile  for  KIOVIG  is  positive  for  the  treatment  of  multifocal motor neuropathy and that the current variation application is approvable.
