## Scientific conclusions

Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR(s)  for  deferasirox,  the  scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

## Acute pancreatitis

A total of 78 cases of acute pancreatitis in children with Exjade have been retrieved during the clinical review cumulatively. A total of 40 cases were excluded from analysis as they contained only hepatic events  or  non-specific  abdominal  pain,  without  a  diagnosis  of  pancreatitis  or  elevated  serum  lipase and/or  amylase.  Out  of  the  remaining  38  cases,  the  PRAC  observed  that  deferasirox  could  not  be excluded from potential causality in 3 cases.

Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)

During  the  reporting  period,  one  (1)  case  report  which  concerned  a  71  year-old  male  patient  with myelodysplastic  syndromes  (MDS),  who  developed  progressive  erythematous,  blistering  rash  with pustular component on the trunk four (4) weeks after commencing Exjade therapy, has been identified in the literature. Given the reviewed literature, causal association with deferasirox could not be ruled out.

Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information of medicinal products containing deferasirox were warranted.

The risk of TEN has been classified as an important identified risk Exjade EU RMP (V12).

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for deferasirox the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance  of  the  medicinal  product(s)  containing  deferasirox  is  unchanged  subject  to  the  proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
