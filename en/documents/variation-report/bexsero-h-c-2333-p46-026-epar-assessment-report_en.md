## Description

## Methods

## Objective(s)

## Primary Safety Objective:

-  To  assess  and  compare  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  a  single  dose  (booster)  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ administered to follow-on subjects approximately 4 to 7.5 years after a 2 dose primary series, with that of 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to vaccine naïve subjects according to a 0, 1 month schedule.

## Primary Immunogenicity Objective:

-  To  assess  serum  bactericidal  activity  at  approximately  4  to  7.5  years  following  a  2  dose  primary series (persistence) compared to serum bactericidal activity at baseline in vaccine naïve subjects.

## Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives:

-  To  assess  the  immune  response  at  1  month  after  a  third  dose  (booster)  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ administered  to  follow-on  subjects  approximately  4  to  7.5  years  after  a  2  dose  primary  series, compared to the immune response at 1 month after the first dose of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to vaccine naïve subjects according to a 0, 1 month schedule.
-  To assess and compare the changes over time in the immune response (kinetics) at 3, 7 and 30 days after a third dose (booster) of rMenB+OMV  NZ  administered  to  follow-on  subjects approximately 4 to 7.5 years after a 2 dose primary series, with that at 3, 7 and 30 days after the second dose of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to vaccine naïve subjects according to a 0, 1 month schedule.
-  To assess the immune response at 1 month after the second dose (primary series) of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to vaccine naïve subjects according to a 0, 1 month schedule.

## Exploratory Immunogenicity Objectives:

## The exploratory immunogenicity objectives are not reported in this CSR and will be reported in an addendum when the results are available.

The  immune  response  to  rMenB+OMV  NZ  may  also  be  evaluated  using  an  additional  panel  of N meningitidis serogroup  B  strains  (ie,  M14459  (fHbp),  96217  (NadA),  M07-0241084  (NHBA)  and NZ98/254, according to the following exploratory objectives.

- To evaluate serum bactericidal activity at approximately 4 years following a 2 dose primary series (persistence) in follow-on subjects from parent study V72\\_41.
- To evaluate the immune response at 3, 7 and 30 days after a third dose (booster) of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to follow-on subjects from parent study V72\\_41.
- To evaluate the immune response at 30 days after the first dose, and 3, 7 and 30 days after the second dose of  rMenB+OMV NZ administered to Canadian and Australian  vaccine naïve subjects according to a 0, 1-month schedule.

## Study design

The present study V72\\_75 was an extension trial from the parent studies V72\\_41 and V72P10. These are 2 key studies in the rMenB+OMV NZ program which enrolled adolescents aged 11 through 17 years; V72\\_41 enrolled subjects in Australia and Canada between August and September 2011 while V72P10 enrolled subjects in Chile between June 2008 and October 2009. In study V72P10, subjects were vaccinated with 2 rMenB+OMV NZ doses administered at a 0, 1 month, or 0, 2 month, or 0, 6 month schedules. In study V72\\_41, subjects were vaccinated with 2 rMenB+OMV NZ doses administered at a 0, 1 month schedule. The studies demonstrated robust response against the vaccine

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

antigens, absence of major safety concerns and supported the adoption of a 2-dose primary vaccine in adolescents with the 2 primary doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered with an interval of at least 1 month.

This present study V72\\_75 was a phase 3b, open label, multicenter, extension study in subjects from 15 to 24 years of age who were vaccinated with 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered at either a 0, 1 month, or 0, 2 month, or 0, 6 month schedules in study V72P10 and at a 0, 1 month schedule in study V72\\_41. A proportional number of healthy vaccine naïve subjects aged 15 to 24 years were to be enrolled at each site to serve as a descriptive comparator for safety, persistence, immune response and antibody kinetics of primary immunization with Men B at registered 0, 1 month schedule.

Data on kinetics of immune response against serogroup B strain would be of particular relevance in outbreak management, and vaccination of travelers.

## Study population /Sample size

A  preliminary  feasibility  assessment  suggested  that  400  follow-on  subjects  could  be  available  to participate  in  the  present  study  out  of  the  972  subjects  who  participated  in  studies  V72\\_41  and V72P10  and  929  subjects  who  completed  vaccinations  with  rMenB+OMV  NZ  according  to  a  2-dose schedule.

Additionally, approximately 250 vaccine naïve subjects (Groups B1 and B2), of the same age range as follow-on  subjects  (approximately  15  to  24  years  of  age)  were  also  to  be  enrolled  into  the  study. Vaccine naïve subjects were to be recruited in proportion to the expected recruitment in each of the countries participating in the parent studies. The expected approximate proportion was 5:2:1 for Chile, Canada and Australia, respectively.

In total up to 650 study participants were estimated to take part in this study: 400 follow-on subjects and 250 vaccine naïve subjects. A total of 531 subjects were actually enrolled into the study: 276 in the follow-on subjects group and 255 in the vaccine naïve group of similar age.

Overall,  the  sample  size  was  large  enough  to  reflect  important  variations  in  the  population  (see confidence intervals [CIs] for the primary endpoints in statistical analysis section), but small enough to accommodate  the  operational  constraints  common  to  extension  studies  (follow-on  subjects).  The sample  size  for  vaccine  naïve  subjects  allowed  for  an  acceptable  precision  in  the  estimation  of immunogenicity  responses,  with  particular  reference  to  kinetics  measurements  at  3  and  7  days postvaccination (at each of those time points only half of all the vaccine naïve subjects were to be assessed) and 30 days postvaccination. The sample size was also estimated to allow for reliable (&gt; 90% probability) observation of common ( ≥ 1%) AEs in the vaccine naïve subjects group.

From a perspective of detecting uncommon local or systemic AEs, with 250 subjects in the vaccine naïve group, the probability of observing at least one subject with an event for an underlying rate of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1% was 92%. Assuming 400 follow-on subjects were to be enrolled, the probability of observing at least one subject with an event for underlying rate of 1% was 98%.

## Treatments

- Follow-on  subjects  (Group  A):  included  up  to  400  eligible  subjects  who  had  received  2  doses  of rMenB+OMV  NZ  vaccine  in  the  parent  studies  (V72\\_41  and  V72P10),  received  no  subsequent meningococcal  group  B  vaccines,  and  who  were  to  receive  a  booster  dose  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ vaccine  in  the  current  study.  In  study  V72\\_41,  344  subjects  were  enrolled  to  receive  a  2-dose primary series of rMenB+OMV NZ at a 0, 1 month schedule. In study V72P10, 1631 subjects were enrolled to receive 1, 2 or 3 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ with different vaccination schedules. Only those who received 2 rMenB+OMV NZ doses administered at either a 0, 1 month, or 0, 2 month, or 0,  6  month  schedules  in  study  V72P10  (ie,  Groups  1a,  2b,  3b  in  parent  study)  and  received  no further meningococcal vaccine since then were to be invited to participate in the extension study V72\\_75.
- Vaccine naïve subjects (Groups B1 and B2): included approximately 250 subjects similar in age to subjects  in  the  follow-on  group,  who  had  not  previously  received  any  meningococcal  group  B vaccine, and who were to receive 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine, 1 month apart, in the current study. On day 1, subjects in this group were to be randomized into 2 different blood draw schedules according to a 1:1 ratio, as described in Table 2-2.

whileGroupAwasanalyzed as Group 3B.

Follow-on subjects meeting all eligibility criteria were to be enrolled in an open label way as shown in Table 2-2.

For follow-on subjects (Group A) the study comprised 4 visits and 1 safety follow-up call for a total of 5 visits over the course of approximately 1 month during which 1 dose of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine was to be administered and 4 blood samples were to be drawn.

All follow-on subjects were to receive a third dose (booster) of rMenB+OMV NZ at visit 1. Four blood samples were to be drawn from all follow-on subjects at visit 1 (ie, prior to rMenB+OMV NZ dose) and at visits 2, 3 and 5 (ie, approximately at 3, 7 and 30 days after the vaccination).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Vaccine naïve subjects meeting all eligibility criteria were to be enrolled in an open label way and randomized 1:1 to 1 of the 2 study groups (Group B1 or Group B2) as shown in Table 2-2. No age matching procedure between follow-on and vaccine naïve subjects was foreseen, but vaccine naïve subjects were to be enrolled in a similar age range as followon subjects, by country. Vaccine naïve subjects were to be enrolled at the same sites enrolling follow-on subjects so that vaccine naïve and follow-on subjects were drawn from populations of comparable geographical origin. Vaccine naïve subjects were to be enrolled in each participating country in proportion to the number of follow-on subjects who were expected to take part in this extension study.

For vaccine naïve subjects (ie, Groups B1 and B2, depending on blood draw schedule) the study comprised 4 visits and 2 safety follow-up calls for a total of 6 visits over the course of approximately 2 months, during which 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine were to be administered and 4 blood samples were to be drawn. A total of 3 diary reminder calls were to be performed over the course of 2 months ' study subject participation.

All vaccine naïve subjects were to receive a first dose of rMenB+OMV NZ at visit 1 and a second dose at visit 3 (1 month after the first dose). Four blood samples were to be drawn from all vaccine naïve subjects at visit 1 (prior to the first dose) and at visits 3, 4 and 6 (approximately at 1 month after the first dose, at 3 days [vaccine naïve Group B1] or 7 days [vaccine naïve Group B2] and 30 days after the second dose).

After receiving vaccination, subjects were to be observed for at least 30 minutes for any immediate adverse events (AEs). The subject parent(s)/legal guardian(s) were to be instructed to complete a subject diary daily to report solicited local and systemic AEs occurring from the day of each vaccination and for the following 6 days as well as to indicate if any analgesic/antipyretic to prevent or to treat pain/fever was taken after injection.

From the day of each injection and for the following 30 days, any unsolicited AE and related medication were to be collected. In addition to these safety data, all serious AEs (SAEs), all medications given to treat SAEs, and all AEs leading to vaccine/study withdrawal were to be collected during the entire study period, from day 1 (from signature of informed consent) through day 31 (study termination visit) for follow-on subjects, or from day 1 through day 61 (study termination visit) for vaccine naïve subjects. These data were to be captured through interviewing the subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) and by review of available medical records.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Safety Endpoints:

- The frequencies and percentages of subjects with solicited local (ie, injection site pain, erythema, swelling, induration) and systemic (ie, fever [temperature ≥ 38.0 ° C], high fever [temperature ≥ 39.5 ° C],  nausea,  fatigue,  myalgia,  arthralgia,  headache)  AEs  were  to  be  assessed  for  7  days (including the day of vaccination) after each vaccination;
- The frequencies and percentages of subjects with any unsolicited AEs for the 30 days (including the day of vaccination) after each vaccination.
- The  frequencies  and  percentages  of  subjects  with  any  SAEs,  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal,  and medically attended AEs throughout the entire study.

## Primary Immunogenicity Endpoints:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  The persistence of bactericidal activity was measured against N meningitides serogroup B indicator strains  H44/76,  5/99,  NZ98/254  and  M10713.  Data  were  to  be  summarized  by  calculating  the percentages  of  subjects  with  human  serum  bactericidal  assay  (hSBA) ≥ 1:4  (strains  5/99  and NZ98/254), ≥ 1:5 (strains H44/76 and M10713), ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:16; hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs); and geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of GMTs prevaccination versus GMTs at 1 month after the  last  dose  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  in  the  V72\\_41  and  V72P10  studies,  to  each  of  the  4  indicator strains.

Prevaccination  data  in  vaccine  naïve  subjects  served  as  a  comparator  to  evaluate  bactericidal activity 4 to 7.5 years post-second dose in follow-on subjects.

## Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints:

-   The immune response was measured against N meningitidis serogroup B indicator strains H44/76, 5/99, NZ98/254 and M10713. Data were to be summarized by calculating percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:4 (strains 5/99 and NZ98/254), ≥ 1:5 (strains H44/76 and M10713), ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:16; hSBA GMTs, GMRs of GMTs at 1 month postvaccination of a booster dose versus prebooster dose  (follow-on  subjects)  or  first  dose  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  versus  pre-first  dose  (vaccine  naïve subjects), to each of the 4 indicator strains.

Post-first  dose  data  in  vaccine  naïve  subjects  served  as  a  comparator  to  evaluate  response  to  a booster dose in follow-on subjects.

Additionally, data were to be summarized by calculating the percentages of subjects with a 4-fold rise at 1 month postvaccination with a booster dose (follow-on subjects) or first dose (vaccine naïve subjects) of rMenB+OMV NZ over prevaccination, to each and any 1, 2, 3 or all 4 indicator strains.

-   The  changes  in  serum  bactericidal  activity  over  time  (kinetics)  were  to  be  measured  against  N meningitidis  serogroup  B  indicator  strains  H44/76,  5/99,  NZ98/254  and  M10713.  Data  were summarized  by  calculating  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA ≥ 1:4  (strains  5/99  and NZ98/254), ≥ 1:5 (strains H44/76 and M10713; section 9.8), ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:16; hSBA GMTs, and GMRs of GMTs, at 3, 7, and 30 days postvaccination with a booster dose (follow-on subjects) versus pre-booster  dose  or  second  dose  (vaccine  naïve  subjects)  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  versus  pre-second dose, to each of the 4 indicator strains.

Post-second dose data in vaccine naïve  subjects served as a comparator to evaluate changes in bactericidal activity over time (kinetics) post-booster dose in follow-on subjects.

Additionally,  data  were  to  be  summarized  by  calculating  the  percentage of  subjects  with  4-fold  rise prevaccination compared to 3, 7 and 30 days postvaccination with a booster dose (follow-on subjects) or second dose (vaccine naïve subjects) of rMenB+OMV NZ, to each and any 1, 2, 3 or all 4 indicator strains.

- The induction of serum bactericidal activity in vaccine naïve subjects was to be measured against N meningitidis serogroup B indicator strains H44/76, 5/99, NZ98/254 and M10713. Data were to be summarized  by  calculating  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA ≥ 1:4  (strains  5/99  and NZ98/254), ≥ 1:5 (strains H44/76 and M10713; section 9.8), ≥ 1:8, and ≥ 1:16; hSBA GMTs, and GMRs of GMTs at 1 month after the second dose of rMenB+OMV NZ versus GMTs prevaccination, to each of the 4 indicator strains.

Additionally,  data  were  to  be  summarized  by  calculating  the  percentage of  subjects  with  4-fold  rise prevaccination  with  a  first  dose  compared  to  1  month  postvaccination  with  a  second  dose  (vaccine naïve subjects) of rMenB+OMV NZ, to each and any 1, 2, 3 or all 4 indicator strains.

## Exploratory Immunogenicity Endpoints:

The  exploratory  immunogenicity  endpoints  are  not  reported  in  this  CSR  and  will  be  reported  in  an addendum when the results are available

The immune response to rMenB+OMV NZ in both follow-on subjects from parent study V72\\_41 and vaccine naïve subjects from Canada and Australia might be also assessed by measuring bactericidal activity against N meningitidis serogroup B strains M14459, M07- 0241084, 96217, and NZ98/254 as follows:

## Follow-on subjects from parent study V72\\_41

- GMTs at baseline (pre-booster), 3, 7 and 30 days after the administration of a third dose (booster) of rMenB+OMV NZ
-  GMRs  at  3,  7  and  30  days  after  the  administration  of  a  third  dose  (booster)  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ, versus baseline (pre-booster)
- the percentage of subjects with hSBA titer ≥ Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLOQ); for each strain and for  all  strains  (composite  response)  at  baseline  (pre-booster),  3,  7  and  30  days  after  the administration of a third dose (booster) of rMenB+OMV NZ
-  The  percentage  of  subjects  with  4-fold  increase  in  hSBA  titers  relative  to  baseline  (prebooster) defined as:
- for a prevaccination titer &lt; 4, a postvaccination titer of at least 16;
- for a prevaccination titer ≥ 4 but &lt;LLOQ, a postvaccination titer of at least 4-fold the LLOQ;
- for a prevaccination titer ≥LLOQ, a postvaccination titer of at least 4-fold the prevaccination titer

## Vaccine naïve subjects from Canada and Australia

- GMTs at baseline and at 30 days after the first dose, then at 3, 7 and 30 days after the second dose of rMenB+OMV NZ
- GMRs at baseline and 30 days after the first dose, then at 3, 7 and 30 days after the administration of a second dose of rMenB+OMV NZ
-  the  percentage of subjects with hSBA titer ≥ LLOQ; for each strain and for all  strains (composite response) at baseline, 3, 7 and 30 days after the administration of a second dose of rMenB+OMV NZ, and 30 days after the first and the second dose of rMenB+OMV NZ
- the percentage of subjects with 4-fold increase in hSBA titers relative to baseline defined as:
- for a prevaccination titer &lt; 4, a postvaccination titer of at least 16;
- for a prevaccination titer ≥ 4 but &lt;LLOQ, a postvaccination titer of at least 4-fold the LLOQ;
- for a prevaccination titer ≥LLOQ, a postvaccination titer of at least 4-fold the prevaccination titer.

## Statistical Methods

There  was  no  statistical  hypothesis  associated  with  the  immunogenicity  or  safety  objectives.  The primary population for each of the immunogenicity associated analysis was to be the following:

- Persistence analyses for the primary immunogenicity objective were done using FAS (full analysis set).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- After booster/first dose analyses for the first secondary immunogenicity objective were done using FAS.
- Assessment  of  the  immune  response  kinetics  was  done  using  PPS  (per-protocol  set).  The assessment after 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ in the vaccine naïve group was performed on PPS.
- The exploratory analyses in the naïve group were to be performed on the FAS.

In  analyses where the vaccine naïve group (Group B1 and B2) served as a control to the follow-on subjects, adjusted GMTs were computed from a 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using PROC GLM with  factors  for  vaccine  group  and  country  and  the  ratios  of  GMTs  between  vaccinated  group  and vaccine naïve group were computed by exponentiating (base 10) the corresponding log-transformed difference  of  least  square  means  from  the  above  described  model.  In  calculating  the  difference  in percentages of subjects with response, the associated CI for the difference was constructed using the method of Miettinen and Nurminen.

Analyses  were  to  be  performed  on  V72\\_41  and  V72P10  follow-on  subjects  both  separately  and combined.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A  total  of  531  subjects  were  enrolled  into  the  study:  276  subjects  were  follow-on  subjects  (145 subjects from study V72\\_41 [Australia and Canada] and 131 subjects from study V72P10 [Chile]) who approximately  4  or  7.5  years  ago  had  received  2  rMenB+OMV  NZ  primary  series  doses  in  studies V72\\_41 and V72P10. A total of 255 subjects (105 subjects of similar age to those in V72\\_41 and 150 subjects  of  similar  age  to  those  in  V72P10)  were  vaccine  naïve  subjects.  All  except  for  1  follow-on subject were exposed to the booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ (Table 10.1-1).

## Baseline data

All  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  balanced  across  the  follow-on  and  vaccine  naïve subjects groups (Table 11.2-1). The mean age of the subjects enrolled into the study V72\\_41 was 18

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

± 1.88 years for the follow-on subjects and 17.5 ± 1.85 years for the vaccine naïve group; for study V72P10,  the  mean  age  was  21.2 ± 1.73  years  and  21.7 ± 1.56  years,  in  the  respective  groups. Among the enrolled subjects, in study V72\\_41, males were 55% in the follow-on group and 49% in the vaccine naïve group while in study V72P10, males were 48% in the follow-on group and 51% in the vaccine naïve group. The race of majority of subjects in study V72\\_41 was categorized as ' white ' , (68% in the follow-on group and 70% in the vaccine naïve group). The race of all of the subjects in study  V72P10  was  categorized  as ' other ' .  Among  the  overall  enrolled  subjects,  99%  met  the protocol-defined study entry criteria.

## Immunogenicity results

## Immune Response Persistence - (Primary Immunogenicity Objective)

Serum  bactericidal  activity  at  approximately  4  to  7.5  years  following  a  2-dose  primary  series (persistence) compared to serum bactericidal activity at baseline in vaccine naïve subjects.

Although  there  was  a  reduction  in  the  antibody  titers  approximately  4  or  7.5  years  after  a  2-dose primary  series,  persistence  of  the  immune  response  was  observed  in  the  follow-on  subjects  as indicated by:

Note:Resultsforstrains5/99andNZ98/254 arecomputedwitha cut-offofhSBA≥1:4;forstrainsH44/76andM10713withacut-offofhSBA≥1:5.

In the follow-on subjects, the percentages of subjects with hSBA titer of at least 4 and the hSBA GMTs after the last vaccination in the parent study were similar at 4 years (V72\\_41) vs 7.5 years (V72P10) across serogroup B indicator strains, except for the strain NZ98/254 for which the titers were higher (Table 2-3; Table 2-4).

Across  the  4  serogroup  B  indicator  strains,  the  highest  persistence  was  observed  for  strain  5/99, followed by strain M10713, strain H44/76, and strain NZ98/254, in that order (Table 2-3; Table 2-4).

## Assessor's comment:

Although  decreasing  for  all  strains  over  time,  immune  persistence  was  observed  4-7.5  years  after vaccination with 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ as demonstrated by GMT ratios (hSBA) &gt; 1 for all strains when comparing vaccinated and vaccine naïve subjects. However, the lower limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio for M10713 was below 1.

Of note and as demonstrated with hSBA titers measured in the vaccine naïve population, basal absolute GMT titers and rates for hSBA titer ≥ 4 in this population were highest for strain M10713, and there was little difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups for this antigen. Based on the GMT ratios for  hSBA  (vaccinated  individuals/naïve  individuals)  highest  persistence  of  immunogenic  response  was reached for strain 5/99 followed by H44/76, and was lowest for NZ98/254 and M10713 (table 2.4).

## Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives:

- 1) Immune response at 1 month after a third dose (booster) of rMenB+OMV NZ in follow-on subjects  approximately  4  to  7.5  years  after  a  2  dose  primary  series  compared  to  the immune  response  at  1  month  after  the  first  dose  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  administered  to vaccine naïve subjects according to a 0, 1 month schedule.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The immune response to a booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ in follow-on subjects at approximately 4 or 7.5  years  after  a  2-dose  primary  series  as  adolescents  was  higher  than  the  response  to  1  dose  of vaccine in vaccine naïve subjects of similar age as indicated by:

- The  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  titer  of  at  least  4  at  1  month  after  the  booster  dose  in follow-on subjects were higher than after a single vaccine dose in vaccine naïve subjects for all 4 indicator strains, ranging across the 4 strains from 94%-100% in Group 3B (V72\\_41) and 93%100% in Group 3B (V72P10). Comparatively, at 1 month following 1 dose of rMenB+OMV NZ in vaccine naïve subjects, responses were lower, ranging from 41%-87% in Group B\\_0\\_1 (V72\\_41) and 62%-92% in Group B\\_0\\_1 (V72P10) (Table 11.4.1-3).
- The hSBA GMTs achieved after booster in follow-on subjects were higher than after a single vaccine dose in vaccine naïve subjects for all 4 indicator strains. In V72\\_41 subjects, the GMRs in follow-on subjects ranged from 4.69 (for strain M10713) to 100 (for strain 5/99) while the GMRs in vaccine naïve  subjects  of  similar  age  ranged  from  2.37  (for  strain  M10713)  to  25  (for  strain  5/99). Similarly, in V72P10 subjects, the GMRs in follow-on subjects ranged from 5.16 (for strain M10713) to 64 (for strain 5/99) while the GMRs in vaccine naïve subjects of similar age ranged from 2.58 (for strain M10713) to 16 (for strain H44/76) (Table 11.4.1-4).

- Thus, administration of a booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ in previously primed subjects (follow-on group) showed a stronger immune response with higher increase of hSBA titers, as compared to the response to a first dose of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine in vaccine naïve subjects of similar age, inducing an anamnestic response (Table 11.4.1-3; Table 11.4.1-4).
- A  booster  dose  administered  4  years  (V72\\_41)  or  7.5  years  (V72P10)  after  the  last  vaccination induced a similar immune response (Table 11.4.1-3; Table 11.4.1-4).

## Assessor's comment:

The rate of subjects with hSBA titer ≥ 4 at 1 month after the booster dose in follow-on subjects were higher than after a single vaccine dose in vaccine naïve subjects for all 4 indicator strains. The same is observed for hSBA GMTs. The GMT ratios following booster compared to first dose indicate the presence of immunological memory (Table 11.4.1-4).

The strongest immune response  as evaluated by hSBA GMTs and an at least 4fold increase of hSBA titers reached one month after the booster dose were obtained for strain 5/99 followed by  H44/76 and were lowest for  NZ98/254 and  M10713.

- 2) Changes over time in the immune response (kinetics) at 3, 7 and 30 days after a third dose  (booster)  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  in  follow-on  subjects  approximately  4  to  7.5  years after a 2 dose primary series compared with that the immune response at 3, 7 and 30

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## days after the second dose of rMenB+OMV NZ in vaccine naïve subjects according to a 0, 1 month schedule.

-   For all 4 strains, the percentages of subjects with hSBA titer of at least 4 in follow-on subjects 3 days after receiving the booster dose were similar to those before vaccination, highly increased 7 days after vaccination and remained unchanged or further increased at 1 month after the booster dose (Table 11.4.1-6). In vaccine naïve subjects 3 days after receiving the second vaccine dose, the percentages of subjects with hSBA titer of at least 4 were similar compared with baseline, increased 7  days  after  vaccination  except  for  the  strain  M10713  which  remained  similar  to  day  4,  and remained unchanged or further increased at 1 month after the second vaccine dose (Table 11.4.16).

-   For all 4 strains, hSBA GMTs in follow-on subjects 3 days after receiving the booster dose remained similar  to  those  before  vaccination,  increased  7  days  after  vaccination  and  further  increased  or remained high at 1 month after the booster dose. In vaccine naïve subjects 3 days after receiving the second vaccine dose GMTs also remained similar to those at baseline, increased 7 days after vaccination and remained high at 1 month after the second dose. For all 4 strains hSBA titers at 1 month after booster were higher than at 1 month after the second dose in naïve subjects (Table 11.4.1-7).

Note: Group 3B subjects (follow-on subjects) -hSBA titers were measured at day 1 (pre booster dose), 3 days, 7 days and 1 month after booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ. Group B\\_0\\_1 subjects (vaccine naive subjects)-hSBA titers were measured at pre-second dose, 3 days, 7 days and 1 month after second dose ofrMenB+OMVNZ.

-   Across serogroup B strains and across vaccine groups, the percentages of subjects with at least 4fold increase were higher at 7 days and at 1 month after the booster dose in the follow on subjects compared than after the second dose in the vaccine naïve subjects (Table 14.2.1.2.2).

## Assessor's comment:

Booster  vaccination  4  to  7  years  after  a  two  dose  vaccination  schedule  with  rMenB+OMV  NZ  led  to strong increases of both hSBA titers and hsBA GMTs of all 4 strains as measurable 7 days and 30 days later. Best results were obtained for the strains H44/76, 5/99 and M10713 showing proportions of 98100%  for  individuals  with  hSBA  titers  ≥  4  after  the  booster  vaccination  (compared  to  94%  for  strain NZ98/254). The kinetics of these immune responses is in agreement with persisting immune memory 47.5 years following two priming doses.

Similar  observations  were  made  when  comparing  the  time  dependent  outcome  before  and  after  the second dose of vaccination. Also here, a strong increase in both hSBA titers and hsBA GMTs against all 4

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

strains  were measurable 7 days and 30 days later, although the increases were of a lower magnitude compared to the booster dose.

- 3) Immune response at 1 month after the second dose (primary series) of rMenB+OMV NZ administered  to  vaccine  naïve  subjects  according  to  a  0,  1  month  schedule.  A  robust immune response to a 2-dose primary series of rMenB+OMV NZ given 1 month apart was observed  in  vaccine  naïve  subjects  at  1  month  following  the  first  and  the  second rMenB+OMV NZ dose as indicated by:
-   At 1 month after the first dose, the percentages of subjects with hSBA titer of at least 4, ranged from 80% to 88% across strains H44/76, 5/99 and M10713, and was 53% for strain NZ98/254 (Table 11.4.1-8). The hSBA GMT titers increased 16- and 20-fold over baseline for strains H44/76 and 5/99, and 5.07- and 2.56-fold over baseline for strains NZ98/254 and M10713, all respectively (Table 11.4.1-9).

- At  1  month  after  the  second  dose,  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  hSBA  titer  of  at  least  4, ranged  from  93%  to  99%  across  strains  H44/76,  5/99  and  M10713,  and  was  80%  for  strain NZ98/254 (Table 11.4.1-8). The hSBA GMT titers increased 46- and 156-fold over baseline for strains H44/76 and 5/99, and 11- and 3.23-fold over baseline for strains NZ98/254 and M10713, respectively  (Table  11.4.1-9).  The  percentages  of  subjects  with  at  least  a  4-fold  hSBA  titer increase were 95% and 97% for strains H44/76 and 5/99, and were 67% and 35% for strains NZ98/254 and M10713, all respectively (Table 11.4.1-10).

Thus, 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine administered 1 month apart to vaccine naïve subjects 15 through 21 years of age induced an overall robust antibody response against all strains with evidence of an early response observed already at one month after the first dose.

## Assessor's comment:

Overall, strong immune responses were observed for all 4 strains after the second dose and after booster vaccination as reflected in high rates of individuals showing hSBA titers of ≥ 4 in both cases. Of note, rates of individuals showing hSBA titers ≥ 4 latest 30 days after the second vaccination remained clearly lower for the strains NZ98/254 (79-82%) and M10713 (90-96%) compared to the other two strains and the outcome observed after booster vaccination. The lower response of NZ98/254 and M10713 after the second vaccination is also reflected in a lower rate of individuals reaching an at least 4 fold increase in hSBA titers after the second vaccination compared to the other two strains.

In general, higher GMTs were reached by booster vaccination compared to the second vaccination dose for all four strains. This observation is especially pronounced for strain 5/99 as reflected in both very high GMTs and GMRs after the booster vaccination and weakest for strain M10713.

## Safety results

-   A total of 530 (&gt;99%) subjects out of enrolled 531 subjects were exposed to the study vaccine and were included in the overall safety set (Table 12.1-1).

-   Solicited  local  AEs  were  reported  in  258  (97%)  follow-on  subjects  and  247  (98%)  vaccine  naïve subjects after the first dose and 226 (91%) vaccine naïve subjects after the second dose (Table 25). Pain was the most common solicited local AE reported after each dose in both groups (Table 12.2.3-1).  Most  of  the  reported  solicited  local  AEs  after  either  dose  of  vaccine  were  mild  to moderate in intensity with onset 6 hours to day 3 after vaccination, that resolved within 7 days.

## Assessor's comment:

The majority of individuals experienced solicited AEs in the included study arms, which were mainly of mild  to  moderate  intensity,  and  resolving  within  a  week.    AE  frequencies  were  comparable  between individuals obtaining 2 doses of vaccination and individuals obtaining the booster dose. The majority of AEs  observed  in  both  groups  of  individuals  were  typical  as  described  for  meningococcal  vaccines including local (pain, erythema, induration and swelling) and systemic reactions such as fever, headache, arthralgias and myalgias.

Thus, no new safety concern is detected here.

- Unsolicited AEs were reported by 87 (32%) follow-on subjects after the booster dose, 96 (38%) vaccine naïve subjects after the first dose and 73 (29%) vaccine naïve subjects after the second dose,  with  45  (16%),  58  (23%),  and  43  (17%)  subjects  in  respective  groups  having  at  least possibly related unsolicited AEs (Table 2-6).

The most commonly  affected system organ classes (SOCs) were 'general disorders and administration site conditions' and 'infections and infestations' while the most common unsolicited AE  by  preferred  term  were  injection  site  pain  and  viral  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (Table 12.2.3-3; Table 12.2.3-4). Most of the unsolicited AEs were mild to moderate in intensity, and most of them resolved before study termination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-   One vaccine-naïve subject, after the first dose had AEs (lymphadenopathy and herpangina) leading to  premature  withdrawal  from  the  study.  One  vaccine  naïve  subject  had  an  SAE  (severe appendicitis)  after  the  first  dose  that  was  considered  as  unrelated  to  the  study  vaccine  by  the investigator.

No death was reported in the study (Table 2-6).

## Assessor's comment:

32%  and  38%  of  individuals  reported  unsolicited  AEs  after  the  booster  dose  and  after  the  second vaccination, respectively,  with  'general disorders and administration site conditions' and 'infections and infestations' as most commonly affected system organ classes (SOCs) and 'injection site pain' and 'viral upper respiratory tract infection' as most common preferred terms.

Scrutinization  of  the  AE  related  original  data  submitted  for  the  SOCs  'Nervous  system  disorders'  and 'Immune  system  disorders'  revealed  diagnoses/PTs  of  more  general  character  including  dizziness, headache, paresthesia, involuntary muscle contraction and allergy.

No deaths were reported.

In summary no new safety concern arose from the reported unsolicited AEs.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Although clearly falling over time, immune persistence was observed for all 4 strains 4-7.5 years after vaccination  with  2  doses  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  as  demonstrated  by  GMT  ratios  (hSBA)  &gt;  1  when comparing vaccinated and vaccine naïve subjects. Highest persistence of immunogenic response was reached for strain 5/99 followed by H44/76, and NZ98/254. Immune persistence for strain M10713 is likely a result of high abundant basal GMTs as shown in the vaccine naïve population.

Strong booster induced immune responses  were observed in individuals treated with the third vaccine dose 4-7.5 years after dose 1 and 2. This is reflected in a high proportion of subjects showing hSBA titer ≥ 4 one month after the booster vaccination compared to vaccine naïve individuals treated for the first  time  with  the  vaccine.  Strongest  effects  were  reached  for  strain  5/99  and  H44/76,  lower immunogenicity was observed for  NZ98/254 and M10713.

Strong immune responses were also observed after the second dose of vaccination as reflected in high rates  of  individuals  showing  hSBA  titers  of ≥ 4  latest  after  30  days.    Of  note,  rates  of  individuals showing hSBA titers ≥ 4  latest  30  days  after  the  second vaccination remained clearly lower for the strains  NZ98/254  (79-82%)  and  M10713  (90-95%)  compared  to  the  other  two  strains  and  to  the outcome  observed  after  booster  vaccination.  In  congruence  to  this  observation,  lower  rates  of individuals reaching an at least 4 fold increase in hSBA titers after the second vaccination as especially seen for NZ98/254 and M10713 after the second vaccination.

In general, higher GMTs were reached by booster vaccination compared to the second vaccination dose for all four strains. This observation is especially pronounced for strain 5/99 as reflected in both very high GMTs and GMRs after the booster vaccination and weakest for strain M10713.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No  significant  differences  in  the  principle  antibody  kinetics  1  to  30  days  after  vaccination  were observed when comparing the behaviour of antibody titers after the second vaccine dose and after the booster  dose.  A  greater  increase  in  GMT  and  response  rates  were  seen  after  the  booster  dose compared to the priming doses.

Reported AEs reflected the known side effect profile of the vaccine. Thus, no new safety concern was observed with regard to the solicited and unsolicited AEs reported in the frame of the study.

In summary a strong booster effect is observed by the application of the third dose on all 4 strains. The  booster  effect  appears  to  be  especially  valuable  for  the  immunogenicity  against  the  strains NZ98/254 and M10713, which appear to show the lowest immunogenic response to the vaccine after the second dose and the strongest decrease of immune persistence.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

With  the  submission  of  the  current  report  the  commitment  is  considered  fulfilled.  The  MAH  should further discuss to what extent these data should be implemented in the SmPC.

## Fulfilled:

Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  provide  a  further  discussion  to  what  extent  the observations made with regard to long persistence and effect of late booster vaccination should be reflected in the SmPC as part of this procedure. (see section 'Additional clarification requested')

The  response  of  the  MAH  to  the  question  posed  as  documented  in  section  4  is  endorsed  and  the commitment, thus, completely fulfilled.

## 4. Additional clarification requested

Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  address  the  following  questions  as  part  of  this procedure:

The MAH is requested to discuss to what extent the observations made with regard to long persistence and effect of late booster vaccination should be reflected in the SmPC.

The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

## MAH responses to Request for supplementary information

The  Company  acknowledges  the  Assessor ' s  request  and  would  like  to  inform  the  Agency  that  an internal evaluation of the data generated with the paediatric study V72\\_75 is still on-going. We are defining how the data should be adequately reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics and the current plan is to submit a type II variation for Bexsero later this year.
