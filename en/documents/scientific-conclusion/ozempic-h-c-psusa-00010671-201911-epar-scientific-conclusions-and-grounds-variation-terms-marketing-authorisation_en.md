## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for semaglutide, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In the clinical studies, hypersensitivity events (e.g., urticaria, rash) considered causally related by investigator were reported in 0.3% of patients receiving semaglutide.

Further, the MAH has presented 4 post-marketing reports of 'hypersensitivity' supporting a causal relationship with semaglutide. The cases have a causal temporal relationship and a positive rechallenge. No confounding factors have been identified.

Based on the information provided it is agreed that these cases reflect a causal relationship between semaglutide and hypersensitivity reactions and it is therefore agreed to update the product information accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for semaglutide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing semaglutide is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
