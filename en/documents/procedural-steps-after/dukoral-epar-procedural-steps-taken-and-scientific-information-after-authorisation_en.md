| II/0045 | Update of sections 4.6 and 5.1 of the SmPC to include effectiveness data from two vaccination campaigns (in Mozambique and Zanzibar). Furthermore the MAH took the opportunity of this variation to revise section 4.2 to add the possibility to use chlorinated water to prepare the buffer solution (used in the Mozambique vaccination campaign, according to WHO guidance) and to clarify information regarding the booster for children. Minor changes are made throughout the Product Information which is also updated according to the QRD template version 9.

The data are considered valuable from a public health perspective in areas where cholera may be epidemic. No significant harmful effects of non-intended gestational exposure to Dukoral were detected in the vaccination campaign in Zanzibar. The Product Information has been updated to reflect these data, as well as the possibility to use chlorinated water to prepare the buffer solution . |
