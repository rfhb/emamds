1 Notifications are issued for type I  variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II  variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II,  labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0029   | Update of section 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update the pharmacokinetic properties information based on the final results from study 20120324, a phase 2, multicenter, single-arm trial to evaluate the biodistribution and shedding of talimogene laherparepvec in subjects with unresected,stage IIIB to IVM1c melanoma.This submission fulfils MEA 006.1. The RMP is updated accordingly (final consolidated version 6.0). In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH)took the opportunityto update Annex II as per the alreadyassessed EMEA/H/C/002771/ANX/001 procedure.In addition, the MAH took the opportunityto update the details of local representatives for Ireland and Portugal in the package leaflet. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 28/03/2019   | 06/06/2019 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | The biodistribution and shedding of intralesionally administered talimogene laherparepvec were investigated in a clinical studythat measured talimogene laherparepvec DNA in blood, urine, injection site, exterior of the occlusive dressings, oral mucosa, anogenital area,and suspected herpetic lesions. Sixty patients with melanoma received Imlygic intralesional injection and talimogene laherparepvec DNA was present in all sites during the study. No samples had detectable talimogene laherparepvec DNA 30 days after the end of treatment in blood, urine, oral mucosa, and anogenital area and no samples had detectable talimogene laherparepvec DNA60 days after end of treatment in injected lesions. Overall 3 of 19 patients with lesions of suspected herpetic origin had talimogene laherparepvec DNApresent at any time during the study. No viral activitywas detected in samples of the occlusive dressings, oral mucosa, anogenital area,and suspected herpetic lesions. Infectious talimogene laherparepvec virus was detected at the site of injection in 7 (11%) patients at multiple time points in the study; no samples were positive for viral infectivity after cycle 2 or after the end of treatment. |
