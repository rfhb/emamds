## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

Medicinal product no longer authorised 2.1 Introduction An influenza pandemic is a global outbreak of influenza disease that occurs when a type A influenza strain to which a high proportion of the world's population is immunologically naïve emerges. In April 2009, a new strain of human influenza A(H1N1)v was identified and characterised. On 11 June 2009 the WHO declared Phase 6 of the influenza pandemic. The declaration reflected sustained transmission of the virus from person to person in several WHO regions. WHO and other international agencies are calling  the  disease  pandemic  (H1N1)v  2009.  For  the  virus  the  nomenclature  influenza  A(H1N1)v (where v indicates variant) has been chosen. Estimates  for  the  attack  rates  associated  with  the  influenza  A(H1N1)v  virus  have  varied  from approximately  10-50  %  in  different  geographical  areas.  The  actual  numbers  of  clinically  apparent infections,  cases  that  require  hospitalisation  and  deaths  in  the  pandemic  period  is  expected  to  be higher  than  in  recent  years  for  seasonal  influenza.  These  estimates  may  change  (upwards  or downwards) during the further course of the pandemic. Hospitalisation and deaths have occurred in previously  healthy  subjects  as  well  as  in  those  with  underlying  conditions  or  pregnancy  that  would predispose them to complications of influenza. For more information about the known clinical features of the disease caused by influenza A(H1N1)v virus please see the Risk Assessment report from ECDC under: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/Documents/0908\\_Influenza\\_AH1N1\\_Risk\\_Assessment.pdf Humenza  is  based  on  the  proposed  new  strain  A/California/7/2009  (H1N1)v  like  strain  (X-179A), which  complies  with  the  WHO 1 and  CHMP 2   recommendations  for  the  emergent  novel  A(H1N1)v influenza  vaccine  composition.  The  candidate  vaccine  contains  a  novel  adjuvant  AF03  (oil-in-water emulsion, squalene based). The development programme/Compliance with CHMP Guidance/Scientific Advice Before  the  current  pandemic  was  declared,  two  clinical  programs  were  independently  developed  for Europe  and  the  US  for  investigational  vaccines  containing  H5N1  inactivated  split  influenza  virus produced in eggs according to the seasonal influenza vaccine production process either established in France  (Vaxigrip)  or  in  the  USA  (Fluzone).  Both  investigational  vaccines  contained  the  novel  AF03 adjuvant. A series of non-clinical pharmacological and toxicological studies were conducted with the AF03 adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine.

<!-- image -->

Subsequently the applicant initiated non-clinical and clinical studies with a candidate H1N1v/AF03 vaccine. As laid down in interim guidance (EMEA/CHMP/323452/2009) the H1N1/AF03 candidate vaccine was considered as new vaccine containing an adjuvant which is not yet approved in any EU authorised vaccine. Although a full clinical data package including safety studies would ultimately have to be provided the guidance made provision for the data to be assessed in an emergency rolling review procedure.

ETF Scientific Advice on the non-clinical and clinical development of the candidate H1N1v/AF03 vaccine was provided on 12.06.2009. Based on the briefing document submitted by Sanofi Pasteur on 22 May 2009 prior to obtaining this advice the CHMP advised the company to provide all available non-clinical

2 EU recommendation for the emergent novel H1N1 influenza vaccine composition (EMEA/CHMP/BWP/3408312009 Rev 1) http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/bwp/34083109enrev1.pdf

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and  clinical  data  generated  for  the  H5N1  AF03  adjuvanted  vaccine  since  these  data  would  be considered supportive for the candidate H1N1v/AF03 vaccine.

## General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP

The  clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  the  quality  standards  of  the  International Conference  on  Harmonisation  (ICH)  guidelines  for  Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP)  and  reflected  the requirements of the EMEA guidance.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

Medicinal product no longer authorised Introduction The  A/H1N1  Pandemic  Influenza  Vaccine  is  indicated  for  prophylaxis  of  influenza  in  an  officially declared pandemic situation. The active substance consists of an A/California/7/2009 (NYMC X-179A) (H1N1)  strain  cultivated  on  embryonated  hens'  eggs,  then  purified,  split  with  octoxynol-9,  and inactivated with formaldehyde. The A/H1N1 Pandemic Influenza Vaccine is a suspension and emulsion for  injection:  extemporaneous  mixture  of  A/H1N1  Pandemic  Influenza  Vaccine  with  squalene  based AF03  Adjuvant  to  be  administered  by  intramuscular  route.  The  dosage  obtained  is  3.8 μ g  of hemagglutinin  per  human  dose  of  0.5  mL.  Since  the  final  product  is  a  10  dose  type  I  glass  vial, thiomersal has been included in the formulation as a preservative. About the product: The manufacturing process for the A/H5N1 drug substance monovalent bulk as well as for the A/H1N1 antigen rely on the process licensed for seasonal influenza vaccine Vaxigrip. AF03 is a novel squalene based  adjuvant,  which  is  currently  not  approved  as  an  integral  part  for  any  vaccine  or  any  other medicinal product in Europe. Hence, the AF03 adjuvant and its formulation into the final vaccine is also a prominent new aspect to be dealt with for vaccine registration, and full quality data for all vaccine components is required. Humenza is a 2-component vaccine consisting of inactivated split virion (H1N1) antigens (suspension) presented in a type I glass vial (10 doses) and of the AF03 adjuvant (emulsion) presented in a type I amber glass vial (10 doses). At the time of vaccine administration, the content of the antigen vial is withdrawn with a syringe and is injected into the AF03 adjuvant vial. The mixed vaccine is a whitish emulsion  containing  10  individual  vaccine  doses  of  0.5mL.  As  the  final  product  is  a  multidose  vial, thiomersal has been included in the formulation as a preservative in the antigen vial. Humenza is indicated for the prophylaxis of pandemic influenza caused by the H1N1 strain and should be used in accordance with official guidance. Composition: HUMENZA consists of two vials: one vial containing the antigen (suspension) and one vial containing the adjuvant (emulsion), which are mixed prior to administration. After mixing, 1 dose (0.5ml) contains: Split influenza virus*, inactivated containing antigen equivalent to: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like strain (NYMC X-179A).......................................3.8 micrograms** * propagated in eggs ** expressed in microgram haemagglutinin

This vaccine complies with the WHO recommendation and EU decision for the pandemic.

AF03 adjuvant composed of squalene (12.4 milligrams), sorbitan oleate (1.9 milligrams), polyoxyethylene cetostearyl ether (2.4 milligrams) and mannitol (2.3 milligrams)

The suspension and emulsion, once mixed, form a multidose vaccine in a vial. Excipients:

The vaccine contains 11.3 micrograms thiomersal.

## List of Excipients:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Antigen vial:

Thiomersal Sodium chloride Potassium chloride Disodium phosphate dihydrate Potassium dihydrogen phosphate Water for injections

## Adjuvant vial:

Sodium chloride Potassium chloride Disodium phosphate dihydrate Potassium dihydrogen phosphate Water for injections

Medicinal product no longer authorised Chemical composition of AF03 AF03  is  a  squalene  based  oil-in-water  emulsion.  There  are  other  squalene  oil-in-water  adjuvanting emulsions licensed in other influenza vaccines (e.g. AS03 and MF59). Squalene is a natural component of cell membranes, an intermediate in the human steroid hormone biosynthetic pathway and a precursor of cholesterol. Consequently, squalene is both biodegradable and biocompatible, since it is a normal component of the human body. The nature of the AF03 Adjuvant with other known squalene-based adjuvants has been discussed at the BWP. Although they all are squalene based oil in water emulsions it has been pointed out that from a quality perspective there are differences in the manufacturing procedure, the composition and the resulting particle size. It is not known to what extent extrapolation of safety based on these quality data can or cannot be made. Active Substance H1N1 Antigen The monovalent bulk is an aqueous suspension of inactivated, split viral particles that were propagated in embryonated eggs and purified by zonal centrifugation. The reference virus described in the current dossier  is  A/California/7/2009  (NYMC  X-179A)  which  was  developed  by  NYMC  (New  York  Medical College)  using  reassortment  between  A/California/7/2009  and  A/New  York/55/2004  (NYMC  X-157) (H3N2), generated by NYMC and supplied by CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The reassortant strain combines the H1 and N1 segments of A/California/7/2009 with the X-157 backbone.  Manufacture The manufacturing process of the monovalent bulk is almost identical to the manufacturing process of Sanofi Pasteur's seasonal influenza vaccine and can be divided into the following steps: -Propagation of the A/H1N1 influenza viral strain in embryonated eggs, harvesting and pooling of the allantoic fluids -Purification of the whole virus bulk by several zonal centrifugation steps -Splitting of the monovalent with octoxynol-9

<!-- image -->

- -Inactivation of the monovalent split virus with formaldehyde, followed by sterile filtration

In general, the manufacturing process is well known from the seasonal influenza vaccine.

The  production  process  for  monovalent  bulks  is  adequately  described.  Control  of  starting  materials (virus  seed  lots,  eggs  and  raw  materials)  is  on  the  whole  acceptable.  Routine  in-process  tests conducted are described.

Data from 3 production batches demonstrates the capability of the purification process to reduce levels of ovalbumin and retain the HA antigen. The reduction of neomycin sulphate to acceptable levels has

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

been shown through process validation studies. Data from validation of the splitting step have been provided and are acceptable.

Data  have  been  provided  to  show  the  capability  of  the  inactivation  process  to  inactivate  X-179A produced from 2 working seed lots, ALV and mycoplasmas.

The  Company  has  shown  that  inactivation  kinetics  provided  for  A/Brisbane/59/2007  represents  a worse-case and thus are relevant for A/California/7/09 and other A strain influenza viruses. The data shows that all strains were inactivated after 25 hours following splitting and thus that the inactivation step is sufficient to ensure that all A/California/7/09 (NYMC X179A) is inactivated following standard manufacturing conditions.    The  inactivation  process  was  assessed  on  six  monovalent  bulk  industrial batches A/California/7/2009 (H1N1).

In addition, the Applicant has provided data from a third batch of MVB to demonstrate consistency of the inactivation process.

Medicinal product no longer authorised All characterization of the antigen drug substance is carried out through release tests on MSL, WSL or monovalent bulk. The tests performed to characterize seed lots and monovalent bulks focus on the HA and  NA  proteins  and  tests  for  impurities.  The  characterization  tests  proposed  are  acceptable.  The Applicant has shown that the RT-PCR assay for HA and NA applied to MSL and WSL is valid for use on X-179A batches and is specific for A/California/7/2009. Materials  of  synthetic  or  biological  origin  (fertilized  SPF  eggs,  embryonated  eggs)  are  adequately controlled. Control of the A/California/7/2009 (NYMC X-179A) (H1N1) reference virus is performed by the WHO collaborative centers which provides the virus. The virus seed lot system is well described and includes the process for generation of new working seed lots. Purification, splitting and inactivation have been identified as critical steps and are well controlled. Process validation data have been provided to demonstrate removal of the product-related impurity, ovalbumin. Ovalbumin levels are also checked in release testing of antigen final bulk. Octoxynol-9 is a process related impurity which arises from splitting. Formaldehyde is a process-related impurity arising from inactivation. Levels of formaldehyde are controlled on release testing of final bulk product. Ovalbumin,  octoxynol-9  and  formaldehyde  have  been  identified  as  the  major  product  related  or process  related  impurities  and  specifications  have  been  set  where  appropriate.  The  Applicant  has provided details of impurities and the proposed testing strategy for each impurity. The impurity testing proposed is appropriate.  Specification Release specifications for the antigen monovalent bulk comply with Ph. Eur. 0158. Tests are conducted for  HA  content  and  identity,  neuraminidase  antigenicity  and  identity  (first  3  batches  only),  sterility, residual infectious viruses, and octoxynol-9 content. The Applicant has provided suitable justification for  the  specifications.  Methods  of  analysis  are  acceptable  overall.      The  biological  properties  of  the monovalent bulk are mainly linked to the hemagglutinin and secondarily to the neuraminidase antigens which originate from the influenza strain. The antigenic property of the monovalent bulk is supported mainly by the hemagglutinin antigen. The hemagglutinin content of each monovalent bulk is assayed by Single Radial Diffusion (SRD) in compliance with European Pharmacopoeia monograph 0158. Data from 3 batches of H1N1 drug substance have been provided. The batches met the acceptance criteria. Sufficient  validation  data  is  provided  regarding  the  following  procedures:  Hemagglutinin  content, Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase identification and octoxynol-9 content. The applicant shows batch analysis results for three consecutive industrial scale batches of the monovalent bulk. Test results for all the batches meet the specifications.

The Applicant provides brief details of the stainless steel containers or polypropylene containers used to store MVB antigen. The container/closure system is identical to that used for the MVB storage of season influenza vaccine. Evidence of compliance with CPMP/QWP/4359/03 (Guideline on plastic immediate packaging materials) has been provided with representative certificates of analysis demonstrating compliance with specifications.

##  Stability

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  Applicant  provided  information  on  stability  studies  to  be  conducted.  Batches  will  be  tested  for appearance, pH and HA content after storage for 24 months at 5°C±3°C or 30 days at +25°C±2°C  o C. Acceptance  criteria  have  been  set  for  these  parameters  and  are  acceptable.  Assurance  has  been provided  that  stability  studies  will  be  conducted  with  both  stainless  steel  and  plastic  carboys.  The Applicant has provided a commitment to complete the ongoing stability studies and has additionally committed  to  provide  data  to  the  Regulatory  Authorities  as  it  becomes  available  and  inform  the Regulatory Authorities of any out-of-specification results.

Data  for  3  batches  of  MVB  stored  at  +5°C  ±  3°C  for  3  months  are  presented.  Further  data  from seasonal batches of influenza vaccine stored for 12 months at 5°C±3°C to support the proposed shelflife  for  H1N1 antigen filled product of 12 months at 5°C±3°C have been provided. A shelf-life of 12 months at 5°C±3°C  o C is acceptable for H1N1 antigen filled product.

Medicinal product no longer authorised AF03 Adjuvant Bulk The Adjuvant AF03 Bulk is a concentrated oil-in-water emulsion containing 32.5 % (w/w) of squalene. The  adjuvant  is  prepared  by  a  Phase  Inversion  Temperature  (PIT)  process  used  to  form  a  stable emulsion  with  a  mean  droplet  size  below  100  nm.  The  emulsion  is  stabilized  by  two  non-ionic surfactants, SO (sorbitan oleate) (hydrophobic surfactant) and PCE (polyoxyethylene cetostearyl ether) (hydrophilic surfactant).  Manufacture of adjuvant bulk The  Applicant  has  indicated  which  sites  are  used  to  manufacture  AF03  adjuvant  bulk  and  GMP certificates have been provided. The manufacturing process consists of three main parts: -Preparation of the aqueous phase; -Preparation of the oily phase; -Emulsification by phase inversion temperature process. The  Applicant  has  conducted  some  characterization  of  the  two  surfactants  sorbitan  oleate  and polyoxyethylene cetosteayl either by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The characterization of surfactants using  mass  spectrometry  was  predicted  and  subsequently  observed  and  thus  can  be  considered confirmatory. Major peaks highlighted corresponded with the expected mass of the relevant ions. Details of the production process of squalene have been provided. The Applicant states that production of  squalene  is  conducted  according  to  GMP,  and  a  GMP  certificate  for  the  squalene  manufacturer  is provided. Tests conducted by the squalene manufacturer and those conducted by sanofi pasteur are listed. Information has been supplied regarding microbial quality controls applied to all raw materials. Full  information  regarding  the  manufacture  and  characterization  of  squalene  has  been  supplied  and provides assurance regarding extraneous agents and the removal of shark proteins. The specifications for squalene are considered adequate. A revised CoA has been supplied for squalene tested on receipt by sanofi pasteur. The applicant has identified critical steps and consequently the parameters used to monitor the process. Data from robustness studies have been provided which identify the adequate parameters to monitor

The Applicant has provided data to demonstrate that:

- -process parameters during PIT emulsification were met for the 3 consistency batches,
- -the batches were homogenous for squalene content,
- -the batches met specifications for squalene content, size distribution sterility and acetone content.
- -mannitol, SO and PCE content of these batches were within the target range.

Process validation of AF03 bulk concentrate can be considered to have been demonstrated.

Changes  made  to  the  AF03  bulk  concentrate  manufacturing  process  during  development  are adequately described. No quality controls were performed for release of Phase I and II AF03 bulk and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

that therefore comparability of commercial batches of AF03 bulk with Phase I can not be established. Comparability has been demonstrated for AF03 final bulk product and AF03 filled product.

Data  have  been  provided  from  robustness  studies  to  show  the  effects  of  changes  in  composition, stirring of oily phase, stirring and temperature during PIT and shearing on the process, and quality of AF03 bulk concentrate.

Characterization has been carried out on AF03 final bulk product. Full data from these studies have been provided.

Impurities arise from the degradation of squalene, SO and PCE. Production of acetone as a degradation product of squalene is judged to be the most sensitive determinant of AF03 degradation and surfactant degradation is thought to be detectable through pH measurement. The justification relating to toxicity and the proposed acceptance limit for acetone content is acceptable.

Medicinal product no longer authorised  Specifications Specifications for the Adjuvant AF03 Bulk: Specifications include bacterial and fungal sterility, pH, size distribution, squalene content and identification, PCE content, SO content, mannitol content, phosphate content and acetone content. The proposed release tests for AF03 bulk concentrate are adequate to determine the quality of AF03 bulk and have been based on industrial scale batches. Details of the non-Ph Eur method for determining squalene content have been provided. Data have been provided to show that the method for determining squalene content of AF03 bulk concentrate has been suitably validated. Sterility testing and size distribution testing are conducted according to Ph Eur monographs. As two QC sites are listed for AF03 bulk concentrate, confirmation is has been provided that the SOP for the analytical techniques is the same at both QC sites. The Applicant has provided data on 3 industrial batches of AF03 bulk concentrate. The data show that specifications were met and that product is consistent. Descriptions  of  the  use  of  reference  standards  in  AF03  bulk  concentrate  release  testing  have  been provided.  Example  certificates  of  analysis  for  each  of  the  reference  standards  have  been  provided. Information  has  been  supplied  on  storage  conditions  for  the  squalene  reference  standard.  The justification  for  the  use  of  the  reference  standard  to  measure  particles  of  approximately  100  nm  is acceptable. A  stainless  steel  shipper  vessel  is  used  for  the  storage  of  the  AF03  bulk  concentrate.  Clarification regarding the maintenance of the low oxygen atmosphere in this container remains has been provided.  Stability Data  from  stability  studies  of  3  batches  of  AF03  bulk  concentrate  have  been  provided.  All  quality parameters remained within specification after storage for 3 months at +5°C ± 3°C. Data have also been  supplied  for  batches  stored  for  3  months  at  +25°C  ±  2°C  and  show  an  increase    in  acetone content for 2 of the 3 batches. Based on the 3 month data, a 6 month shelf-life at +5°C ± 3°C for AF03 bulk concentrate is acceptable.

Batch  data  have  been  provided  for  Phase  II  H1N1  antigen  final  bulk product, although quality control tests were limited to stability, thiomersal content and HA content. Stability data have been provided which indicate that Phase II Final bulk product batches are stable for appearance, pH, HA content and sterility when stored at +5°C ± 3°C for 2 months. No  changes  have  been  made  to  the  H1N1  antigen  drug  product  manufacturing  process  during development. Batch data are supplied for 4 batches of Phase II H1N1 antigen drug product. The Applicant has adequately explained the choice of vial and stopper for H1N1 antigen drug product. Data are presented to demonstrate that the stoppers have been tested according to Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 and met acceptance criteria. Cytotoxicity studies were conducted according to USP 87. Justification  for  the  level  of  thiomersal  used  has  been  provided.  Size  distribution  data  indicate  that there  is  no  physicochemical  interaction  between  H1N1  antigen  and  AF03  adjuvant  when  the components are mixed. Animal studies indicate that an interaction between antigen and adjuvant may not be critical for development of an immune response to the vaccine.  Adventitious Agents showed greater than 4 log reduction in titre, in compliance with CPMP/BWP/268/95.

Squalene, a major component of the AF03 adjuvant is purified from shark liver. Bioburden is controlled and sharks are not a relevant TSE species. Whilst no data have been provided to  demonstrate the capability of the squalene distillation process to inactivate/remove viruses and no testing for viruses is conducted on the squalene raw material, given the species  barrier  and  the  squalene  manufacturing process, the risk to humans from any shark virus in the raw material appears to be negligible. Indeed,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

no  virally  associated  pathology  has  been  described  for  sharks  with  the  exception  of  a  herpesvirus infected captive smooth dogfish.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Manufacture  of  AF03  adjuvant  drug  product  consists  of  the  dilution  of  the  AF03  bulk  concentrate followed by filling into glass vials. AF03 bulk concentrate (32 % squalene) is diluted with PBS to form AF03 bulk product containing 3.3 % squalene.

The Company has provided data from animal studies to show that injection of AF03 induces an influx of inflammatory cells to the injection site. Data from in vitro studies with AF03 and H5N1 antigen show immuno-stimulating effects on human blood cells.

Process  development  for  the  adjuvant  system  has  included  change  in  raw  materials  suppliers  and concentration, manufacturing site and the scale of production. The Applicant has compared the process used to manufacture Phase II AF03 product and that used to manufacture industrial scale batches. The study included an evaluation of equipment changes on critical steps, and a comparison of conductivity and temperature during PIT. Differences seen in conductivity and temperature profiles during PIT are considered  by  the  Applicant  to  be  due  to  differences  in  the  heating/cooling  kinetics  due  to  the increased volume. Data from robustness studies have been provided to show that heating and cooling rates do not impact product quality.

A flow diagram for filling of AF03 bulk product has been provided. The in-process controls applied to this process are fill volume and sterilization parameters for the container closure materials.

The Applicant has conducted small scales studies to demonstrate that the filtration step for final bulk product is capable of removing high concentrations of bacteria and that the product is not bactericidal. A  study  of  filter  extractables  has  also  been  conducted  under  worst-case  conditions.  Non-volatile residue levels were assessed. Analysis of the extractables found that they are non-toxic according to USP criteria. The Applicant has conducted photostability studies to select the vial used for AF03 drug product. The data  demonstrate  that  exposure  to  light  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  squalene  degradation  product, acetone,  and  an  increase  in  peroxide  levels  and  thus  the  use  of  an  amber  vial  for  filling  of  AF03 adjuvant product is proposed. Silicon levels seen in the photostability studies are well within the MAD and derive from the silicon coating of the stoppers. The amber glass vials and siliconized stoppers chosen for AF03 filled product have been described. A compatibility  study  has  been  conducted  to  study  interactions  between  AF03  and  different  stoppers. Descriptions of the interaction testing and extractables and cytotoxicity studies conducted to choose the stopper and confirm acceptability of the stopper have been provided.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The non-clinical studies provided in support of H1N1/AF03 candidate vaccine consists of pharmacology/toxicology  data  being  generated  using  AF03-adjuvanted  H5N1  or  seasonal  H1N1 vaccine,  and  AF03  alone.  Pharmacology  and  Toxicology  studies  which  refer  to  candidate  vaccine consisting of the new H1N1 strain have also been submitted.

Noteworthy is that a mouse study was conducted to compare immunogenicity of a A/H5N1 monovalent vaccine (at a suboptimal dose of 0.3 µg of H5N1), formulated either with AF03, MF59-like, AS03-like, or other adjuvants (e.g. AlOOH, AF03+immunomodulator). AF03 has similar adjuvanting effects as the two  other  squalene-in-water  emulsion  (MF59-like,  AS03-like),  both  in  potentiating  vaccine-specific humoral (HI titres) and cellular (IFN-gamma, IL-5) immune responses.

Medicinal product no longer authorised A non-clinical Toxicological testing programme which refers to candidate vaccine consisting of the new H1N1 strain (non-adjuvanted or AF03-adjuvanted) was submitted during the rolling review RR#05. Its primary  focus  was  on  the  evaluation  of  1)  Reproductive  and  Developmental  toxicities  of  AF03  and AF03-adjuvanted  A/H1N1  vaccines,  and  2)  Acinar  Cell  Toxicity  of  the  AF03  and  AF03-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine. At present, final reports of all these studies are not available but will be submitted as soon  as  available  under  follow-up  measures.  In  addition,  supportive  data  on  lachrymal  glands  and pancreas obtained from studies with another adjuvant containing AF03 + an immunomodulator and with vaccines adjuvanted with this other adjuvant were also provided. There  were  deviations  from  GLP  in  some  studies  of  the  non-clinical  programme.  However,  the deviations concerning the rabbit general toxicity study described below can be accepted as there has been intense regulatory oversight of the study with the protocol discussed with assessors prior to the study being conducted. Regarding reproductive toxicity studies, GLP compliance was not claimed as only draft reports are available. This can be accepted in the rolling review process and no objections are raised in respect of GLP.  However, ultimately, finished, signed study reports will be provided by the applicant. Pharmacology  Primary pharmacodynamics Primary pharmacodynamics with AF03-adjuvanted A/H5N1 and seasonal vaccines AF03 adjuvant has been tested in the context of influenza vaccines that were based either on A/H5N1 (different  clades  and  subclades)  or  seasonal  influenza  antigens.  The  adjuvant  effect  of  AF03  on immune  responses  elicited  by  vaccines  was  shown  across  studies  and  its  dose-sparing  effect  was documented in mice and ferrets. It was shown that the extent of an AF03 immunopotentiating effect could be affected by such factors as age of animals (e.g., young versus old mice), priming status and primary immunization dose. In general, and as expected, the adjuvanting effect of AF03 was stronger in naïve than in primed mice in both age groups, and was greater in young animals than in old ones, and when a vaccine formulation contained low and suboptimal vaccine dose level. In  A/H5N1  challenge  studies  using  monkey  (infection)  and  ferret  (disease)  models,  the  protective efficacy of AF03-adjuvanted vaccines was demonstrated.

## Primary pharmacodynamics with AF03-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine

The  ability  of  AF03-adjuvanted  A/H1N1/California/07/2009  vaccine  to  induce  specific  humoral  and cellular immune responses and to protect animals from viral challenge has been investigated in three immunogenicity  studies  in  BALB/c  mice  and  one  ferret  challenge  study.  Results  of  these  studies provide proof of principle for immunogenicity and efficacy of the candidate vaccine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The ferret study presented so far is with interim results only, and the final report of this study will be submitted as a follow-up measure.

Of  note,  all  pharmacological  data  obtained  in  mice  and  ferrets  have  been  generated  using  material made at the scale used to generate clinical trials material.  In addition, two additional mouse studies are performed to address batch consistency using commercial lots and will be submitted as follow-up measures.

-  Secondary pharmacodynamics

Secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  not  performed.  This  approach  is  in  accordance  with  the relevant  guidelines,  note  for  guidance  on  preclinical  pharmacological  and  toxicological  testing  of vaccines  (CPMP/SWP/465/95)  and  the  guideline  on  dossier  structure  and  content  for  pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application (CPMP/VEG/4717/03).

Medicinal product no longer authorised  Safety pharmacology programme No safety pharmacology studies were performed with Humenza vaccine.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions No studies were performed. Pharmacology / AF03 With respect to the adjuvant mode of action of AF03, in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that monocytes and granulocytes (mostly neutrophils) were important target cells of the emulsion. These cell populations were rapidly recruited at the injection site and the adjuvant was shown to favor monocyte differentiation towards Dendritic Cells. All these events should create an immunocompetent environment at the vaccination site that would enhance the triggering of an immune response to the vaccine  antigens.  The  response  profiles  elicited  by  AF03  were  in  most  aspects  comparable  to  those induced  by  MF59-like,  suggesting  that  these  two  oil-in-water  emulsions  share  common  features  of mechanism of action. Pharmacokinetics In line with the relevant guidelines CPMP/SWP/465/95 and CPMP/VEG/4717/03, no pharmacokinetics studies have been performed. Pharmacokinetics / AF03 No pharmacokinetics studies have been performed with AF03 alone. Toxicology  Single-dose Toxicity No general single dose toxicity studies were carried out apart from the studies performed to address specific findings (see Other Toxicity Studies). The safety evaluation was assessed in the repeat dose toxicity studies.  Repeat dose Toxicity

The systemic and local tolerance of AF03 alone was assessed in both a rat and a rabbit repeat dose toxicity study (see section Toxicology / AF03). The rabbit study also included the assessment of the A/H5N1 vaccine adjuvanted with AF03.

The dose, dosing route and regimen were relevant and tested rabbits showed to be immunologically responsive  to  the  vaccine  used  in  toxicity  testing.  In  these  studies  with  AF03  and  H5N1-AF03 adjuvanted  vaccine,  toxic  findings  seen  were  confined  to  local  reactogenicity,  with  systemic  effects consistent with an immune response to vaccination. No specific concerns were raised.

-  Genotoxicity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As a novel unlicensed adjuvant, AF03 has been studied for genotoxicity in a standard battery of tests including  Ames  test,  Mouse  Lymphoma  assay  and  an in  vivo micronucleus  test.  No  specific  safety concerns were raised.

-  Carcinogenicity

No carcinogenicity studies were conducted which is in line with the Note for Guidance on Preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95)

##  Reproduction Toxicity

The effect of AF03 and AF03-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccines on Reproductive system and on Pre- and Post-natal development has been investigated in 4 studies, including 1 rat study and 3 rabbit studies.

The  effect  of  acinar  cell  toxicity  of  AF03  and  AF03/H1N1  vaccine  was  sequentially  assessed  in  two investigative studies, which were conducted in rabbit species but included only one single I.M. dose, one gender of animals (i.e. male rabbits), a short observation period (2 days after dosing), and with histopathological examinations primarily focused on specified tissues [eyes, lachrymal tissues (lachrymal gland, nictitating membrane, Harderian gland and eyelids) and pancreas].

Medicinal product no longer authorised  2 studies evaluating the adjuvant alone in rats and rabbits, and  2 rabbit studies assessing the AF03 adjuvanted Swine A/H1N1 Influenza Vaccines manufactured by the Applicant in Europe or in US The applicant provided further details on the US and the EU vaccines used in these studies and showed that the differences between the two are minor. Data from the study conducted with the US vaccine are thus considered as supportive. Under  test  conditions  of  1)  6x  I.M.  injections  (D-21,  D-7,  D6,  D8,  D11,  and  D17  (rats)  or  D27 (rabbits)) with AF03 alone at concentrations of 1.25-2.5% (rats) or 2.5-5% (rabbits), or 2) 5x I.M. injections (D-21, D-7, D6, D11, D27) in rabbits with 7.5 µgHA + 2.5% AF03, there were no embryofetal toxicity effects noted and also no treatment related effects were noted on pup weights as well as physical,  functional  and  neurological  development  (D0:  first  day  of  gestation).  Immunogenicity  data generated  in  these  studies  demonstrated  transfer  of  vaccine-specific  maternal  antibodies  to  fetuses and pups.  Local tolerance Local tolerance was assessed in two repeat toxicity studies in rats and rabbits with AF03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine. No specific safety concerns were raised.  Other toxicity studies Other general toxicity studies presented by the applicant were intended to address a specific finding of toxicity to the lachrymal glands which arose from studies with an adjuvant that is based on AF03 but additionally  includes  an  immunomodulator.    In  brief,  with  H1N1  AF03-adjuvanted  vaccine,  slightly increased  apoptosis  and  necrosis  of  acinar  cells  in  the  lachrymal  glands  was  found  in  some  rabbits given twice the human dose, as a single intramuscular injection in male rabbits, but not at the human dose. This effect was reproducible across several studies conducted with AF03 or with AF03+immunomodulator  associated  or  not  with  an  antigen  and  was  found  on  microscopic  but  not macroscopic  examination.  Data  from  studies  conducted  with  the  AF03+immunomodulator  adjuvant showed  that  this  change  was  mostly  found  in  males,  was  not  found  in  mice,  was  reversible,  even where adjuvanted vaccine was given on four occasions and was not found to be associated with an ocular  abnormality  during  the  in-life  stages  of  these  studies.    However,  there  is  no  mechanistic explanation at present. Toxicity Studies with AF03 and AF03-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine

Investigative Toxicity Study after a Single IM Injection of AF03/H1N1 vaccine in male NZW Rabbits (Study no. KH06001 IS0914)

No GLP status was claimed for this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The objectives were to investigate the potential effects of AF03 adjuvanted-A/H1N1 vaccine at three different  dose-levels  (twice  the  human  dose,  the  human  dose,  and  half  the  human  dose)  on  the lachrymal tissues and the pancreas. The aim was to establish a NOEL for these organs in NZW male rabbits following a single I.M. injection.

A total of 40 NZW male rabbits were allocated to the study. Ten males were given one IM injection on day 1 of either AF03 adjuvanted-A/H1N1 vaccine at 0.5-, 1- or 2-fold the human dose or saline.

## Summary of acinar cell necrosis/apoptosis findings

Medicinal product no longer authorised -: not observed At 2x human dose, one single I.M. injection of AF03/H1N1 vaccine increased the incidence of a minimal necrotic/apoptotic  process  in  acinar  cells  of  lachrymal  glands,  although  in  this  case  other  lachrymal tissues like nictitating membranes and eyelids were not affected. Notably, at the human dose or half the human dose, one single I.M. injection of AF03/H1N1 vaccine did not cause such an effect, because  the microscopic observation of unilateral acinar cell necrotic/apoptotic  process  were  consistent  with  the  controls,  thus  establishing  the  human  dose  of AF03/H1N1 vaccine as a NOEL. This one human dose level in rabbit species corresponds to a safety margin  of  about  17x  for  a  50  kg  body  weight  human  and  is  considered  quite  acceptable  for toxicological testing of the vaccine class for human use. Investigative Toxicity Study After a Single IM Injection of AF03 alone in male Rabbits (Study no. KH06001 IS0912) No GLP status was claimed for this study. The objectives were to investigate the acinar cell toxicity (apoptosis/necrosis), induced by an adjuvant composed  of  AF03  +  an  immunomodulator  previously  observed  in  a  study  after  4  intramuscular injections to NZW rabbits, and to determine whether this finding could be induced after one dose, to provide  quick  investigative  model  for  follow-up  studies.  In  addition,  AF03  was  evaluated  as  it  is  a component of the concerned adjuvant. A total of 30 male NZW rabbits were allocated to 2 treated groups and one control group. Groups of 10 male rabbits received one IM injection of either the mixed adjuvant AF03+ immunomodulator or AF03 at  2-fold  the  human  dose  (5%  squalene  +  20 μ g  immunomodulator  and  5%  squalene  alone, respectively). At  2x  human  dose,  an  exposure  level  higher  than  that  to  be  administered  in  man,  one  single  I.M. injection of AF03 alone induced a higher incidence of minimal histological change (apoptosis/necrosis of acinar cells) in the lachrymal tissues (lachrymal glands, nictitating membranes and eyelids, but not in Harderian gland), but not in pancreas in contrast to AF03+immunomodulator adjuvant.

Dedicated studies evaluated the nonclinical safety profile of the adjuvant, which was considered as a new chemical entity composed of squalene, polyoxyethylene 12 cetostearyl ether, sorbitan oleate and mannitol. These studies included three genotoxicity studies, two in-vitro : an Ames test (AA32696) and a mouse lymphoma assay (AA32697), and one in-vivo : a micronucleus test in mice after intravenous injection of a maximum tolerated dose (AA33728). Two repeat dose toxicity studies, one in rodents (in rats: AA32695) and one in non rodents (in rabbits: AA33212), assessed the systemic toxicity and local tolerance of AF03. In the rat repeat dose and in the reproductive toxicity studies, several dose levels of AF03 were assessed (from 1.25% to 10% squalene, including the human dose 2.5% squalene) in order to establish a dose effect relationship and determine the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). In the rabbit repeat dose toxicity study, the human dose of AF03 used in the vaccine was evaluated. No specific safety concerns were raised.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The significance of these minimal histological findings observed for AF03 or AF03/H1N1 vaccine at 2x human dose level is unknown yet, in considering that:  These minimal histological findings in lachrymal tissues were not accompanied by microscopical structure changes in the eyes and were not associated with any ophthalmologic dysfunctions, as assessed extensively both by standard in-life ophthalmologic examinations and by several functional  tests  including  blink  rate,  tear  flow  and  corneal  surface  examinations.  This  even holds  for  AF03+immunomodulator  adjuvant  associated  or  not  with  an  antigen,  which  were shown  to  induce  histological  changes  at  a  higher  frequency  and  severity  in  rabbit  species tested  A complete recovery of the histological changes, as revealed in two independent repeat-dose toxicity studies (one standard with AF03+immunomodulator associated with an  antigen, one investigative with AF03+immunomodulator alone or with an antigen) where a recovery group was  included.  In  these  studies,  no  findings  were  observed  14  days  after  the  last  injection. Furthermore,  a  comparison  of  results  across  studies  revealed  that  repeated  dosing  caused similar effect as did one single dose, suggesting a full recovery during dosing intervals  AF03+immunomodulator associated with another antigen has also been tested in a standard repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  mice  with  no  findings  in  pancreas  observed,  in  contrast  to observation  made  in  rabbits.  This,  together  with  the  fact  of  species-species  difference  in lachrymal  gland  overall  size,  tissue  morphology,  expression  of  biochemical  markers  and abundance of gland tissue on a body weight basis, necessitates a careful interpretation of the clinical relevance of histological finding observed for AF03 and AF03/H1N1 vaccine.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

No  environmental  risk  assessment  was  included  in  the  application.  According  to  the  guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  'Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  fro  Human  Use' vaccines  due  to  the  nature  of  their  constituents  are  exempted  from  the  requirement  to  provide  an environmental risk assessment in the application for a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product for human use.

## Discussion on non-clinical aspects

Primary pharmacodynamics study performed with AF03-adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine provide proof of principle for immunogenicity and efficacy of the candidate vaccine.  However,  what  immune mechanism(s) of defense can render protection against new A/H1N1 is currently unknown.

In  relation  to  vaccines,  the  pharmacodynamic  studies  consist  of  assessments  of  the  immune responses.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Regarding  reproduction  toxicity  studies,  the  study  design  used  did  not  result  in  exposure  in  early pregnancy.    Doses  were  given  7  days  before  mating  and  from  day  6  of  gestation  and  therefore  a period, corresponding to the first 6 days of pregnancy is not covered.  The applicant provided further justification behind the choice of the study design. However, this did not consider the effect of dosing with vaccine and exposure to adjuvant just before implantation. The theoretical risk is that an immune effect  arising  from  vaccination  in  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  might  be  associated  with  effects leading  to  a  failure  of  implantation.  There  is  insufficient  evidence  of  a  hazard  from  the  studies conducted. On balance, it is reasonable to conclude that the data presented show that the constituents of  the  adjuvant  are  not  expected  to  have  an  adverse  effect  in  early  pregnancy;  the  studies  are sufficient to indicate no effect is expected from immunogenic responses to the antigen. A reproducible non-clinical finding of necrosis and apoptotis was identified in lachrymal glands in rabbit studies.  The  understanding  of  this  phenomenon  with  new  adjuvant  is  currently  poor  and  requires further research and non-clinical studies. However, this finding of toxicity to the lachrymal gland did not  cause  clinically  or  macroscopically  identifiable  effects  in  animals.These  findings  have  been adequately reflected in the SPC. 2.4 Clinical aspects Introduction GCP The applicant provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted within and outside the European  community  were  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  ethical  standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic  studies  were  not  performed  in  accordance  with  the  note  for  guidance  on  clinical evaluation of new vaccines (CPMP/EWP/463/97) and the Guideline on dossier structure and content for pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application (CPMP/VEG/4717/03). Pharmacodynamics

The data on the immunological response to Humenza obtained during clinical studies are described and discussed below.

## Clinical efficacy

The clinical dossier consists of three main European clinical trials conducted with the AF03/H1N1 vaccine:

- -GPF07 : a phase II, multicenter, randomised, open label trial in healthy adults aged 18 to 60 years and elderly subjects aged &gt;60 years conducted in France.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -GPF 08 : a phase II, multicenter, randomised, open label trial in healthy paediatric subjects aged 3 to 17 years conducted in Finland.
- -GPF 09 : a phase II, multicentre, randomised, open trial, in healthy paediatric subjects aged 6 to 35 months conducted in Finland.

In addition, the two supportive studies conducted with an AF03/H5N1 vaccines were submitted:

- -FUF04 (US): a phase I, observer-blinded, randomised, formulation/dose ranging study in healthy adults aged 18-40 years.
- -GPF01 (Belgium): a phase I (two-step) dose/formulation finding study in healthy adults aged 18-40 years.

Of note, there is a difference in manufacturing process between the four European studies and the US trial supportive study FUF04.

All  these  studies  are  still  ongoing.  In  all  these  studies,  AF03-adjuvanted  vaccine  formulations  are compared with non-adjuvanted vaccines using a two-dose schedule with a dose interval of 21 days.

Data  following the two-dose  priming  schedule  were  provided  for  the  three  studies  with the H1N1v/AF03 candidate vaccine and for the two supportive H5N1/AF03 studies. Date up to Month 6 - Month 12 post-primary were provided for the two H5N1/AF03 supportive studies.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Assays For a potential pandemic vaccine candidate based on an A/H5N1 strain, such as the one used in GPF01 and FUF04, an haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay using horse erythrocytes has been shown to be more sensitive than the standard HAI assay with turkey erythrocytes or chicken erythrocytes, which is  used in the evaluation of seasonal vaccines. The HAI assay with horse erythrocytes was therefore used  for  evaluation  of  the  immune  response  to  the  A/H5N1  vaccine.  The  HAI  assay  with  turkey erythrocytes  was  used  for  evaluation  of  the  immune  response  to  the  adjuvanted  A/H1N1  pandemic influenza candidate vaccine. In  all  studies  conducted  with  the  A/H5N1  prototype  pandemic  influenza  vaccine  and  with  the adjuvanted A/H1N1  pandemic  influenza  candidate vaccine all sera were  also analysed by a seroneutralisation (SN) assay. HAI and SN assays were carried out at GCI laboratory in USA. Control samples were included in the assays. Validation reports were provided that indicated a robust performance of both assays (for H5N1 and H1N1). In  addition,  antibody  titres  against  the  swine-origin  A/H1N1  influenza  virus  were  measured  in  sera obtained during the three studies with the A/H1N1 adjuvanted vaccine using single radial haemolysis (SRH) performed at the laboratory of Dr. Emanuele Montomoli, University of Siena, Italy. The  HAI  and  SRH  data,  together  with  the  SN  data,  provide  a  surrogate  marker  for  efficacy  in  this application, although, as for all pandemic  influenza  vaccines, no  direct correlation  has  been demonstrated between the immune response and clinical efficacy.  Dose-Response Studies Study  GPF01 investigated  AF03  adjuvanted  H5N1  (strain  A/Vietnam)  vaccine  formulations  with varying  antigen  doses.  The  antigen  was  produced  according  to  the  Vaxigrip  process  (European manufacturing site). Study  FUF04 was  conducted in the USA  evaluating different adjuvant concentrations and employing H5N1 (strain: A/Indonesia) antigen produced according to the Fluzone process (US manufacturing site). The  immunogenicity  results  from  GPF01  and  FUF04  demonstrated  that  a  single  dose  of  H5N1/AF03 formulations  was  not  sufficient.  All  3  CHMP  criteria  were  met  only  following  two  doses  of  vaccine formulations  containing  3.75µg  to  15µg  HA  antigen  adjuvanted  with  2.5%  AF03.  A  dose-response effect was observed using different antigen and different AF03 concentrations.

There were increases in GMTR, SCRs and SPRs following the second dose of H5N1/AF03 formulations compared to values observed after the first dose. At 6 months post-vaccination 15-19.5% of subjects were  still  HIH  seroprotected  after  receipt  of  2.5-6  µg/2.5%  AF03  formulations  while  none  of  the subjects in the unadjuvanted vaccine control groups were seroprotected. High SN titres were observed in groups vaccinated with 2.5-6 µg/2.5% AF03 formulations (85-99.5% with titres &gt;=40 at day 42 and 47-79%  with  titres  &gt;=40  at  Month  6).  Induction  of  cross-reactive  neutralising  antibodies  was demonstrated against A/Indonesia although titres were considerably less than against the homologous virus. There was a limited vaccine specific Th1 response seen in CMI assays with the AF03 adjuvant. However this area remains largely exploratory in influenza vaccine development.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall  it  was  considered  that  the  choice  of  a  regimen  consisting  of  two  doses  of  either  3.75µg  or 7.5µg HA and 2.5% AF03 for the planned H1N1/AF03 clinical trials in adults and children was justified.

-  Main studies

## Study GPF07 and GPF08 (subjects of &gt;3 years of age)

## METHODS (GENERAL)

## Study Participants

The inclusion and exclusion criteria were in general identical for studies GPF01, FUF04, GPF07, GPF08 and GPF09.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Specific exclusion criteria included:  Previous participation in a clinical trial involving an investigational flu pandemic vaccine  Vaccination with an influenza vaccine during the past 6 months (GPF01)  Confirmed  infection  with  the  swine-origin  A/H1N1  influenza  strain  in  2009  (GPF07,  GPF08  and GPF09) Treatments and Objectives This is described in table 1. Outcomes/endpoints The primary immunogenicity endpoints were defined as described below. HAI antibody (Ab) titres, Neutralising Ab titres and Ab titres measured by SRH method were obtained on D0, D21 and D42. HAI assay: HAI Ab titres were obtained in duplicate assays; the geometric mean of these two values was used. The following endpoints were derived: - Geometric Mean Titre (GMT) ratios - Seroprotection rate defined as HAI Ab titre ≥ 40 (1/dilution [dil]) - Seroconversion rate defined as the proportion that was either seronegative prior to vaccination and had a post-vaccination titre ≥ 40 (1/dil) or seropositive prior to vaccination and had at least a 4-fold increase in titre post-vaccination. The results were compared against the CHMP criteria applied to the assessment of seasonal influenza vaccines for age groups 18-60 years and &gt; 60 years. SN assay: -    GMT ratios -    Subjects with two- and four-fold increase of titres -    Subjects with neutralising Abs titre ≥ 20, ≥ 40, and ≥ 80 (1/dil) Randomisation A  randomisation  list  stratified  by  centre  and  age  group  was  created  using  the  block  permutation method,  stratified  by  age  group  within  centres.  This  guaranteed,  at  any  time,  a  similar  number  of subjects between the three investigational medicinal products inside each centre and each age group. Blinding/Masking The studies were open-label but serology testing was performed in a blinded manner. Statistical methods No statistical hypothesis was tested. All analyses were descriptive.

## RESULTS

## Participant Flow Study GPF07

A total of 450 subjects (300 adults [aged 18 to 60 years], and 150 elderly subjects [aged over 60 years]) were included in the study and randomised to one of the three vaccine groups. All subjects included  at  D0  were  included  in  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  for  immunogenicity  analysis  and  in  the Safety  Analysis  set  (SafAS)  for  safety  assessment  after  the  first  vaccination.  All  but  two  subjects (withdrawals  after  the  first  vaccination)  were  included  in  the  SafAS  for  safety  assessment  after  the second vaccination.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Summary of HAI data following vaccination with the 3.8 µg HA pandemic A/H1N1 influenza vaccine

The results of the HAI and SN assays showed similar trends after both vaccinations.

Twenty-one days after one vaccination, the HAI data demonstrated that almost all adult, elderly and 3 to 17-year old subjects had detectable anti-HA Ab (titre ≥ 10 [1/dil]) and that 97.0% of adults, 83.3% of elderly subjects, and 100% of subjects aged 3 to 17 years had seroprotective titres ( ≥ 40 [1/dil]) to the  A/H1N1  influenza  strain.  Neutralising  antibody  titres ≥ 40 (1/dil)  were  observed  for  more  than 85% of subjects in GPF07 and in all subjects in GPF08 21 days after the first vaccination.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The  benefit  of  the  second  dose  was  in  terms  of  level  of  response,  particularly  in  3  to  8-year-old subjects and in subjects aged 60 years and over (a single dose was clearly insufficient in persons of &gt;70 years of age). Clinical data in subjects of &gt;80 years age were extremely limited. After the second vaccination,  almost  all  subjects  reached  seroprotective  HAI  Ab  titres  to  the  A/H1N1  strain  and  had neutralising Ab titres ≥ 80 (1/dil). The three CHMP criteria were reached in all age groups after the first and after the second vaccination.

As  observed  for  the  adult  subjects,  a second dose of both adjuvanted vaccines did not elicit further significant increase of immune response. Twenty-one days after the second vaccination, 96.3% of subjects in the 3.8 μ g HA + AF03 group and 98.0% of subjects in the 7.5 μ g HA + AF03 group had neutralising antibodies at a titre ≥ 80 (1/dil). Between 88.9% and 96.0% of subjects had a four-fold increase in titre from D0 to D42 in the two adjuvanted groups.

## 9-17 years group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall,  20.4%  in  the  3.8 μ g  HA  +  AF03  group  and  36.0%  in  the  7.5 μ g  HA  +  AF03  group  had detectable  SN  titres  ( ≥ 10  1/dil)  prior  to  the  first  vaccination.  Twenty  one  days  after  the  first vaccination, 100% of the subjects in the two adjuvanted vaccine groups had SN titres ≥ 80 (1/dil) and a four-fold rise of SN titres from D0. GMTs and GMTR further increased after the second vaccination. GMT of SN at D42 were &gt;9 000 (1/dil.).

## 3 to 8 years group

Only one subject (2.0%) in each of the two adjuvanted vaccine groups had detectable antibody titres prior to the first vaccination. Twenty one days after the first vaccination, 100% of the subjects in the two adjuvanted vaccine groups had SN titres ≥ 80 (1/dil) and a four-fold rise of SN titres from D0. GMTs  and  GMTR  further  increased  after  the  second  vaccination.  GMT  of  SN  at  D42  were  &gt;9  000 (1/dil.).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Ancillary Analysis Effect of baseline titre, previous influenza vaccination and gender on the immune response In GPF07, a baseline titre (prior to the first vaccination) was detected in around 45% of adult subjects and  60%  of  elderly  subjects  using  the  HAI  assay.  In  GPF08,  no  subjects  aged  3  to  8  years  had detectable anti-HA titres prior to the first vaccination. A few subjects (22.9%) from 9 to 17 years of age had pre-existing antibodies at baseline. Subjects with detectable titres at baseline tended to have higher GMTs compared to subjects with an undetectable titre after the first vaccination, regardless of the age group, and after the second vaccination only in adult and elderly subjects. All CHMP criteria were fulfilled following both vaccinations in all age groups. The pre-existing titres observed in GPF07 are  consistent  with  the  published  literature  and  other  licensed  pandemic  vaccines.  Whether  this represents  cross  reactivity  from  previous  vaccination  or  exposures  to  previous  seasonal  strains  or exposure  to  the  pandemic  A/HINI  strain  remains  speculative.  The  clinical  significance  of  these observations remains unknown. In GPF07, subjects who were not previously vaccinated against seasonal influenza tended to develop higher GMTs than the subjects who received seasonal vaccine before. This was observed after the first and after the second vaccinations, in adult and elderly subjects. Of note, due to the small number of elderly subjects without previous vaccination, the data from this age group have to be interpreted with caution. In GPF08, after the second vaccination, GMTs tended to be slightly higher in 3- to 8-year-old subjects who did not receive previous seasonal vaccination than in other subjects, whereas a similar immune response was observed in all subsets of subjects analyzed in 9-to 17-year-old subjects. The proportion of males and females in each study was similar (except in the elderly subgroup in which there were more female subjects than male subjects) and there was not considered to be a clinically important effect of gender on the immune response. Regardless of the studied covariates, the three CHMP criteria were met in all subgroups 21 days after the first and the second vaccinations, with high seroprotection rates. Analysis of immunogenicity at more narrow age strata Additional analyses of immunogenicity Post dose 2 as well as Post dose 1 were also performed at more narrow  age  strata  with  adjustment  to  baseline  seropositivity  and  prior  vaccination  status  and  were presented in Responses to LOQ of RR#02 and RR#03.  All 3 CHMP criteria were met since the first vaccination and were still kept so after the second dose at strata of 3 - 5 y, 6 - 8 y, 9 - 12 y, 13 - 17 y, 18 - 40 y, 41 - 50 y, 51 - 60 y, 61 - 70 y, independent of the age, pre-vaccination status, and antibody titre status at baseline.

- o Pre-vaccination  status  has  no  significant  influence  on  GMTs  at  3  -  5  y  and  6  -  8  y strata (all subjects seronegative);
- o There is a trend for seropositive subjects at baseline to develop higher GMTs after first dose  at  9  -  12  y  and  13  -  17  y  age  strata,  but  such  trend  of  difference  between seropositive and seronegative subjects disappeared after the second dose; no influence of pre-vaccination status at these age strata;
- o There is a trend for seropositive subjects at baseline to develop higher GMTs compared to seronegative subjects after first dose at 18 - 40 y, 41 - 50 y, 51 - 60 y, and 61 70  y  age  strata;  the  second  vaccination  has  little  impact  on  GMTs  in  seropositive subjects  and  GMTs  in  such  subjects  still  trended  higher  compared  to  seronegative subjects in these age strata; no influence of pre-vaccination status at these age strata;
-  At  71  -  80  y  age  stratum  (all  has  pre-vaccination  history),  all  3  CHMP  criteria  were  met  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

seropositive  subjects  after  the  first  dose  while  seronegative  subjects  did  not  achieve  SPR criterum (i.e. &lt; 60%), however, after the second dose, all these criteria were fulfilled in all subjects of this age stratum whatever the serostatus;  the impact of seropositivity on GMTs observed in this age stratum is the same as observed in age strata of 18 - 40 y, 41 - 50 y, 51 - 60 y, and 61 - 70 y;

-  At ≥ 81  y  age  stratum  (all  has  pre-vaccination  history),  only  1  out  of  7  subjects  was seronegative at baseline and did not develop HI antibodies after the first and second doses of HUMENZA; in the remaining subjects of this age stratum, all CHMP criteria were met.

## Study GPF09 (younger children 6-35 months of age)

METHOD

-  GMTs were equal to 200, 256, and 290 (1/dil), corresponding to geometric mean titre ratios (GMTRs) D21/D0 of 39.9, 51.3, and 58.0 respectively.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The method has been mainly described in table 2 (objective, sample size, treatments) and within the section on study GP07 and GP08. RESULTS Participants Flow A total of 401 subjects, i.e. 201 aged 6 to 11 months and 200 aged 12 to 35 months, were included in the study. All subjects received the first vaccine injection. A total of 14 subjects did not complete the D0-D42 period [13 did not complete the D0-D21 period: 11 aged 6 to 11 months and 2 aged 12 to 35 months; 1 subject aged 12 to 35 months (3.8 μ g HA + AF03 group) did not complete the D21-D42 period]. All but 14 subjects (withdrawals of the study) received the second vaccine injection. All subjects included at D0 were included in the full analysis set (FAS) for immunogenicity analysis and in the safety analysis set (SafAS) for safety assessment after the first vaccination. All but 14 subjects (withdrawals  of  the  study)  were  included  in  the  SafAS  for  safety  assessment  after  the  second vaccination. Recruitment Subjects were included in the study between 16 September and 07 October 2009. Baseline data Regarding  the  baseline  serostatus,  all  subjects  (except  one)  were  seronegative  to  the  A/H1N1 influenza strain prior to vaccination. Demographic and baseline characteristics (age, gender, ethnic origin, history of influenza vaccination) were similar across groups. Overall, in the 6 to 11 months group, the age of subjects ranged from 6.1 to 12.0 months and the average age was 9.1 months. In the 12 to 35 months group, the age of subjects ranged from 13.0 to 36.0 months and the average age was 27.1 months. Outcomes and Estimation HAI Subjects Aged 6 to 11 Months In each adjuvanted group, no subjects had a detectable antibody titre, i.e. ≥ 10 (1/dil), prior to the first vaccination. Twenty-one days after the first vaccination, at least 97% of subjects had a detectable antibody titre. At D21, in the 1.9 μ g HA + ½ AF03, 3.8 μ g HA + ½ AF03 and 3.8 μ g HA + AF03 groups respectively:

-  The seroconversion rates or significant increases, as well as the seroprotection rates reached 95.7%, 97.9%, and 100.0%

## Subjects Aged 12 to 35 Months

Prior  to  the  first  vaccination,  all  subjects  in  the  three  adjuvanted  groups  were  seronegative  to  the A/H1N1 influenza strain (antibody titre &lt;10 [1/dil]), except one subject in the 3.8 μ g HA + ½AF03 group. Twenty-one days after the first vaccination, at least 98% of subjects had a detectable antibody titre. A strong immune response was induced by the A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines adjuvanted with AF03.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At D21, in the 1.9 μ g HA + ½ AF03, 3.8 μ g HA + ½ AF03 and 3.8 μ g HA + AF03 groups respectively:

-  GMTs were equal to 253, 220, and 409 (1/dil), corresponding to GMTRs D21/D0 of 50.7, 42.2, and 81.9 respectively.
-  The seroconversion rates or significant increases, as well as the seroprotection rates reached 97.8%, 98.0%, and 100.0%.

For both age groups, twenty-one days after the first vaccination, the three CHMP criteria were fulfilled, 95% CIs inclusive, in the three adjuvanted groups, with very high estimates: at least 95% of subjects raised seroprotective titres of Ab against the A/H1N1 strain in the 6-11 months group and at least 97% in the 12-35 months group.

Twenty-one  days  after  the  second  vaccination  (D42),  the  immune  response  to  the  vaccine  was increased compared to that observed after the first one. In the 1.9 μ g HA + ½ AF03, 3.8 μ g HA + ½ AF03 and 3.8 μ g HA + AF03 groups respectively, GMTs reached 3008, 2500, and 3241 (1/dil) for the 6-11 months group and 2736, 2524, and 3748 (1/dil) for the 12-35 months group, corresponding to GMTRs D42/D21 of 13.3, 9.90, and 11.0 and 10.8, 11.2, and 9.51, respectively.

Medicinal product no longer authorised The seroconversion rates or significant  increases  from  D0,  as  well  as  the  seroprotection  rates  were equal to 100.0% in the three adjuvanted groups. Twenty-one  days  after  the  second  vaccination,  as  seen  following  the  first  injection  in  the  three adjuvanted vaccine groups, the three CHMP criteria were met, 95%CI inclusive, with 100.0% subjects having developed seroprotective levels of antibodies against the A/H1N1 strain. Similar results were observed in the PP population. Neutralising Antibody Subjects Aged 6 to 11 Months Prior to the first vaccination, all subjects were seronegative to the A/H1N1 strain (neutralising antibody titre &lt;10 [1/dil]), except one subject in the 1.9 μ g HA + ½ AF03 group. After the first vaccination, as observed  with  the  HAI  method,  at  least  97%  of  subjects  had  detectable  neutralising  antibodies.  At D21, at least 97% of subjects in the three adjuvanted groups had neutralising antibodies at a titre ≥ 80 (1/dil)  and  a  four-fold  increase  in  titre  from  D0  to  D21.  GMTs  further  increased  after  the  second vaccination to reach values &gt;9 000 (1/dil.). At D42, 100% of subjects in the three adjuvanted groups had neutralising antibodies at a titre ≥ 80 (1/dil) and had a four-fold increase in titre from D0 to D42. The trends for the SN data reflect those described for the HAI data. Subjects Aged 12 to 35 Months In  subjects  aged  12  to  35  months,  antibodies  were  not  detectable  (neutralising  antibody  titre  &lt;10 [1/dil]) prior to the first vaccination, except in two subjects (one subject in the 1.9 μ g HA + ½AF03 group and one subject in the 3.8 μ g HA + AF03 group). After the first vaccination, as observed with the HAI method, at least 98% of subjects had detectable neutralising antibodies. At D21, at least 98% of subjects in the three adjuvanted groups had neutralising antibodies at a titre ≥ 80 (1/dil) and a fourfold  increase  in  titre  from  D0  to  D21.  GMTs  further  increased  after  the  second  vaccination  to  reach values ranging from 8539 to 9761 (1/dil.). After the second vaccination, 100% of subjects in the three adjuvanted groups had neutralising antibodies at a titre ≥ 80 (1/dil) and had a four-fold increase in titre from D0 to D42. The trends for the SN data reflect those described for the HAI data. The key data are summarised in Table 5 Table 5: GPF09 - Summary of Immunogenicity Data Following the First Vaccination (D21) (half dose vs full dose of 3.8 µg HA Pandemic A/H1N1 Influenza Vaccine) - Full Analysis Set (FAS)

Medicinal product no longer authorised *Seroconversion for subjects with pre-vaccination titre &lt;10 (1/dil) on D0, post-vaccination titre ≥ 40 (1/dil) † Significant increase for subjects with pre-vaccination titre ≥ 10 (1/dil), ≥ 4-fold increase of the titre after vaccination (post/pre) Twenty-one days after the first vaccination, there was a trend towards better titres with the full dose compared to half dose, but there was no difference in terms of seroprotection. Therefore, half dose was selected for dose recommendation in 6 to 35-month-old subjects. A single vaccination with half dose of the candidate vaccine induced a strong immune response in both age  groups.  This  immune  response  was  further  increased  after  the  second  vaccination,  with  GMTs ≥ 2500  (1/dil)  with  HAI  and ≥ 8500  (1/dil)  with  SN  in  both  vaccine  and  age  groups.  The seroconversion or significant increase rate, as well as the seroprotection rate were equal to 100% in both age groups, regardless of the vaccine dose given (half or full dose). The analysis of the immune response based on covariates will be provided in a next submission as part of a follow-up measure according to the action plan.  Supportive studies Studies GPF01 and FUF04 also provided supportive data on antibody persistence and boosting data. Three, six and twelve months after primary series vaccination, a decrease in GMTs was observed in all groups.  By  month  3,  Ab  titres  declined  but  substantial  wane  of  the  immunity  became  apparent  by month 6. However, all adjuvanted groups maintained a higher proportion of subjects with detectable Ab titres. Within adjuvanted groups, Group 2 (3.75 μ gHA+AF03), Group 3 (7.5 μ gHA+AF03) and Group 4  (15 μ gHA+AF03) were comparable, whereas the antibody persistence in Group 1 (1.9 μ gHA+AF03) was lower. The same trend was observed with the SN method. Upon boosting with A/Indonesia strain at month 12 (Step 2 only of GPF01 study), a higher immune response was induced as soon as 7 days (D372) after booster vaccination, and at 21 days (D386) after booster vaccination, all three CHMP criteria were met for all the adjuvanted groups, whereas none of these criteria were met for the non-adjuvanted control group.

Booster immune responses were also demonstrated able to cross-inhibit A/Vietnam strain in HI as well as  SN  assay,  with  all  three  CHMP  criteria  met  when  assayed  against  this  strain.  Similarly,  none  of these criteria were met for the non-adjuvanted control group even 21 days after booster.

Interestingly,  even  though  the  primary  vaccination  series  and  the  booster  vaccination increased  the influenza specific lymphoproliferative response in GPF01 study, the IFNγ and IL-13 cytokine secretion and the multi-cytokine producing CD4 T-cell frequencies in all groups, no clear antigen dose-effect or significant difference between the four adjuvanted groups was observed after the primary or booster

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vaccinations. The booster vaccination did not improve the cellular response compared to the primary vaccination series. The Th1/Th2 balance was not significantly impacted by vaccination.

In FUF04 study, only the Month 6 Ab persistence data are presented so far, and data at M12 (D365) and  at  M15  (D456)  and  6  months  postbooster  (M21  [D636]  for  a  subset  of  subjects  are  still  in collection. Similar to study GPF01, the antibody titres after a 2-dose vaccination series decreased over time (at M6) for all study groups, and responses for all endpoints (GMTs, SCR, SPR) were higher for the adjuvanted groups than for the control groups. In FUF04, H5N1 vaccine material was produced in the US using a manufacturing process distinct from the one constantly used for GPF01, GPF07, and GPF08).

##  Discussion on clinical efficacy

The antibody persistence data after one single dose of HUMENZA are not available as yet, which could somewhat be regarded as a limitation to HUMENZA's clinical immunogenicity data package. However, this limitation is not HUMENZA-specific, but was common to other pandemic vaccines at the time of their licensure. In order to address the issue of antibody persistence after single dose of HUMENZA, the antibody persistence after one dose will be monitored in the on-going US study FUF16, which assesses the 3.8 µg HA + AF03 vaccine manufactured by using the US process in adults and elderly subjects. In addition, antibody persistence after two doses of HUMENZA will be assessed in on-going GPF07, GPF08 and GPF09 clinical trials.

Medicinal product no longer authorised In main studies in subjects aged 3 years and above the adjuvantation and antigen-sparing effect of AF03 is reassured for the actual H1N1 vaccine antigen. The HI and SN data at 21 days post dose 1 clearly showed adequacy for one dose of 3.8 µg HA/AF03 H1N1 vaccine for each age group: 18 - 60 y, &gt; 60 y, 9 -17 y, and 3 - 8 y, independent of pre-existing immunity status of subjects (children 3 - 8 y were all immune näive for H1N1 in GPF08). Similar to what was previously seen for the first dose, after the second dose of HUMENZA (3.8 µg HA/AF03 H1N1 vaccine), the fulfilment of all three immunogenicity criteria [GMTR &gt;2.5/2.0, SCR &gt; 40%/30%, SPR &gt; 70%/60% in HAI method, defined by CHMP for 18 - 60 y adults / &gt; 60 y elderly] is maintained in any age group: 3 - 8 y, 9 -17 y, 18 - 60 y, and &gt; 60 y. These HI data are well supported by the SN data. The most notable chance among three parameters after the second dose is the substantial increase of GMTs and GMTRs in 3 - 8 y subgroup. Whereas the gain of GMTs and GMTRs from the second dose is low in the rest age groups: increase of GMTR (D42/D21, HAI method) is: 7.09 for 3 - 8 y, 2.98 for 9 17 y, 1.48 for 18 -60 y, and 1.62 for &gt; 60 y subgroups. Analyses of immunogenicity performed at more narrow age strata showed that all 3 CHMP criteria were met in seropositive subjects aged 71-80 years old after the first dose while seronegative subjects in this strata did not achieve SPR criterum. Also, in the age group 61-70 years who were seronegative at baseline  the  seroprotection  rate  after  one  dose  (78%)  was  much  lower  than  in  younger  subjects seronegative at baseline (90%+). In the 6 - 35 months age group and in 6 - 11 months and 12 - 35 months subgroups, one single dose of  either  half  dose  or  full  dose  (3.8  µg  HA  +  2.5%  AF03)  of  HUMENZA  elicited  strong  HI  and  SN antibody response. All 3 CHMP criteria defined for 18 - 60 years of age adults were met after one single  dose,  whereas  non-adjuvanted  vaccine  is  less  immunogenic  and  needs  a  2-dose  schedule  in order to fulfil 3 CHMP criteria in 6 - 35 months children. The second dose vaccination further increased the antibody response both in HI and SN assays. This is a reminiscence of the observation made in GPF08 study (3 - 17 y children/adolescent study), in that great GMT titre increase by the second dose was evidenced only in 3 - 8 y subgroup with almost all subjects sero-negative at baseline. However, as indicated for other pandemic vaccines, the benefit of this apparent GMT titre increase is unknown. The CHMP laid down 3 immunological criteria as a basis for considering licensure of pandemic vaccines. All these criteria were well fulfilled by Humenza (a AF03-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine) after a single dose administration in healthy subjects aged 6 months and above in three European studies. This has been shown by two independent assays - HAI and SN assays. The reliability of these immunogenicity data will  be  substantiated  independently  via  the  analysis  of  randomised  sera  submitted  to  independent laboratories. For future confirmation by a re-test, clinical trial sera need to be stored as requested by the CHMP for all pandemic vaccines.

## Clinical safety

##  Patient exposure

Overall,  1020  subjects  received  at  least  one  injection  of  an  A/H1N1  or  A/H5N1  pandemic  influenza vaccine adjuvanted with AF03 at 2.5%, given as half (196 subjects) or full (824 subjects) dose, during the Phase I study (GPF01) and the three Phase II studies (GPF07, GPF08 and GPF09) conducted in Europe  in  subjects  from  6 months  of  age.  All  were  healthy  subjects.  In  addition  to  these  subjects, 125 subjects were included in a Phase II study conducted in the USA (FUF16) to receive a full dose of the 3.8 µg HA pandemic influenza vaccine adjuvanted with AF03; and 9000 subjects are planned to be enrolled  in  a  post-authorization  safety  study  (GPF11)  to  further  increase  the  safety  database  (Also, 5000 will be vaccinated with unadjuvanted Panenza vaccine).

Medicinal product no longer authorised Overall,  around  1500  doses  of  adjuvanted  A/H1N1  pandemic  influenza  vaccine  formulations  were administered, either as half (386) or full (1208) doses, and 2214 doses of A/H5N1 or A/H1N1 influenza vaccines adjuvanted with AF03 were given, either as half or full dose. Limitation of the safety database Population The  safety  data  are  generated  from  a  healthy  population:  the  clinical  trials  excluded  subjects  with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, receiving immunosuppressive therapy, with a chronic illness that  could  interfere  with  trial  conduct  or  completion,  with  current  alcohol  or  drug  abuse,  or  those having received blood-derived products within 3 months prior to the first vaccination. The three Phase II clinical studies are conducted in Western Europe, with a predominantly Caucasian population  in  both  studies,  with  insufficient  data  to  conduct  an  analysis  of  the  safety  profile  by ethnicity.  Again,  based  on  the  safety  profile  of  the  seasonal  vaccine,  it  is  expected  that  the  clinical safety data described for the adjuvanted A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine in this application would be similar in diverse ethnic populations. Size of the safety database With a safety database of this size, the frequency of uncommon and rare adverse events cannot be accurately predicted. The safety database of 1 020 subjects that received the EU pandemic influenza vaccine adjuvanted with AF03 provides a probability of 95% to observe at least one event which occurs with an incidence of 1 / 340 (0.29%), i.e. if no event is observed in this 1 020 subjects cohort, we can reject, with an alpha level of 5%, incidences greater than 0.29%. In GPF07, in each vaccine group (N=150), there is a probability of approximately 95% of observing any  AE  with  a  true  incidence  of  2%.  For  each  vaccine  formulation,  there  is  a  probability  of approximately 95% of observing any adverse event (AE) with a true incidence of 3% in adult subjects (18 to 60 years) (N=100) and of 5.8% in elderly subjects (&gt;60 years) (N=50). In GPF08, in each vaccine group (N=100), there is a probability of approximately 95% of observing any  AE  with  a  true  incidence  of  3%.  For  each  vaccine  formulation,  there  is  a  probability  of approximately 95% of observing any AE with a true incidence of 5.8% in each stratum of age (N=50). In GPF09, for each vaccine formulation (half dose and full dose) tested (N=100 per formulation), there is a probability of approximately 95% of observing any AE with a true incidence of 3%. For each group (vaccine  formulation  in  each  of  the  age  strata,  6-11  months  subjects  and  12-35 months  subjects, N=50), there is a probability of approximately 95% of observing any AE with a true incidence of 5.8%.  Adverse events

## Adult and Elderly Subjects

In  adults,  the  overall  incidence  of  solicited  adverse  events  was  similar  across  adjuvanted  groups, whereas  in  the  elderly,  the  overall  incidence  of  solicited  adverse  events  tended  to  increase  as  the dosage of HA increased. The incidence of unsolicited adverse events was similar across groups in adult and elderly subjects.

In  GPF07, the incidence of solicited and unsolicited adverse events was slightly lower in the elderly population  compared  to  adult  subjects  aged  18 to  60  years;  such  an  observation  is  common  in seasonal  influenza  clinical  trials.  These  effects  were  not  considered  to  be  clinically  important  and overall, in all age groups and vaccine groups, the adjuvanted A/H1N1 pandemic influenza candidate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vaccine  was  considered  to  be  well  tolerated.  Solicited  and  unsolicited  reactions  were  generally  less frequently  reported  after  the  second  vaccination  than  after  the  first,  in  both  adjuvanted  vaccine groups, but the safety profile was similar after the first and after the second vaccinations.

There were no findings of clinical concern in the solicited injection site and solicited systemic adverse events within 7 days after any vaccination. For the 3.8 µg HA adjuvanted A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine, in the 7 days following any vaccination in adult and elderly subjects, injection site reactions such as injection site pain occurred with an incidence of 69.7% in adults and of 29.6% in the elderly. Other injection site reactions, such as, injection site induration, injection site erythema, injection site swelling  and  injection  site  ecchymosis  occurred  with  an  incidence  of  &lt;10%.  For  solicited  systemic adverse events within 7 days after any vaccination with the 3.8 µg HA adjuvanted A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine, headache, myalgia and malaise were very common (&gt;14%) in adults, and fever and shivering  (&lt;10%)  were  common.  In  elderly  subjects,  headache  was  very  common  (&gt;14%),  and malaise and myalgia were common (&lt;8%). Overall, most of the injection site reactions occurred within 3 days after vaccination, lasted 3 days or less and were of Grade 1.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Table 6: GPF07 - Incidence of Solicited Reactions in the 7 Days after Any Vaccination (3.8 µg HA) - Safety Analysis Set Children Aged 3 to 17 Years In  children  from  3  to  17 years  of  age,  the  overall  incidence  of  solicited  adverse  events  was  similar across  adjuvanted groups. In both age groups, solicited injection site  reactions  were  more  frequent than solicited systemic reactions, particularly in younger subjects. The incidence of unsolicited adverse events  was  similar  across  adjuvanted  groups  in  subjects  from  9  to  17 years  of  age.  In  younger subjects  from  3  to  8 years  of  age,  the  incidence  of  unsolicited  adverse  events  increased  with  the strength  of  antigen.  Overall,  solicited  reactions  and  unsolicited  events  were  less  frequent  after  the second vaccination than after the first one in both age groups. The incidence of solicited reactions in the 7 days after any vaccination is presented in Table 7.

In GPF08, the incidence of solicited reactions was similar between 3 to 8-year-old subjects and 9 to 17-year-old  subjects.  The  incidence  of  unsolicited  adverse  events  was  higher  in  9 to  17-year-old subjects than in 3 to 8-year-old subjects in subjects having received the 3.8 µg HA adjuvanted A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine. Overall, solicited adverse events (except injection site pain) were more frequent in children from 3 to 17 years of age than in adult and elderly subjects, as is common with seasonal influenza vaccines. These effects were not considered to be clinically important and overall, in all age groups and vaccine groups, the vaccine was considered to be well tolerated. It is to be noted that  the  severity  grading  scale  was  different  between  3  to  11-year-old  subjects  and  subjects  from 12 years of age.

Medicinal product no longer authorised For  the  3.8 µg HA  adjuvanted  A/H1N1  pandemic  influenza  vaccine,  in  the  7  days  following  any vaccination, injection site pain occurred with an incidence of 89.8% in 9 to 17-year-old subjects and of 88.0%  in  3 to  8-year-old  subjects.  Other  injection  site  reactions  such  as  injection  site  erythema, injection  site  induration,  and  injection  site  swelling  occurred  with  an  incidence  &gt;18%.  Injection  site ecchymosis  occurred  with  an  incidence  of  6.1%  in  9 to  17-year-old  subjects  and  26.0%  in  3 to 8-year-old subjects. For solicited systemic adverse events within 7 days after any vaccination with the 3.8 µg HA  adjuvanted  A/H1N1  pandemic  influenza  vaccine,  malaise  (&gt;44%),  headache  (&gt;42%), myalgia  (&gt;44%),  shivering  (&gt;28%),  and  fever  (&gt;12%)  were  very  common.  Overall,  most  of  the solicited reactions occurred within 3 days after vaccination, lasted 3 days or less and were of Grade 1. The incidence of Grade 3 solicited reactions was low except the increase of grade 3 fever and injection site erythema especially following second dose of the vaccine. Subjects from 6 to 35 Months of Age In subjects from 6 to 35 months of age, the overall incidence of solicited adverse events was similar across adjuvanted groups receiving half dose of adjuvant, and was slightly higher in subjects receiving a full dose of adjuvant. In 6 to 11-month subjects, solicited injection site reactions were less frequent than solicited systemic reactions, whereas in 12 to 35-month subjects solicited injection site reactions were more frequent than solicited systemic reactions. The incidence of unsolicited adverse events was similar across adjuvanted groups. The incidence of solicited reactions in the 7 days after the first vaccination is presented in each age group in Table 8.

For the 3.8 µg HA adjuvanted A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine given as a full dose, in the 7 days following the first vaccination, injection site pain/tenderness occurred with an incidence of 28.8% in 6 to 11-month-old subjects and of 50.0% in 12 to 35-month-old subjects. When the vaccine was given as half dose, the proportion of subjects with pain/tenderness decreased to 18.8% in younger subjects, and  remained  similar  in  older  subjects.  When  the  3.8 µg HA  pandemic  A/H1N1  influenza  vaccine adjuvanted  with  AF03  was  given  as  a  full  dose,  injection  site  erythema  and  induration  were  very common  in  all  subjects,  injection  site  swelling  was  very  common  in  12  to  35-month  old  subjects (&gt;10%) and the remaining solicited injection site reactions were common (&gt;5%). When the vaccine was given as half dose, injection site erythema was very common in all subjects (&gt;10%), injection site induration was very common in 12 to 35-month old subjects, and the remaining solicited injection site reactions were common (&gt;2%).

Medicinal product no longer authorised In GPF09, the incidence of solicited injection site reactions was lower in 6 to 11-month-old subjects than  in  12 to  35-month-old  subjects,  whereas  the  opposite  was  observed  for  solicited  systemic reactions.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  solicited  systemic  reactions  were  different  between  6  to 23-month-old  subjects  and  subjects  from  24 months  of  age.  The  incidence  of  unsolicited  adverse events  was  similar  between  age  groups.  In  all  age  groups  and  vaccine  groups,  the  vaccine  was considered to be well tolerated.

For  solicited  systemic  adverse  events  within  7  days  after  the  first  vaccination  with  the  3.8 µg HA adjuvanted A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine given as full dose, all solicited systemic reactions, i.e. fever, vomiting, crying abnormal, drowsiness, appetite lost and irritability, were very common in 6 to 11-month old subjects, and all solicited systemic reactions but vomiting were very common in 12 to 23-month  old  subjects.  In  24  to  35-month  old  subjects,  myalgia  and  shivering  were  very  common (&gt;10%), the remaining reactions, i.e. fever, headache and malaise, being common (&gt;2%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

When the 3.8 µg HA pandemic A/H1N1 influenza vaccine was given as half dose, the following solicited systemic reactions were very common (&gt;14%):

-  Malaise and myalgia in 24 to 35-month old subjects
-  Fever, crying abnormal, drowsiness, appetite lost and irritability in 12 to 23-month subjects

The following solicited systemic reactions were common:

-  Fever in 6 to 11-month subjects
-  Shivering and headache in 24 to 35-month old subjects.
-  Vomiting in 12 to 23-month subjects

Medicinal product no longer authorised  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events A  total  of  two  SAEs  were  reported  within  21  days  after  the  first  vaccination  with  the  7.5 µg HA adjuvanted A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine, one in GPF07 in an adult subject and one in GPF08 in a 5-year-old subject. No SAEs were reported in GPF09. Two additional SAEs were reported within 21 days after the second vaccination in GPF07: one SAE was reported after vaccination with the 3.8 µg HA adjuvanted A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine and one after vaccination with the 7.5 µg HA adjuvanted A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine. All SAEs were assessed as not related to vaccination. Line listings with all the SAEs that have been reported to the Pharmacovigilance Department in GPF07 were provided. So far, none of the SAEs taking place in any of the adjuvanted groups of both studies was assessed as related by the Sponsor or Investigator. No deaths occurred in either study. At the time of this application, no safety concern resulting from the SAE data has been identified during the clinical trials that are still on-going. AEs of special interest (AESIs) Anaphylaxis,  Guillain-Barré  syndrome,  encephalitis,  Bell's  palsy,  neuritis,  convulsions,  vasculitis, demyelinating disorders and laboratory-confirmed vaccination failure have been identified as being of special  interest  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccines.  For  all  groups  in  all  studies  conducted  during  the Clinical Development of the vaccine, none of these events of special interest was reported. Furthermore,  based  on  key  data  obtained  within  the  21 days  following  the  first  and  second vaccinations in GPF07 and GPF08, and in the 21 days following the first vaccination in GPF09, no safety signal was detected from all related adverse events reported from the three Phase II studies by system organ class. In GPF01 study, one syncopal episode took place in GPF01 in the primary vaccination series, after the administration  of  the  first  dose  of  vaccine.  This  AESI  involved  a  patient  with  a  relevant  history  of syncope occurring at the time of injections and was assessed as not related to the study vaccine on the basis on subject's previous medical history. The subject was withdrawn from the trial after this event.  Safety in special populations Pregnancies

<!-- image -->

At  the  time  when  the  FUF04  report  was  prepared,  a  total  of  12  pregnancies  were  reported  to  the Company (7 pregnancies were reported during the 6 month follow-up period after Dose 1). Pregnancy outcomes were reported for 4 of the 12 cases: 3 resulted in the delivery of healthy babies and one resulted  in  a  spontaneous  abortion  assessed  as  unrelated  by  the  Investigator  (5  months  after vaccination  with  2.5%  AF03  vaccine).  The  female  subjects  who  delivered  healthy  babies  did  not experience any AEs related to vaccination; no congenital anomalies were reported. Outcomes were not reported for 8 subjects due to the following reasons: ongoing pregnancies (n=5) and pending follow-up (n=3). There were no SAEs reported for subjects with unknown outcomes at the time this report was prepared.  Follow-up  information  about  delivery  and  newborn  or  pregnancy  termination  will  be completed. No cases of pregnancy were reported within 21 days after the first vaccination in GPF07 and GPF08 studies.

-  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The co-administration of Humenza with other vaccines or drug products was not formally investigated.

-  Discontinuation due to adverse events

In  GPF01  study,  two  subjects  who  had  received  one  of  the  adjuvanted  formulations  discontinued because of an AE (moderate nausea and mild malaise for one subject, myalgia and injection site pain for the other subject). One subject discontinued because of an SAE (vasovagal syncope).

In the FUF04 study, a total of eight subjects discontinued following the occurrence of an AE. AEs that led to discontinuation were related to vaccination in five subjects. Four of them received one of the adjuvanted formulations. AEs reported were the following:

-  allergic reaction due to vaccine

Medicinal product no longer authorised  severe muscle pain and fever  fever, dry throat, intermittent fatigue, sweats, and decrease of appetite  weakness One subject who received placebo reported a flu-like syndrome. In GPF07 study, no AE or SAE led to study discontinuation of subjects who received the any of the adjuvanted vaccines. In GPF08 study, one SAE led to study discontinuation of 3 to 8 year-old subject who received the 7.5 μ g HA adjuvanted vaccine. No other AE led to study discontinuation during the D0-D42 period in these two studies. In  GPF09  study  amongst  14  discontinuations,  only  2  were  due  to  AEs  unrelated  to  vaccine administration (skin rash and gastroesophageal reflux).  Post marketing experience There is no post-marketing experience with Humenza at present.  Discussion on clinical safety Based  on  a  consideration  of  safety  data  collected  within  21 days  after  any  vaccination  with  the adjuvanted  A/H1N1  pandemic  influenza  vaccines,  both  candidate  vaccines  were  safe  and  well tolerated. There  was  no  specific  safety  signal  detected  with  AF03  adjuvanted  vaccine  during  H5N1  and  H1N1 studies completed so far. Reactogenicity was observed in form of injection pain, erythema, injection site swelling, fever, headache, malaise, myalgia and shivering. There was some trend in reduction of adverse reaction rates following second dose especially in adults and elderly. The incidence of shivering and malaise was especially high in children of 9-17 years of age with almost 50% of children affected. The incidence of fever (&gt;38°C for at least 1 day) was higher in smaller 12 month-8 year old children than in children 9-17 years and especially in those vaccinated with two doses of full dose 3.8 and 7.5 µg+AF03 vaccine (up to 26%). However GPF08 and GPF09 studies were relatively small and therefore limited to make sound safety comparisons between different age sub-groups.   In terms of unsolicited reactions,  there  were  no  cases  for  specific  concern.  Clearly  the  incidence  of  fevers ≥ 38°C  was reaching up to 20% after second dose of 1.9-3.8 µg HA in children of 6 months to 8 years of age. Therefore the safety profile following second dose does not allow concluding on sufficient benefits of second  dose.  Relevant  warning  on  use  of  antipyretics  and  adequate  monitoring  of  fever  in  children have been implemented in the SPC. In this context a theoretical risk of febrile convulsions in exposed population cannot be ruled out.

Safety in pregnancy and lactation period was not investigated. However, the information unintentionally obtained during clinical studies with H1N1 will be continuously monitored and reported in  a  cumulative  way.  The  MAH  has  also  provided  an  outline  of  the  planned  registry  to  follow-up pregnant woman vaccinated with HUMENZA. The RMP has been updated accordingly.

The  Applicant  was  also  asked  to  justify  that  the  safety  database  was  sufficient  to  adequately characterize the safety profile of the vaccine and sufficient to support the safe us in each age group.

The current safety database can be considered sufficient to adequately characterize the common and most common adverse events, as well as those uncommon AEs occurring at a frequency of ≥ 0.29% but does not allow an uncommon AE or any rare AE with an incidence of &lt; 0.29% ~ ≥ 0.1% to be detected,  as  is  otherwise  demanded  by  new  vaccine  Guideline.  In  order  to  consolidate  the  current safety profile, the MAH committed to perform a large post-authorization safety study (GPF011) in at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

least 9,000 patients in different age groups, including immunocompromised subjects. Furthermore, the MAH committed to implement a post-licensure prospective clinical safety study (N=3 000 subjects).

A common observation associated with the use of squalene-based adjuvant is the increased incidence of  injection  site  reactions,  particularly  pain,  compared  to  the  non-adjuvanted  formulation.  This observation is expected, as with the use of any other emulsion adjuvant, and may be related to the increase  of  inflammation  at  the  injection  site,  corroborating  with  the  stimulation  of  the  immune response. This difference is not considered to be of clinical concern. Regarding systemic events, the addition  of  a  squalene-based  adjuvant  is  not  generally  associated  with  an  increased  incidence  of systemic events.

The data from GPF01, GPF07, GPF08 and GPF09 suggest that, in accordance with the predicted effect of adding squalene-based adjuvant as described above, the incidence of injection site reactions after the first vaccination was slightly higher in the presence of the adjuvant; there appeared to be no major effect regarding systemic reactions.

Pivotal  trials  GPF07,  GPF08  and  GPF09  exploring  the  safety  of  an  AF03-adjuvanted  swine  A/H1N1 influenza vaccine are currently ongoing. From the safety data obtained so far for these trials and from the SAEs reported to the Global Pharmacovigilance Department (GPVD) until the 20 th  February 2010, no major safety concern is to be underlined. Injection site reactions, headache, myalgia and malaise were nevertheless considered as important safety risks due to the observed frequency of occurrence in GPF07,  GPF08  and  GPF09  clinical  trials.  In  addition,  injection  site  reactions,  fever,  vomiting,  crying abnormal, drowsiness, appetite lost and irritability in 6 to 23 months population are also considered as important identified risks considering their high frequency of occurrence in GPF09.

Medicinal product no longer authorised Finally, in relation to the reproductible finding of acinar cells necrosis and apoptosis observed in nonclinical studies, the possibility of an autoimmune syndrome development following AF03 administration has been considered. However, although the reason for the changes in the lachrymal glands is unclear, an overview of the data and literature provides supporting evidence that the lesions are less likely to indicate  such  a  pathologic  process.  The  time  and  the  dose-dependent  relationship  between  AF03 necrosis/apoptosis in animals and any potential theoretical risks in humans is difficult to appreciate at this moment. The time required for an autoimmune condition to manifest can be as long as several months to several years. Therefore the company has committed to monitor eye symptoms in GPF11 postmarketing study as well as in the post-licensure prospective clinical safety study planned in 3000 subjects and to refer any found patients for further screening of  autoimmune antibodies and longterm follow-up. 2.5 Pharmacovigilance Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements. Risk Management Plan The MAH submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan. In non clinical studies AF03 was shown to induce a higher incidence of minimal apoptosis/necrosis in the lachrymal tissues of rabbits at twice the human dose than in controls, which was  reversible within 14 days. The evidence to date suggests that the apoptosis/necrosis in the toxicology studies is not related to autoimmunity, but the exact mechanism is not known. A study conducted with the H1N1 AF03 adjuvanted vaccine established the no observed effect dose level in relation to apoptotis/necrosis induction  in  the  lachrymal  tissues  at  one  human  dose.  No  signal  that  would  correlate  with  an ophthalmic  dysfunction  was  identified  to  this  date  and  the  applicant  commits  to  monitor  in  the post-marketing setting visual and ocular adverse events which might relate to the findings in the non clinical studies for AF03.

Additionally,  from  supportive  trials  GPF01  and  FUF04  testing  a  H5N1  AF03-Adjuvanted  Pandemic Influenza Vaccine in 216 and 297 healthy adult subjects respectively, no important identified risk which could have a major negative impact on the benefit/ risk assessment of HUMENZA is to be identified.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Additionally,  a  group  of  adverse  events  of  special  interest  were  considered  as  potential  risks  for HUMENZA. This list of events was developed using as reference the known safety profile of seasonal influenza vaccines, which includes:

-  Neuritis;
-  Convulsions;
-  Anaphylaxis;
-  Encephalitis;
-  Guillain-Barré syndrome;
-  Bell's palsy;
-  Demyelinating disorders;
-  Vasculitis;
-  Laboratory Confirmed Vaccination failure.

Medicinal product no longer authorised These  potential  risks  occur  very  rarely  after  seasonal  influenza  vaccination,  an  aspect  which  could justify why none of these events occurred during HUMENZA clinical development phase as of today. In this  line  of  thought,  the  RMP  proposes  4  main  pharmacovigilance  activities  which  have  per  aim  to further explore and guarantee the safety usage of HUMENZA as soon as it starts being more widely used in the post-marketing setting: 1. Routine Pharmacovigilance activities: as soon as HUMENZA moves from a pre to post-marketing  setting,  a  new  set  of  pharmacovigilance  activities  which  qualify  as  routine activities  (collection  and  analysis  of  AE  spontaneous  reports,  aggregate  reports  and  signal detection activities) will start and be conducted on an ongoing basis. These have per aim to detect  and  characterize  (qualitative  and  quantitative  data,  reporting  rate  trend)  all  relevant adverse  events  which  occur  in  biggest  possible  pool  of  patients, i.e. ,  the  post-marketing setting; 2. Routine Risk Minimization activities: activities which will have per aim to minimize some of the identified  or  potential  risks  presented  in  this  RMP,  such  as  potential  contamination  of  vials, vaccination errors and other risks linked to adverse events. In addition, the Applicant proposes an  additional  risk  minimization  activity,  linked  to  the  fact  that  a  mixing  procedure  prior  to vaccine administration is needed; 3. Continue the clinical development program assessing the safety of HUMENZA (still ongoing). The MAH commits to implement an additional post-licensure prospective clinical safety study (N=3 000 subjects from 6 months of age). While the use of adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine remains the preferred choice, adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine can be considered as a realistic option for the study given the current epidemiology, feasibility and risk-benefit to study volunteers. 4. Post-authorization safety studies: A prospective non-interventional post-marketing cohort safety study involving 9 000 subjects (GPF11) will be conducted in order to further consolidate the known safety profile of HUMENZA. In addition, sanofi pasteur participates in a H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine post-marketing GBS surveillance study. In regards to studies contributing with additional safety data in pregnant women, the applicant will implement a prospective pregnancy registry for HUMENZA, which will combine data on pregnant women exposed to HUMENZA from the following sources: clinical trials; spontaneously reported case reports; literature reports; post-marketing studies; and through a toll-free call-in phone number. Follow-up of pregnancy outcome and adverse events will be proactively collected. Results will be reported on a monthly-basis, as part of the S-PSUR.

## Important missing information

Medicinal product no longer authorised Vaccine effectiveness ECDC vaccine effectiveness studies including a pooled analysis for case-control studies will permit the evaluation of the effectiveness of H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines which will be used in Europe. Sanofi pasteur clinical trials have scheduled immuno-logical tests for cross-reactivity in case potential drifted variants of the A/H1N1 virus occur. SPC section 4.2: HUMENZA is currently not recommended in children less than 6 months of age. Very rare AEs (other than AE of special interest) which could not be identified during the clinical development -the 3 000 subjects clinical trial and the post-marketing safety cohort study GPF11 will increase the opportunity to detect rare AEs which would not be detected during the clinical development. Not Applicable Data on pregnant or lactating women - Post-marketing safety cohort study GPF11 - Prospective pregnancy registry containing data from various sources on pregnant women exposed to HUMENZA. Data will be communicated to Health Agencies on a monthly basis. SPC section 4.6: No data have been generated in pregnant or lactating women with the vaccine HUMENZA or with any other vaccine containing adjuvant AF03. A reproductive and developmental toxicity study conducted in rabbits with HUMENZA showed no effects on embryo fetal development. The use of HUMENZA may be considered during pregnancy and lactation if this is thought to be necessary, taking into account official recommendations. Data on immuno-compromized individuals - Post-marketing safety cohort study GPF11 SPC section 4.4: Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immuno-suppression may be insufficient .

Medicinal product no longer authorised - Section 4.4 Special precautions for storage \" Do not freeze\" - Vaccine contains thiomersal as a preservative. - Additional stand-alone instructional materials (pictogram) to demonstrate proper mixing. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the MA application is of the opinion that the above risk minimisation activities are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product: see as detailed in section 2.3 of this CHMP Assessment Report. 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation Quality The manufacture of the H1N1 antigen, the H1N1 formulated vial and the AFO3 (adjuvant) vial are appropriately controlled. Adequate release and shelf life specifications have been set. Commitments are made by the applicant to update some missing information, which does not impact on the risk/benefit assessment of this vaccine. Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology The  non-clinical  programme  consisted  in  supportive  pharmacology/toxicology  data  generated  with AF03-adjuvanted  H5N1  or  seasonal  H1N1  or  with  AF03  alone,  and  in  pharmacology/toxicity  studies performed with AF03-adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic vaccine including reproduction toxicity and singledose toxicity addressing specific findings to the lachrymal glands. The  data  provided  from  reproduction  toxicity  studies,  based  on  draft  reports,  showed  that  6x  I.M. injections in rats or rabbits with AF03 alone at concentrations of 1.25-2.5% (rats) or 2.5-5% (rabbits), or 5x I.M. injections in rabbits with 7.5 µgHA + 2.5% AF03, did not cause toxic effects on foetus or on post-natal development. The data on lachrymal glands of male rabbits have been provided in provisional report and showed that I.M.  injection  with  one  human  dose  of  AF03/H1N1  vaccine  induced  histological  changes  that  were comparable to the background. This dose level tested in rabbits ensures a safety margin which is well acceptable for the toxicological testing of a vaccine in this species.

## Efficacy

Clinical immunogenicity data derived from healthy subjects, which are routinely taken as a means of efficacy  assessment  for  other  pandemic  vaccines,  are  available  for  HUMENZA  for  all  age  groups  to which the CHMP are currently recommended, i.e., 6 - 35 months, 3 - 8 y, 9 - 17 y, 18 - 60 y, and &gt; 60 y healthy subjects.

In adults from the age of 18 years the administration of a single dose of 3.8 µg HA elicited antibody responses  that  exceeded  the  CHMP  criteria  except  that  subjects  aged  &gt;  70  years  who  were seronegative at baseline required two doses.  In subjects aged 3-8 years and 9-17 years a single dose of 3.8 µg HA/AF03 elicited antibody responses that exceeded the CHMP criteria applied to young adults

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and these data were supported by the NA titres. In children ages 3-8 years, there was a very marked increment  in  GMT  after  the  second  dose  but  it  is  not  known  whether  this  would  result  in  a  clinical benefit.  In  subjects  aged  6  to  35  months  a  single  half  adult  dose  elicited  antibody  responses  that exceeded the CHMP criteria applied to young adults and all except one subject achieved a NA titre of at least 1:80.

Antibody persistence information will be collected post-approval but relies mainly on A/H5N1 data preauthorization.

The  safety  profile  of  Humenza  is  based  on  three  main  studies  performed  in  subjects  aged  6  -  35 months, 3 - 17 years and ≥ 18 years from which no safety concerns were raised during a D0 - D42 period after one or two doses of vaccines. This safety profile is further supported by 6 months safety follow-up  data  from  two  supportive  studies  GPF01  and  FUF04  where  the  safety  of  two  doses  of AF03/H5N1 vaccines was investigated.

However, safety data package of Humenza submitted so far suffers from similar limitations as do other pandemic vaccines, including lack of data from high-risk groups and diseased subjects, lack of data on concurrent use with other vaccines or drugs, and small database unable to detect rare adverse events. A  sound  RMP  and  PhVS  has  been  put  in  place  in  order  to  minimise  the  potential  risks.  Although unspecific  for  Humenza,  the  occurrence  of  erythema,  fever,  shivering  and  malaise  in  a  significant proportion of vaccinees following Humenza (especially following second dose) highlights the identified risk.

Medicinal product no longer authorised From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.  User consultation A user consultation test has been performed and was considered acceptable. Risk-benefit assessment Benefits The  real  benefits  of  Humenza  can  only  be  assessed  by  its  use  during  a  pandemic.  At  present  the potential benefit can only be evaluated based on detailed characterisation of immunological responses to vaccination with AF03/H1N1 obtained in the three Phase II clinical studies and with supportive data obtained with AF03/H5N1 A single dose of 3.8 µg HA/AF03 has been shown to be suitably immunogenic in children aged 3-17 years old and adults 18-60 years old. Similarly, in subjects aged 6-35 months, it was found that one half  adult  dose  will  be  adequately  immunogenic.    Based  on  narrow  age  strata  immunogenicity analyses, only two-dose schedule can be advocated in elderly aged &gt; 60 years old. Data  from  the  three  main  studies  show  that  the  vaccine  induces  a  strong  immune  response  in  all subjects. Therefore the expected benefit of Humenza is to provide some protection against clinically-apparent infection due to A(H1N1)v. Risks The  safety  and  reactogenicity  profile  of  the  vaccine  resembles  what  was  seen  for  other  pandemic vaccines that contain an adjuvant like MF59 and AS03.

Cases of pregnancy with favourable outcomes were noted in supportive study, but the number of cases was very small and no firm conclusion can be drawn. The recommendation will be updated as soon as data on use of Humenza in pregnancy become available.

AF03 is regarded as a new adjuvant and licensure of Humenza does not build on an approved mock-up vaccine. In this respect, supportive safety follow-up and booster data with AF03/H5N1 vaccines are considered  very  helpful.  Overall,  no  safety  concern  was  identified  following  the  booster  vaccination, and within the time period of up to 12 month follow up after primary series and 6 month follow-up after booster vaccination.

The specific commitments include collection of safety, immunogenicity and effectiveness data from the ongoing and planned clinical studies.

## Balance

Medicinal product no longer authorised Based on all the quality safety and efficacy data specific to the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)v strain and on supportive data provided with the H5N1 strain, it is considered that in the current pandemic situation  the  benefits  outweigh  the  risks  that  may  be  associated  with  the  use  of  the  vaccine  in accordance with the SPC. A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.  the following additional risk minimisation activities were required: see as detailed in section 2.5 The CHMP considers that the eligibility in accordance with Article 2(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 together with the criteria of conditional Marketing Authorisation in accordance with and 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 are fulfilled. Furthermore, the CHMP took note that the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan is not fully completed yet as only some of the measures are completed. Already available paediatric data of studies subject to this plan are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by majority decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Humenza  in  the  'Prophylaxis  of  influenza  in  an  officially declared  pandemic  situation'  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the conditional marketing authorisation.
