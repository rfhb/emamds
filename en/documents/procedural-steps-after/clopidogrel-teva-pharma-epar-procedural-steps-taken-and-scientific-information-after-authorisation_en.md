In addition, section 4.8 has been amended with minor details on the CURE study. Additional changes have been added to the SmPC and Package Leaflet in order to bring it in line with the revised QRD template (version 7.3). In addition to the amendments to update the PI texts in line with the innovator, the MAH propose the removal of the version number of the PhV system approved included in Annex II as per EMA requirement. The MAH would also like to take the opportunity to propose some additional minor amendments in the translated PI texts in some languages which have been introduced in the product no longer authorised |
