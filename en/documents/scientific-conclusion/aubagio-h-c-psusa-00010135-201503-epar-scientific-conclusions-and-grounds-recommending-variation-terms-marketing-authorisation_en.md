## Scientific conclusions and grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation

International non-proprietary name:TERIFLUNOMIDE

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for TERIFLUNOMIDE, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

## Severe skin reactions

There  have  been  two  (2)  cases  of  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome  and  two  (2)  cases  reported  with  skin exfoliation reported during the period under review, and seven (7) cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and 27 cases reporting skin exfoliation cumulatively. Upon review of post-marketing cases with severe skin disorders (potentially Stevens-Johnson syndrome), it was observed that teriflunomide could not be excluded from potential causality in cases where time to onset, de-challenge/re-challenge information, and discontinuation from teriflunomide were available.

## Pancreatitis

There have been eight (8) cases of pancreatitis reported during the period under review, and 18 cases cumulatively. Upon review of post-marketing cases with pancreatitis, as well as the review of clinical trial  data,  statistical  signals,  and  epidemiology,  the  PRAC  considered  that  teriflunomide  could  not  be excluded from potential causality in cases where time to onset, de-challenge/ rechallenge information, and discontinuation from teriflunomide were available.

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Post-marketing  cases  with  hypersensitivity  reactions  (immediate  or  delayed)  some  of  which  were severe,  such  as  anaphylaxis  and  angioedema,  were  reported.  The  PRAC  observed  that  teriflunomide could not be excluded  from potential causal association in cases where  time to onset,  dechallenge/rechallenge  information  and  discontinuation  were  available.  Two  (2)  patients  underwent reportedly the rapid elimination procedure; however, the outcome was unknown for both patients.

## Headache

There  have  been  cumulatively  2179  Adverse  Drug  Reactions  (ADR)  reports  from  post-marketing sources. Upon review of post-marketing cases for headache, as well as the review of clinical trial data (placebo-controlled  studies),  the  PRAC  considered  that  there  is  a  trend  towards  a  causal  association with teriflunomide for headache.

## Blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased

The  reported  cases  together  with  the  higher  number  of  CPK  increase  cases  or  associated  events  in pooled clinical trials (7 mg /14 mg) show a clear trend towards a causal association. CPK increase is labelled  as  a  common  ADR  in  section  4.8 of  the  SmPC  of  leflunomide  (Arava).  Upon  review of  postmarketing cases for CPK increase, as well as the review of clinical trial data (placebo-controlled studies), the PRAC considered that there is a trend towards a causal association with teriflunomide.

## Arthralgia

Clinical trial data shows a trend towards more events in the pooled teriflunomide group (7mg /14 mg) compared to placebo group. The reported cases together with the higher number of arthralgia cases or associated  events  in  clinical  trials  show  a  clear  trend  towards  a  causal  association.  Upon  review  of clinical  trial  data,  the  PRAC  considered  that  there  is  a  trend  towards  a  causal  association  with teriflunomide.

## Palpitations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  placebo-controlled  studies  palpitations  were  reported  &gt;1%  more  often  in  the  teriflunomide  7  mg group (but not in the teriflunomide 14 mg group) when compared to placebo. Upon review of clinical trial data, the PRAC considered that there is a trend towards a causal association with teriflunomide.

## Sepsis

Cumulatively, there have been a total of 24 case reports (all were assessed as serious) referring to 22 events of sepsis (one wound sepsis and one urosepsis), of which five were with fatal outcome and one life-threatening sepsis. The 5 patients who died due to sepsis (4 due to urinary tract infection and 1 secondary to decubitus ulcers), all had advanced Multiple Sclerosis disease and multiple drug therapy. The PRAC is of the opinion that there is enough evidence leading to the conclusion that severe infections during teriflunomide treatment can result to sepsis.

## Peripheral neuropathy

In  placebo-controlled  studies,  in  total  there  have  been  17  cases  of  peripheral  neuropathy  that  were confirmed by nerve conduction studies, out of 898 patients treated. Of these 17 patients, there were 5 patients who discontinued treatment.

Therefore, in view of available data regarding teriflunomide, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for TERIFLUNOMIDE the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing TERIFLUNOMIDE is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.
