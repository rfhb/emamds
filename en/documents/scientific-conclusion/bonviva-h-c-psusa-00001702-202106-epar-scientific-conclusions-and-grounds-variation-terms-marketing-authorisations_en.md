## Scientific conclusions

Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR(s)  for  ibandronic  acid,  sodium ibandronate, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on hypocalcaemia from spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and the fact that  hypocalcaemia is an identified risk for ibandronic acid, the PRAC  considers  that a causal  relationship between  ibandronic acid  and hypocalcaemia is established. The PRAC concluded that  the product information of products containing ibandronic acid (osteoporotic indication (Bonviva)) should be amended accordingly.

Update of  section 4.8 of  the SmPC to add the  ADR hypocalcaemia with  a frequency uncommon.  The Package leaflet is updated accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the  basis of the scientific  conclusions for ibandronic acid, sodium ibandronate the  CHMP  is of the opinion  that  the  benefit-risk  balance of  the  medicinal product(s)  containing  ibandronic  acid, sodium ibandronate is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
