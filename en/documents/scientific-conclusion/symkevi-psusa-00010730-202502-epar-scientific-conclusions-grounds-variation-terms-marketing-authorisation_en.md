## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for tezacaftor / ivacaftor, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on cases of liver failure reported in patients both with and without pre-existing liver disease for elexacaftor / tezacaftor / ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) and in the context of updates made to the product information for ELX/TEZ/IVA, given the very serious nature of the events in question, the PRAC considers that the product information of products containing tezacaftor / ivacaftor should be amended accordingly.

In view of available data on anxiety and insomnia from post-marketing reports including in some cases positive de-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between tezacaftor / ivacaftor and anxiety and insomnia is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing tezacaftor / ivacaftor should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tezacaftor / ivacaftor the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing tezacaftor / ivacaftor is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
