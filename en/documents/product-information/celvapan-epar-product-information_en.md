<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Celvapan suspension for injection Influenza vaccine (H1N1)v (whole virion, Vero cell derived, inactivated)

<!-- image -->

2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Whole virion influenza vaccine, inactivated containing antigen of strain *: A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v 7.5 micrograms** per 0.5 ml dose * propagated in Vero cells (continuous cell line of mammalian origin) ** expressed in micrograms haemagglutinin. This is a multidose container. See section 6.5 for the number of doses per vial. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Suspension for injection. The vaccine is a clear to opalescent, translucent suspension. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Prophylaxis of influenza caused by A(H1N1)v 2009 virus (See section 4.4). Celvapan should be used in accordance with Official Guidance 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The dose recommendations take into account available data from clinical studies in healthy subjects who received two doses of Celvapan (H1N1)v. From clinical studies limited immunogenicity and safety data are available for Celvapan (H1N1)v in healthy adult and older subjects and in children (see section 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1). Adults and older people One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. A second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. A second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks.

Children aged 6 to 35 months One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date. A second dose of vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Children aged less than 6 months Vaccination is not currently recommended in this age group.

For further information, see sections 4.8 and 5.1.

It is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Celvapan, complete the vaccination course with Celvapan (see section 4.4). Method of administration Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral thigh, depending on the muscle mass. 4.3 Contraindications History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues (e.g. formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose) of this vaccine. See section 4.4 for Special warnings and special precautions for use. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use The vaccine can only be expected to protect against influenza caused by A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v-like strains. Caution is needed when administrating this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance(s), to any of the excipients and to trace residues e.g. formaldehyde, benzonase, or sucrose. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following CELVAPAN vaccination (see section 4.8). Such reactions have occurred both in patients with a history of multiple allergies and in patients with no known allergy. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. Immunisation shall be postponed in patients with severe febrile illness or acute infection. Celvapan should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly. There are no data with Celvapan using the subcutaneous route. Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings. Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient. A protective response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). There are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Celvapan with other (H1N1)v vaccines. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

There are no data on co-administration of Celvapan with other vaccines. However, if co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified.

The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment. Following influenza vaccination, false positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, and especially, HTLV-1. In such cases, the Western Blot method is negative. These transitory false-positive results may be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation The safety of Celvapan in pregnancy and lactation has been assessed in a limited number of pregnant women. Data from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do not suggest malformations or fetal or neonatal toxicity. Animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with H5N1 strain vaccines (A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005) do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to female fertility, pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). The use of Celvapan may be considered during pregnancy if this is thought to be necessary, taking into account official recommendations. Celvapan may be used in lactating women. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Some undesirable effects mentioned under section 4.8 'Undesirable effects' may affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects  Clinical trials with Celvapan (H1N1)v Adults and Older People In a clinical study the 7.5 µg dose of Celvapan (H1N1)v was administered to adults aged 18 to 59 years (N = 101) and older people over 60 years of age (N = 101). Safety data after the first and second vaccination suggest a similar safety profile to that reported for the influenza vaccines using a H5N1 strain. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Clinical trials were conducted with a version of Celvapan containing a H5N1 vaccine strain (see section 5.1) in approximately 3700 subjects (ranging in age from 18 to 60 years and above), and in special risk groups of approximately 300 subjects each, consisting of immune-compromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions.

ADR frequency is based upon the following scale: Very Common ( ≥ 1/10); Common ( ≥ 1/100 &lt; 1/10), Uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 - &lt; 1/100), Rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 - &lt; 1/1,000), Very Rare (&lt; 1/10,000) Clinical trials with a version of Celvapan containing a H5N1 vaccine strain Medicinal product no longer authorised

Most of the reactions were mild in nature, of short duration and qualitatively similar to those induced by influenza vaccines. There were fewer reactions after the second dose of the vaccine compared with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the first dose. The safety profile in healthy subjects &gt; 60 years of age, in immune-compromised subjects and patients with chronic disease conditions is similar to the safety profile in healthy subjects.

##  Post-marketing surveillance

## Pandemic Observational Study with Celvapan (H1N1)v

In an observational safety study including 3216 subjects aged 6 months to 60 years and older, the nature of adverse events was consistent with those observed in other clinical studies in adults and children. The following adverse reactions were reported at a higher frequency category than in the other clinical studies: Adults aged 18 years and older: Very common: Injection site pain, injection site redness, muscle pain Uncommon: influenza like illness Children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years: Very common: fatigue, headache Uncommon: cough Children aged 6 months to 5 years: Very common: Injection site redness, drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite, crying Celvapan (H1N1)v The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in the post-marketing experience in adults and children receiving Celvapan (H1N1)v. The frequency of these adverse reactions is not known. Immune system disorder: Anaphylactic reaction*, Hypersensitivity* Nervous system disorders: Febrile convulsion Hypoaesthesia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Angioedema *Such reactions have been manifested by respiratory distress, hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, cyanosis, pyrexia, flushing, angioedema, and urticaria Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Pain in extremity (in the majority of cases reported as pain in the injection site arm) Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines

From post-marketing surveillance with egg-derived trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines, the following serious adverse reactions have been reported:

## Uncommon:

Generalised skin reactions Rare: Neuralgia, paraesthesia, transient thrombocytopenia. Very rare: Vasculitis with transient renal involvement. Neurological disorders, such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis and Guillain Barré syndrome. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has been reported. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccines, ATC Code J07BB01 Clinical studies with Celvapan (H1N1)v currently provide:  Safety and immunogenicity data obtained three weeks after administration of two doses of Celvapan (H1N1)v to healthy adults aged 18 years and older.  Safety and immunogenicity data obtained three weeks after administration of two doses of Celvapan (H1N1)v to healthy children aged 6 months to 17 years. Clinical studies in which a version of Celvapan containing HA derived from A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) was administered at day 0 and at day 21 provide:  Safety and immunogenicity data in healthy adults, including older people.  Safety and immunogenicity data in special risk groups (immunocompromised and chronically ill) Immune response against A/California/07/2009(H1N1)v Medicinal product no longer authorised

Immune response against a version of Celvapan containing A/H5N1 vaccine strains

The immunogenicity of the vaccine containing 7.5 µg non-adjuvanted HA derived from strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 has been evaluated in two clinical studies in adults aged 18 - 59 years (N = 312) and in older subjects aged 60 years and older (N = 272) following a 0, 21 day schedule.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The seroprotection rates, seroconversion rates and seroconversion factors reported in adults and older subjects were comparable with Celvapan (H1N1)v.

## Results from Vaccine Effectiveness Study in Jersey

Pandemic vaccine effectiveness against the medically-attended influenza like illness (ILI) with laboratory-confirmation as A(H1N1)v, was assessed for the vaccination campaign in Jersey 2009/2010 in a case control study (test-negative design). Younger children 6 months to 9 years received Celvapan, while older children from 9 to 18 years of age received an adjuvanted split pandemic vaccine. There were no reported vaccine failures in either of these paediatric age groups. Crude vaccine effectiveness of one dose of pandemic vaccine among children was 100% (95% CI: 70-100%). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-Clinical data obtained with Celvapan containing a H5N1 vaccine strain demonstrated alterations in liver enzymes and calcium levels in repeat dose toxicity studies in rats. Such alterations in liver function have not been seen to date in human clinical studies. Alterations in calcium metabolism have not been examined in human clinical studies. Animal reproductive toxicology studies do not indicate harmful effects in regard to female fertility, embryo-foetal and pre- and post-natal toxicity. 6.

## PACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER

## CELVAPAN suspension for injection

Influenza vaccine (H1N1)v (whole virion, Vero cell derived, inactivated)

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

-  you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38 °C). If this applies to you then your vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold should not be problem, but your doctor or nurse should advise whether you could still be vaccinated with Celvapan.

-Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Celvapan is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you receive Celvapan 3. How Celvapan is given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Celvapan 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Celvapan is and what it is used for Celvapan is a vaccine to prevent influenza (flu) caused by A(H1N1)v 2009 virus When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defense system) will produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. 2. What you need to know before you receive Celvapan You should not receive Celvapan:  if you previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of Celvapan or to any of the substances that may be present in trace amounts as follows: formaldehyde, benzonase, sucrose. -Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine. Take special care with Celvapan: Check with your doctor or nurse before you are given Celvapan if  you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient contained in the vaccine, to formaldehyde, benzonase, or to sucrose. (see section 6. Further information). Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  you have problems with your immune system, since your response to the vaccine may then be poor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first few weeks after vaccination with Celvapan the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given Celvapan.
-  you have a bleeding condition or a bleeding problem or you bruise easily.

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before having Celvapan. This is because the vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed.

Other medicines and Celvapan Please tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription or have recently been given any other vaccine. There is no information on administration of the vaccine Celvapan with other vaccines. However, if this cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs. In such cases, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense. Pregnancy and breast-feeding Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby. Your doctor will discuss with you whether you should be given Celvapan. The vaccine may be used during breast-feeding. Driving and using machines Some effects mentioned under section 4. 'Possible side effects' may affect your ability to drive or use machines. 3. How Celvapan is given Your doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations. The vaccine will be injected into a muscle (usually in the upper arm). The vaccine should never be given into a vein. Adults and older people: A dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given. A second dose of the vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. Children and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years of age: A dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given. A second dose of the vaccine should be given after an interval of at least three weeks. Children aged less than 6 months: Vaccination is not currently recommended in this age group. When Celvapan is given for the first dose, it is recommended that Celvapan (and not another vaccine against (H1N1)v) be given for the complete vaccination course.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

Allergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock. Doctors are aware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases.

## Side effects from clinical studies in adults and older people

<!-- image -->

Very common: Pain and redness where the injection was given, aching muscles Uncommon: Influenza like illness

The side effects listed below have occurred with Celvapan (H1N1)v in clinical studies in adults, including older people. In the clinical studies, most side effects were mild in nature and short term. Very common:  Headache  Feeling tired Common:  Runny nose and sore throat  Insomnia (difficulty sleeping)  Dizziness  Eye irritation  Stomach pain  Increased sweating  Rash, hives  Joint and muscle pain  Fever, shivering, generally feeling unwell  Pain, redness, swelling or a hard lump where the injection was given, reduced movement in the arm injected Side effects from clinical studies in children Children and adolescents 6 months to 17 years of age In a clinical study the frequency and type of side effects after the first and second injection were basically similar to that seen in the adult and older population using Celvapan. However, some differences in frequency and type of side effects were observed. Specifically, headache, vertigo (spinning feeling), cough, feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, pain in the arms or legs and tiredness were observed commonly in children and adolescents. Additionally, in the case of the 9 to 17 year olds pain at the injection site was very common. In children aged 6 to 35 months disturbed sleep and fever were very common, and decreased appetite, restlessness, irritability, crying and drowsiness were common. Side effects from the Pandemic Observational Study with CELVAPAN (H1N1)v Results from a clinical study done on marketed vaccine confirmed the safety profile as observed in the clinical studies. The following adverse reactions were reported at a higher frequency category than in the other clinical studies: Adults aged 18 years and older: Medicinal product no longer authorised

Very common: Redness where the injection was given, drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite, crying  Clinical trials with a similar vaccine In a study with a similar influenza vaccine (containing a H5N1 vaccine strain) that included healthy adults and older people, subjects with a weakened immune system and patients with long-term conditions, the safety profile was similar to that in healthy adults.  Side effects observed during post-marketing surveillance The side effects listed below have occurred with Celvapan (H1N1)v in adults and children during the pandemic flu vaccination program. -Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions leading to a dangerous decrease in blood pressure which, if untreated, may lead to shock. Your doctors know that this might happen and will have emergency treatment ready to use. -Fits due to fever -Reduced skin sensitivity -Pain in arms and or legs (in the majority of cases reported as pain in the vaccination arm) -Flu-like illness -Swelling of tissue just below the skin.  Side effects observed with flu vaccines given routinely every year The side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with vaccines given routinely every year to prevent flu. They may also happen with Celvapan. Uncommon:  generalized skin reactions including urticaria (hives) Rare:  severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves  low blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising Very rare: vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney problems) neurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system), neuritis (inflammation of nerves) and a type of paralysis known as Guillain-Barré Syndrome If any of these side effects occur, please tell your doctor or nurse immediately.
