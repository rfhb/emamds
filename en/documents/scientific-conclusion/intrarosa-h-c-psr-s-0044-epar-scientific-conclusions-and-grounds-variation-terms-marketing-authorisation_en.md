## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report for the non-interventional imposed PASS final study report for the medicinal product(s) mentioned above, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Intrarosa (prasterone) is removed from the additional monitoring list as the condition to the marketing authorisation has been fulfilled. This relates to the non-interventional PASS - Drug Utilisation Study (DUS) to describe the baseline characteristics, utilisation patterns of EU postmenopausal women initiating treatment with Intrarosa and to assess whether EU prescribers abide by the contraindications stated in the EU SmPC.

Therefore, the statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle, is removed from the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet.

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce a change to the list of local representatives.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for the results of the study for the medicinal product(s) mentioned above, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of these medicinal product(s) is unchanged, subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP is of the opinion that the terms of the marketing authorisation of the medicinal product mentioned above should be varied.
