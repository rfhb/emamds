| A31/0007  | On 17 April 2013, further to the emergence of new evidence from the scientific literature on dual RAS blockade therapy and given the seriousness of the identified safety concerns, the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) initiated a review under Article 31 of Council Directive 2001/83/EC, requesting the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) to issue a recommendation on the benefit- risk of dual RAS blockade therapy through the combined use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or aliskiren and to determine whether any regulatory measures should be taken on the marketing authorisations of the products involved in this procedure. | 22/05/2014 | 04/09/2014 | SmPC and PL | For further information please refer to the Renin- angiotensin-system (RAS)-acting agents Article 31 referral - Assessment report. |
