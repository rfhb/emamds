| EMEA/H/C/ 000666/A20/ 0012 | Pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of 31 March 2004, the European Commission requested on 20 October 2008, the opinion of the CHMP on measures necessary to ensure the safe and effective use of the above mentioned medicinal product further to an increased concern over psychiatric adverse events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 23/10/2008          | Marketing Authorisation withdrawn on 16/01/2009 Please refer to Public Statement | longer Marketing Authorisation withdrawn on 16/01/2009 Please refer to Public Statement | authorised Please refer to the Scientific Conclusions: EMEA/H/C/000666/A20/0012                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| II/0011                    | Medicinal product Update (based on the third PSUR) of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to include a further warning related to depressive reactions and a new warning concerning diabetic patients as well as to add hypoglycaemia and tremor as uncommon adverse reactions and psychotic disorders (including hallucinations, delusion and paranoia), rash, convulsions, disturbance in attention, headache and abdominal pain as post-marketing adverse reactions. Relevant sections of the Package Leaflet (PL) were amended accordingly. An editorial correction was made in Annex II. | 30/05/2008          | no 17/07/2008                                                                    | SPC, Annex II, PL                                                                       | Following the third PSUR assessment, the CHMP concluded that depression may occur as a side effect of Acomplia in patients who have no obvious risk factors, apart from obesity itself. More than half of the patients who develop such side effects do so within one month of starting treatment, and approximately 80% do so within three months. Consequently, the CHMP recommended an update of the product information to reflect this new information and to advise prescribers to monitor patients for signs and symptoms of psychiatric disorders, particularly depression, after the start of treatment. Additionally, cumulative reviews were performed by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) for a number of adverse reactions such as hypoglycaemia, tremor, psychotic disorders, rash, convulsions, disturbance in attention, headache and abdominal pain. Further to these cumulative reviews, the CHMP recommended to include all these adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SPC as well as to add a new warning in section 4.4 to inform prescribers that monitoring of blood glucose levels is recommended in diabetic patients. |

| II/0008 | Medicinal product Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet Update of section 4.3 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to reflect a new contraindication in patients with ongoing major depression and/or ongoing antidepressive treatment. In addition, a warning including additional information on psychiatric safety has been included in section 4.4 of the SPC and section 4.8 has been updated with psychiatric adverse events (suicidal ideation, aggressiveness and aggressive behaviour). The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. | 19/07/2007          | no 31/08/2007                            | longer SPC, PL                   | On June 2006, the CHMP discussed the psychiatric safety of Acomplia and requested the MAH to provide all available data with regards to psychiatric events (mainly suicidal- and depression-related events) in patients treated with Acomplia. The CHMP also requested the MAH to propose a modification of the product information accordingly. These CHMP requests have been addressed through the present variation. The MAH provided all available data on psychiatric adverse events from spontaneous reporting and from clinical trials conducted after the granting of the Marketing Authorisation. Some of these clinical trials were still ongoing at the time of submission of the data. The provided data suggest that the risk of depression is approximately doubled in patients taking Acomplia, compared to obese or overweight patients not taking the medicine. In a small minority of cases, this could lead to suicidal ideation or even suicide attempts. This doubling of the risk of depression occurs in all types of patients; however, this risk may be increased in patients with a past history of depression. Although this pattern of side effects is similar to what was seen during the approval procedure of the medicine, the CHMP concluded that this increased risk of |

This could result in patients with depression being at risk of their disease getting worse. Additional exposure data show that too many patients are given rimonabant together with anti-depressant drug. Already in the present SPC there is a warning for this combination and in this variation it is agreed that this warning is strengthened to be a contraindication. The CHMP concluded that the benefits of Acomplia continue to outweigh its risk, except in patients with ongoing major depression or taking antidepressants. In addition, the CHMP recommended the addition in the product information of a stronger warning regarding psychiatric safety, including that treatment should be stopped if a patient develops depression. The product information was as well updated with psychiatric adverse events (suicidal ideation, aggressiveness and aggressive behaviour). |
