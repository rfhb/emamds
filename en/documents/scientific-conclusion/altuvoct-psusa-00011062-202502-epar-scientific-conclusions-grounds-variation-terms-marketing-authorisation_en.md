## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for efanesoctocog alfa, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on hypersensitivity reactions from spontaneous reports, including in some cases  a  close  temporal  relationship,  a  positive  de-challenge  and/or  re-challenge  and  in  view  of  a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between efanesoctocog alfa and hypersensitivity  reactions  including  anaphylaxys  is  at  least  a  reasonable  possibility.  The  PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing efanesoctocog alfa should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for efanesoctocog alfa the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing efanesoctocog alfa is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
