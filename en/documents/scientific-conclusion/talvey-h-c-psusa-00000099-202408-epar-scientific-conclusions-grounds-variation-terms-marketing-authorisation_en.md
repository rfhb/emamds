## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for talquetamab, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data and sufficient level of evidence, the PRAC Rapporteur concluded that the product information for talquetamab should be amended to included palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome an individual ADR of talquetamab (instead of being included in footnote under Skin disorders).

The PRAC Rapporteur also concluded that Oral pain should be moved from SOC 'Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders' to SOC 'Gastrointestinal disorders'.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for talquetamab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing talquetamab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
