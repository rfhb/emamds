## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ocrelizumab, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In the view of available data not raising concerns on an increased risk on adverse pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ocrelizumab within 3 months prior to the last menstrual period and the available information  on  pharmacokinetics  of  ocrelizumab  including  half-terminal  life  of  26  days,  the  PRAC concluded  that  the  product  information  of  products  containing  ocrelizumab  should  be  amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ocrelizumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ocrelizumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
