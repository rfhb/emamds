## 1. ASSESSMENT

## Introduction

This report covers the submission of the following data from two paediatric studies in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006:

Article 46 submission of study D-Pan-H1N1-025 (not part of any FUM): P46 102 Safety and immunogenicity study of GSK Biologicals' pandemic influenza candidate vaccine (GSK2340272A) in children aged 3 to 9 years

Article 46 submission of study Q -Pan-H1N1-045 (not part of any FUM): P46 103 Safety  and  immunogenicity  study  of  GSK  Biologicals'  A/California/7/2009  (H1N1)v-like  vaccines GSK2340274A and GSK234074A in children 3 to less than 10 years old

The current submissions each consist of: · A cover letter · A short critical expert overview · For Q-Pan H1N1-045 a statement regarding conduct of studies outside of the EU · Study  reports  on  D-Pan  H1N1-025  and  Q-Pan  H1N1-045  (details  of  study  dates  and  report dates are provided below) In each case the MAH states in the cover letter that, in accordance with Article 16 (2) of Regulation No. 726/2004,  the  new  data  do  not  require  any  further  regulatory  action,  including  update  of  the prescribing information. Assessment D-Pan-H1N1-025 There are two full reports on this study that commenced 7 December 2009:  The first is dated 7 July 2011 and covers data to M7 with a data lock 29 June 2011  The second is dated 8 July 2011 and covers safety and effectiveness to M12 with a data lock 29 June 2011. The  study  was  conducted  at  3  sites  in  the  Czech  Republic  using  full  and  half  adult  doses  of  D-Pan H1N1.  To  overcome  relatively  low  HA  yields  in  the  production  of  the  H1N1v  antigen  the  Company wished  to  investigate  the  impact  of  applying  a  modified  manufacturing  process  in  which  the concentration  of  octoxynol-10  was  raised  from  13-17  μg/ml  to  60-103  μg/ml.  However,  due  to  the perception of a decreased pandemic threat recruitment in this study was much slower than expected and 60 of the planned 300 subjects were enrolled. Meanwhile the vaccine lot used in group C expired and so the Company decided to stop recruitment. This was a randomised, observer-blind study in subjects aged 3 to 9 years who were to be allocated to three vaccine groups with a ratio of 1:1:1 as follows:  Group A (AS03 group): new process vaccine containing 3.75 μg HA/AS03A on D0 and D21  Group B (AS03/2 group): new process vaccine containing 1.9 μg HA/AS03B on D0 and D21  Group C (H1N1 group): non-adjuvanted H1N1 containing 15 μg of HA on D0 and D21 (initial manufacturing process). The Co- Primary Objectives were to evaluate whether the full and half dose new process adjuvanted vaccine elicited immune responses that exceeded the CHMP criteria applied to adults.

## Results

There were 60 subjects enrolled of which 58 completed. The ATP-I cohort at M7 included 34 subjects (13 in the AS03 group, 9 in the AS03/2 group and 12 in the H1N1 group). The mean age of the M7 cohort was 6.9 years. The overall male-female distribution was 61.8% versus 38.2%.

The pre-vaccination seropositivity rates were 33-50%. At D21 the CHMP criteria were already met in the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. The GMTs increased further with the

In  the  ATP  cohort  for  analysis  of  effectiveness,  percentage  of  subjects  with  occurrence  of  RT-PCR confirmed H1N1 influenza was 33.3% (one subject; onset of ILI on Day 42) in the AS03 group, 14.3% (one subject; onset of ILI on Day 42) in the AS03/2 group and 20.0% (one subject; onset of ILI on Day  42)  in  the  H1N1  group.  Results  from  the  one  dose  and  two  dose  ATP  cohort  for  analysis  of effectiveness are consistent with those obtained for the ATP cohort for analysis of effectiveness. The  incidence  of  subjects  with  any  symptoms  (solicited  and  unsolicited)  during  the  7-day  follow-up period after vaccination was 100% in the AS03 group, 95.0% in the AS03/2 group and 94.4% in the H1N1 group. Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported solicited adverse event for the AS03 and AS03/2 groups (overall incidence per dose of 90.0% and 75.0%, respectively). Redness and pain at the injection site were the most frequently reported solicited adverse event for the H1N1 group (overall incidence per dose 36.1% for redness and 33.3% for pain at the injection site).

In  the  3-5  years  age  stratum,  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  symptoms  (overall incidence per dose) were drowsiness (28.6%), irritability (21.4%), and loss of appetite (21.4%) in the AS03  group;  irritability  (30.0%)  and  drowsiness  (20.0%)  in  the  AS03/2  group;  and  drowsiness (41.7%) in the H1N1 group. Two subjects in the AS03 group experienced grade 3 fever after the first dose administration.

In  the  6-9  years  age  stratum,  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  symptoms  (overall incidence per dose) were headache (50.0%), fatigue (42.3%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (26.9%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in the AS03 group; headache (46.7%), fatigue (40.0%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (16.7%) in the AS03/2 group; fatigue (37.5%), headache (20.8%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (8.3%) in the H1N1 group. No grade 3 fever was reported.

Up to Month 7, 13 unsolicited symptoms were reported, 6 were reported by 3 subjects from the AS03 group, 2 by 2 subjects in AS03/2 group and 5 by 4 subjects in H1N1 group. All reported events were commonly observed in children of this age. Events reported by more than one subject were rhinitis, otitis  media,  and  nasopharyngitis.  One  AE  (vomiting)  considered  as  related  to  vaccination  by  the investigator and one grade 3 AE (tonsillitis) considered as unrelated were reported in the AS03 group.

Also, three SAEs (viral infection, muscle injury, adenoid vegetation) were reported for 2 subjects who received  the  adjuvanted  vaccine.  None  of  them  were  considered  as  related  to  vaccination  and  all resolved by the end of the reporting period. There were no AEs leading to withdrawal. One subject reported one AE of special interest (epilepsy) that was not serious and not considered as related to vaccination.  No  adverse  events  of  specific  interest  or  potential  immune-mediated  diseases  were reported up to M7.

At D182 the mean age of subjects followed up was 6.4 years and the male-female distribution was 65.5% versus 34.5%. Six SAEs had been reported by 4 subjects but none was considered to be related to vaccination by the investigator and all subjects recovered. Three subjects experienced AEs of special interest (epilepsy, syncope and urticaria) but none was considered to be related to vaccination by the investigator. No AESIs/ pIMDs were reported during the entire study. Unsolicited MAEs were reported by 15 subjects (75.0%), 16 subjects (80.0%) and 16 subjects (88.9%) of  the  AS03  group,  AS03/2  group  and  H1N1  group,  respectively.  The  most  frequently  reported unsolicited AEs with MAEs were nasopharyngitis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, and rhinitis. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Q-Pan-H1N1-045

There are two synoptic study reports that provide data to D21 and D182.

The study was conducted in Thailand and the Philippines between 25 July 2010 and 31 January 2011 (D182 completion date). D21 was completed 23 August 2010 and the data lock was on 22 September 2010. The data lock for the D182 report was 7 April 2011.

This was a randomised, observer-blind (all groups, both epochs), parallel-group, multi-centre study of safety  and  immunogenicity  in  children  aged  3  to  &lt;10  years  of  age.  Subjects  were  randomised  to receive one of three regimens with an aim to achieve approximately equal distribution across the two age strata (3 to &lt;6 years; 6 to &lt;10 years) as follows:

At D182, the ATP-I cohort consisted of approximately 45% females and 55% males overall. The mean age of subjects in the ATP-I cohort was 6.0 years overall (range 3 to 9 years). All subjects completed the  Day  182  visit  and  therefore  the  demographics  at  baseline  were  the  same  as  for  D21  and  as follows:

 Q25ASB - 69 subjects to receive one dose of 0.9 μg Q-Pan + AS03B at Day 0  D25ASB - 69 subjects to receive one dose of 0.9 μg D-Pan + AS03B at Day 0  Q50ASB - 53 subjects to receive one dose of 1.9 μg Q-Pan + AS03B at Day 0 Blood  samples  from  all  subjects  were  to  be  taken  on  Days  0,  21  and  182  for  immunogenicity assessment. The study had the following co-primary objectives:  To assess whether Q25ASB results in an immune response to the vaccine-homologous virus at D21 that meets or exceeds the CBER and CHMP criteria applied to adults  To assess whether D25ASB results in an immune response to the vaccine-homologous virus at D21 that meets or exceeds CBER and CHMP criteria applied to adults The study also had the following secondary objectives:  To demonstrate immunological equivalence between Q25ASB and D25ASB at D21 based on a GMT ratio (Q-Pan vs. D-Pan) for which the 2-sided 95% confidence limits was within 0.5 to 2.0.  To describe the immunogenicity of Q50ASB at D21  To describe HI data at d182  To evaluate safety and reactogenicity up to D182 Results Enrolment (209) slightly exceeded the target of 191 subjects to provide at least 180 evaluable subjects. All 209 subjects completed the study through the Day 182 visit. At D21, all 209 subjects were included in the ATP-I cohort. At D182, a total of 205 subjects (98.1%) were included in the ATP-I cohort.

The  seropositivity  rates  at  D0  were  high,  at  56.6%  for  the  Q25ASB  group,  56.0%  for  the  D25ASB group and 41.4% for the Q50ASB group, increasing to 100% at D21. At D21 the co-primary objectives for the study were met with SCR and SPR at 98.7% in the Q25ASB and D25ASB groups and GMFRs of 25.7 and 27.1, respectively. The CBER criteria were exceeded at D21 in both treatment groups. The adjusted GMT ratio was 0.96 (based on adjusted GMTs of 432.1 and 450.9) with 95% CIs of 0.73 and 1.26. In  subjects  receiving  the  standard  paediatric  (i.e.  half-adult)  dose  all  CHMP  and  CBER  criteria  were exceeded at D21. The HI GMTs at D21 were comparable across the three groups (418.8 to 448.6). Medicinal product no longer authorised

At  D182  the  three  treatment  groups  continued  to  meet  the  CHMP  targets  and  the  CBER  guidance target  for  seroconversion.  The  D25ASB  group  continued  to  meet  the  CBER  guidance  target  for seroprotection rate at D182 but this was not met by the other groups. GMTs were comparable across groups at D182.

See the tables on the following pages for details of the D21 safety data: After  the  vaccination  injection  site  pain  was  the  most  common  solicited  local  symptom  reported  for each of the three treatment groups and in both age strata (3 to &lt;6 years and 6 to &lt;10 years). The most common solicited general symptoms reported in subjects 3 to &lt;6 years of age were fever (6.1%, 16.1% and 20.8%, respectively) and loss of appetite (18.2%, 12.9% and 4.2%, respectively). No fever &gt; 40.0°C was reported. Among subjects 6 to &lt;10 years of age, the most commonly reported solicited general symptoms were headache (17.1%, 20.5% and 12.1%, respectively) and muscle aches (14.6%, 15.9% and 15.2%, respectively). At least one unsolicited symptom was reported by 28.9% of subjects in the Q25ASB group and by 28% in the D25ASB group compared to 8.6% in the Q50ASB group. At least one MAE through D21 was reported for 18.4%, 12% and 1.7% of subjects in the Q25ASB, D25ASB and Q50ASB groups, respectively. The most commonly reported MAE was upper respiratory tract  infection,  occurring  in  3  (3.9%)  of  Q25ASB  subjects,  4  (5.3%)  D25ASB  subjects  and  in  one Q50ASB subject. No SAEs, pIMDs or withdrawals due to AEs were reported from Day 0 to Day 21. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Up to D42 at least one unsolicited symptom was reported by 36.8% of subjects in the Q25ASB group, 37.3% of in the D25ASB group and 39.7% in the Q50ASB group (see table below). There were no AEs of grade 3 intensity reported and only 4 AEs considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination: 2 in Q25ASB subjects and 2 in D25ASB subjects. Up to D182 unsolicited symptoms requiring a medically attended visit were reported by 38.2%, 38.7% and  31.0%  per  group.  The  most  commonly  reported  MAE  was  upper  respiratory  tract  infection, occurring in 7 (9.2%) of Q25ASB subjects, 8 (10.7%) of D25ASB subjects and in 5 (8.6%) of Q50ASB subjects. Two SAEs were reported during the 182-day post-vaccination period: dengue hemorrhagic fever and Type B influenza. Both events resolved before the end of the study and both were considered by the investigator  to  be  unrelated  to  study  vaccine.  No  pIMDs  were  reported  during  the  182-day  postvaccination period. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2. RAPPORTEUR'S  OVERALL  CONCLUSION  AND  FURTHER  ACTION  IF REQUIRED

D-Pan  H1N1-025 provides  limited  information  due  to  the  small  numbers  enrolled.  However,  there were no unexpected immunogenicity and safety findings in this study

Q-Pan  H1N1-045 is  of  particular  interest  since  it  retrospectively  provides information on the likely sufficiency of single half adult doses of AS03 when combined with a quarter of the adult dose of HA and suggested that in fact a single dose of only a quarter of the HA could be used with AS03B. It is also of interest that the pre-vaccination seropositivity rates (using the MAH's rather sensitive HI) were high and actually not so very different between these and the Czech children of the same age range in study 025.

Both studies demonstrated the expected safety profile. It was notable in 045 that a quarter of the HA dose behaved similarly to half the adult HA dose, again indicating the major role of the adjuvant. The rates of all and high grade fevers were not unexpected in this age group. The  assessor  concurs  with  the  MAH  that  these  additional  data  do  not  have  implications  for  the Pandemrix SmPC. Medicinal product no longer authorised
