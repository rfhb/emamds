## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

Study number

: LPS15991

Study title : Open label exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis - Dupilumab skin BArrier function and LIpidomics STudy in Atopic Dermatitis - BALISTAD

Study dates:

16/07/2020 to 17/06/2021 (DCO 29/07/2021)

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

LPS15991/BALISTAD: Open-label exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis

## Description

The scope of this phase 4 study was the analysis of the effect of dupilumab treatment on skin-barrier function in adolescent and adult atopic dermatitis (AD) patients, i.e. on pathophysiological features such as epidermal activation, epidermal lipids and proteins, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) etc. using skin tape stripping (STS) to measure skin barrier function and integrity. In addition, disease activity was measured by clinical assessments and patient-reported outcomes, as well as highdefinition standard photography from the targeted lesional and non-lesional areas.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Study participants

Male or female adolescent or adult (aged 12 to 65 years) patients with moderate to severe AD according to Hanifin and Rajka criteria at least 1 year before screening and IGA score of ≥3 at screening and age- and gender-matched healthy volunteer participants were enrolled in this study. Patients must have had non-lesional skin 4 cm from the lesional area or at least identifiable normal looking skin as close to the lesion as possible. They were treatment-naïve or had paused dupilumab treatment for at least 6 months before study entry. The application of topical medications and moisturizers on the target assessment areas should be withheld if possible throughout the study.

## CHMP comment

A total of 52 study participants were enrolled and assigned 1:1 either to the healthy volunteer or to the dupilumab cohort based on their health condition. Overall, 12 adolescent patients were enrolled, 6 thereof had an AD diagnosis of several years and thus, were treated with dupilumab. All dupilumab-treated patients completed the study, whereas 3 of the HV cohort prematurely discontinued the study; their age is unclear. The inclusion criteria were adequately chosen to define an AD population.

## Study design

This was a phase 4 open-label, exploratory study evaluating the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function in adolescent and adult patients with moderate to severe AD with a healthy volunteer cohort as a reference comparator in two study sites (see Fig.1).

The maximum study duration per participant was 24 weeks. The study comprised of:

- Screening Period 1 (Day -28 to -1): Subjects were evaluated according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.
- Baseline Visit (Day 1): Subjects who remained eligible were enrolled.
- 16-week treatment period for AD patients and a 16-week observation period for healthy volunteers.
- 4-week safety follow-up period.

## CHMP comment

A healthy volunteer cohort served as reference comparator for the AD population. To establish similar conditions for the subsequent analysis of dupilumab's treatment effect on the skin barrier, individuals were matched with AD patients for age, gender, examined skin area and study site.

## Treatments

The study intervention included dupilumab 200 mg and 300 mg in a prefilled syringe for subcutaneous administration.

For AD patients aged ≥12 to &lt;18 years, the dose regimen was based on body weight on Day 1 :

- Loading dose of 400 mg on Day 1, followed by 200 mg Q2W for a body weight of less than 60 kg.
- Loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1, followed by 300 mg Q2W for a body weight of ≥ 60 kg.

## CHMP comment

Dupilumab was administered to AD patients according to the authorized posology. Study subjects must have had a treatment gap of at least 6 months or must have been treatment-naïve. This is reasonable with regard to the comparability of the differently affected skin areas.

## CHMP comment

The measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) to quantify the skin barrier functionality as well as non-invasive techniques such as skin tape stripping to determine TEWL are commonly used in clinical trials. Here, 5-20 STS over a period of 16 weeks were performed in lesional and non-lesional skin areas in AD patients under dupilumab treatment and for comparison in HV. The STS time points are acceptable as dupilumab's treatment effect sets in after 2 weeks.

## Sample size

A total of 52 participants were enrolled in the study, of which 26 participants each were enrolled in the dupilumab cohort and the healthy volunteer cohort.

The intent-to-treat (ITT) and safety populations included 52 participants. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population included 51 participants because 1 healthy volunteer participant was retrospectively found to not meet the inclusion criteria and hence was excluded from the mITT population.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

This was an open-label study.

## Changes to the conduct of the study

- To further characterize the treatment effect of dupilumab in adolescent and adult patients with moderate to severe AD in reference to matched healthy controls, a proteomics assessment and a transcriptomics assessment from skin tape strips were added.
- These assessments allowed for better assessment of the mechanism of dupilumab in AD. To have comparable data in lesional skin and non-lesional skin of AD patients as well as in normal skin of healthy volunteers, the number of skin tape strips collected was set to 20 for each skin area.
- In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, benefit-risk assessment in the context of COVID-19 was introduced in Amended Protocol 01. Implementation of temporary or alternative mechanisms such as phone contact, virtual visits, online meetings, use of local clinic or laboratory locations, and home visits by skilled staff (as permitted per local regulations) were allowed to ensure the study continuity and protect participants' safety. No waivers to deviate from protocol enrollment criteria due to COVID -19 were granted. Remote monitoring was implemented when onsite monitoring was not allowed. All temporary mechanisms utilized and deviations from planned study procedures were documented as being related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## CHMP comment

The amendments are not supposed to have negatively affected the effiacacy or safety analyses.

Evaluation of dupilumab 's treatment effect on skin proteomics and on skin transcriptome (expression of proteins or genes associated with skin barrier function) using STS samples were explored as tertiary endpoints. According to the MAH, results will be provided in a separate report.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical Methods

No hypothesis testing is predefined in this exploratory study.

Sample size for this exploratory study was based on medical/clinical judgement and aligned with the sample size from similar studies in the literature. No formal sample size calculation was performed. TEWL data collected in similar settings as planned for this study were not available: ie, TEWL values after 5 skin tape strips, and pre- and post-dupilumab treatment are unknown.

Allowing for drop-out rate of 15%, a total of approximately 24 patients with moderate to severe AD will be enrolled to achieve 20 evaluable patients: ie, patients with no major or critical deviations related to IMP and/or TEWL measurements, for whom the TEWL data for primary analysis: ie, TEWL at baseline and Week16, are considered sufficient and interpretable. An approximately equal number of age, gender, location of targeted lesion area and site matched healthy volunteers serving as a reference comparator cohort will be enrolled. Drop-out rate in healthy volunteers is expected to be zero. Any drop-out healthy volunteer for whom the matched patient is considered as evaluable will not be replaced.

A detailed description of participant accountability including number of participants by analysis population, screen failure of participants with the reasons for screen failure, participants who did not complete the study observation period along with the main reason for permanent treatment discontinuation, and participants who requested permanent treatment discontinuation was generated by cohort.

Continuous variables (age, weight) and qualitative variables (gender, race, and body mass index) were summarized by cohort in descriptive statistics (summary tables).

The efficacy evaluation was based on a review of the individual values (graphics), descriptive statistics (summary tables, graphics), and where applicable, exploratory statistical analysis.

The safety evaluation was based on a review of vital signs parameters and reported adverse events (AEs). All the safety analyses were performed using the safety population. When applicable, results were reported by cohort and overall.

## Results

## Participant flow

All 26 participants in the dupilumab cohort completed the study treatment period as well as the study period, whereas 3 healthy volunteer participants did not complete the study. The reasons for permanent study discontinuation included participant lost to follow-up, withdrawal by participant, and failure to meet inclusion criteria (see Table 5).

A total of 19 major protocol deviations were reported during the study. Major protocol deviations that impacted efficacy analyses were as follows:

- Two participants from the dupilumab cohort received topical corticosteroids as rescue medications for worsening of AD during the treatment period.
- One participant from the dupilumab cohort received systemic corticosteroid for the treatment of medical history (left hip bursitis).
- One participant from the dupilumab cohort received IMP not as per protocol during the treatment period.
- One healthy volunteer participant and 1 participant from the dupilumab cohort received topical antibiotics as for the treatment of AEs.
- One healthy volunteer participant who was retrospectively identified as not meeting the eligibility criteria after enrollment, received topical corticosteroid for treatment of an AE (worsening of dermatitis shoulder and arm).

## CHMP comment

All patients assigned to the dupilumab group completed the study. 4/26 (15.4%) thereof had major protocol deviations that are supposed to have influenced the efficacy analysis mainly due to oral intake or topical application of corticosteroids. Based on the provided documents it is, however, unclear if paediatric patients were involved.

## Recruitment

LPS15991 was conducted from 16 July 2020 (first patient first visit) through 17 June 2021 (last patient last visit), in 2 centers in the United States and in Canada.

## Baseline disease characteristics

In the dupilumab cohort, the median (range) duration since diagnosis of AD was 13.2 (4 to 16) years for adolescent participants and 26.0 (4 to 56) years for adult participants in the mITT population (mITT population was same as the safety population for the dupilumab cohort), see Table 9.

## Prior and concomitant medications

A notably higher number of participants reported prior medications clinically relevant to AD in the dupilumab cohort compared with that in the healthy volunteers cohort, respectively, including corticosteroids, dermatological preparations (25 [96.2%] participants versus 0 participants), antipruritics, including antihistamines, anesthetics, etc (19 [73.1%] participants versus 1 [3.8%] participant), corticosteroids for systemic use (18 [69.2%] participants versus 0 participants), psycholeptics (14 [53.8%] participants versus 2 [7.7%] participants), antibacterials for systemic use (6 [23.1%] participants versus 1 [3.8%] participant), antipsoriatics (5 [19.2%] participants versus 0 participants), and antibiotics and chemotherapeutics for dermatological use and immunosuppressants (4 [15.4%] participants versus 0 participants each).

A notably higher number of participants also reported clinically important prior medications in the dupilumab cohort compared with that in the healthy volunteers cohort, respectively, including ophthalmologicals (23 [88.5%] participants versus 5 [19.2%] participants), drugs for obstructive airway diseases (23 [88.5%] participants versus 0 participants), and nasal preparations (20 [76.9%] participants versus 1 [3.8%] participant).

A total of 9 (34.6%) participants in the dupilumab cohort were reported to have received concomitant corticosteroids, dermatological preparations , of which 3 participants received those medications via topical route, and the rest of the participants received the medications via other routes. Of the 2 (7.7%) participants in the dupilumab cohort who received concomitant antibiotics and chemotherapeutics for dermatological use via topical route, both participants received the medications for the treatment of AEs (treatment of abscess and of minor wound).

Of the 2 (7.7%) participants in the dupilumab cohort who received concomitant corticosteroids for systemic use , left hip bursitis and worsening of bilateral shoulder pain).

## CHMP comment

Regarding the adolescents, the gender ratio was balanced across both cohorts, whereas race and ethnicity was not. All patients of the dupilumab group had a history of chronic AD (median 13.2 years) and corresponding prior medication. The majority of patients included in the safety population received concomitant medications (26/26 in the dupilumab and 24/26 of the HV), i.e. emollients and antipruritics etc.

13/26 patients assigned to the dupilumab cohort received prohibited medications and 11/26 (34.6%) thereof were reported to have received concomitant corticosteroids (topical or systemic) und thus, prohibited medication, however, only 2 were assessed to have caused protocol violations related to administration of prohibited medications. It is unclear if adolescent patients were involved.

To what extent these medications have influenced TEWL measurement, was not discussed by the MAH.

## Number analysed

All 52 participants were included in the ITT and the safety populations. The mITT population included 51 participants (1 participant was retrospectively found to not meet the inclusion criteria and hence

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was excluded from the mITT population). The number of participants included in each analysis population is provided in Table 6.

## Efficacy results

## Primary efficacy endpoint

## Percent change from baseline in TEWL at Week 16 after 5 STS assessed on lesional skin

The Percent change from baseline in TEWL after 5 STS assessed on lesional skin at Week 16 in AD patients in the mITT population was -54.6 (18.0) (Table 15). The primary statistical analysis of ratio of the Week 16 and baseline TEWL values after 5 STS on lesional skin in AD patients for the mITT population demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement (point estimate [90% CI] = 0.43 [0.37 to 0.49], p&lt;0.0001), representing a 57% reduction in TEWL (Table 16).

TEWL data for linear mixed model was log-transformed to account for right skewness of data and heteroskedasticity.

The linear mixed effect on log(TEWL) includes age, sex, number of STS, localization on the body, visit, number of STS-by-visit interaction and number of STS-by-age interaction as fixed effects. Modelis run on data on lesional skin area. Repeated measures withinparticipantsaremodeledwithacompoundsymmetrycovariancematrix

Point estimate obtained is back-transformed by exponentiation (point estimate displayed)

## CHMP comment

The primary efficacy endpoint Percent change from baseline in TEWL at Week 16 after 5 STS assessed on lesional skin for the whole mITT population was met, i.e. TEWL was reduced by 57% under dupilumab treatment. This effect was consistent over time as reflected by the outcome of the secondary endpoints.

## Tertiary/exploratory endpoints

The results of the tertiary endpoints related to lipidomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and gene expression will be provided in a separate report. The tertiary endpoints of the mean absolute and percent change from baseline in EASI, SCORAD, GISS, peak pruritus NRS, POEM, quality of sleep NRS, and DLQI scores indicated a gradual improvement in symptoms over time.

## Safety results

## Exposure

The mean (SD) exposure was 111.8 (2.9) days (Table 13). All participants in the dupilumab cohort were treated for more than 99 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, 20 (76.9%) participants in the dupilumab cohort experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Six out of the 6 adolescents (100%) in dupilumab cohort presented with TEAEs.

The TEAE preferred terms (PTs) reported in the 6 adolescents in dupilumab cohort were as follows:

- Food allergy: 2 (33.3%)
- Injection site reaction: 2 (33.3%)
- Conjunctivitis allergic: 1 (16.7%)
- Abscess limb: 1 (16.7%)
- Hordeolum: 1 (16.7%)
- Arthralgia: 1 (16.7%)
- Dermatitis atopic: 1 (16.7%).

A total of 13 (50.0%) participants in the healthy volunteer cohort experienced AEs, all of which (13 [65.0%] participants) were adults. There were no AEs reported in the 6 adolescents who were from the healthy volunteer cohort.

In the dupilumab cohort, the most common TEAE PTs (≥10% participants overall) reported were injection site reaction (5 [19.2%] participants) and arthralgia (3 [11.5%] participants).

In addition, in the dupilumab cohort, 2 (10.0%) adult participants reported noninfective conjunctivitis and 1 (16.7%) adolescent participant reported allergic conjunctivitis. In the healthy volunteer cohort, the most common AE PT (≥10% participants overall) reported was ecchymosis (3 [11.5%] participants). None of the participants in either of the cohorts experienced a severe AE, a serious adverse event (SAE), an AE leading to death, an AE leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation, or an adverse event of special interest (AESI).

In the dupilumab cohort, 1 adult participant experienced a potentially clinically significant abnormality (PCSA ) of ≥5% decrease in weight from baseline and 5 adult part icipants experienced a PCSA of ≥5% increase in weight from baseline;

In the healthy volunteer cohort, 1 adult participant each experienced PCSAs of diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg and increase from baseline ≥10 mmHg, ≥5% decrease in weight from baseline, and ≥5% increase in weight from baseline.

One adolescent participant in the dupilumab cohort experienced PCSAs of diastolic blood pressure ≤54 mmHg and decrease from baseline ≥10 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≥78 mmHg and increase from basel ine ≥10 mmHg .

One adolescent participant in the healthy volunteer cohort experienced a PCSA of diastolic blood pressure ≥78 mmHg and increase from baseline ≥10 mmHg.

## CHMP comment

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were collected over 20 weeks. All patients in the dupilumab cohort had a mean exposure of 112 days. 6/6 (100%) of the included paediatric patients had TEAEs, however, no serious AE, AE of special interest or deaths were reported. Regarding the TEAE preferred terms (PTs) reported in the 6 adolescents, typical adverse events was observed that are known to occur under dupilumab treatment in the AD population, i.e. local injection reactions and eye complications prevailed. However, considering the very limited number of patients, the TEAE frequencies are of limited informative value. No AEs were observed in adolescents assigned to the healthy volunteer cohort.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Atopic dermatitis is associated with skin barrier defects, which has, amongst others, implications for the immune function of the skin. The scope of this phase 4 study was the analysis of the effect of dupilumab treatment on skin-barrier function in adolescent and adult AD patients, i.e. on pathophysiological features such as TEWL, epidermal activation, epidermal lipids and proteins, etc. using STS to measure skin barrier function and integrity. In addition, disease activity was measured by clinical assessments and patient-reported outcomes, as well as high-definition standard photography from the targeted lesional and non-lesional areas.

## Methodology

A total of 52 study participants were enrolled and assigned 1:1 either to the healthy volunteer or to the dupilumab cohort based on their health condition. Overall, 12 adolescent patients were enrolled, 6 thereof had an AD diagnosis of many years and thus, were treated with dupilumab. All 6 dupilumabtreated patients completed the study, whereas 3 of the HV cohort prematurely discontinued the study; their age is unclear. Overall, the inclusion criteria were adequately chosen to define an AD population. A healthy volunteer cohort served as reference comparator for the AD population. To establish similar conditions for the subsequent analysis of dupilumab's treatment effect on the skin barrier, in dividuals were matched with AD patients for age, gender, examined skin area and study site.

Dupilumab was administered to AD patients according to the authorized posology. Study subjects must have had a treatment gap of at least 6 months or must have been treatment-naïve. This is reasonable with regard to the comparability of the differently affected skin areas.

The measurement of TEWL to quantify the skin barrier functionality as well as non-invasive techniques such as STS to determine TEWL are commonly used in clinical trials. Here, 5-20 STS over a period of 16 weeks were performed in lesional and non-lesional skin areas in AD patients under dupilumab treatment and for comparison in HV. The STS time points are acceptable as the onset of dupilumab's effect was observed after 2 treatment weeks in clinical trials.

All patients assigned to the dupilumab group completed the study. 4/26 (15.4%) thereof had major protocol deviations that might have influenced the efficacy analysis mainly due to oral intake or topical application of corticosteroids. Based on the provided documents it is, however, unclear if paediatric patients were involved. The introduced protocol amendments are not supposed to have negatively affected the effiacacy or safety analyses.

## Results

Regarding the adolescents, the gender ratio was balanced across both cohorts, whereas the race and ethnicity ratio were unbalanced. All patients of the dupilumab group had a history of chronic AD (median 13.2 years) and corresponding prior medication. The majority of patients included in the safety population received concomitant medications (26/26 in the dupilumab and 24/26 of the HV), i.e. emollients and antipruritics etc.

13/26 patients assigned to the dupilumab cohort received prohibited medications and 11/26 (34.6%) thereof were reported to have received concomitant corticosteroids (topical or systemic) und thus, prohibited medication. However, only 2 were assessed to have caused protocol violations related to administration of prohibited medications. It is unclear if adolescent patients were involved. To what extent these medications have influenced TEWL measurement, is not discussed by the MAH.

The primary efficacy endpoint Percent change from baseline in TEWL at Week 16 after 5 STS assessed on lesional skin for the whole mITT population was met, i.e. TEWL was reduced by 57% under dupilumab treatment. This effect was consistent over time as reflected by the outcome of the secondary and tertiary endpoints.

Treatment-emergent adverse events were collected over 20 weeks. All patients in the dupilumab cohort had a mean exposure of 112 days. 6/6 (100%) of the included paediatric patients had TEAEs, however, no SAE, AESI or deaths were reported. Regarding the TEAE preferred terms (PTs) reported in the 6 adolescents, typical adverse events was observed that are known to occur under dupilumab treatment in the AD population, i.e. local injection reactions and eye complications prevailed. However, considering the very limited number of patients, these TEAE frequencies are of limited informative value. No AEs were observed in the 6 adolescents assigned to the healthy volunteer cohort.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

Few adolescent patients AD were included in this phase 4 study that aimed at the analysis of dupilumab 's treatment effect on skin-barrier function. The efficacy results indicate that TEWL of lesional skin was gradually reduced for the total AD mITT population over a period of 16 treatment weeks compared with the TEWL of healthy volunteers suggesting an improved skin barrier. However, the relatively high amount of concomitant AD medication might have influenced the results. Regarding the very limited analysed patient number of overall 12 adolescents, the generated data are considered supportive information. The collected safety data are consistent with the known safety profile. It is concurred that no amendment of the PI is indicated.
