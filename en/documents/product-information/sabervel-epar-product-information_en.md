## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Sabervel 75 mg film-coated tablets

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each film-coated tablet contains 75 mg of irbesartan

Excipient  with known effect: 20 mg of lactose monohydrate per film-coated tablet

<!-- image -->

In hypertensive type 2 diabetic  patients, therapy should  be initiated  at 150 mg irbesartan once daily and titrated up to 300 mg once daily  as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. The demonstration  of renal benefit of Sabervel in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based on studies where irbesartan was used in addition  to other antihypertensive  agents, as needed, to reach target blood  pressure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1).

For the full  list of excipients,  see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Film-coated  tablet. White, concave, round, film-coated tablet with 7 mm diameter. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Sabervel is indicated  in adults for the treatment of essential hypertension. It is also indicated  for the treatment of renal disease in adult patients with hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  as part of an antihypertensive  medicinal  product regimen (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The usual recommended initial  and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily,  with or without  food. Sabervel at a dose of 150 mg once daily  generally  provides a better 24 hour blood  pressure control than 75 mg. However, initiation  of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly  in haemodialysed  patients and in the elderly over 75 years. In patients insufficiently  controlled  with 150 mg once daily,  the dose of Sabervel can be increased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive  agents can be added (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). In particular,  the addition  of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide  has been shown to have an additive effect with Sabervel (see section 4.5). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Special Populations

Renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired  renal function. A lower starting dose (75 mg) should  be considered for patients undergoing  haemodialysis  (see section 4.4).

Hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild  to moderate hepatic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

impairment.  There is no clinical  experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Elderly patients: although consideration  should be given to initiating  therapy with 75 mg in patients over 75 years of age, dosage adjustment is not usually  necessary for the elderly.

Paediatric population : the safety and efficacy of Sabervel in children  aged 0 to 18 has not been established. Currently available  data are described in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology  can be made.

## Method of Administration

For oral use. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity  to the active substance, or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). The concomitant  use of Sabervel with aliskiren-containing  products is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus  or renal impairment  (GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73  m 2 ) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Intravascular volume  depletion:  symptomatic  hypotension,  especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume  and/or sodium  depleted by vigorous  diuretic  therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting.  Such conditions  should  be corrected before the administration  of Sabervel. Renovascular hypertension:  there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single  functioning  kidney are treated with medicinal  products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system. While this is not documented with Sabervel, a similar  effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II  receptor antagonists. Renal impairment  and kidney  transplantation:  when Sabervel is used in patients with impaired  renal function,  a periodic  monitoring  of potassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration  of Sabervel in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and cardiovascular events were not uniform  across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study with patients with advanced renal disease. In particular,  they appeared less favourable in women and non-white subjects (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system (RAAS) Medicinal product no longer authorised

There is evidence that the concomitant  use of ACE-inhibitors,  angiotensin  II receptor blockers or aliskiren  increases the risk of hypotension,  hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors,  angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren  is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely  necessary, this should only  occur under specialist supervision  and subject to frequent close monitoring  of renal function,  electrolytes and blood  pressure. ACE-inhibitors  and angiotensin  II receptor blockers should  not be used concomitantly  in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

Hyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal  products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system, hyperkalaemia may occur during  the treatment with Sabervel, especially  in the presence of renal impairment,  overt proteinuria  due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring  of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lithium:  the combination  of lithium  and Sabervel is not recommended (see section 4.5).

Aortic and mitral  valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:  as with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral  stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy.

Primary aldosteronism:  patients with primary aldosteronism  generally will  not respond to antihypertensive  medicinal  products acting through inhibition  of the renin-angiotensin  system. Therefore, the use of Sabervel is not recommended.

General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function  depend predominantly  on the activity  of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying  renal disease, including  renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors  or angiotensin-II  receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension,  azotaemia, oliguria,  or rarely acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive agent, excessive blood  pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could  result in a myocardial  infarction or stroke. As observed for angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors,  irbesartan and the other angiotensin antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood  pressure in black people than in non-blacks, possibly  because of higher prevalence of low-renin  states in the black hypertensive population  (see section 5.1). Pregnancy: Angiotensin  II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated  during  pregnancy. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning  pregnancy should  be changed to alternative antihypertensive  treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed,  treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). Lactose: this medicinal  product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems  of galactose intolerance,  the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption  should  not take this medicinal  product. Paediatric population:  irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations  aged 6 to 16 years old but the current data are insufficient  to support an extension of the use in children  until  further data become available  (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Diuretics and other antihypertensive  agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the hypotensive  effects of irbesartan; however  irbesartan has been safely administered with other antihypertensive  agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting  calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in  volume depletion  and a risk of hypotension  when initiating  therapy with Sabervel (see section 4.4). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Clinical  trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system  (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors,  angiotensin  II receptor blockers or aliskiren  is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension,  hyperkalaemia  and decreased renal function  (including  acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).

Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing  diuretics:  based on experience with the use of other medicinal  products that affect the renin-angiotensin  system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics,  potassium supplements,  salt substitutes containing  potassium or other medicinal  products that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium  and is, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4).

Lithium:  reversible increases in serum lithium  concentrations and toxicity  have been reported during

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concomitant administration  of lithium  with angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors.  Similar  effects have been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination  is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination  proves necessary, careful monitoring  of serum lithium  levels is recommended.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs: when angiotensin  II antagonists are administered simultaneously  with non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic  acid (&gt; 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.

As with ACE inhibitors,  concomitant  use of angiotensin  II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function,  including  possible acute renal failure,  and an increase in serum potassium, especially  in patients with poor pre-existing  renal function. The combination  should be administered with caution, especially  in the elderly. Patients should  be adequately hydrated and consideration  should  be given to monitoring  renal function  after initiation  of concomitant therapy, and periodically  thereafter.

Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension  (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Additional  information  on irbesartan interactions:  in  clinical  studies, the pharmacokinetic  of irbesartan is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide.  Irbesartan is mainly  metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by glucuronidation.  No significant  pharmacokinetic  or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal  product metabolised  by CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin  on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic  of digoxin  was not altered by coadministration  of irbesartan. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy: The use of AIIRAs is not recommended during  the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during  the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Epidemiological  evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following  exposure to ACE inhibitors during  the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive;  however a small  increase in risk cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled  epidemiological  data on the risk with Angiotensin  II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar  risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning  pregnancy should  be changed to alternative antihypertensive  treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed,  treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately,  and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should  be started. Exposure to AIIRA therapy during  the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity  (decreased renal function,  oligohydramnios,  skull  ossification  retardation) and neonatal toxicity  (renal failure,  hypotension,  hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). Should  exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull  is recommended.

## Breast-feeding:

Because no information  is available  regarding the use of Sabervel during  breast-feeding, Sabervel is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during  breastfeeding are preferable, especially while  nursing a newborn or preterm infant.

It is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites  are excreted in human milk. Available  pharmacodynamic/toxicological  data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

metabolites in milk  (for details see 5.3).

## Fertility

Irbesartan had no effect upon fertility  of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing the first signs of parental toxicity  (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability  to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on its pharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely  to affect this ability.  When driving  vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into  account that dizziness  or weariness may occur during treatment.

4.8 Undesirable effects In placebo-controlled  trials in patients with hypertension,  the overall  incidence of adverse events did not differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation  due to any clinical  or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for placebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the recommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria  and normal  renal function,  orthostatic dizziness  and orthostatic hypotension  were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon)  but in excess of placebo. The following  table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled  trials in which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the adverse reactions that were additionally  reported in &gt; 2% of diabetic  hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency  and overt proteinuria  and in excess of placebo. The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following  convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000  to &lt; 1/1,000);  very rare (&lt; 1/10,000).  Within  each frequency grouping,  undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Adverse reactions additionally  reported from post-marketing experience are also listed. These adverse reactions are derived from spontaneous reports.

significant  increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in irbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable  clinical  musculoskeletal  events. In 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with irbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*,  which was not clinically  significant,  has been observed.

Uncommon: jaundice Not known: hepatitis,  abnormal liver  function Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Not known: leukocytoclastic  vasculitis Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Common: musculoskeletal  pain* Not known: arthralgia,  myalgia (in some cases associated with increased plasma creatine kinase levels), muscle cramps Renal and urinary disorders: Not known: impaired  renal function including  cases of renal failure in patients at risk (see section 4.4) Reproductive system and breast disorders: Uncommon: sexual dysfunction General disorders and administration site conditions: Common: fatigue Uncommon: chest pain Investigations: Very common: Hyperkalaemia* occurred more often in diabetic patients treated with irbesartan than with placebo. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria  and normal renal function,  hyperkalaemia (≥ 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the irbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency  and overt proteinuria,  hyperkalaemia (≥ 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group and 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. Common: Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Paediatric population:

In a randomised trial  of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following adverse reactions occurred in the 3-week double-blind  phase: headache (7.9%), hypotension  (2.2%), dizziness  (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label  period of this trial the most frequent laboratory abnormalities  observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and elevated CK values in 2% of child  recipients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

Experience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity.  The most likely  manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension  and tachycardia; bradycardia might also occur from overdose. No specific information  is available  on the treatment of overdose with Sabervel. The patient should  be closely monitored,  and the treatment should  be symptomatic and supportive. Suggested measures include induction  of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

The efficacy of irbesartan is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin  system, black hypertensive patients have notably less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered  concomitantly  with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide  (e.g. 12.5 mg daily),  the antihypertensive response in black patients approaches that of white patients.

5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group:  Angiotensin-II  antagonists, plain. ATC code: C09C A04. Mechanism of action:  Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II  receptor (type AT 1 ) antagonist. It is expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II  mediated by the AT 1  receptor, regardless of the source or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II  (AT 1 ) receptors results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II  levels,  and a decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly  affected by irbesartan alone at the recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit  ACE (kininase-II),  an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin  into  inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation  for its activity. Clinical  efficacy: Hypertension Irbesartan lowers blood  pressure with minimal  change in heart rate. The decrease in blood  pressure is dose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of 150-300  mg once daily  lower supine or seated blood  pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing)  by an average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic)  greater than those associated with placebo. Peak reduction of blood  pressure is achieved within  3-6 hours after administration  and the blood pressure lowering effect is maintained  for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood pressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic  and systolic responses at the recommended doses. Once daily  dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar  to twice daily  dosing  on the same total dose. The blood  pressure lowering effect of irbesartan is evident within  1-2 weeks, with the maximal  effect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive  effects are maintained during  long term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood  pressure gradually returns toward baseline. Rebound hypertension has not been observed. The blood  pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type  diuretics are additive.  In patients not adequately controlled  by irbesartan alone, the addition  of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily  results in  a further placebo-adjusted blood  pressure reduction at trough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic).

There is no clinically  important  effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion.

## Paediatric population

Reduction of blood  pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low),  1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high)  target titrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family  history  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hypertension) children  and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the three weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable,  trough seated systolic blood  pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium  dose), 13.2 mmHg (high dose). No significant  difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough seated diastolic  blood  pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium dose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized to either active medicinal  product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg in SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of irbesartan (see section 4.2).

## Hypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease

The study of the 'Effects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria  in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  (IRMA 2)' shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria  in patients with microalbuminuria.  IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled  double blind  morbidity  study in 590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria  (30-300 mg/day) and normal  renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl  in males and &lt; 1.1 mg/dl  in females). The study examined the long-term effects (2 years) of irbesartan on the progression to clinical  (overt) proteinuria  (urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) &gt; 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from baseline). The predefined blood  pressure goal was ≤ 135/85  mmHg. Additional  antihypertensive  agents (excluding ACE inhibitors,  angiotensin  II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine  calcium blockers) were added as needed to help achieve the blood  pressure goal. While  similar  blood  pressure was achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in  the placebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint  of overt proteinuria,  demonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An accompanying improvement  in the glomerular  filtration  rate (GFR) was not observed during  the first three months of

The 'Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)' shows that irbesartan decreases the progression of renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency  and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double blind,  controlled,  morbidity  and mortality  trial comparing  irbesartan, amlodipine  and placebo. In 1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria  ≥ 900 mg/day and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl,  the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of irbesartan on the progression of renal disease and all-cause mortality  were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg to a maintenance dose of 300 mg irbesartan, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine,  or placebo as tolerated. Patients in all  treatment groups typically  received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive  agents (e.g., diuretics,  beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood  pressure goal of ≤ 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic  pressure if baseline was &gt; 160 mmHg. Sixty per cent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood  pressure whereas this figure was 76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine  groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly  reduced the relative risk in the primary combined  endpoint  of doubling  serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality.  Approximately  33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached the primary renal composite endpoint  compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine  groups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction compared to amlodipine  (p = 0.006)]. When the individual  components of the primary endpoint  were analysed, no effect in all  cause mortality  was observed, while  a positive  trend in the reduction in ESRD and a significant  reduction in doubling  of serum creatinine were observed. Subgroups consisting  of gender, race, age, duration  of diabetes, baseline blood  pressure, serum creatinine, and albumin  excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black subgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall  study population  respectively, a renal benefit was not evident,  although  the confidence intervals  do not exclude it. As for the secondary endpoint  of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups in the overall population,  although  an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a decreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebobased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the irbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based  regimen,  while hospitalization  due to heart failure was reduced in the overall  population.  However, no proper explanation  for these findings  in women has been identified. Medicinal product no longer authorised

treatment. The slowing  in the progression to clinical  proteinuria  was evident as early as three months and continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria  (&lt; 30 mg/day) was more frequent in the irbesartan 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%).

Two large randomised, controlled  trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination  with Ramipril  Global  Endpoint  Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination  of an ACE-inhibitor  with an angiotensin  II receptor blocker.

ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history  of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus  accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus  and diabetic nephropathy.

These studies have shown no significant  beneficial  effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and mortality,  while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury  and/or hypotension  as compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar  pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors  and angiotensin  II receptor blockers. ACE-inhibitors  and angiotensin  II receptor blockers should  therefore not be used concomitantly  in patients with diabetic nephropathy. ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial  in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was a study designed to test the benefit of adding  aliskiren  to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor or an angiotensin  II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus  and chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically  more frequent in the aliskiren  group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia,  hypotension  and renal dysfunction)  were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties After oral administration,  irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability  gave values of approximately  60-80%. Concomitant  food intake does not significantly  influence the bioavailability  of irbesartan. Plasma protein binding  is approximately  96%, with negligible  binding  to cellular blood components. The volume of distribution  is 53 - 93 litres. Following  oral or intravenous  administration of 14 C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating  plasma radioactivity  is attributable  to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised  by the liver  via glucuronide  conjugation  and oxidation.  The major circulating  metabolite  is irbesartan glucuronide  (approximately  6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily  oxidised  by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible  effect. Irbesartan exhibits linear  and dose proportional  pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. A less than proportional  increase in oral absorption  at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal recommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations are attained at 1.5 - 2 hours after oral administration.  The total body and renal clearance are 157 - 176 and 3 - 3.5 ml/min,  respectively. The terminal elimination  half-life  of irbesartan is 11 - 15 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within  3 days after initiation  of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited  accumulation of irbesartan (&lt; 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life  and accumulation  of irbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and C max  values were also somewhat greater in elderly  subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young  subjects (18  - 40 years). However the terminal half-life  was not significantly  altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Irbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated  by both biliary  and renal pathways. After either oral or IV administration  of 14 C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity  is recovered in the urine,  and the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacokinetics  of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children  after the administration of single  and multiple  daily  doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum  daily  dose of 150 mg for four weeks. Of those 23 children,  21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults (twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that C max , AUC and clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan daily. A limited  accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily  dosing.

Renal impairment:  in patients with renal impairment  or those undergoing  haemodialysis,  the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly  altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis.

## 6.1 List of excipients

Hepatic impairment:  in patients with mild  to moderate cirrhosis,  the pharmacokinetic  parameters of irbesartan are not significantly  altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 5.3 Preclinical safety data There was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity  at clinically  relevant doses. In non-clinical  safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day  in rats and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in macaques) caused a reduction of red blood  cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin,  haematocrit). At very high  doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day)  degenerative changes in the kidney  (such as interstitial nephritis,  tubular distension,  basophilic  tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the hypotensive  effects of the medicinal  product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, irbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy  of the juxtaglomerular  cells (in rats at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day,  in macaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the pharmacological  action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular  cells does not appear to have any relevance. There was no evidence of mutagenicity,  clastogenicity  or carcinogenicity. Fertility  and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at oral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity  (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day),  including mortality  at the highest dose. No significant  effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants,  or live fetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival,  development,  or reproduction of offspring. Studies in animals indicate that the radiolabeled  irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit fetuses. Irbesartan is excreted in the milk  of lactating rats. Animal  studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, hydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, abortion  or early resorption  were noted at doses causing significant  maternal toxicity,  including mortality.  No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. 6.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Sabervel 150 mg film-coated tablets

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each film-coated tablet contains 150 mg of irbesartan

Excipient  with known effect: 40 mg of lactose monohydrate per film-coated tablet

In hypertensive type 2 diabetic  patients, therapy should  be initiated  at 150 mg irbesartan once daily and titrated up to 300 mg once daily  as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. The demonstration  of renal benefit of Sabervel in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based on studies where irbesartan was used in addition  to other antihypertensive  agents, as needed, to reach target blood  pressure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1).

For the full  list of excipients,  see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Film-coated  tablet. White, concave, round, film-coated tablet with 9 mm diameter. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Sabervel is indicated  in adults for the treatment of essential hypertension. It is also indicated  for the treatment of renal disease in adult patients with hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  as part of an antihypertensive  medicinal  product regimen (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The usual recommended initial  and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily,  with or without  food. Sabervel at a dose of 150 mg once daily  generally  provides a better 24 hour blood  pressure control than 75 mg. However, initiation  of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly  in haemodialysed  patients and in the elderly over 75 years. In patients insufficiently  controlled  with 150 mg once daily,  the dose of Sabervel can be increased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive  agents can be added (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). In particular,  the addition  of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide  has been shown to have an additive effect with Sabervel (see section 4.5). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Special Populations

Renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired  renal function. A lower starting dose (75 mg) should  be considered for patients undergoing  haemodialysis  (see section 4.4).

Hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild  to moderate hepatic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

impairment.  There is no clinical  experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Elderly patients: although consideration  should be given to initiating  therapy with 75 mg in patients over 75 years of age, dosage adjustment is not usually  necessary for the elderly.

Paediatric population : the safety and efficacy of Sabervel in children  aged 0 to 18 has not been established. Currently available  data are described in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology  can be made.

## Method of Administration

For oral use. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity  to the active substance, or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). The concomitant  use of Sabervel with aliskiren-containing  products is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus  or renal impairment  (GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73  m 2 ) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Intravascular volume  depletion:  symptomatic  hypotension,  especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume  and/or sodium  depleted by vigorous  diuretic  therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting.  Such conditions  should  be corrected before the administration  of Sabervel. Renovascular hypertension:  there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single  functioning  kidney are treated with medicinal  products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system. While this is not documented with Sabervel, a similar  effect should be anticipated with angiotensin -II  receptor antagonists. Renal impairment  and kidney  transplantation:  when Sabervel is used in patients with impaired  renal function,  a periodic  monitoring  of potassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration  of Sabervel in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and cardiovascular events were not uniform  across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study with patients with advanced renal disease. In particular,  they appeared less favourable in women and non-white subjects (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system (RAAS) Medicinal product no longer authorised

There is evidence that the concomitant  use of ACE-inhibitors,  angiotensin  II receptor blockers or aliskiren  increases the risk of hypotension,  hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors,  angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren  is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely  necessary, this should only  occur under specialist supervision  and subject to frequent close monitoring  of renal function,  electrolytes and blood  pressure. ACE-inhibitors  and angiotensin  II receptor blockers should  not be used concomitantly  in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

Hyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal  products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system, hyperkalaemia may occur during  the treatment with Sabervel, especially  in the presence of renal impairment,  overt proteinuria  due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring  of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lithium:  the combination  of lithium  and Sabervel is not recommended (see section 4.5).

Aortic and mitral  valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:  as with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral  stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy.

Primary aldosteronism:  patients with primary aldosteronism  generally will  not respond to antihypertensive  medicinal  products acting through inhibition  of the renin-angiotensin  system. Therefore, the use of Sabervel is not recommended.

General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function  depend predominantly  on the activity  of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying  renal disease, including  renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors  or angiotensin-II  receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension,  azotaemia, oliguria,  or rarely acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive agent, excessive blood  pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could  result in a myocardial  infarction or stroke. As observed for angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors,  irbesartan and the other angiotensin antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood  pressure in black people than in non-blacks, possibly  because of higher prevalence of low-renin  states in the black hypertensive population  (see section 5.1). Pregnancy: Angiotensin  II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated  during  pregnancy. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning  pregnancy should  be changed to alternative antihypertensive  treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed,  treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). Lactose: this medicinal  product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems  of galactose intolerance,  the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption  should  not take this medicinal  product. Paediatric population:  irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations  aged 6 to 16 years old but the current data are insufficient  to support an extension of the use in children  until  further data become available  (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Diuretics and other antihypertensive  agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the hypotensive  effects of irbesartan; however  irbesartan has been safely administered with other antihypertensive  agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting  calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in  volume depletion  and a risk of hypotension  when initiating  therapy with Sabervel (see section 4.4). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Clinical  trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system  (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors,  angiotensin  II receptor blockers or aliskiren  is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension,  hyperkalaemia  and decreased renal function  (including  acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).

## Potassium supplements and potassium-sp

aring diuretics:  based on experience with the use of other medicinal  products that affect the reninangiotensin  system, concomitant  use of potassium-sparing  diuretics,  potassium supplements,  salt substitutes containing  potassium or other medicinal  products that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium  and is, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lithium:  reversible increases in serum lithium  concentrations and toxicity  have been reported during concomitant administration  of lithium  with angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors.  Similar  effects have been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination  is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination  proves necessary, careful monitoring  of serum lithium  levels is recommended.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs: when angiotensin  II antagonists are administered simultaneously  with non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic  acid (&gt; 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.

As with ACE inhibitors,  concomitant  use of angiotensin  II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function,  including  possible acute renal failure,  and an increase in serum potassium, especially  in patients with poor pre-existing  renal function. The combination  should be administered with caution, especially  in the elderly. Patients should  be adequately hydrated and consideration  should  be given to monitoring  renal function  after initiation  of concomitant therapy, and periodically  thereafter. Additional  information  on irbesartan interactions:  in  clinical  studies, the pharmacokinetic  of irbesartan is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide.  Irbesartan is mainly  metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by glucuronidation.  No significant  pharmacokinetic  or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal  product metabolised  by CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin  on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic  of digoxin  was not altered by coadministration  of irbesartan. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy: The use of AIIRAs is not recommended during  the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during  the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Epidemiological  evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following  exposure to ACE inhibitors during  the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive;  however a small  increase in risk cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled  epidemiological  data on the risk with Angiotensin  II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar  risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning  pregnancy should  be changed to alternative antihypertensive  treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed,  treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately,  and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should  be started. Exposure to AIIRA therapy during  the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity  (decreased renal function,  oligohydramnios,  skull  ossification  retardation) and neonatal toxicity  (renal failure,  hypotension,  hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). Should  exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull  is recommended. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension  (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

## Breast-feeding:

Because no information  is available  regarding the use of Sabervel during  breast-feeding, Sabervel is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during  breastfeeding are preferable, especially while  nursing a newborn or preterm infant.

It is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites  are excreted in human milk.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Available  pharmacodynamic/toxicological  data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its metabolites in milk  (for details see 5.3).

## Fertility

Irbesartan had no effect upon fertility  of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing the first signs of parental toxicity  (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability  to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on its pharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely  to affect this ability.  When driving  vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into  account that dizziness  or weariness may occur during treatment. 4.8 Undesirable effects In placebo-controlled  trials in patients with hypertension,  the overall  incidence of adverse events did not differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation  due to any clinical  or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for placebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the recommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria  and normal  renal function,  orthostatic dizziness  and orthostatic hypotension  were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon)  but in excess of placebo. The following  table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled  trials in which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the adverse reactions that were additionally  reported in &gt; 2% of diabetic  hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency  and overt proteinuria  and in excess of placebo. The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following  convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000  to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000  to &lt; 1/1,000);  very rare (&lt; 1/10,000).  Within  each frequency grouping,  undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Adverse reactions additionally  reported from post-marketing experience are also listed. These adverse reactions are derived from spontaneous reports.

In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria  and normal renal function,  hyperkalaemia (≥ 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the irbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency  and overt proteinuria, hyperkalaemia (≥ 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group and 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. Common: significant  increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in irbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable  clinical  musculoskeletal  events. In 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with irbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*,  which was not clinically  significant,  has been observed.

## Paediatric population:

In a randomised trial  of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following adverse reactions occurred in the 3-week double-blind  phase: headache (7.9%), hypotension  (2.2%), dizziness  (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label  period of this trial the most frequent laboratory abnormalities  observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and elevated CK values in 2% of child  recipients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

Experience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity.  The most likely  manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension  and tachycardia; bradycardia might also occur from overdose. No specific information  is available  on the treatment of overdose with Sabervel. The patient should  be closely monitored,  and the treatment should  be symptomatic and supportive. Suggested measures include induction  of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

The efficacy of irbesartan is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin  system, black hypertensive patients have notably less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered  concomitantly  with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide  (e.g. 12.5 mg daily),  the antihypertensive response in black patients approaches that of white patients.

5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group:  Angiotensin-II  antagonists, plain. ATC code: C09C A04. Mechanism of action:  Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II  receptor (type AT 1 ) antagonist. It is expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II  mediated by the AT 1  receptor, regardless of the source or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II  (AT 1 ) receptors results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II  levels,  and a decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly  affected by irbesartan alone at the recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit  ACE (kininase-II),  an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin  into  inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation  for its activity. Clinical  efficacy: Hypertension Irbesartan lowers blood  pressure with minimal  change in heart rate. The decrease in blood  pressure is dose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of 150-300  mg once daily  lower supine or seated blood  pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing)  by an average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic)  greater than those associated with placebo. Peak reduction of blood  pressure is achieved within  3-6 hours after administration  and the blood pressure lowering effect is maintained  for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood pressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic  and systolic responses at the recommended doses. Once daily  dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar  to twice daily  dosing  on the same total dose. The blood  pressure lowering effect of irbesartan is evident within  1-2 weeks, with the maximal  effect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive  effects are maintained during  long term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood  pressure gradually returns toward baseline. Rebound hypertension has not been observed. The blood  pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type  diuretics are additive.  In patients not adequately controlled  by irbesartan alone, the addition  of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily  results in  a further placebo-adjusted blood  pressure reduction at trough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). Medicinal product no longer authorised

There is no clinically  important  effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion.

## Paediatric population

Reduction of blood  pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low),  1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high)  target titrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family  history  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hypertension) children  and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the three weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable,  trough seated systolic blood  pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium  dose), 13.2 mmHg (high dose). No significant  difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough seated diastolic  blood  pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium dose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized to either active medicinal  product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg in SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of irbesartan (see section 4.2).

## Hypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease

The study of the 'Effects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria  in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  (IRMA 2)' shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria  in patients with microalbuminuria.  IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled  double blind  morbidity  study in 590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria  (30-300 mg/day) and normal  renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl  in males and &lt; 1.1 mg/dl  in females). The study examined the long-term effects (2 years) of irbesartan on the progression to clinical  (overt) proteinuria  (urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) &gt; 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from baseline). The predefined blood  pressure goal was ≤ 135/85  mmHg. Additional  antihypertensive  agents (excluding ACE inhibitors,  angiotensin  II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine  calcium blockers) were added as needed to help achieve the blood  pressure goal. While  similar  blood  pressure was achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in  the placebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint  of overt proteinuria,  demonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An accompanying improvement  in the glomerular  filtration  rate (GFR) was not observed during  the first three months of

The 'Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)' shows that irbesartan decreases the progression of renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency  and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double blind,  controlled,  morbidity  and mortality  trial comparing  irbesartan, amlodipine  and placebo. In 1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria  ≥ 900 mg/day and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl,  the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of irbesartan on the progression of renal disease and all-cause mortality  were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg to a maintenance dose of 300 mg irbesartan, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine,  or placebo as tolerated. Patients in all  treatment groups typically  received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive  agents (e.g., diuretics,  beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood  pressure goal of ≤ 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic  pressure if baseline was &gt; 160 mmHg. Sixty per cent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood  pressure whereas this figure was 76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine  groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly  reduced the relative risk in the primary combined  endpoint  of doubling  serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality.  Approximately  33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached the primary renal composite endpoint  compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine  groups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction compared to amlodipine  (p = 0.006)]. When the individual  components of the primary endpoint  were analysed, no effect in all  cause mortality  was observed, while  a positive  trend in the reduction in ESRD and a significant  reduction in doubling  of serum creatinine were observed. Subgroups consisting  of gender, race, age, duration  of diabetes, baseline blood  pressure, serum creatinine, and albumin  excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black subgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall  study population  respectively, a renal benefit was not evident,  although  the confidence intervals  do not exclude it. As for the secondary endpoint  of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups in the overall population,  although  an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a decreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebobased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the irbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based  regimen,  while hospitalization  due to heart failure was reduced in the overall  population.  However, no proper explanation  for these findings  in women has been identified. Medicinal product no longer authorised

treatment. The slowing  in the progression to clinical  proteinuria  was evident as early as three months and continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria  (&lt; 30 mg/day) was more frequent in the irbesartan 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%).

Two large randomised, controlled  trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination  with Ramipril  Global  Endpoint  Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination  of an ACE-inhibitor  with an angiotensin  II receptor blocker.

ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history  of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus  accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus  and diabetic nephropathy.

These studies have shown no significant  beneficial  effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and mortality,  while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury  and/or hypotension  as compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar  pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors  and angiotensin  II receptor blockers. ACE-inhibitors  and angiotensin  II receptor blockers should  therefore not be used concomitantly  in patients with diabetic nephropathy. ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial  in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was a study designed to test the benefit of adding  aliskiren  to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor or an angiotensin  II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus  and chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically  more frequent in the aliskiren  group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia,  hypotension  and renal dysfunction)  were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties After oral administration,  irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability  gave values of approximately  60-80%. Concomitant  food intake does not significantly  influence the bioavailability  of irbesartan. Plasma protein binding  is approximately  96%, with negligible  binding  to cellular blood components. The volume of distribution  is 53 - 93 litres. Following  oral or intravenous  administration of 14 C irbesartan, 80-85% of the circulating  plasma radioactivity  is attributable  to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised  by the liver  via glucuronide  conjugation  and oxidation.  The major circulating  metabolite  is irbesartan glucuronide  (approximately  6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily  oxidised  by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible  effect. Irbesartan exhibits linear  and dose proportional  pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. A less than proportional  increase in oral absorption  at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal recommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations are attained at 1.5 - 2 hours after oral administration.  The total body and renal clearance are 157 - 176 and 3 - 3.5 ml/min,  respectively. The terminal elimination  half-life  of irbesartan is 11 - 15 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within  3 days after initiation  of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited  accumulation of irbesartan (&lt; 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life  and accumulation  of irbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and C max  values were also somewhat greater in elderly  subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young  subjects (18 - 40 years). However the terminal half-life  was not significantly  altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Irbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated  by both biliary  and renal pathways. After either oral or IV administration  of 14 C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity  is recovered in the urine,  and the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan.

## Paediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacokinetics  of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children  after the administration of single  and multiple  daily  doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum  daily  dose of 150 mg for four weeks. Of those 23 children,  21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults (twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that C max , AUC and clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan daily. A limited  accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily  dosing.

Renal impairment:  in patients with renal impairment  or those undergoing  haemodialysis,  the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly  altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis.

## 6.1 List of excipients

Hepatic impairment:  in patients with mild  to moderate cirrhosis,  the pharmacokinetic  parameters of irbesartan are not significantly  altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 5.3 Preclinical safety data There was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity  at clinically  relevant doses. In non-clinical  safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day  in rats and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in macaques) caused a reduction of red blood  cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin,  haematocrit). At very high  doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day)  degenerative changes in the kidney  (such as interstitial nephritis,  tubular distension,  basophilic  tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the hypotensive  effects of the medicinal  product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, irbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy  of the juxtaglomerular  cells (in rats at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day,  in macaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the pharmacological  action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular  cells does not appear to have any relevance. There was no evidence of mutagenicity,  clastogenicity  or carcinogenicity. Fertility  and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at oral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity  (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day),  including mortality  at the highest dose. No significant  effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants,  or live fetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival,  development,  or reproduction of offspring. Studies in animals indicate that the radiolabeled  irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit fetuses. Irbesartan is excreted in the milk  of lactating rats. Animal  studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, hydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, abortion  or early resorption  were noted at doses causing significant  maternal toxicity,  including mortality.  No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. 6.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Sabervel 300 mg film-coated tablets

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each film-coated tablet contains 300 mg of irbesartan

Excipient  with known effect: 80 mg of lactose monohydrate per film-coated tablet

In hypertensive type 2 diabetic  patients, therapy should  be initiated  at 150 mg irbesartan once daily and titrated up to 300 mg once daily  as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. The demonstration  of renal benefit of Sabervel in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based on studies where irbesartan was used in addition  to other antihypertensive  agents, as needed, to reach target blood  pressure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1).

For the full  list of excipients,  see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Film-coated  tablet. White, concave, round, film-coated tablet with 11 mm diameter. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Sabervel is indicated  in adults for the treatment of essential hypertension. It is also indicated  for the treatment of renal disease in adult patients with hypertension  and type 2 diabetes mellitus  as part of an antihypertensive  medicinal  product regimen (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The usual recommended initial  and maintenance dose is 150 mg once daily,  with or without  food. Sabervel at a dose of 150 mg once daily  generally  provides a better 24 hour blood  pressure control than 75 mg. However, initiation  of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly  in haemodialysed  patients and in the elderly over 75 years. In patients insufficiently  controlled  with 150 mg once daily,  the dose of Sabervel can be increased to 300 mg, or other antihypertensive  agents can be added (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). In particular,  the addition  of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide  has been shown to have an additive effect with Sabervel (see section 4.5). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Special Populations

Renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired  renal function. A lower starting dose (75 mg) should  be considered for patients undergoing  haemodialysis  (see section 4.4).

Hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild  to moderate hepatic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

impairment.  There is no clinical  experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Elderly patients: although consideration  should be given to initiating  therapy with 75 mg in patients over 75 years of age, dosage adjustment is not usually  necessary for the elderly.

Paediatric population: the safety and efficacy of Sabervel in children  aged 0 to 18 has not been established. Currently available  data are described in section 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology  can be made.

## Method of Administration

For oral use. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity  to the active substance, or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1). Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). The concomitant  use of Sabervel with aliskiren-containing  products is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus  or renal impairment  (GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73  m 2 ) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Intravascular volume  depletion:  symptomatic  hypotension,  especially after the first dose, may occur in patients who are volume  and/or sodium  depleted by vigorous  diuretic  therapy, dietary salt restriction, diarrhoea or vomiting.  Such conditions  should  be corrected before the administration  of Sabervel. Renovascular hypertension:  there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency when patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single  functioning  kidney are treated with medicinal  products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system. While this is not documented with Sabervel, a similar  effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II  receptor antagonists. Renal impairment  and kidney  transplantation:  when Sabervel is used in patients with impaired  renal function,  a periodic  monitoring  of potassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no experience regarding the administration  of Sabervel in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and cardiovascular events were not uniform  across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study with patients with advanced renal disease. In particular,  they appeared less favourable in women and non-white subjects (see section 5.1). Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system (RAAS) Medicinal product no longer authorised

There is evidence that the concomitant  use of ACE-inhibitors,  angiotensin  II receptor blockers or aliskiren  increases the risk of hypotension,  hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors,  angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren  is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely  necessary, this should only  occur under specialist supervision  and subject to frequent close monitoring  of renal function,  electrolytes and blood  pressure. ACE-inhibitors  and angiotensin  II receptor blockers should  not be used concomitantly  in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

Hyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal  products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system, hyperkalaemia may occur during  the treatment with Sabervel, especially  in the presence of renal impairment,  overt proteinuria  due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring  of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Lithium:  the combination  of lithium  and Sabervel is not recommended (see section 4.5).

Aortic and mitral  valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:  as with other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral  stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy.

Primary aldosteronism:  patients with primary aldosteronism  generally will  not respond to antihypertensive  medicinal  products acting through inhibition  of the renin-angiotensin  system. Therefore, the use of Sabervel is not recommended.

General: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function  depend predominantly  on the activity  of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or underlying  renal disease, including  renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors  or angiotensin-II  receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated with acute hypotension,  azotaemia, oliguria,  or rarely acute renal failure. As with any antihypertensive agent, excessive blood  pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or ischaemic cardiovascular disease could  result in a myocardial  infarction or stroke. As observed for angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors,  irbesartan and the other angiotensin antagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood  pressure in black people than in non-blacks, possibly  because of higher prevalence of low-renin  states in the black hypertensive population  (see section 5.1). Pregnancy: Angiotensin  II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated  during  pregnancy. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning  pregnancy should  be changed to alternative antihypertensive  treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed,  treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). Lactose: this medicinal  product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems  of galactose intolerance,  the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption  should  not take this medicinal  product. Paediatric population:  irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations  aged 6 to 16 years old but the current data are insufficient  to support an extension of the use in children  until  further data become available  (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Diuretics and other antihypertensive  agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the hypotensive  effects of irbesartan; however  irbesartan has been safely administered with other antihypertensive  agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting  calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in  volume depletion  and a risk of hypotension  when initiating  therapy with Sabervel (see section 4.4). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Clinical  trial data has shown that dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system  (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors,  angiotensin  II receptor blockers or aliskiren  is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as hypotension,  hyperkalaemia  and decreased renal function  (including  acute renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).

Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing  diuretics:  based on experience with the use of other medicinal  products that affect the renin-angiotensin  system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics,  potassium supplements,  salt substitutes containing  potassium or other medicinal  products that may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium  and is, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4).

Lithium:  reversible increases in serum lithium  concentrations and toxicity  have been reported during

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

concomitant administration  of lithium  with angiotensin  converting enzyme inhibitors.  Similar  effects have been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination  is not recommended (see section 4.4). If the combination  proves necessary, careful monitoring  of serum lithium  levels is recommended.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs: when angiotensin  II antagonists are administered simultaneously  with non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic  acid (&gt; 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect may occur.

As with ACE inhibitors,  concomitant  use of angiotensin  II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function,  including  possible acute renal failure,  and an increase in serum potassium, especially  in patients with poor pre-existing  renal function. The combination  should be administered with caution, especially  in the elderly. Patients should  be adequately hydrated and consideration  should  be given to monitoring  renal function  after initiation  of concomitant therapy, and periodically  thereafter.

Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension  (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Additional  information  on irbesartan interactions:  in  clinical  studies, the pharmacokinetic  of irbesartan is not affected by hydrochlorothiazide.  Irbesartan is mainly  metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by glucuronidation.  No significant  pharmacokinetic  or pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal  product metabolised  by CYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin  on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan have not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic  of digoxin  was not altered by coadministration  of irbesartan. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy: The use of AIIRAs is not recommended during  the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during  the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Epidemiological  evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following  exposure to ACE inhibitors during  the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive;  however a small  increase in risk cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled  epidemiological  data on the risk with Angiotensin  II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar  risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning  pregnancy should  be changed to alternative antihypertensive  treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed,  treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately,  and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should  be started. Exposure to AIIRA therapy during  the second and third trimesters is known to induce human fetotoxicity  (decreased renal function,  oligohydramnios,  skull  ossification  retardation) and neonatal toxicity  (renal failure,  hypotension,  hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). Should  exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull  is recommended.

## Breast-feeding:

Because no information  is available  regarding the use of Sabervel during  breast-feeding, Sabervel is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during  breastfeeding are preferable, especially while  nursing a newborn or preterm infant.

It is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites  are excreted in human milk. Available  pharmacodynamic/toxicological  data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

metabolites in milk  (for details see 5.3).

## Fertility

Irbesartan had no effect upon fertility  of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing the first signs of parental toxicity  (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

No studies on the effects on the ability  to drive and use machines have been performed. Based on its pharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely  to affect this ability.  When driving  vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into  account that dizziness  or weariness may occur during treatment.

4.8 Undesirable effects In placebo-controlled  trials in patients with hypertension,  the overall  incidence of adverse events did not differ between the irbesartan (56.2%) and the placebo groups (56.5%). Discontinuation  due to any clinical  or laboratory adverse event was less frequent for irbesartan-treated patients (3.3%) than for placebo-treated patients (4.5%). The incidence of adverse events was not related to dose (in the recommended dose range), gender, age, race, or duration of treatment. In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria  and normal  renal function,  orthostatic dizziness  and orthostatic hypotension  were reported in 0.5% of the patients (i.e., uncommon)  but in excess of placebo. The following  table presents the adverse drug reactions that were reported in placebo-controlled  trials in which 1,965 hypertensive patients received irbesartan. Terms marked with a star (*) refer to the adverse reactions that were additionally  reported in &gt; 2% of diabetic  hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency  and overt proteinuria  and in excess of placebo. The frequency of adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following  convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000  to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000  to &lt; 1/1,000);  very rare (&lt; 1/10,000).  Within  each frequency grouping,  undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Adverse reactions additionally  reported from post-marketing experience are also listed. These adverse reactions are derived from spontaneous reports.

In diabetic hypertensive patients with microalbuminuria  and normal renal function,  hyperkalaemia (≥ 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 29.4% of the patients in the irbesartan 300 mg group and 22% of the patients in the placebo group. In diabetic hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency  and overt proteinuria, hyperkalaemia (≥ 5.5 mEq/L) occurred in 46.3% of the patients in the irbesartan group and 26.3% of the patients in the placebo group. Common: significant  increases in plasma creatine kinase were commonly observed (1.7%) in irbesartan treated subjects. None of these increases were associated with identifiable  clinical  musculoskeletal  events. In 1.7% of hypertensive patients with advanced diabetic renal disease treated with irbesartan, a decrease in haemoglobin*,  which was not Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Paediatric population:

In a randomised trial  of 318 hypertensive children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years, the following adverse reactions occurred in the 3-week double-blind  phase: headache (7.9%), hypotension  (2.2%), dizziness  (1.9%), cough (0.9%). In the 26-week open-label  period of this trial the most frequent laboratory abnormalities  observed were creatinine increases (6.5%) and elevated CK values in 2% of child  recipients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

Experience in adults exposed to doses of up to 900 mg/day for 8 weeks revealed no toxicity.  The most likely  manifestations of overdose are expected to be hypotension  and tachycardia; bradycardia might also occur from overdose. No specific information  is available  on the treatment of overdose with Sabervel. The patient should  be closely monitored,  and the treatment should  be symptomatic and supportive. Suggested measures include induction  of emesis and/or gastric lavage. Activated charcoal may be useful in the treatment of overdose. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

The efficacy of irbesartan is not influenced by age or gender. As is the case with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin  system, black hypertensive patients have notably less response to irbesartan monotherapy. When irbesartan is administered  concomitantly  with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide  (e.g. 12.5 mg daily),  the antihypertensive response in black patients approaches that of white patients.

5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group:  Angiotensin-II  antagonists, plain. ATC code: C09C A04. Mechanism of action:  Irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin-II  receptor (type AT 1 ) antagonist. It is expected to block all actions of angiotensin-II  mediated by the AT 1  receptor, regardless of the source or route of synthesis of angiotensin-II. The selective antagonism of the angiotensin-II  (AT 1 ) receptors results in increases in plasma renin levels and angiotensin-II  levels,  and a decrease in plasma aldosterone concentration. Serum potassium levels are not significantly  affected by irbesartan alone at the recommended doses. Irbesartan does not inhibit  ACE (kininase-II),  an enzyme which generates angiotensin-II and also degrades bradykinin  into  inactive metabolites. Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation  for its activity. Clinical  efficacy: Hypertension Irbesartan lowers blood  pressure with minimal  change in heart rate. The decrease in blood  pressure is dose-related for once a day doses with a tendency towards plateau at doses above 300 mg. Doses of 150-300  mg once daily  lower supine or seated blood  pressures at trough (i.e. 24 hours after dosing)  by an average of 8-13/5-8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic)  greater than those associated with placebo. Peak reduction of blood  pressure is achieved within  3-6 hours after administration  and the blood pressure lowering effect is maintained  for at least 24 hours. At 24 hours the reduction of blood pressure was 60-70% of the corresponding peak diastolic  and systolic responses at the recommended doses. Once daily  dosing with 150 mg produced trough and mean 24 hour responses similar  to twice daily  dosing  on the same total dose. The blood  pressure lowering effect of irbesartan is evident within  1-2 weeks, with the maximal  effect occurring by 4-6 weeks after start of therapy. The antihypertensive  effects are maintained during  long term therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, blood  pressure gradually returns toward baseline. Rebound hypertension has not been observed. The blood  pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type  diuretics are additive.  In patients not adequately controlled  by irbesartan alone, the addition  of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) to irbesartan once daily  results in  a further placebo-adjusted blood  pressure reduction at trough of 7-10/3-6 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic).

There is no clinically  important  effect on serum uric acid or urinary uric acid secretion.

## Paediatric population

Reduction of blood  pressure with 0.5 mg/kg (low),  1.5 mg/kg (medium) and 4.5 mg/kg (high)  target titrated doses of irbesartan was evaluated in 318 hypertensive or at risk (diabetic, family  history  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hypertension) children  and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years over a three week period. At the end of the three weeks the mean reduction from baseline in the primary efficacy variable,  trough seated systolic blood  pressure (SeSBP) was 11.7 mmHg (low dose), 9.3 mmHg (medium  dose), 13.2 mmHg (high dose). No significant  difference was apparent between these doses. Adjusted mean change of trough seated diastolic  blood  pressure (SeDBP) was as follows: 3.8 mmHg (low dose), 3.2 mmHg (medium dose), 5.6 mmHg (high dose). Over a subsequent two week period where patients were re-randomized to either active medicinal  product or placebo, patients on placebo had increases of 2.4 and 2.0 mmHg in SeSBP and SeDBP compared to +0.1 and -0.3 mmHg changes respectively in those on all doses of irbesartan (see section 4.2).

## Hypertension and type 2 diabetes with renal disease

The study of the 'Effects of Irbesartan on Microalbuminuria  in Hypertensive Patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  (IRMA 2)' shows that irbesartan 300 mg delays progression to overt proteinuria  in patients with microalbuminuria.  IRMA 2 was a placebo-controlled  double blind  morbidity  study in 590 patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria  (30-300 mg/day) and normal  renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/ dl  in males and &lt; 1.1 mg/dl  in females). The study examined the long-term effects (2 years) of irbesartan on the progression to clinical  (overt) proteinuria  (urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) &gt; 300 mg/day, and an increase in UAER of at least 30% from baseline). The predefined blood  pressure goal was ≤ 135/85  mmHg. Additional  antihypertensive  agents (excluding ACE inhibitors,  angiotensin  II receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine  calcium blockers) were added as needed to help achieve the blood  pressure goal. While  similar  blood  pressure was achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in  the placebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint  of overt proteinuria,  demonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose. An accompanying improvement  in the glomerular  filtration  rate (GFR) was not observed during  the first three months of

The 'Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT)' shows that irbesartan decreases the progression of renal disease in patients with chronic renal insufficiency  and overt proteinuria. IDNT was a double blind,  controlled,  morbidity  and mortality  trial comparing  irbesartan, amlodipine  and placebo. In 1,715 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, proteinuria  ≥ 900 mg/day and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0-3.0 mg/dl,  the long-term effects (mean 2.6 years) of irbesartan on the progression of renal disease and all-cause mortality  were examined. Patients were titrated from 75 mg to a maintenance dose of 300 mg irbesartan, from 2.5 mg to 10 mg amlodipine,  or placebo as tolerated. Patients in all  treatment groups typically  received between 2 and 4 antihypertensive  agents (e.g., diuretics,  beta blockers, alpha blockers) to reach a predefined blood  pressure goal of ≤ 135/85 mmHg or a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic  pressure if baseline was &gt; 160 mmHg. Sixty per cent (60%) of patients in the placebo group reached this target blood  pressure whereas this figure was 76% and 78% in the irbesartan and amlodipine  groups respectively. Irbesartan significantly  reduced the relative risk in the primary combined  endpoint  of doubling  serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or all-cause mortality.  Approximately  33% of patients in the irbesartan group reached the primary renal composite endpoint  compared to 39% and 41% in the placebo and amlodipine  groups [20% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.024) and 23% relative risk reduction compared to amlodipine  (p = 0.006)]. When the individual  components of the primary endpoint  were analysed, no effect in all  cause mortality  was observed, while  a positive  trend in the reduction in ESRD and a significant  reduction in doubling  of serum creatinine were observed. Subgroups consisting  of gender, race, age, duration  of diabetes, baseline blood  pressure, serum creatinine, and albumin  excretion rate were assessed for treatment effect. In the female and black subgroups which represented 32% and 26% of the overall  study population  respectively, a renal benefit was not evident,  although  the confidence intervals  do not exclude it. As for the secondary endpoint  of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, there was no difference among the three groups in the overall population,  although  an increased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen for women and a decreased incidence of non-fatal MI was seen in males in the irbesartan group versus the placebobased regimen. An increased incidence of non-fatal MI and stroke was seen in females in the irbesartan-based regimen versus the amlodipine-based  regimen,  while hospitalization  due to heart failure was reduced in the overall  population.  However, no proper explanation  for these findings  in women has been identified. Medicinal product no longer authorised

treatment. The slowing  in the progression to clinical  proteinuria  was evident as early as three months and continued over the 2 year period. Regression to normoalbuminuria  (&lt; 30 mg/day) was more frequent in the irbesartan 300 mg group (34%) than in the placebo group (21%).

Two large randomised, controlled  trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination  with Ramipril  Global  Endpoint  Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination  of an ACE-inhibitor  with an angiotensin  II receptor blocker.

ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history  of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus  accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus  and diabetic nephropathy.

Irbesartan exhibits linear  and dose proportional  pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10 to 600 mg. A less than proportional  increase in oral absorption  at doses beyond 600 mg (twice the maximal recommended dose) was observed; the mechanism for this is unknown. Peak plasma concentrations are attained at 1.5 - 2 hours after oral administration.  The total body and renal clearance are 157 - 176 and 3 - 3.5 ml/min,  respectively. The terminal elimination  half-life  of irbesartan is 11 - 15 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within  3 days after initiation  of a once-daily dosing regimen. Limited  accumulation of irbesartan (&lt; 20%) is observed in plasma upon repeated once-daily dosing. In a study, somewhat higher plasma concentrations of irbesartan were observed in female hypertensive patients. However, there was no difference in the half-life  and accumulation  of irbesartan. No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients. Irbesartan AUC and C max  values were also somewhat greater in elderly  subjects (≥ 65 years) than those of young  subjects (18  - 40 years). However the terminal half-life  was not significantly  altered. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients.

These studies have shown no significant  beneficial  effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and mortality,  while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury  and/or hypotension  as compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar  pharmacodynamic properties, these results are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors  and angiotensin  II receptor blockers. ACE-inhibitors  and angiotensin  II receptor blockers should  therefore not be used concomitantly  in patients with diabetic nephropathy. ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial  in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) was a study designed to test the benefit of adding  aliskiren  to a standard therapy of an ACE-inhibitor or an angiotensin  II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus  and chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically  more frequent in the aliskiren  group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia,  hypotension  and renal dysfunction)  were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the placebo group. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties After oral administration,  irbesartan is well absorbed: studies of absolute bioavailability  gave values of approximately  60 -80%. Concomitant food intake does not significantly  influence  the bioavailability  of irbesartan. Plasma protein binding  is approximately  96%, with negligible  binding  to cellular blood components. The volume of distribution  is 53 -93 litres. Following  oral or intravenous administration of 14 C irbesartan, 80 -85% of the circulating  plasma radioactivity  is attributable  to unchanged irbesartan. Irbesartan is metabolised  by the liver  via glucuronide  conjugation  and oxidation.  The major circulating  metabolite  is irbesartan glucuronide  (approximately  6%). In vitro studies indicate that irbesartan is primarily  oxidised  by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9; isoenzyme CYP3A4 has negligible  effect. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Irbesartan and its metabolites are eliminated  by both biliary  and renal pathways. After either oral or IV administration  of 14 C irbesartan, about 20% of the radioactivity  is recovered in the urine,  and the remainder in the faeces. Less than 2% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged irbesartan.

## Paediatric population

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The pharmacokinetics  of irbesartan were evaluated in 23 hypertensive children  after the administration of single  and multiple  daily  doses of irbesartan (2 mg/kg) up to a maximum  daily  dose of 150 mg for four weeks. Of those 23 children,  21 were evaluable for comparison of pharmacokinetics with adults (twelve children over 12 years, nine children between 6 and 12 years). Results showed that C max , AUC and clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adult patients receiving 150 mg irbesartan daily. A limited  accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily  dosing.

Renal impairment:  in patients with renal impairment  or those undergoing  haemodialysis,  the pharmacokinetic parameters of irbesartan are not significantly  altered. Irbesartan is not removed by haemodialysis.

## 6.1 List of excipients

Hepatic impairment:  in patients with mild  to moderate cirrhosis,  the pharmacokinetic  parameters of irbesartan are not significantly  altered. Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 5.3 Preclinical safety data There was no evidence of abnormal systemic or target organ toxicity  at clinically  relevant doses. In non-clinical  safety studies, high doses of irbesartan (≥ 250 mg/kg/day  in rats and ≥ 100 mg/kg/day in macaques) caused a reduction of red blood  cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin,  haematocrit). At very high  doses (≥ 500 mg/kg/day)  degenerative changes in the kidney  (such as interstitial nephritis,  tubular distension,  basophilic  tubules, increased plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine) were induced by irbesartan in the rat and the macaque and are considered secondary to the hypotensive  effects of the medicinal  product which led to decreased renal perfusion. Furthermore, irbesartan induced hyperplasia/hypertrophy  of the juxtaglomerular  cells (in rats at ≥ 90 mg/kg/day,  in macaques at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day). All of these changes were considered to be caused by the pharmacological  action of irbesartan. For therapeutic doses of irbesartan in humans, the hyperplasia/ hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular  cells does not appear to have any relevance. There was no evidence of mutagenicity,  clastogenicity  or carcinogenicity. Fertility  and reproductive performance were not affected in studies of male and female rats even at oral doses of irbesartan causing some parental toxicity  (from 50 to 650 mg/kg/day),  including mortality  at the highest dose. No significant  effects on the number of corpora lutea, implants,  or live fetuses were observed. Irbesartan did not affect survival,  development,  or reproduction of offspring. Studies in animals indicate that the radiolabeled  irbesartan is detected in rat and rabbit fetuses. Irbesartan is excreted in the milk  of lactating rats. Animal  studies with irbesartan showed transient toxic effects (increased renal pelvic cavitation, hydroureter or subcutaneous oedema) in rat foetuses, which were resolved after birth. In rabbits, abortion  or early resorption  were noted at doses causing significant  maternal toxicity,  including mortality.  No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit. 6.

In this leaflet: 1. What Sabervel is and what it is used for 2. Before you take Sabervel 3. How to take Sabervel 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Sabervel 6. Further information 1. WHAT SABERVEL IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR Sabervel belongs to a group of medicines  known as angiotensin-II  receptor antagonists. Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which binds to receptors in blood  vessels causing them to tighten. This results in an increase in blood  pressure. Sabervel prevents the binding  of angiotensin-II  to these receptors, causing the blood  vessels to relax and the blood  pressure to lower. Sabervel slows the decrease of kidney function in patients with high  blood  pressure and type 2 diabetes. Sabervel is used in adult patients · to treat high  blood  pressure (essential hypertension) · to protect the kidney  in patients with high  blood  pressure, type 2 diabetes and laboratory evidence of impaired  kidney function. 2. BEFORE YOU TAKE SABERVEL Do not take Sabervel · if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to irbesartan or any other ingredients  of Sabervel · if you are more than 3 months pregnant . (It is also better to avoid  Sabervel in early pregnancy - see pregnancy section) · if you have diabetes or impaired  kidney  function and you are treated with a blood  pressure lowering  medicine containing  aliskiren. Warnings and precautions Tell your doctor if any of the following  apply  to you: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- if you suffer from kidney problems
- if you suffer from heart problems
- if you receive Sabervel for diabetic kidney disease . In this case your doctor may perform regular blood  tests, especially for measuring blood  potassium levels in case of poor kidney function
- if you are going to have an operation (surgery) or be given anaesthetics.
- if you are taking any of the following  medicines used to treat high  blood  pressure: - an ACE-inhibitor  (for example enalapril,  lisinopril,  ramipril),  in particular if you have diabetes-related kidney problems.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- aliskiren

Your doctor may check your kidney  function,  blood  pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. potassium) in your blood  at regular intervals.

See also information  under the heading 'Do not take Sabervel'.

You must tell  your doctor if you think you are (or might  become) pregnant. Sabervel is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see pregnancy section).

Use in Children This medicine should  not be used in children and adolescents (under 18 years) because the safety and efficacy have not yet been fully  established. Other medicines and Sabervel Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking,  have recently taken or might  take any other medicines. Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions: If you are taking an ACE-inhibitor  or aliskiren  (see also information  under the headings 'Do not take Sabervel' and 'Warnings  and precautions'). You may need to have blood checks if you take: · potassium supplements · salt substitutes containing  potassium · potassium-sparing  medicines (such as certain diuretics) · medicines containing  lithium If you take certain painkillers,  called non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs, the effect of irbesartan may be reduced. Taking Sabervel with food and drink Sabervel can be taken with or without food. Pregnancy and breast-feeding Pregnancy You must tell  your doctor if you think you are (or might  become) pregnant. Your doctor will  normally advise you to stop taking Sabervel before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are pregnant and will  advise you to take another medicine instead of Sabervel. Sabervel is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if used after the third  month of pregnancy. Breast-feeding Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding. Sabervel is not recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is newborn, or was born prematurely.

## Driving and using machines

No studies on the effects on the ability  to drive and use machines have been performed. Sabervel is unlikely  to affect your ability  to drive or use machines. However, occasionally  dizziness  or weariness may occur during  treatment of high  blood  pressure. If you experience these, talk to your doctor before attempting to drive or use machines.

## Important information about some of the ingredients of Sabervel

Sabervel contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars (e.g. lactose), contact your doctor before taking this medicine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. HOW TO TAKE SABERVEL
