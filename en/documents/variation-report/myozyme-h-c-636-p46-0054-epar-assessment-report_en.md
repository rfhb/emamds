## 1. Introduction

On 29.05.2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for MYOZYME, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure PAM 054.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The  MAH  stated  that  study  AGLU07510  \"A  Phase  3/4,  Prospective,  Multinational,  Open-label, Noninferiority Study of Alglucosidase Alfa Manufactured at the 160 L and 4000 L Scales in Treatment Naive Patients with Infantile-Onset Pompe Disease\" is a stand-alone study.

The MAH confirmed that study PEAS (AGLU07510) is not part of an approved Paediatric Investigation Plan. The MAH has not identified any new paediatric information from this study that would need to be added to the EU Product Information.

The MAH also informed that a small clinical trial to investigate pharmacodynamics aspects (EMBASSY (AGLU07310)) in Late -Onset Pompe Disease was conducted and completed.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

In the United States (US), alglucosidase alfa produced at the 160 L research scale was approved for use by Pompe patients without limitation to age or age of onset. Alglucosidase alfa produced at the 4000 L scale was indicated for use in patients 8 years and older with late (noninfantile) onset Pompe disease (acid α -glucosidase [GAA] deficiency) who do not have evidence of cardiac hypertrophy.

In the European Union (EU) and other areas of the world, alglucosidase alfa produced at the 4000 L scale-up scale was approved on the basis of physico-chemical comparability to the previously approved intermediate scale product and is indicated for use by Pompe patients without limitation to age or age of onset.

This study was intended to provide clinical safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) data to support comparability of alglucosidase alfa manufactured at the 160 L scale  (Myozyme  in  the  United  States  [US])  and  4000  L  scale  (Lumizyme  in  the  US/  Myozyme throughout the rest of world), in order to support expansion of the indication of Lumizyme in the US to include infantile-onset Pompe disease patients.

With the approval on 1 August 2014 for the supplement to expand the indication for Lumizyme in the US to include all Pompe patients irrespective of age or phenotype, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that both production scales of 160 L alglucosidase alfa and 4000 L alglucosidase alfa are biochemically and clinically comparable. In light of this approval by the FDA, the justification for continuing to run this study no longer existed and, therefore, Genzyme terminated the study early.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted the final report for:

- A Phase 3/4, Prospective, Multinational, Open-label, Noninferiority Study of Alglucosidase Alfa Manufactured at the 160 L and 4000 L Scales in Treatment Naïve Patients with Infantile-Onset Pompe Disease (study number EFC12722 / AGLU07510).

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Description

This study is a non-randomised, open-label, multicentre, multinational study of patients ≤12 months of age at study entry who had been diagnosed with infantile-onset Pompe disease.

All patients received IV infusion of 20 mg/kg of body weight qow of alglucosidase alfa produced at the 160 L scale (US patients) or at the 4000 L scale (non-US patients).

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The primary objective was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of alglucosidase alfa produced at the 4000 L scale to the 160 L scale product in terms of the change from baseline of the left ventricular mass index Z-score (LVMI-Z) after 52 weeks of treatment.

## Secondary objectives were to:

- -compare alglucosidase alfa produced at the 4000 L scale to the 160 L scale relating to the estimated probabilities of survival to Week 52;
- -compare alglucosidase alfa produced at the 4000 L scale to the 160 L scale relating to the estimated probabilities of invasive ventilator-free survival to Week 52;
- -compare the survival and invasive ventilator-free survival of the 160 L and 4000 L treatment arms to an untreated historical cohort at 12 months of age;
- -assess motor development in treated patients;
- -compare the safety profile of alglucosidase alfa produced at the 160 L and 4000 L scales.

## The tertiary objectives were to:

- -assess physical growth in treated patients;
- -determine the PK profile of alglucosidase alfa produced at the 160 L and 4000 L scales;
- -assess the effect of treatment on the change in urinary oligosaccharide (HEX4) levels.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Study design

The study was a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter, multinational study of patients less than or equal to 12 months of age at study entry who had been diagnosed with infantile-onset Pompe disease.

Patients  received  an  intravenous  (IV)  infusion  of  recombinant  human  acid  α  glucosidase  (rhGAA, alglucosidase alfa, manufactured at the 160 L or 4000 L scale dependent on region) at a dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight every 2 weeks

## Study population /Sample size

## Study population

In  this  study,  patients  had  documented  GAA  enzyme  deficiency  with  subsequent  genotyping  for diagnosis confirmation, were naïve to alglucosidase alfa treatment, were cross-reactive immunologic material positive, did not have decompensated heart failure or a major congenital abnormality, and were invasive ventilator-free at enrolment.

## Sample size

Per  the  protocol,  it  was  planned  to  enrol  24  patients  into  the  study  with  the  aim  of  obtaining  an analysis population of 20 evaluable patients. However, only 4 patients were enrolled and treated by the time of the FDA approval on 1 August 2014.

Five patients were screened. One (1) patient, who required invasive ventilator support at screening, was a screen failure. Overall, 4 patients were enrolled and treated.

## Treatments

In the study, patients received alglucosidase alfa produced at the 160 L scale (US patients) or at the 4000 L scale (non-US patients).

The total amount of alglucosidase alfa administered was adjusted to account for changes in body weight. All patients received IV infusion of 20 mg/kg of body weight qow.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Efficacy:

The primary efficacy endpoint was change in LVMI-Z from baseline to Week 52.

## Secondary endpoints were:

- -estimated probability of survival to Week 52;
- -estimated probability of invasive ventilator-free survival to Week 52;
- -change in motor development status from baseline to Week 52 as assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure - 88 Scale (GMFM-88) total percent scores.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Tertiary endpoints were:

- -change in body length, weight, and head circumference from baseline to Week 52;
- -PK parameters (maximal concentration [Cmax], time to maximal concentration [Tmax], area under the curve from first to last timepoints [AUC0-t], clearance (CL), peripheral volume of distribution [Vz], volume of distribution at steady state [Vss]), and half-life [t1/2]) at baseline (Day 1), Week 12, and Week 52;
- -change in urinary HEX4 levels from baseline to Week 52.

## Safety:

Safety was evaluated in terms of continuous monitoring of AEs (all treatment-emergent AEs and events by relationship, seriousness, and severity), IARs, events occurring on the day of infusion and up to 48 hours (2 days) after infusion, and discontinuations due to AEs. Scheduled clinical and laboratory safety assessments include: clinical hematology, chemistry (including brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]), and urinalysis; anti-rhGAA immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody and inhibitory antibody formation in patients testing positive for IgG; vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature); physical examinations; and electrocardiograms (ECGs).

Additional individual safety assessments conducted when clinically indicated and approved by the Global Safety Officer include (1) circulating immune complex detection; and (2) IgE, serum tryptase, and complement activation, following moderate, severe, or recurrent IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions (IgE-mediated).

## Statistical Methods

The number of patients included in this study did not provide sufficient power to conduct the statistical analysis as outlined in the protocol.

The Full Analysis Set consisted of all patients who received at least 1 infusion of alglucosidase alfa. Four  (4)  patients  were  in  this  data  set.  This  study  population  was  used  for  all  analyses,  including demographics, safety, and efficacy.

## Results

## · Recruitment/ Number analysed

The study started on 21 August 2012 (first patient enrolled) and ended on 01 December 2014 (last patient completed). In total, 4 patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease were enrolled and analysed. One (1) fifth patient, who required invasive ventilator support at screening, was a screen failure. All the 4 other patients were  screened  and  treated  with alglucosidase alfa: 1 patient received alglucosidase  alfa  manufactured  at  the  4000  L  scale  and  3  patients  received  alglucosidase  alfa manufactured at the 160 L scale.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Prior to termination of the study, 2 patients in the 160 L group completed the study. The 1 patient in the  4000  L  group  discontinued  due  to  termination  of  the  study,  and  1  patient  in  the  160  L  group discontinued due to physician's decision.

## · Baseline data

The mean age of the patients at enrolment was 0.5 years. The mean body mass index at enrolment was 14.8 kg/m2 (range 11.2 to 16.9 kg/m2). The race/ethnicity was different among the 4 patients enrolled (black, white, multiple).

None of the patients enrolled were ventilator dependent at baseline.

All prior and concomitant medications and therapeutic procedures in this paediatric population were consistent with the patients' underlying Pompe disease and intercurrent illnesses.

## · Efficacy results

Efficacy was evaluated for the FAS, which included all 4 study patients

## Primary efficacy variable: Change from baseline LVM-Z

Due to the presence of cardiomegaly in all 4 patients, most of the patients had a high z-score at baseline. All but 1 patient showed improvement during the course of the study.

## Secondary efficacy variables:

Ventilator-free survival: Three of the four patients did not use a ventilator during their time on the study (patient began non-invasive ventilator use at Week 10, which was continuing at study discontinuation).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Motor development status and performance change: Only 1 patient declined in motor function during the trial; all other subjects improved in GMFM-88 total percent score and improved or remained the same for Dimension scores.

## Agency on efficacy:

In order to support expansion of the indication of Lumizyme (alglucosidase alfa) in the US to include infantile-onset Pompe disease patients, Genzyme designed and implemented this study to assess the comparability of alglucosidase alfa produced at the 160 L and 4000 L scales in treatment naïve patients with classical infantile-onset Pompe disease

The expected duration of treatment with alglucosidase alfa (manufactured at either the 160 L or 4000 L scale) was 52 weeks (364 days) and it was planned to enrol 24 patients into the study with the aim of obtaining an analysis population of 20 evaluable patients.

However, with the approval for the supplement indication in the US on 1 August 2014, the MAH considered that the justification for continuing the study no longer existed and terminated the study early.

During this period, only 4 patients were included and only two (both treated with 160 L scales) reached the 52 weeks duration of treatment.

The very low number of patients included in this study did not provide sufficient power to conduct the statistical analysis and no conclusion can be drawn regarding the comparability of alglucosidase alfa produced at the 160 L and 4000 L scales.

## · Safety results

## Extent of exposure

The 4 patients who received alglucosidase alfa in AGLU07510 study comprise the safety population for this report.

Patient was on alglucosidase alfa manufactured at the 160 L scale for 31 weeks and received a total of 26 doses. Patient was on alglucosidase alfa manufactured at the 160 L scale for 52 weeks and received a total of 31 doses. Patient was on alglucosidase alfa manufactured at the 4000 L scale for 30 weeks and received a total of 16 doses. Patient was on alglucosidase alfa manufactured at the 160 L scale for 52 weeks and received a total of 27 doses.

Two (2) patients in 160 L group had dose adjustments during the study. Due to an ongoing SAE of respiratory failure, patient received 20 mg/kg/week instead of qow starting Week 13 and until study discontinuation.  As  a  result  of  recurrent  IARs,  patient  received  10  mg/kg/week  instead  of  20 mg/kg/qow  between  Week  11  and  Week  25,  as  well  as  premedication  of  corticosteroids  and  H2 receptor antagonists; study drug dose of 20 mg/kg/qow was resumed at Week 26.

## Adverse events

A total of 68 treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported in 4 patients (overall safety population). All 4 patients reported at least 1 TEAE.

The  majority  of  AEs  were  non-serious  (55/68  AEs),  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  (65/68  AEs)  and assessed as unrelated to the study drug (57/68 AEs). A majority of treatment-related AEs (10/11 AEs) were IARs and were reported in 2 patients.

Three  AEs  (3/68  AEs)  were  assessed  as  severe  in  2  patients  (experienced  respiratory  failure  and experienced cardiac failure and pulmonary oedema). These 3 TEAEs were also SAEs.

The treatment-emergent adverse events, without regard to causality are summarised in Table 14.3.

The most frequently reported TEAE, regardless of relationship to alglucosidase alfa, was pyrexia (13 events). The next most common TEAEs, regardless of relationship to alglucosidase alfa, were vomiting

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(4 events), cardiac failure (3 events), and urticaria (3 events). Patient (160 L group) experienced the most TEAEs (n=25).

There were 11 events that were considered related or possibly related to alglucosidase alfa, of which the most common were pyrexia (4 events) and urticaria (3 events). The remaining 4 events that were considered  related  or  possibly  related  to  alglucosidase  alfa  were  oxygen  desaturation,  hypotension, infusion site erythema, and nystagmus.

## Death and study discontinuations for safety reasons

Two patients completed AGLU07510 study.

There were no AEs leading to discontinuation from the study.

There were 11 TEAEs that led to a change in the study drug dose. The most common events that led to an  interruption  in  the  study  drug  were  pyrexia  (3  events)  and  urticaria  (3  events).  Two  additional events (adenovirus infection and pulmonary oedema) also led to a study drug interruption. There were 3 events (all experienced by Patient in 160 L group) that led to an increase in the study drug dose: respiratory failure, muscle contracture, and hypotonia.

There were no deaths during the study.

## Other serious adverse events

A total of 13 treatment-emergent SAEs (13/68 AEs) were experienced by 3 patients, all in the 160 L groups (3/4 of the overall safety population) during the study.

All SAEs experienced during treatment with alglucosidase alfa are summarized by patient in the Tables below.

The majority of SAEs were unrelated to study drug.

Of the 13 events, 3 were considered related or possibly related to the study drug (these 3 were IARs). Patient experienced an SAE of pyrexia that was mild in severity and was considered possibly related to the study drug. The study drug was interrupted and the event resolved. Patient experienced 2 SAEs of urticaria. Both events were considered moderate in severity and related to the study drug. The study drug was interrupted due to both events, and both events resolved.

## Other significant adverse events

## Infusion associated reactions

An IAR was defined by Genzyme as AEs that occur during the infusion or within up to 24 hours after the start of infusion and are considered as related or possibly related to the ERT by the Investigator or the Sponsor. An event occurring ≥ 24 hours after the start of an infusion may be judged an IAR if a delayed reaction is considered possible by the Investigator or Sponsor.

Ten (10) IARs (at any severity grade) were reported in 2 patients (160 L group).

Patient experienced 4 events of pyrexia, all of which were mild in severity and eventually resolved. One (1) of these pyrexia events was an SAE. The other IARs this patient experienced were non-serious and included decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, and urticaria. Patient experienced 2 events of urticaria,  both  of  which  were  SAEs,  moderate  in  severity,  and  eventually  resolved.  The  other  IAR experienced  by  this  subject  was  infusion  site  erythema  (non-serious),  which  started  after  infusion completion  and  lasted  for  55  minutes.  All  other  IARs  experienced  by  Patient  and  occurred  during infusion. No IARs were assessed as severe in severity, and all events eventually resolved.

## Immunogenicity

Patient (4000 L group) did not test positive for IgG antibodies (seronegative) during the study. The remaining 3 patients (160 L group) did test positive for IgG antibodies (seropositive), however, there were  no  cases  of  enzyme  activity  inhibition,  and  only  Patient  tested  positive  for  enzyme  uptake inhibition at a single timepoint.

Patient (160 L group) seroconverted at Week 4 with an IgG titer of 1600. The maximum IgG titer for this patient during the study was 102400 from Week 26 to Week 31. Neutralizing antibody titer for this patient during the study was found to be positive once (titer of 20 at Week 26). Patient (160 L group) seroconverted at Week 4 with an IgG titer of 3200. The maximum IgG titer for this patient during the study  was  25600  at  Week  8.  This  patient  did  not  test  positive  for  neutralizing  antibody  during  the study. Patient (160 L group) seroconverted at Week 4 with an IgG titer of 200. The maximum IgG titer for this patient during the study was 1600 from Week 8 to Week 18. This patient did not test positive for neutralizing antibody during the study.

For 2 patients (in 160 L group), IgE testing was performed and results for both patients were negative. Complement testing was performed for 2 patients; of these 2 patients tested, 1 tested positive for complement  activation.  Patients  and  were  also  tested  for  serum  tryptase  (4.7  and  3.1 μ g/L, respectively); results were within the normal range (normal range: ≤ 12.5 μ g/L).

## Laboratory parameters

## Individual patient changes in laboratory values

No worsening was observed from baseline to Week 52/early termination visit in results classified by the central lab to be at the panic level or requiring notification of the site or patient by telephone call.

## Individual clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory values

Elevated  levels  of  creatine  kinase,  creatine  kinase  muscle-brain  isoform,  aspartate  transaminase (AST),  and  alanine  transaminase  (ALT)  have  been  observed  in  untreated  infantile-onset  Pompe patients (van den Hout, 2003, Pediatrics), are consistent with the underlying muscle disease, and are not  related  to  liver  pathology.  Study  patients  typically  exhibited  abnormal  values  for  selected laboratory assessments ALT, AST, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase.

No chemistry or hematology laboratory results classified by the central lab to be at the panic level or requiring notification of the site or patient by telephone call were reported as an AE (either serious or non-serious).

## Vital signs and physical examination

Adverse events associated with abnormal vital signs and physical exam findings were discussed in the TEAE section.

Agency on safety:

One of the objectives of this study was to compare the safety profile of alglucosidase alfa produced at the 160 L and 4000 L scales.

The safety population of study AGLU07510 included 4 patients: 1 patient received alglucosidase alfa manufactured at the 4000 L scale and 3 patients received alglucosidase alfa manufactured at the 160 L scale. We agree that this number of patients did not provide sufficient power to conduct the statistical analysis.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two patients (2/4) completed the study. There were no deaths during the study.

All patients experienced AEs. A total of 68 AEs were reported in both groups during the 52-week study: 5/68 of total AEs in the alglucosidase alfa 4000L treatment group, and 63/68 in the alglucosidase 160L treatment group. No relevant comparison of these proportions could be performed due to the study size.  The  majority  of  AEs  were  non-serious  (55/68  AEs),  assessed  as  mild  to  moderate  in  severity (65/68 AEs), and unrelated to the treatment (57/68 AEs). Three patients, all in the alglucosidase alfa 160 L group, experienced 11 AEs that were assessed by the investigator as related to alglucosidase alfa.  Regardless  of  causality,  AEs  belonged  to  the  main  following  SOCs:  General  disorders  and administration  site  conditions  (15/68  AEs),  Infections  and  infestations  (12/68  AEs),  and  Respiratory disorders  (12/68  AEs).  Ten  treatment-related  AEs  (10/11  AEs)  were  characterized  as  IARs.  The majority of IARs (all occurred in the 3 patients of 160 L group) were non-serious, mild in severity and resolved with symptomatic treatment; all patients with IARs recovered without sequelae.

No  anaphylactic/allergic  reactions  were  reported.  Of  4  assessable  patients,  the  3  patients  in  the alglucosidase alfa 160 L group did test positive for IgG antibodies (seropositive), however, there were no cases of enzyme activity inhibition, and only one patient (160 L group) tested positive for enzyme uptake inhibition at a single timepoint. The peak IgG titers in these patients was equal to or below 102400 and 1 patient  tested  inhibitory  antibody  positive.  IgE  testing  was  performed  in  2  patients, which was negative. Complement activation was positive in 1 of these patients and serum tryptase testing was normal in both patients.

During  AGLU07510  study,  treatment-related  AEs  (mainly  IARs)  were  reported  in  2  patients  in  the alglucosidase  alfa  160  L  group.  Due  to  the  small  size  of  this  study,  no  relevant  comparative assessment  of  AEs  frequency  could  be  drawn  between  patients  treated  with  alglucosidase  alfa produced at the 160 L and 4000 L scales. Nevertheless, based on the data provided by the MAH, the final  results  of  study  AGLU07510  do  not  raise  any  new  safety  concerns  as  compared  to  previous studies  and  experiences  in  infantile-onset  patients  treated  with  alglucosidase  alfa  at  a  dose  of  20 mg/kg qow.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Due to termination of the study and to the low number of patients included (4 patients instead of 24) this study did not provide sufficient power to conduct the statistical analysis, thus no conclusion can be drawn regarding the comparability of alglucosidase alfa produced at the 160 L and 4000 L scales.

During  AGLU07510  study,  treatment-related  AEs  (mainly  IARs)  were  reported  in  2  patients  in  the alglucosidase  alfa  160  L  group.  Due  to  the  small  size  of  this  study,  no  relevant  comparative assessment  of  AEs  frequency  could  be  drawn  between  patients  treated  with  alglucosidase  alfa produced at the 160 L and 4000 L scales. Nevertheless, based on the data provided by the MAH, the final  results  of  study  AGLU07510  do  not  raise  any  new  safety  concerns  as  compared  to  previous studies  and  experiences  in  infantile-onset  patients  treated  with  alglucosidase  alfa  at  a  dose  of  20 mg/kg qow.
