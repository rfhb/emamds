## 1. Introduction

Perampanel is a highly selective non-competitive AMPA-type glutamate receptor antagonist. In the EU, Fycompa  (perampanel),  following  the  recent  extension  of  indication  in  the  paediatric  population (EMEA/H/C/002434/II/0047), is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of:

-partial-onset seizures (POS) with or without secondarily generalised seizures in patients from 4 years of age and older.

-primary generalised tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in patients from 7 years of age and older with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE).

Perampanel has also been approved as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients with POS aged 4 years and older in the US as of September 2018. The International Birth Date is 23 July 2012  in  the  EU  (via  the  centralized  procedure).  Perampanel  is  marketed  under  the  trade  name Fycompa and is available as 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-mg tablets and 0.5 mg/ml oral suspension.

With this post-authorisation measure (PAM) EISAI is hereby submitting final study results and report related  to  paediatric  population  in  line  with  Article  46  of  paediatric  regulation  1901/2006  for  Study E2007-M065-411 (Study 411). Study 411 was a Phase 4, observational, open-label, post marketing, non-interventional  drug  monitoring  study,  to  collect  data  on  the  use  of  Fycompa  in  actual  clinical settings. The study was conducted in the hospitals of participating physicians/investigators in Taiwan. Male and female subjects (aged 12 years and older) who were diagnosed to have POS with or without SGS and who were appropriate to receive Fycompa according to the investigator, were eligible to enroll in  this  study.  The  purpose  of  Study  411  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  Fycompa  as  an adjunctive treatment of POS with or without SGS in subjects with epilepsy aged 12 years and older.

On 27 October 2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Fycompa (perampanel), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. This study E2007-M065-411 (Study 411) which was completed on 03 July 2017, was implemented as a Taiwan post-marketing, observational study following comments from the review of the marketing authorisation application by the  Taiwan  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (TFDA).  The  TFDA  requested  a  post-marketing,  safety monitoring study instead of a bridging study.

The submission of the final clinical study report for Study 411 is being made to the European Medicines Agency to fulfil the obligation to present data from any MAH-sponsored study in a pediatric population.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for Study E2007-M065-411 (hereafter referred to as Study 411), a Phase  4,  observational,  open-label,  post  marketing,  non-interventional  drug  monitoring  study  to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Fycompa as an adjunctive treatment of POS with or without SGS in subjects with epilepsy aged 12 years and older

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Description

The  study  was  conducted  in  the  hospitals  of  the  participating  physician/investigators  in  Taiwan  to collect data on the use of Fycompa in actual clinical settings.

## Methods

## Objectives

The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Fycompa in patients with the adjunctive  treatment  of  partial-onset  seizures  with  or  without  secondarily  generalized  seizures  in patients with epilepsy aged 12 years and older.

## Study design

Study 411 has been designed to evaluate the safety profile of Fycompa prescribed as add-on therapy in patients with epilepsy in Taiwan. The anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) were prescribed by the physician according to current and best medical practice. The study protocol did not prescribe or advise any drug or treatment for the study patients and they were given treatment according to investigators' routine practice. There was no control group in the study. Figure 1 below represents the study design:

- a: Required only for patients who discontinue prior to Week 52 (in whom Early Termination visit has been performed). CGIC: Clinical Global Impression of Change

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CHMP comment:

On Visit 0, there was the screening/baseline visit, conducted in Week-0 of the study, and the eligibility criteria were carried out, in particular the seizure count(s) in the past 4 weeks.

On treatment phase, the patients received Fycompa in addition to their current AED; the treatment with Fycompa was initiated with a dose of 2 mg/day once daily before bedtime. During treatment, the maintenance dose ranged between 4 and 12 mg daily.

The following assessments / procedures were carried out during the 50 weeks treatment period:

- Recording seizure count(s) and seizure type(s) experienced by patient.
- Collecting and recording concomitant drug treatment details of patient in the eCRF.
- Examining and recording number and details of AE(s) experienced by patient.

The Follow-Up visit was only performed for patients who discontinued prior to Week-52 and it had been conducted after 2  weeks of  ET  (Early  Termination)  visit.  The  same  assessments  and  procedures  as mentioned above were carried out during the 50 weeks treatment period.

## Study population /Sample size

The study planned to enrol 100 patients (60 evaluable). Subjects were eligible for participation in the study if they were aged 12 years and older with a diagnosis of partial-onset seizures with or without secondarily generalized seizures.

## CHMP comment:

The  patients  were  selected  to  receive  Fycompa  as  an  adjunctive  treatment  starting  at  Visit  0  and according to investigator's judgment.

## Treatments

Fycompa was taken as a single oral dose taken once daily before bedtime. Treatment was initiated with a dose of 2 mg/day as approved in the PIL.

## CHMP comment:

The dose was increased based on clinical response and tolerability by increments of 2 mg/day to a maintenance dose of 4 mg/day to 12 mg/day.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## · Safety:

All Adverse Events (AEs) including Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).

Adverse  Events  of  Special  Interest  (AESI)  such  as  Medication  Errors,  Lack  of  Therapeutic  Efficacy, Overdose, Abuse, Misuse, Off Label Use, Pregnancy and exposure to drug during breast feeding.

- Efficacy :

Change from Baseline in 28-day seizure count at the End of treatment.

Response rate at Week 12, Week 24 and Week 52. Response was defined as &gt;=50% reduction in 28day seizure frequency from Baseline.

## CHMP comment:

Safety is the primary endpoint and efficacy the secondary.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical Methods

- Safety aspects: the number and percentage of patients with AEs/SAE and frequency/incidence of each type of AE/SAE were calculated.
- Efficacy aspects: the mean change from baseline in 28-day seizure frequency at the end of the treatment and the 50% response rate after 12, 24 and 52 weeks of treatment were calculated.

## CHMP comment:

As  this  is  an  open-label,  post  marketing,  non-interventional  drug  monitoring  study,  there  are  no statistical methods per se . The results are only observational.

## CHMP comment:

This study was conducted between 11 Apr 2016 and 03 Jul 2017 at 3 study sites in Taiwan.

117 subjects were enrolled into the study. Of these, 79 subjects completed the study (= 67.5% of all patients) and 38 discontinued (= 32.5% of all patients).

The main reasons for discontinuation are: death (n=2; 1.7%), lack of efficacy (n= 5; 4.3%), lost to FUp (n= 3; 2.6%), withdrawn consent (n= 11; 9.4%) and AE (n= 16; 13.7%).

| Female           | 48(41.0)                 |

## CHMP comment:

The  mean  age  of  patients  is  32.8  years.  The  median  (minimum,  maximum)  age  of  the  enrolled subjects was 31.0 (13.0, 65.0) years. There were 69 (59.0%) male subjects and 48 (41.0%) female subjects in the study.

Around  20  %  of  subjects  were  taking  1  concomitant  AED,  nearly  1/3  of  subjects  were  taking  2 concomitant AED, and almost 1/3 of subjects were taking 3 concomitant AED.

Among the 117 subjects, only 13 (11.1%) subjects were 12 to 17 years of age, 99 (84.6%) subjects were 18 to 60 years of age and 5 (4.3%) subjects were above 60 years of age. The low amount of paediatrics in this study do not provide enough further safety data in this specific population.

The paediatrics (12 to 17 years of age) are underrepresented, which undermines the validity of the study in this age cohort. No firm conclusion concerning this age group is therefore possible.

## Efficacy results

During  this  study,  efficacy  assessments  were  evaluated  as  secondary  endpoints  and  included percentage  change  in  28-day  seizure  frequency  from  baseline  and  50%  responder  rate  (50%  or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to baseline).

## CHMP comment:

Regarding the percentage change in 28-day seizure frequency from baseline, the mean ± SD seizure count at baseline was 9.39±26.65 seizures, with a mean ± SD change from baseline at Week 52 of 1.78±15.93 seizures (P=0.2342). This is not a significant result however no firm conclusion can be drawn from these efficacy data and do not challenge the known efficacy results for perampanel in the studied population, mainly in adults.

## CHMP comment:

Regarding the 50% responder rate (defined as 50% or greater reduction in 28-day seizure frequency from baseline), it  concerned  10.30% (17/165) subjects at Weeks 12, 10.07% (15/149) subjects at Weeks 24, and 31.06% (41/132) subjects at Weeks 52. This endpoint is that recommended in EU by the guidelines. The study design do not lead to put in question the known efficacy results.

A total of 232 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 78 (66.67%) subjects with 47 (40.17%) subjects reporting AEs in the nervous system disorder SOC.

There were 38 serious adverse events (SAE) reported in the study by 18 (15.4%) subjects of which a total of 8 SAEs were reported by 2 subjects between the ages of 12 and 17 years . The majority of  subjects  (15  out  of  18  i.e.  12.8%)  with  serious  TEAE  required  hospitalization  or  prolongation  of existing hospitalization.

A total  of  12  SAEs  were  reported  in  the  SOC  of  nervous  system  disorders by  a  total  of  9  (7.69%) subjects and 5 SAEs were reported in the SOC psychiatric disorders by a total of 2 (1.71%) subjects.

The  other  SAEs  were  of  renal  and  urinary  disorders,  neoplasms  benign,  malignant  and  unspecified (including cysts and polyps) ie, 3 events each.

Of the SAEs, 9 events were considered possibly related to the study drug and the remaining SAEs were all considered not related to the study drug.

For 36 subjects (30.8%), the occurrence of TEAE led to study drug dose adjustment in 15 subjects (33.3%) of the 4mg group and in 16 subjects (29.1%) of the 8mg group. For 23 subjects the TEAE led to study drug dose reduction and for 16 subjects the TEAE led to study or study drug withdrawal.

There were two deaths in the 4mg group reported in the present study (see below for more details).

## CHMP comment:

The most frequent SOC is related to nervous system disorders and psychiatric disorders in accordance with the known safety profile of perampanel.

From  these  data,  no  further  safety  conclusion  could  be  drawn  regarding  the  paediatrics  for  the following  reasons:  they  represent  only  11%  of  the  overall  included  patients  and  the  MAH  did  not provide separate data for patients aged 12 to 17 years, as the data are mixed for the overall included patients. This issue is a flaw of this study not pursued.

As detailed recently in the PSUSA for perampanel, available post marketing data since the marketing authorization in July 2012 did not show additional risks associated with long-term use of perampanel. Nevertheless,  post-marketing  studies  are  ongoing  and  long  term  safety  in  adolescents  and  adults should remain a missing information in the PSUR.

## TEAE by SOC and PT for all enrolled subjects

Among  the  232  events  in  78  subjects,  the  most  frequent  AE  occurring  in  more  than  10%  of  the subjects implied MedDRA SOC Nervous System Disorders.

Indeed, seventy-four (74) subjects showed AE within this SOC: 31 events of dizziness and 15 events of headache which were common AEs in this SOC.

The  other  common  AEs  were  psychiatric  disorders  (40  events)  mostly  irritability  with  16  events, infections and infestations (31 events) mostly upper respiratory tract infections with 19 events, general disorders (17 events) mostly malaise with 6 events, injury poisoning and procedural complications (14 events) mostly wounds with 5 events.

## CHMP comment:

When  scrutinizing  more  in  detail  with  PT  classification,  the  most  common  AE  from  MedDRA  SOC Nervous System Disorders are those already stated in the SmPC: dizziness, somnolence and ataxia. For  the  MedDRA  SOC  Psychotic  Disorders,  the  most  common  AE  are  irritability,  aggression  and agitation.

The AE headache which is one of the most frequent AE from SOC Nervous System Disorders is not stated in the SmPC nor mentioned in the recent PSUSA AR.

Events reported in patients who had medical history of suicidal behaviours were consistent with the known safety profile of perampanel or could be related to the medical history of the patients.

## Severity of AE and relationship to study drug /outcome

Of  the  232  TEAEs,  there  were  151  mild  AEs,  67  moderate  and  14  severe  AEs  reported  during  the study.

The study drug dosage was decreased due to 30 TEAEs.

The study drug was discontinued due to 26 TEAEs.

Concomitant medication was given for 94 AEs, non-drug treatment was given for 33 AEs and no action was taken for 49 AEs.

The relationship to study drug was reported as probably related for 55 TEAEs and possibly related for 59 TEAEs. There were 118 TEAEs which were not related to the study drug.

Regarding  the  outcome,  a  total  of  178  AEs  were  recovered/resolved  without  sequelae,  2  were recovered/resolved with sequelae and 27 AEs were reported as not recovered.

## CHMP comment:

The most frequently reported TEAEs that led to discontinuation were irritability (6 [5.1%] subjects with 6 events) and dizziness (3 [2.6%] subjects with 3 events) which are AE from the SOC Nervous System Disorders.  In  the  SmPC,  it  is  stated:  'The  adverse  reactions  most  commonly  ( ≥ 1%  in  the  total perampanel group and greater than placebo) leading to discontinuation were dizziness and somnolence'. Therefore, this is overall in line with what was observed in controlled phase 3 studies assessing the efficacy and safety of perampanel when given for the treatment of POS in adjunction to other AED. Regarding the AE irritability, it is tabulated in section 4.8 as common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10) and the frequency in study 411 is slightly higher with 13.68%. This is in the same range however no formal comparison is possible.

## CHMP comment:

There was one drowning considered possibly related to the study drug and one heart failure due to multiple liver malignant tumors considered not related to the study drug.

No death was reported for subjects aged between 12 and 17 years.

## Other safety findings

The study was an observational study and vital signs were not recorded during the study.There was no other observationapartfromAEs andSAEs monitored in the study.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Fycompa(perampanel) in patients with adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures,with or without secondary generalized seizures.

Fycompa was taken as a single oral dose once daily. The drug was taken at doses of 4 mg/day to 12 mg/day to be effective therapy in partial-onset seizures. The drug was initiated with a dose of 2 mg/day as per the approved package insert.The dose was increased based on clinical response and tolerability by increments of 2 mg/day to a maintenance dose of 4 mg/day to 12 mg/day.

The primary endpoint for this observational study is safety assessment.

Regarding the safety, the AEs described in Study 411 are overall consistent with the known safety profile for Fycompa described in the SmPC. The safety results of the study reported that 17 (14.52%) subjects experienced at least one SAEs.Most common AEs and SAEs were reported in the nervous

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

system disorders, including dizziness, headache and ataxia among others. In some cases, the dose decrease was an option to continue the treatment. In other cases, the subjects discontinued the study or study treatment. No deaths were reported for subjects aged between 12 and 17 years.

There  were  no  significant  changes  in  the  frequency  and  severity  of  previously  identified  adverse reactions apart from the AE headache.

On the basis of the review of the AEs and TEAEs in this study, no additional changes to the safety information  of  the  SmPC  are  requested  by  the  Applicant  which  is  acceptable.  However  the  AE 'headache' may be possibly added to the SmPC in the future (15 events in 13 patients, frequency of 11.11% which could be categorized as very common). Of note, this AE is not yet discussed in  the recent PSUSA and needs to be kept in mind and further explored.

Regarding efficacy,  which  is  the  secondary  endpoint  in this  study,  there is  a  non-significant  change from baseline in seizure count at week 52 [-1.78 (15.93), p = 0.2342]. This is not a significant result however no firm conclusion can be drawn from these efficacy data and do not challenge the known efficacy results for perampanel in the studied population, mainly in adults. Response rate was not high possibly explained by the studied population.

## 3. Rapporteur's CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

The MAH submitted the results of study 411 in order to fulfil the requirement of reporting paediatric data as outlined in accordance with Article 46 of regulation (EC) no 1901/2006, as amended. Only a small number of paediatric patients were included in this study (i.e. 11% of the patients).

The MAH determines that the benefit-risk ratio for Fycompa remains unchanged and positive despite the non-significant efficacy result at 52 weeks, which is hardly disputable regarding the study design (open-labelled, uncontrolled). Indeed the results of this study could only be considered as supportive of  the  known  safety  profile  and  efficacy  results  of  perampanel  in  adults  and  adolescents  above  12 years of age and do not allow to draw any further robust conclusion.

The MAH does not propose any changes of the currently approved SmPC based on the present data, which is supported. However, the AE 'headache' needs to be kept in mind and further explored for its potential addition in the SmPC.

## Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required.
