## I. INTRODUCTION

This AR concerns 4 studies (+ 1 study Annex) which were submitted by the MAH to comply with Article 45 of the regulation 1901/2006.

Apart from the 4 study reports and accompanying study Annex, there were investigator approvals and very brief expert statements provided. Neither clinical overview, nor clinical summaries were present in the dossier.

The MAH's experts stated that the submitted paediatric studies do not influence the benefit risk for Rotarix and that subsequently there are neither consequential regulatory actions nor changes to the product information necessary.

## II. STUDY SUMMARIES

## Study 103478

##  General

A phase IIIb, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre study to assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of 2 doses of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals. oral live attenuated  human  rotavirus  (HRV)  vaccine  in  healthy  infants  (6-12  weeks  of  age  at  first  dose) previously uninfected with human rotavirus.

## · Objective(s)

## Primary:

- To show a difference of at least 20% in seroconversion rate at Visit 3 (two months post-dose 2) between HRV and placebo groups.

Criteria:  the  primary  objective  was  reached  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  asymptotic standardized 95% CI for treatment difference (HRV minus placebo) was ≥ 20%.

## Secondary:

- To assess the reactogenicity and safety of each dose of the HRV vaccine versus placebo.
- To  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  the  HRV  vaccine  in  terms  of  serum  anti-RV  IgA  antibody concentrations at Visit 3 (at two months post-dose 2).
- To assess the presence of rotavirus (RV) in gastroenteritis (GE) stools collected until Visit 3.

## · Study design

The study was designed as a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, self-contained study with two parallel groups that received the following vaccines:

- Two oral doses of HRV (HRV vaccine group)
- Two oral doses of Placebo (Placebo group)

All subjects received routine childhood vaccinations according to local immunization recommendation (2,  4,  6  months  schedule).  All  routine  vaccinations  were  to  be  given  at  least  14  days  prior  to administration of HRV vaccine or placebo dose and Hib vaccine was to be administered at the time of HRV or placebo dose. Blood samples were drawn from all subjects prior to the first vaccine dose (Visit 1) and two months after the second vaccine dose (Visit 3).

The study duration was approximately 4 months for each subject.

## · Study population /Sample size

## Inclusion criteria:

Healthy infants aged between 6 and 12 weeks (42-90 days) of age at the time of the first vaccination whom  were  free  of  obvious  health  problems  and  for  whom  the  vaccination  history  was  available. Written informed consent was obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject.

## · Endpoints

## Primary endpoint

- Percentage of subjects who seroconverted at Visit 3 (percentage of subjects with concentration ≥ 20 U/ ml in subjects who were seronegative before vaccination).

## Secondary endpoints

- Occurrence of any grade 2 or grade 3 fever, vomiting or diarrhoea within the 15-day (Day 0 - Day 14) solicited follow-up period after each study vaccine dose.
- For each type of solicited symptoms, occurrence of the symptom within the 15-day (Day 0 - Day 14) solicited follow-up period after each study vaccine dose.
- Occurrence of unsolicited adverse events within 43 days (Day 0- Day 42) after each study vaccine dose according to MedDRA classification.
- Occurrence of serious adverse events throughout the study period.
- Serum anti-RV IgA antibody concentration expressed as Geometric Mean concentration (GMC) at Visit 3.
- Presence of RV in GE stools collected from Dose 1 of HRV vaccine/ placebo up to Visit 3.
- Statistical Methods

## Analysis of Demography

Demographic characteristics on age at Dose 1 and Dose 2 of HRV vaccine/ placebo, height and weight at Visit 1, gender and race distribution were tabulated by group.

## Analysis of Immunogenicity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Immunogenicity analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity (primary analysis) and on the total vaccinated cohort. At each time point that serum anti-rotavirus IgA antibody response was measured,  seropositivity/  seroconversion  rates  and  their  exact  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  were calculated for each group. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and their 95% CI were calculated for each group. GMCs and their 95% CI were also calculated on the subjects who were seropositive for anti-rotavirus IgA antibody.

The  two-sided  asymptotic  standardized  95%  CI  for  difference  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  who seroconverted for anti-rotavirus IgA at Visit 3 between HRV and placebo groups was computed. The primary objective was reached if the lower limit of the two-sided asymptotic standardized 95% CI for treatment  difference  (HRV  minus  placebo)  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  who  seroconverted  for antirotavirus IgA antibody at Visit 3 was above the pre-defined clinical limit of 20%.

## Analysis of Reactogenicity and Safety

The safety analysis was performed on the total vaccinated cohort (primary analysis) and on the ATP cohort. The percentage of doses and of subjects with any symptom (solicited or unsolicited) reported during  the  15-day  (Day  0  to  Day  14)  follow-up  period  and  with  each  solicited  symptoms  reported during the 15-day solicited follow-up period was tabulated by group with their exact 95% CIs. The percentage of doses and of subjects with unsolicited AEs classified by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system reported during the 43-day (Day 0 to Day 42) follow-up period after any HRV vaccine or placebo dose were tabulated by group with their exact 95% CIs.

The same calculations were done for symptoms rated as grade \"3\" in intensity and for those assessed as causally related to vaccination. The percentage of doses and of subjects reporting diarrhoea, fever or vomiting graded 2 or 3 in intensity was calculated by group, with exact 95% CIs, over the solicited follow-up  period  (Day  0  to  Day  14).  SAEs  and  withdrawals  due  to  non-serious  AEs/  SAEs  were described. The percentage of subjects with GE and RV (vaccine strain or wild-type RV) GE from Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or placebo to Visit 3 was tabulated by group with their exact 95% CIs.

##  Results

## Demography

The demographic profile of the two groups at Dose 1 was similar with respect to mean age, height, weight,  gender  and  racial  distribution.  The  mean  age  of  the  subjects  in  the  ATP  cohort  for immunogenicity was 10.3 weeks (range: 7 to12 weeks) at the time of the first vaccination and 19.1 weeks (range: 16 to 21 weeks) at the time of the second vaccination. All subjects were Korean.

## Immunogenicity

## ATP cohort for immunogenicity:

The anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion rate was 66.7% [95% CI: 51.6%; 79.6%] in the HRV vaccine group and 4.2% [95% CI: 0.1%; 21.1%] in the placebo group at two months after Dose 2.

The lower limit of the two sided asymptotic standardized 95% CI for the difference in the percentage of subjects who seroconverted for anti-rotavirus IgA antibody at two months after Dose 2 between the HRV vaccine group and (minus) the placebo group was 42.81% which is above the pre-defined clinical limit of 20%. Thus, from the above data, it was concluded that the primary objective was met.

## TV cohort:

The anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion rate was 65.3% [95% CI: 53.1%, 76.1%] in the HRV vaccine group and 5.4% [95% CI: 0.7%, 18.2%] in the placebo group.

The lower limit of the two sided asymptotic standardised 95% CI for the difference between groups in percentage of subjects who seroconverted for anti-rotavirus IgA antibody at Visit 3 was 44.17%. This result was consistent with the result obtained with the ATP cohort for immunogenicity.

- Safety results

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The incidence of any symptom (solicited or unsolicited) reported during the 15-day (Day 0 to Day 14) follow-up period was similar between the two groups. There was no increase in the incidence of symptoms after Dose 2 compared to Dose 1.
- The incidence of symptoms (solicited or unsolicited) rated as grade 3 in intensity reported during the 15-day (Day 0 to Day 14) follow-up period was similar in the two groups.
- The  incidence  of  symptoms  (solicited  or  unsolicited)  considered  by  the  investigator  as  causally related  to  vaccination  reported  during  the  15-day  (Day  0  to  Day  14)  follow-up  period  was  also similar between the two groups. There was no increase in incidence of causally related symptoms (solicited or unsolicited) with subsequent doses.
- The percentage of subjects reporting diarrhoea, fever or vomiting graded 2 or 3 in intensity during the 15-day follow-up period after vaccination was similar in both the groups.
- The  percentage  of  subjects  with  report  of  at  least  one  unsolicited  symptom  within  the  43-day follow-up period after any vaccination was similar in both the groups: 53.4% [95% CI: 43.3%; 63.3%] in the HRV vaccine group and 59.6% [95% CI: 45.1%; 73.0%] in the placebo group.
- RV was isolated from two reported GE episodes with available stool samples for RV testing from Dose 1 up to Visit 3 (one subject in each group). The wild type of the serotype G1P[8] was isolated from both stool samples. Onset of RV GE episode was reported 30 days and 10 days after Dose 2 for the subjects in the HRV vaccine group and placebo group, respectively. The intensity of RV GE episodes  were  graded  by  the  investigator  as  grade  1  (mild)  for  the  HRV  vaccine  recipient  and grade  2  (moderate)  for  placebo  recipient.  No  vaccine  strain  was  detected  in  any  of  the  stool samples tested.
- SAEs: No fatal SAEs were reported during the study. Non-fatal SAEs were reported in 11 subjects (9 subjects in the HRV vaccine group and 2 subjects in the placebo group). All SAEs except one in the HRV vaccine group (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in n  227) were considered by the investigator not to be causally related to study vaccination. All subjects recovered from the SAEs.
- No intussusception case was reported during the study.
- There was no report of discontinuation from the study due to an AE/ SAE.

##  Conclusions:

- GSK  Biologicals.  HRV  vaccine  was  immunogenic  in  Korean  infants  who  were  a  part  of  the  ATP cohort  for  immunogenicity  as  shown  by  the  anti-rotavirus  IgA  antibody  seroconversion  rate  of 66.7% [95% CI: 51.6%, 79.6%] observed in the HRV vaccine group at two months after Dose 2.
- The  anti-rotavirus  IgA  antibody  seroconversion  rate  observed  in  the  HRV  vaccine  group  at  two months after Dose 2 in the total vaccinated cohort was 65.3% [95% CI: 53.1%; 76.1%].
- The lower limit of the two-sided asymptotic standardized 95% CI for treatment difference (HRV minus placebo) in the percentage of subjects who seroconverted for anti-rotavirus IgA antibody at two months after Dose 2 was above the pre-defined clinical limit of 20% in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity thus, meeting the primary objective of the study. The results obtained in the total vaccinated cohort were consistent with those of the ATP cohort for immunogenicity.
- The reactogenicity profiles of the HRV vaccine group and placebo group were similar.
- There was no evidence of a clinically meaningful difference between the HRV vaccine group and the placebo group for SAEs reported from Dose 1 up to Visit 3 or unsolicited AEs reported within 43 days (Day 0 to Day 42) after vaccination.

Assessor's  comment: Study  103478  sought  to  investigate  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  the Rotarix vaccine in children aged 6 to 12 weeks whom have never suffered a rota-virus infection prior to vaccination.  Review  of  the  study  did  not  raise  any  issues  regarding  neither  the  safety  nor  the immunogenicity in this study group and the MAH's conclusions are corroborated.

## Study 103792

##  General

A phase IIIb, randomised, multicentre double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the immunogenicity and safety of two doses of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals. oral live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine (RIX4414) as primary dosing in healthy infants in India of approximately 8 weeks of age at the first dose.

## · Objective(s)

## Primary:

- To assess the immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals. HRV vaccine in terms of seroconversion rates to rotavirus (RV) after two doses of HRV vaccine versus two doses of placebo.

## Secondary:

- To assess the safety and reactogenicity of each dose of GSK Biologicals' HRV vaccine versus placebo.
- · To assess the immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals. HRV vaccine in terms of serum anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations at Visit 3 (at one month post-Dose 2).
- · To assess the presence of RV in gastroenteritis (GE) stools collected until Visit 3.

## · Study design

This  was  a  phase  IIIb,  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  self-contained  study  with  two groups. The treatment groups were:

- Group HRV received 10 6.5  CCID50 HRV vaccine
- Group Placebo received placebo.

The  administration  of  hepatitis  B,  Bacille  Calmette-Guerin  (BCG)  and  oral  poliovirus  vaccine  (OPV) vaccinations at birth were allowed according to local universal immunisation program (UIP) schedule and were to be documented in the case report form (CRF). Following the UIP recommendation in India, routine diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis-hepatitis B (DTPw-HB), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)  and  OPV  vaccines  was  administered  at  6,  10  and  14  weeks  of  age  (given  with  a  two  week separation  from  the  first  and  subsequent  dose  of  the  study  vaccine/placebo).  Blood  samples  were collected from all subjects for the assessment of immunogenicity of the HRV vaccine at Visit 1 and at Visit 3.

## Inclusion criteria

A  healthy  male  or  female  infant  between  and  including,  8  to  10  weeks  of  age  at  the  time  of  first vaccination and who was administered the first dose of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Hib, oral  poliovirus  vaccine  (DTPw/Hib/OPV)  as  per  the  local  universal  immunisation  program  (UIP)  at  6 weeks of age were enrolled.  Written  informed  consent  was  obtained  from  the  parents/guardians  of each subject.

## · Endpoints

## Primary endpoint

- Percentage of subjects who seroconverted for anti-RV IgA one month after Dose 2 (Visit 3)

## Secondary endpoints

- Serum anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations expressed as Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) at Visit 3
- For  each  type  of  solicited  symptom,  occurrence,  intensity  and  relationship  to  the  vaccination  of symptom during  the  8-day  (Day  0  -  Day  7)  solicited  follow-up  period  after  each  study  vaccine dose.
- Occurrence of unsolicited symptoms during the 31-day follow-up period (Day 0 - Day 30) after each study vaccine dose, according to MedDRA classification.
- Presence of RV in GE stools collected from Dose 1 of HRV vaccine/placebo up to Visit 3.
- Occurrence of SAEs throughout the study period.

## · Statistical Methods

## Analysis of Demography

Demographic characteristics on age at Dose 1 and Dose 2 of HRV vaccine/placebo, height and weight at Visit 1,racial and gender composition were tabulated by group. The increase in height and weight of the subjects from Visit 1 to Visit 3 was tabulated by group. Summary of feeding practices on the day of each study vaccination was  presented by group. The summary  of  concomitant vaccinations administered from Dose 1 of HRV/placebo up to Visit 3 were summarised by group. The percentage of subjects  in  the  below  mentioned  three  concomitant  vaccination  categories  were  calculated  for  each group

- without concomitant vaccinations. category (i.e. subjects with no vaccination administered within 13 days of both doses of HRV/placebo, excluding subjects who might have been administered with OPV (as per the government immunisation programme) within 13 days of HRV/placebo doses)
- with concomitant vaccinations. category (i.e. subjects with at least one vaccination administered within 13 days of at least one dose of HRV/placebo, excluding the unknown OPV administration (as per the government immunisation programme))
- with  unknown  concomitant  vaccinations.  (i.e.  subjects  who  do  not  belong  to  .With  concomitant vaccination. or .Without concomitant vaccination. i.e. subject who might have been administered with OPV (as per the government immunisation programme) within 13 days of at least one dose of HRV/placebo and without vaccination administered within 13 days of both doses of HRV/placebo)

## Analysis of Immunogenicity

Anti-RV  IgA  antibody  seropositivity/seroconversion  rates  and  GMCs  (also  calculated  on  seropositive subjects) with their 95% confidence interval (CI) were tabulated.

As per protocol, a minimum interval of two weeks between the administration of the study vaccine and the administration of concomitant vaccines was to be observed. However, approximately one third of enrolled subjects received routine vaccinations in this forbidden interval and for some subjects OPV administration was unknown. Therefore, the above mentioned analyses were also explored by three concomitant vaccination categories. The distribution of the ratio of post- over pre-vaccination for antirotavirus IgA antibody concentrations in subjects seropositive at prevaccination was explored by group.

## Analysis of Safety

The percentage of doses and of subjects with any symptom (solicited or unsolicited) reported during the 8-day (Day 0 to Day 7) follow-up period and with each solicited general symptom reported during the 8-day solicited follow-up period was tabulated by group with their exact 95% CIs.

The  percentage  of  doses  and  of  subjects  with  unsolicited  AEs  classified  by  Medical  Dictionary  for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system reported during the 31-day (Day 0 to Day 30) follow-up period after any HRV vaccine or placebo dose were tabulated by group with their exact 95% CIs. The same calculations were done for symptoms rated as grade \"3\" in intensity and for those assessed as causally related to vaccination. The percentage of subjects with GE and RV (vaccine strain or wild-type RV) GE from Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or placebo to Visit 3 was tabulated by group with their exact 95% CIs.

SAEs reported during the study period and withdrawals due to AEs or SAEs were described.  Difference between groups was explored using the two-sided Fisher.s exact test for the following endpoints:

- percentage of subjects reporting each individual solicited general symptom within 8-day (Day 0 toDay 7) follow-up period after any dose,
- percentage  of  subjects  reporting  each  individual  solicited  general  symptom  graded  3  intensity within 8-day (Day 0 to Day 7) follow-up period after any dose,
- percentage of subjects reporting each individual solicited general symptom assessed as related to vaccination within 8-day (Day 0 to Day 7) follow-up period after any dose.

p-values less than 0.05 were used as an indicator of a possible difference between groups. However, since p-values were not adjusted for multiplicity of comparisons, statistically significant findings were to be interpreted with caution and also taking into account clinically relevant difference.

##  Results

## Demography

In the ATP cohort for immunogenicity, the demographic profile of the two groups at study entry was similar with respect to mean age, height, weight and BMI. All subjects were Indian.

## Immunogenicity

Analysis  was  performed  on  the  ATP  cohort  for  immunogenicity  (primary  analysis)  and  on  the  Total vaccinated cohort. Included in the ATP cohort were all subjects who received concomitant vaccinations in the forbidden interval but who complied with other study criteria.

## At Visit 3:

- The anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion rates were 58.3% [95% CI: 48.7%; 67.4%] in the HRV  Group.  Similar seroconversion rates were  observed in subjects without concomitant vaccination (55.7% [95% CI: 43.3%; 67.6%]), in subjects with concomitant vaccination (65.7% [95% CI: 47.8%; 80.9%]) and for subjects with unknown concomitant vaccination (50% [95% CI: 18.7%; 81.3%])
- The  seroconversion  rates  were  6.3%  [95%  CI:  2.5%;  12.5%]  in  the  Placebo  Group,  indicating natural infection with wild type RV had occurred in these subjects.
- GMCs calculated  on  subjects  seropositive  for  anti-rotavirus  IgA  was  153.9U/ml  [95%  CI:  113.3 U/ml;  209.0  U/ml]  in  the  HRV  Group  and  81.6  U/ml  [95%  CI:  27.4  U/ml;  242.8  U/ml]  in  the Placebo Group.
- The  lower  limit  of  the  two  sided  asymptotic  standardised  95%  CI  for  the  difference  in  the percentage of subjects who seroconverted for anti-rotavirus IgA antibody at Visit 3 between the HRV vaccine Group and (minus) the Placebo Group was 41.46% indicating that the seroconversion rate was significantly higher in the HRV vaccine group as compared to that in the Placebo Group.

## · Safety results

Analysis was performed on Total vaccinated cohort (primary analysis) and on ATP cohort for safety.

## Any symptom:

- The percentage of subjects reporting any, grade 3 symptoms and symptoms causally related to vaccination (solicited or unsolicited) during the 8-day (Day 0 to Day 7) follow-up period after any dose was similar between both groups. The incidence of any symptoms was similar after Dose 1 and Dose 2 in both groups indicating no increase in symptoms with subsequent doses.

## Solicited general symptoms:

- The  percentage  of  subjects  for  who  solicited  general  symptom  was  reported  during  the  8-day follow-up  period  after  vaccination  was  similar  in  both  groups.  Cough/runny  nose  were  the  most commonly reported symptoms. Statistically significant differences were not detected between the two groups with respect to the  percentage of subjects reporting any individual solicited general symptom including those rated as grade 3 in intensity and those assessed as causally related to vaccination during the 8-day followup period after any HRV vaccine or placebo dose (p-value &gt; 0.05, two-sided Fisher.s exact test).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Unsolicited symptoms :

- The percentage of subjects for whom at least one unsolicited symptom was reported within the 31day follow-up period after any vaccination was similar in both groups: 19.8 % [95% CI: 14.3%; 26.3%] of  subjects  in  the  HRV  Group  and  17.7%  [95%  CI:  12.4%;  24.0%]  of  subjects  in  the Placebo Group.

## Rotavirus in stool samples collected during GE episodes:

- Of all the GE episodes reported from Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or placebo up to Visit 3, stool samples were not available from 30.4% of the GE episodes in the HRV Group and from 15.4% of the GE episodes in the Placebo Group.
- The percentage of subjects reporting GE episodes from Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or placebo up to Visit 3 was 12.6% [95% CI: 8.2%; 18.4%] in the HRV Group and 13.3% [95% CI: 8.7%; 19.1%] in the Placebo Group.
- RV was not isolated from any of the tested stool samples collected in case of GE episodes up to Visit 3

## Serious adverse events:

Five subjects (three in the HRV Group and two in the Placebo Group) reported non-fatal SAEs. None of these were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. All SAEs resolved. No deaths or intussusception cases occurred during the study.

Withdrawals due to adverse events/serious adverse events:

One  subject  (n  203)  in  the  HRV  Group  withdrew  from  the  study  due  to  diarrhoea  (non-serious adverse event).

## Concomitant medications:

The percentage of subjects who started taking at least one concomitant medication from Day 0 to Day 7 after any vaccination was similar in both groups. The percentage of subjects who started taking any antipyretic or  any  antibiotic  from  Day  0  to  Day  7  after  any  vaccination  was  similar  in  both  groups. None of the subjects started taking prophylactic antipyretic medication from Day 0 to Day 7 after any vaccination.

##  Conclusions:

- The immune  response  in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity in terms of anti-rotavirus seroconversion  rates  in  the  group  receiving  HRV  vaccine  was  58.3%  [95%  CI:  48.7%;  67.4%] which was significantly higher than the seroconversion observed in the Placebo Group (6.3% [95% CI: 2.5%; 12.5%]). The results observed from the analysis for the total vaccinated cohort were consistent with the results observed with the ATP cohort for immunogenicity.
- The HRV vaccine was well tolerated and the reactogenicity profile of the HRV vaccine was similar when compared to the reactogenicity profile of placebo. No SAEs causally related to vaccination were reported.
- RV was not isolated from any of the tested stool samples collected in case of GE episodes up to Visit 3

Assessor's  comment: Study  103792  investigated  the  seroconversion  rate  in  children vaccinated with Rotarx using a twofold administration versus placebo. The primary endpoint was  easily  met,  with  the  vaccinated  cohort  showing  a  more  or  less  ten  times  higher seroconversion rate versus the placebo. Safety and reactogenity of the vaccine was also shown to be good, and rota-virus was undetectable in any of the stool samples taken from patients presenting with gastro-enteritis during the trial. The MAH's conclusions drawn from the results are thus corroborated.

## Study 103992

##  General

A  phase  II,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of two doses of GSK Biologicals' oral live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine (RIX4414 at 106.5 CCID50) when given concomitantly with OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine) versus when  given  alone  (HRV  vaccine  dose  given  15  days  after  the  OPV  dose)  in  healthy  infants  in Bangladesh.

## · Objective(s)

## Primary:

- To assess immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' HRV vaccine in terms of anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion  at  Visit  6  in  the  group  receiving  HRV  vaccine  concomitantly  with  OPV versus placebo group.

## Secondary:

- To assess immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' HRV vaccine in terms of anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion at Visit 6 in the group receiving HRV vaccine alone versus placebo group.
- To assess vaccine immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' HRV vaccine in terms of anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion at Visit 6 in group receiving HRV vaccine concomit antly withOPV versus group receiving HRV vaccine alone (HRV vaccine dose given 15 days after the OPV dose).
- To assess vaccine take at Visit 6 in groups receiving GSK Biologicals' HRV vaccine concomitantly with OPV versus group receiving GSK Biologicals' HRV vaccine alone (HRV vaccine dose given 15 days after the OPV dose) in a subset of subjects.
- To assess  immunogenicity  of  GSK  Biologicals'  HRV  vaccine  in  terms  of  Geometric  Mean Concentration (GMC) at Visit 6.
- To  assess  rotavirus  (RV)  shedding  in  stool  samples  collected  at  pre-determined  timepoints  in  a subset of subjects.
- To assess the presence of RV in diarrhoeal stools collected from Visit 3 until Visit 6.
- To  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  the  poliovirus  antigens  at  Visit  6  in  each  of  the  HRV  vaccine groups versus placebo group.
- To  assess  the  safety  and  reactogenicity  of  each  dose  of  GSK  Biologicals'  HRV  vaccine  versus placebo.

- Group HRV+OPV: receiving 2 doses of HRV given concomitantly with OPV
- Group HRV: receiving 2 doses of HRV given alone (HRV vaccine dose given 15 days after the OPV dose)
- Group Placebo+OPV: receiving 2 doses of placebo for HRV vaccine given concomitantly with OPV
- Group Placebo: Group receiving 2 doses of placebo for HRV vaccine (HRV placebo dose given 15)

The study was conducted in a double-blind manner with respect to HRV vaccine and placebo. Hepatitis B,  BCG  and  OPV  vaccinations  at  birth  are  allowed  according  to  local  EPI  schedule  and  were  to  be documented in the case report form (CRF). BCG at Visit 1 was allowed and was to be documented in the CRF.

Following the EPI recommendation in Bangladesh, routine DTPw-HB vaccine was to be administered at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age (at Visits 1, 2 and 4).

## · Statistical Methods

## Analysis of Demography

Demographic characteristics (descriptive statistics on age at Visit 1, Dose 1 and Dose 2 of HRV vaccine or  placebo,  height  and  weight  at  Visit  1  and  gender  and  race  distribution)  were  tabulated  for  each group. Increase in height and weight from Visit 1 to Visit 3, Visit 5 and Visit 6 was summarised by group.

## Analysis of Immunogenicity

Immunogenicity analysis  was  performed  on  the  (ATP)  cohort  for  immunogenicity  (primary  analysis) and the total vaccinated cohort.

## All subjects:

At each time point that serum antibody response to a given antigen was measured, seroprotection/seroconversion/seropositivity  rates  and  their  exact  95%  CI  were  calculated  by  group and for pooled placebo groups. GMCs/GMTs and their 95% CI were calculated by group and for pooled placebo groups. GMCs and their 95% CI were also calculated on the subjects who had seroconverted to anti-rotavirus IgA antibody.

The asymptotic standardised 95% CI for difference between the two HRV groups and between each HRV group and the pooled placebo group was computed for each of the following endpoints separately.

-  the  percentage  of  subjects  who  seroconverted  for  anti-rotavirus  IgA  antibody;  the  corresponding one-sided asymptotic standardised P-value was also computed

- seroprotection rates for each anti-polio type 1, 2 and 3 antibodies

## Stool analysis subset:

The  percentage  of  subjects  with  presence  of  RV  in  stool  samples  collected  at  pre-determined  time points (shedding) was tabulated by group and for pooled placebo groups. The percentage of subjects with vaccine take at Visit 6 was calculated by group and for pooled placebo groups with its exact 95% CI.

## Analysis of Safety

The  safety  analysis  was  performed  on  the  total  vaccinated  cohort  (primary  analysis)  and  the  ATP cohort for safety. The percentages of doses and of subjects with any symptom (solicited or unsolicited) reported during the 8-day follow-up period and with specific solicited symptoms reported during the 8day (Day 0 to Day 7) solicited follow-up period were tabulated by group with their exact 95% CI. The percentages  of  doses  and  of  subjects  with  unsolicited  adverse  events  classified  by  MedDRA  system reported during the 31-day follow-up period after any HRV vaccine or placebo dose were tabulated by group with their exact 95% CI. The same calculations were done for symptoms rated as grade \"3\" in intensity and for those assessed as related to vaccination.

Differences  between the two HRV groups and between each HRV group and pooled placebo groups were explored using two-sided Fisher Exact test for each individual solicited symptom (any, grade \"3\", related)  reported  within  the  8-day  follow-up  period  after  any  HRV  vaccine  or  placebo  dose.  Due  to multiple endpoints analysed without multiplicity adjustment, statistically significant differences (Pvalue &lt; 0.05) should be interpreted  cautiously  and  the  differences  observed  in  this  study  could  occur  by chance alone.

The percentages of subjects with gastroenteritis (GE) and RV (vaccine strain or wild-type RV) GE from Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or placebo to Visit 6 were tabulated by group with their exact 95% CI. SAEs /withdrawals due to AE/SAEs were described.

##  Results

Demography

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The demographic profile of the four groups at study entry (Visit 1) was similar with respect to mean age, gender, racial distribution, height and weight. All subjects were of Bangladeshi origin. The mean age of subjects was 12.3 weeks at the time of the first HRV vaccine or placebo dose, 16.7 weeks at the time of the second HRV vaccine or placebo dose. The mean increase in height and weight were similar between the groups after the full vaccination course. The intended duration of the study, per subject, was approximately 3.5 months.

## Immunogenicity

Analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity (primary analysis).

- Table 8 presents the anti-rotavirus IgA antibody GMC and seroconversion rates. Approximately one month after Dose 2 of HRV vaccine, the anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion rate was 56.5% [95% CI: 44.0%; 68.4%] in group HRV+OPV and 66.7% [95% CI: 54.0%; 77.8%] in group HRV.
- The  18.6  %  of  seroconversion  observed  in  the  pooled  placebo  group  at  Visit  6  indicated  that natural infection with wild type RV had occurred during the study. The presence of wild type RV was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of the diarrhoeal stool samples.
- Table 9 presents inferential analysis on anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion rates at Visit 6. A statistically significant increase was detected in group HRV+OPV and in group HRV as compared to the pooled placebo group in terms of seroconversion rate at Visit 6 (P-value &lt; 0.05; one-sided asymptotic standardised test).
- Although  the  seroconversion  rate  at  Visit  6  was  somewhat  lower  in  the  HRV+OPV  group,  a statistically  significant decrease was not detected in the HRV+OPV group when compared to the HRV group (P-value &gt; 0.05; one-sided asymptotic standardised test) (Table 2).
- In the stool analysis subset, RV shedding was observed at Day 4 and Day 7 after Dose 1 and Dose 2  of  HRV  vaccine.  The  percentage  of  subjects  with  RV  shedding  at  combined  time  points  was 17.6% [95% CI: 6.8%; 34.5%] in group HRV+OPV and 31.0% [95% CI: 17.6%; 47.1%] in group HRV. RV shedding at combined time points was also detected in 10.5% [95% CI: 2.9%; 24.8%] subjects in group pooled placebo.
- The percentage of subjects with vaccine take at Visit 6 was 51.5% [95% CI: 33.5%; 69.2%] in group  HRV+OPV,  73.7%  [95%  CI:  56.9%;  86.6%]  in  group  HRV  and  19.4%  [95%  CI:  8.2%; 36.0%] in the pooled placebo group.
- The  seroprotection  rate  observed  against  poliovirus  type  3  in  Bangladesh  appeared  to  be  lower than  seroprotection  rates  observed  in  previous  South  African  studies  but  are  in  line  with seroprotection rates observed in other countries using the EPI schedule.
- Statistically  significant  differences  were  not  detected  between  each  HRV  group  and  the  pooled placebo group, and between the two HRV groups in terms of anti-poliovirus types 1, type 2 and type 3 seroprotection rates and GMTs at Visit 6, except for anti-poliovirus type 2 antibody GMT between the 2 HRV groups (in favour of the HRV+OPV group).

## · Safety results

Analysis was performed on the Total Vaccinated Cohort.

- The  percentage  of  subjects  with  symptoms  (solicited  or  unsolicited)  reported  within  the  8-day (Day 0 to Day 7) follow-up period after HRV vaccine or placebo dose including those rated as grade \"3\" were similar in all the groups. None were assessed as related to vaccination.
- Table 11 presents percentage of subjects reporting each solicited general symptoms and those graded '3' in intensity during the 8-day (Day 0 to Day 7) follow-up period after any HRV vaccine or  placebo  dose.  Irritability  was  the  most  frequently  recorded  solicited  general  symptom  in  all groups. Reports of solicited symptoms rated grade 3 in intensity were infrequent in all groups. None of the solicited symptoms were considered to be related to vaccination.
- Statistically  significant  differences  were  not  detected  for  the  comparison  between  the  two  HRV groups and between each HRV group and the pooled placebo group with respect to the incidence of  subjects  reporting  any  individual  solicited  general  symptom  and  those  rated  grade  3  in intensity  during  the  8-day  follow-up  period  after  any  HRV  vaccine  or  placebo  dose  (P-value  &gt; 0.05,  two-sided  Fisher's  exact  test),  except  for  grade  3  vomiting  between  HRV  group  and  the pooled placebo group (P-value = 0.029 in favour of the pooled placebo group). On the contrary, there  was  no  significant  difference  in  grade  3  vomiting  between  the  HRV+OPV  group  and  the pooled placebo group suggesting that the observed difference with the HRV group was likely to be a  chance  finding  due  to  the  number  of  endpoints  analysed  and  to  the  fact  that  no  multiplicity adjustment was done.
- The percentages of subjects with report of at least one unsolicited symptom within the 31-day follow-up  period  after  any  vaccination  were  similar  in  all  groups.  None  of  the  unsolicited symptoms were determined to have a causal relationship to vaccination.

- RV  was  isolated  in  stool  samples  from  seven  subjects  reporting  GE  between  Dose  1  of  HRV vaccine  or  placebo  up  to  Visit  6  (two  subjects  in  group  HRV+OPV,  one  subject  in  group  HRV, three subjects in group placebo+OPV and one subject in group placebo). No subject had more than one episode of RV GE. Of these seven RV GE episodes, G2P[4] was isolated in 2 GE stool samples and G12P[6] was isolated in 5 GE stool samples.
- SAEs: One SAE was reported during the study: A fatal SAE (Case ID B0399127A) assessed as not related  to  vaccination  (severe  pneumonia  leading  to  cardio  respiratory  and  renal  failure)  was reported  in  one  subject  from  group  HRV  on  Day  16  after  Dose  1  of  HRV  vaccine.  No intussusception cases were reported during the study.
- Withdrawal due to AE/SAE: One discontinuation from the study took place due to the fatal SAE described above.

##  Conclusions:

- The immune response in terms of anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion rates in the group receiving HRV vaccine concomitantly with OPV and in the group receiving HRV vaccine alone (HRV vaccine dose  given  15  days  after  the  OPV  dose)  was  of  56.5%  and  66.7%  respectively  which  is significantly higher than the seroconversion rate observed in the placebo groups. A statistically significant decrease was not detected in the HRV+OPV group when compared to the HRV group.
- Shedding  (17.6%  versus  31.0%)  and  vaccine  take  rates  (51.5%  versus  73.7%)  tended  to  be somewhat lower in  the  group  receiving  HRV  vaccine  concomitantly  with  OPV  compared  to  the group receiving HRV vaccine alone (HRV vaccine dose given 15 days after the OPV dose).
- There  was  no  interference  observed  with  co-administration  of  OPV  with  GSK  Biologicals'  HRV vaccine on the immune response to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3.
- The reactogenicity profile of the group receiving HRV vaccine concomitantly with OPV was similar to group receiving HRV vaccine alone (HRV vaccine dose given 15 days after the OPV dose). The reactogenicity profile of the HRV vaccine groups was similar to the placebo groups.
- No SAEs related to vaccination were reported.

Assessor's comment: Study 103992 was set up as an investigation to compare immunogenicity and safety of Rotarix vaccination, both alone and concomitantly with oral polio vaccine,  versus  placebo  using  a  four  arm  study  design  (HRV  vs.  HRV+OPV  vs.  placebo  vs. placebo+OPV). Immunogenicity results showed a clear superiority of the HRV treatment groups versus the placebo groups in anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion. Although a 10% difference was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

noted  between  the  HRV  and  HRV+OPV  groups,  this  difference  was  shown  to  be  statistically non-significant. There was neither decrease nor increase noted in the OPV immune response.

Safety  and  reactogenicity  was  similar  in  all  four  study  arms.  The  results  of  this  trial  thus confirm the efficacy and safety of Rotarix when concomitantly administered with OPV.

## Study 107531

##  General

A phase III randomized multi-center study to assess the immunogenicity of three doses of Pediarix, Prevnar  and  ActHIB  given  to  healthy  infants  at  2,  4  and  6  months  of  age  when  administered  with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals two-dose oral live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine given during the same vaccination visit (at 2 and 4 months of age) or given separately (at 3 and 5 months of age).

## · Objective(s)

## Primary:

- To demonstrate that the co-administration with GSK Biologicals HRV vaccine does not impair the immune  response  to  all  antigens  contained  in  each  of  the  routine  infant  vaccines  (Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB).

For this comparison the criteria for non-inferiority 1 month after Dose 3 of routine infant vaccines at Visit 6 were specified as follows:

Lower limit of the standardized asymptotic 95% confidence interval (CI) on the difference (HRV co-administration  group  minus  HRV  separate  group)  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  antipolyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP) antibody concentration ≥1.0 μg/mL is ≥ -10% (clinical limit for non-inferiority).

## and

Lower limits of the 95% CIs on the geometric mean antibody concentration (GMC) ratios (HRV co-administration  group  divided  by  HRV  separate  group)  for  each  of  the  anti-pertussis  toxoid (PT),  anti-filamentous  haemagglutinin  (FHA)  and  anti-pertactin  (PRN)  antibodies  are  ≥0.67 (clinical limit for non-inferiority).

## and

Lower limit of the standardized asymptotic 95% CI on the difference (HRV co-administration group minus HRV separate group) in the percentage of subjects with seroprotective concentration (≥10 mIU/mL) for anti-Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) antibodies is ≥ -10% (clinical limit for non-inferiority).

## and

Lower limits  of  the  95%  CIs  on  the  GMC  ratios  (HRV  co-administration  group  divided  by  HRV separate group) for each of the seven S. pneumoniae (Pn) serotypes are ≥0.5 (clinical limit for non-inferiority).

## and

Lower limits of the standardized asymptotic 95% CIs on the differences (HRV co- administration group minus HRV separate group) in the percentage of subjects with seroprotective titers (≥1:8) for  each  of  anti-poliovirus  serotypes  1,  2  and  3  antibodies  are  ≥  -10%  (clinical  limit  for  noninferiority).

## and

Lower limits of the standardized asymptotic 95% CIs on the differences (HRV co-administration group minus HRV separate group) in the percentage of subjects with seroprotective concentrations (≥0.1 IU/mL) for each of anti-diphtheria and anti-tetanus antibodies are ≥ - 10% (clinical limit for non-inferiority).

## Secondary:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To assess the immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' HRV vaccine in terms of serum anti- rotavirus immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody seropositivity (≥20 U/mL) at 2 to 3 months after Dose 2 of HRV vaccine (Visit 6).

## · Study design

Open-label, randomized (1:1), multi-center study with two parallel groups.

- Co-administration group (henceforth referred to as co-ad group) received Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and HRV vaccine during the same vaccination visit at 2 and 4 months of age.
- Separate  administration  group  (henceforth  referred  to  as  sep-ad  group)  received  Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and HRV vaccine separately at 3 and 5 months of age.

Fluzone vaccine was to be offered to subjects at 6 months (Visit 5) and 7 months (Visit 6) of age. Administration  of  this  vaccine  was  optional  at  the  investigator's  and  subject's  parents/guardians discretion. Blood samples were to be drawn from all subjects at Visit 6. Safety was to be assessed in all subjects during the entire study period inclusive of the Extended Safety Follow-up Phase (from Day 0 up to 5 months after the 3rd dose of Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB or within 7 months following the last dose of Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB in case the 3rd dose was not given).

## · Statistical Methods

## Analysis of Demography

The distributions of subjects enrolled by center were tabulated by group. The number of subjects who dropped out at  Visit  6  was  tabulated  by  group  according  to  the  reason  for  drop-  out.  The  median, mean, range and standard deviation (SD) of age at each study vaccine dose (in weeks) were computed by group. The median, mean and SD of height in centimeter (cm) and weight in kilograms (kg) at Visit 1 were computed by group. The Body Mass Index (BMI) at Visit 1 was also computed as weight (in kg) / height2 (in meters). The median, mean and SD of the gestation period (in weeks) and weight at birth (in kg) were computed by group. The racial and gender composition were also presented. The number of  doses  of  HRV  vaccine,  Prevnar,  Pediarix  and  ActHIB  administered  was  tabulated  per  group.  The percentage of subjects who received a dose of hepatitis B vaccine before Dose 1 of routine vaccination at Visit 1 was tabulated per group.

## Analysis of Immunogenicity

## Within group analysis

For each treatment group and each antigen:

- Seropositivity/seroprotection rates, as applicable, were calculated with exact 95% CI
- GMC/geometric mean titers (GMTs) with 95% CIs were tabulated. Calculation of the GMC/GMTs was performed by taking the anti-log of the mean of the log concentration/ titer transformations. Antibody concentrations/ titers below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC/GMT calculation
- The distribution of antibody concentrations/ titers was presented using reverse cumulative curves (RCC).  For  anti-HBsAg  antibodies,  seroprotection  rates  and  GMC,  with  95%  CIs,  were  also computed according to whether subjects received a dose of hepatitis B vaccine or not before Dose 1 of routine vaccination at Visit 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Between groups analysis

## For each antigen:

- The two-sided asymptotic standardized 95% CIs for the difference between group (co-ad group minus sep-ad group) in seropositivity/seroprotection rates, as applicable, were computed
- The 95% CIs of GMC/GMT ratios between groups (co-ad group divided by sep-ad group) were computed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model on the logarithm10 transformation of the concentrations/titers. The ANOVA model included the vaccine group as only fixed effect. For antiHBsAg antibodies, the ANOVA included the previous hepatitis B vaccination status as an additional fixed effect
- The criteria for non-inferiority were only pre-specified for the response to routine vaccines

## Analysis of Safety

Preliminary safety data on SAEs occurring in study Rota-060 from study initiation up to the data lock point of 23 April 2007 and recorded in the GSK SAE database is provided as a tabular summary. SAEs reported in clinical studies are also recorded in the clinical study database. The GSK SAE database and the clinical study database will undergo a final reconciliation upon completion of the Extended Safety Follow-up Phase.

##  Results

## Demography

The analysis was performed on the ATP Cohort for immunogenicity and on the TVC.

The demographic profiles of the two groups of subjects in the ATP Cohort for immunogenicity were comparable with respect to mean weight, mean height, gender and BMI at Visit 1. The mean age of the subjects in the co-ad group was 8.7 weeks at the time of the first dose of HRV vaccine and the routine infant vaccines and 17.4 weeks at the time of the second dose of HRV vaccine and the routine infant vaccines. The mean age of the subjects in the sep-ad group was 8.8 weeks at the time of the first dose of the routine vaccination  and  17.6  weeks  at  the  time  of  the  second  dose  of  the  routine vaccination.The mean age of the subjects in the sep-ad group was 12.8 weeks at the time of the first dose  of  the  HRV  vaccine  and  21.5  weeks  at  the  time  of  the  second  dose  of  the  HRV  vaccine.  The demographic characteristics were similar for the ATP Cohort for immunogenicity and the TVC.

## Secondary endpoints

- Antibody response to HRV vaccine:
- -The seropositivity  rate  for  anti-rotavirus  IgA  antibody  at  3  months  after  Dose  2  of  the  HRV vaccine dose in the co-ad group was 78.8% [95% CI: 71.8%; 84.8%] and at 2 months after Dose 2 of the HRV vaccine dose in the sep-ad group was 86.0% [95% CI: 78.5%; 91.6%].
- -The anti-rotavirus IgA GMC was 110.0 U/mL [95% CI: 85.8; 141.1] at 3 months after Dose 2 of the HRV vaccine dose in the co-ad group and was 188.2 U/mL [95% CI: 139.6; 253.5] at 2 months after Dose 2 of the HRV vaccine dose in the sep-ad group.

## · Safety results

## Preliminary Safety Results up to the data lock point of 23 April 2007

No deaths were reported up to the data lock point. SAEs were reported by the investigators for 28 subjects up to the data lock point of 23 April 2007. Of these, 10 SAEs were reported within the 31-day post-vaccination  period.  All  SAEs  reported  within  31  days  of  an  HRV  vaccine  dose  (either  coadministered or given separately with the routine infant vaccines) were resolved. One subject in the sep-ad group withdrew due to an unrelated SAE (malignant brain neoplasm) from the Active Phase of the study. One case of intussusception was reported in study Rota-060 up to the data lock point of 23 April 2007. A 39-week old female subject from the sep-ad group experienced intussusception 90 days after  the  third  dose  of  routine  vaccines.  The  intussusception  was  reduced  by  surgery.  The  event resolved after 6 days.

## Assessor's comment: The final safety data was provided in the annex report of the Extended Safety Follow-up Phase. Please see further down this AR.

##  Conclusions:

- By meeting the pre-specified criteria for non-inferiority, study Rota-060 has demonstrated that co- administration of the HRV vaccine with licensed routine infant vaccines recommended in the US (Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB) does not negatively impact the immune response to any of the antigens (PRP, HBsAg, poliovirus serotypes 1, 2 and 3, diphtheria, tetanus, PT, FHA, PRN and S. pneumoniae  serotypes  4,  6B,  9V,  14,  18C,  19F  and  23F)  that  are  currently  included  in  the Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  is  schedule,  Advisory  Committee  on  Immunization Practices (ACIP), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and in the American Academy of Family Physician  (AAFP)  schedules  of  recommended immunizations for infants in the US. The primary objective of this study was met.
- Two doses of the HRV vaccine (at least 10 6.0  CCID50 per dose) were immunogenic in US infants, with anti-rotavirus IgA seropositivity rates of 78.8% [95% CI: 71.8%; 84.8%] at 3 months after the 2nd HRV vaccine dose in the co-ad group and 86.0% [95% CI: 78.5%; 91.6%] at 2 months after the 2nd HRV vaccine dose in the sep-ad group.
- There are no clinical concerns raised based on the preliminary safety data from study Rota-060.

Assessor's  comment: Study  107531  sought  to  investigate  the  potential  impact  of  Rotarix vaccination on the immunogenicity of routine infant vaccinations (as recommended in the US) when said vaccination was given concomitantly. The study design thus compromised two arms: one where HRV was given at the same time as the first two routine vaccinations and one were the two HRV administrations were done separately.

Non-inferiority  between  the  both  study  arms  in  respect  to  immune  responses  to  the  routine vaccinations  was  attained,  and  neither  was  HRV  immunogenicity  impacted  due  to  coadministration.

Safety  was  to  be  assessed  in  a  prolonged  safety  follow-up  report,  but  preliminary  data gathered in this trial did not point towards worrisome trends or issues of particular interest. Only one case of intussusception, which was dealt with by surgery, was reported in all of the groups.

From this trial it can be gathered that co-administration of HRV with routine child vaccinations, as done in the US, has no appreciable impact on the immunogenicity of either of the vaccines.

## Study 107531 - Annex report: Extended Safety Follow-up Phase

##  General

A phase III randomized multi-center study to assess the immunogenicity of three doses of Pediarix, Prevnar  and  ActHIB  given  to  healthy  infants  at  2,  4  and  6  months  of  age  when  administered  with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals two-dose oral live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine given during the same vaccination visit (at 2 and 4 months of age) or given separately (at 3 and 5 months of age).

## · Objective(s)

## Safety:

To assess the safety of two doses of GSK Biologicals HRV vaccine given concomitantly or separately with routine infant vaccinations in terms of serious adverse events (SAEs) and specific adverse events (AEs) from Day 0 (i.e. Day of administration of Dose 1 of the routine infant vaccines) up to 5 months after the 3rd dose of Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB or within the 7 months following the last dose of Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB in case the 3rd dose is not given.

## · Study design

Open-label, randomized (1:1), multi-center study with two parallel groups.

- Co-administration group (henceforth referred to as co-ad group) received Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and HRV vaccine during the same vaccination visit at 2 and 4 months of age.
- Separate  administration  group  (henceforth  referred  to  as  sep-ad  group)  received  Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and HRV vaccine separately at 3 and 5 months of age.

Fluzone vaccine was to be offered to subjects at 6 months (Visit 5) and 7 months (Visit 6) of age. Administration  of  this  vaccine  was  optional  at  the  investigator's  and  subject's  parents/guardians discretion. Blood samples were to be drawn from all subjects at Visit 6. Safety was to be assessed in all subjects during the entire study period inclusive of the Extended Safety Follow-up Phase (from Day 0 up to 5 months after the 3rd dose of Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB or within 7 months following the last dose of Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB in case the 3rd dose was not given).

Active  Phase  included  the  period  starting  from  Day  0  up  to  final  study  visit  (Visit  6)  for  postvaccination blood sampling at approximately one month after Dose 3 of the routine vaccines. Extended safety  follow-up  phase  included  the  period  starting  from  the  day  after  Visit  6  up  to  the  contact  at Month 9.

Subjects in the sep-ad group received a dose of HRV vaccine at Visit 2 and Visit 4. tContact (by telephone call or any other convenient procedure) 120 - 150 days after Visit 5 for safety follow-up.

## · Study population

## Inclusion criteria

Healthy  infants  between  6  and  12  weeks  of  age  at  the  time  of  the  first  vaccination  with  written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject, and those who had not received a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine or those who had received only one dose of hepatitis B vaccine administered at least 30 days prior to enrolment were included in the study. All vaccinated subjects were to be followed for safety during the entire study period (Day 0 up to 5 months after the 3rd dose of Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB or within 7 months following the last dose of Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB in case the 3rd dose was not given).

## · Endpoints

SAEs  and  specific  AEs  [new  onset  of  chronic  illness(es)  that  are  not  congenital  anomalies  (e.g. autoimmune  disorders,  asthma,  type  I  diabetes  and  allergies)  and  conditions  prompting  ER  visits] during the entire study period (from Day 0 up to 5 months after the 3rd dose of Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB or within the 7 months following the last dose of Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB in case the 3rd dose was not given).

## · Statistical Methods

## Analysis of Safety

The safety analysis was performed on the TVC (primary analysis) and on the ATP cohort for safety. Specific AEs and SAEs were analyzed separately. Specific AEs include only non-serious AEs.

- Percentage of subjects with specific AEs classified by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) from Day 0 up to the last study contact of the extended safety follow-up phase was computed along with exact 95% confidence interval  (CI).  The  same  calculations  were  done  for  specific  AEs  with  causal  relationship  to vaccination, for specific AEs rated as Grade 3, specific AEs leading to ER visit and specific AEs that did not result in an ER visit.
- Percentage of subjects reporting SAEs classified by MedDRA SOC and PT from Day 0 up to the last study contact of the extended safety follow-up was computed along with exact 95% CI.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The percentage of subjects who took at least one concomitant medication by type, during the active phase of the study was tabulated with exact 95% CI for each group.

Exploratory comparisons between groups for the percentage of subjects reporting specific AEs (any intensity, related, grade 3, those leading to ER visit and those that did not result in an ER visit) and subjects reporting SAEs from Day 0 up to the last study contact of the extended safety follow-up were performed using two-sided asymptotic standardized 95% CIs for group difference and the two-sided asymptotic score test for the null hypothesis of identical incidence in both groups (significance level of alpha = 0.05).

P-values less than 0.05 were used as an aid to highlight potential imbalance between groups.

##  Results

## Demography

The analysis was performed on the TVC, which included 484 subjects who received at least one dose of the study vaccines (Pediarix, Prevnar, ActHIB and HRV vaccine). Of these 484 subjects, 25 subjects in the sep-ad group dropped out before Visit 2 without having received any HRV vaccine. Hence, only 459 subjects received at least one dose of the HRV vaccine.

#new onset of chronic illness(es) that are not congenital anomalies (e.g. autoimmune disorders, asthma, type I diabetes and allergies) and conditions prompting ER visits.Specific AEs include only non-serious AEs.

## specific AE incidences:

- The percentage of subjects with at least one specific AE from Day 0 up to the last study contact was similar in both groups (10.8% in the co-ad group and 12.8% in the sep-ad group) (p-value = 0.512).
- A  potential  imbalance  between  groups  was  noted  for  only  one  specific  AE  'Gastroesophageal reflux' (5 subjects (2.1%) in the sep-ad group and none in the co-ad group) (p-value = 0.021). None of the  cases  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  vaccination.  One  case

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

resulted  in  an  ER  visit.  None  of  the  subjects  had  a  prior  medical  history  of  'Gastroesophageal reflux'. This potential imbalance is likely due to a chance observation.

- The percentage of subjects with at least one specific AE leading to ER visit from Day 0 up to the last study contact was 8.4% in the co-ad group and 8.9% in the sep-ad group (p-value = 0.844).
- The percentage of subjects with at least one specific AE not leading to an ER visit from Day 0 up to the last study contact was 2.4% in the co-ad group and 4.7% in the sep-ad group (p-value = 0.175)
- One subject in the sep-ad group reported a specific AE (pyrexia) that was assessed as related to vaccination. This subject experienced pyrexia one day after receiving the first dose of the routine infant vaccines. The duration of this AE was two days and the subject recovered.

## SAE incidences:

- From Day 0 up to the last study contact, at least one SAE was reported by 15 (6.0%) subjects in the co-ad group and 14 (6.0%) subjects in the sep-ad group (p-value = 0.975).
- When SAEs were classified by MedDRA SOC and PT, no potential imbalance between groups were noted  for  any  of  the  SAEs  reported  during  the  entire  study  period  (p-value  &gt;0.05  for  all comparisons).
- One subject in the co-ad group experienced rotavirus gastroenteritis 108 days after the third dose of  routine  infant  vaccines.  This  subject  was  hospitalized  and  laboratory  demonstrated  rotavirus antigen  in  stool  (serotype  not  investigated).  This  SAE  resolved  and  was  not  considered  by  the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.
- All subjects recovered from the SAEs except one subject in the sep-ad group with malignant brain neoplasm. This SAE was not considered to be causally related to vaccination by the investigator. This subject was withdrawn from the study before receiving any dose of the HRV vaccine.
- One case of intussusception was reported during the study. A 39-week old female subject (n° 92) from the sep-ad group experienced intussusception 90 days after the third dose of routine vaccines (125 days after the second dose of HRV vaccine). The intussusception was reduced by surgery. The event resolved after 6 days.
- One SAE ('Fever' with PT 'Viral Infection') was considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. The subject in the co-ad group developed fever 9 days after receiving the first dose of the HRV vaccine co-administered with routine infant vaccines and was hospitalized. The fever lasted for 3 days and the subject recovered.
- There were no fatal events reported in this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Withdrawals due to adverse events/serious adverse events:

Withdrawals  due  to  AE/SAE  were  assessed  only  during  the  active  phase  of  the  study.  The parents/guardians of subject number 50 in the sep-ad group withdrew their child from the study after administration of the routine vaccinations at Visit 1 due to an unrelated SAE (atypical rhabdoid tumor). This  subject  did  not  receive  any  dose  of  the  HRV  vaccine.  This  SAE  was  not  considered  by  the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

##  Conclusions:

- Two  doses  of  the  HRV  vaccine,  when  co-administered  with  licensed  routine  infant  vaccines recommended in the US (Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB) or given separately, have a similar safety profile.
- There are no clinical concerns raised based on the available safety data.

Assessor's  comment: The extended safety follow-up of Study 107531 included all patients whom were vaccinated  in  the  active  phase  of  the  study,  and  was  meant  to  investigate  the safety  of  HRV  vaccination  in  combination  with  routine  (US)  childhood  vaccinations,  whether administered concomitantly or separately.

The  data  gathered  in  this  follow-up  showed  that  the  safety  profile  between  both  groups (concomitant versus separate administration) was similar, and that no administration-specific safety signals were detectable. It is agreed with the MAH that none of the observations made in this safety follow-up are a reason for concern.

## III. OVERALL DISCUSSION ON CLINICAL ASPECTS

The four Rotarix studies (+ extended safety follow-up annex) submitted in the framework of the P45 resolution aimed to a) compare the vaccine's immunogenicity and safety compared to placebo with or without  routine  pediatric  co-vaccines  in  children  aged  from  6  weeks  to  12  weeks  of  age  and  b) investigate non-inferiority and non-negative-impact bearing of concomitant vaccination with OPV and vaccines used within the US routine pediatric vaccination schedule.

All study outcomes confirmed the good immunogenicity and safety profiles of the Rotarix vaccine in the study  populations,  and  it  was  clearly  established  that  concomitant  vaccination  within  the  routine pediatric vaccination schedule did not bring about any negative effects on these or the other vaccine's established immunogenicity and safety profiles.

No new issues that would warrant regulatory actions were found to exist in any of the study results provided, and results were in agreement with the already established knowledge on Rotarix safety and immunogenicity.

This submission is thus hereby considered fulfilled.
