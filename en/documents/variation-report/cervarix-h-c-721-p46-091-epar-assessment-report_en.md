## Introduction

This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH:

According to Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006, the Company hereby submits the clinical study report HPV-071, Month 36 data, entitled: ' A Phase IIIb observer-blind, randomized, multicentre primary immunization study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals' HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine and Merck's Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) Recombinant Vaccine, when administered intramuscularly according to alternative 2-dose schedules in 9-14 year old healthy females.

Study reports for Month 7, dated 23 May 2014, and Month 12, dated 11 February 2015, were previously submitted under Article 46 of the regulation 1901/2006 on 12 March 2015 (as part of the variation II/67, eCTD sequence 0192). The Annex study report for Month 18 &amp; Month 24, dated 13 August 2015, was previously submitted under Article 46 of the regulation 1901/2006 on 07 September 2015 (eCTD sequence 0207).

Non-inferiority and superiority of immune responses to both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens was demonstrated at Month 18 and Month 24 when Cervarix was administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0,6 months in 9-14 year old females versus Gardasil administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 months or according to a 3-dose schedule at 0,2,6 months.

Both vaccines were generally well tolerated when administered according to a 3-dose or 2-dose schedule in subjects aged 9-14 years. However, more SAEs were reported in the 2-dose Cervarix group over the entire study period up until Month 24, as well as in the period between Month 18 and Month 24, compared to the Gardasil groups, regardless of the number of Gardasil doses.

## 2. Assessment of the post-authorisation measure PAM 091

The MAH submitted a report at Month 36 for Study 115411 (HPV-071 PRI), a Phase IIIb observerblind, randomized, multicentre (Sweden, Hong Kong, France and Singapore) primary immunization study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Cervarix (bivalent HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04adjuvanted) and Gardasil (quadrivalent HPV-6/11/16/18 aluminium-adjuvanted), when administered intramuscularly according to alternative 2-dose schedules in 9-14 year old healthy females.

## 2.1.1. Clinical study

## Methods

## Objectives

## Primary objective

## Immunogenicity

- The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate sequentially if the immunogenicity (as determined by ELISA) of Cervarix was non-inferior/superior to that of Gardasil after administration according to a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 months in 9-14 years old females, one month after the last dose (Month 7).

If non-inferiority at Month 7 was shown, non-inferiority/superiority analysis by comparison of the immune response to both vaccine antigens between the Cervarix 2-dose group and the Gardasil 2-dose group at Months 12, 18, 24 and 36 will be performed (first secondary objective).

## Secondary objective

## Immunogenicity

- If the primary non-inferiority objective is reached, the next objective is to evaluate sequentially if the immunogenicity (as determined by ELISA) of a 2-dose Cervarix schedule is noninferior/superior to that of a 2-dose Gardasil schedule, both administered at 0, 6 months, at Months 12, 18, 24 and 36.
- If the primary non-inferiority objective is reached, the next objective is to evaluate sequentially if the immunogenicity (as determined by ELISA) of a 2-dose Cervarix schedule at 0, 6 months is non-inferior/superior to that of a 3-dose Gardasil schedule at 0, 2, 6 months at Months 7, 12, 18, 24 and 36.
- To assess the immune responses to HPV types 16 and 18 by ELISA at Day 0 and Months 7, 12, 18, 24 and 36 in all subjects.
- To assess the immune responses to HPV types 16 and 18 by PBNA in a subset of subjects at Day 0 and Months 7, 12, 18, 24 and 36.
- To assess cell-mediated immunity (CMI), i.e., T-cell-mediated and memory B-cell immune responses specific to HPV-16 and HPV-18 in a sub-cohort of subjects at Day 0, Months 7, 12, 24 and 36.

## Safety

- To assess the reactogenicity of the administered vaccines in all groups after each dose.
- To assess the safety of the administered vaccines in all groups.
- To evaluate compliance with completion of vaccination in all groups.

## Study design

HPV-071 is a Phase IIIb, observer-blind, randomised, age-stratified, multicentre study with 3 parallel groups.

- -The occurrence of pIMDs from first vaccination to six months after the last vaccine dose (from Day 0 up to Month 12) in all groups.
- -The occurrence of MSCs throughout the study period (from Day 0 up to Month 36) in all groups.
- -The occurrence of SAEs throughout the study period (from Day 0 up to Month 36) in all groups.
- -The occurrence of SAEs related to the investigational product, to study participation, to GSK concomitant products or any fatal SAE throughout the study period (from Day 0 up to Month 36) in all groups.
- -The occurrence of pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes throughout the study period (from Day 0 up to Month 36) in all groups.

- -Use of concomitant medication (e.g. prophylactic use of antibiotics or antipyretics) throughout the study period (from Day 0 up to Month 36) in all groups.
- -The percentage of subjects completing the vaccination schedule in all groups.

## Statistical Methods

Comparison between groups

- Primary between-group comparisons to assess the non-inferiority at Month 7 were performed in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity on subjects seronegative by ELISA at Day 0 for the antigen under analysis. Subjects seropositive for only one antigen were eliminated for the analysis of that antigen but were still evaluable for the analysis of the other antigen. In addition, non-inferiority assessment was also performed in the TVC on all subjects (regardless of serostatus at Day 0).
- Between-group comparisons to assess superiority were performed in the TVC on all subjects (regardless of serostatus at Day 0). In addition, superiority assessment was also performed in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity on subjects seronegative at Day 0 for the antigen under analysis.

## Criteria for non-inferiority

- Non-inferiority with respect to seroconversion rates was shown if, one month after the last dose, for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies, the upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference (Gardasil minus Cervarix) was below 5%.
- Non-inferiority with respect to GMT for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies was shown if, one month after the last dose, the upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio (Gardasil divided by Cervarix) was below 2.

## Criteria for superiority

- If non-inferiority was reached, and if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs Cervarix divided by Gardasil of a given antigen was above 1 in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity, the following criteria for superiority were to be assessed sequentially in the TVC:
- o First, superiority for HPV-18 was assessed. Superiority was shown if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs for anti-HPV-18 antibodies (Cervarix divided by Gardasil) was above 1 with the associated p-value.
- o Second, if superiority for HPV-18 is shown, superiority for HPV-16 was assessed. Superiority was shown if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs for antiHPV-16 antibodies (Cervarix divided by Gardasil) was above 1 with the associated pvalue.

## Demographic characteristics

- In the ATP cohort, the age at vaccination was comparable between the different groups (11.5 ± 1.62 years in Cervarix group, 11.5 ± 1.55 years in Gardasil 2-dose group and 11.6 ± 1.63 years in Gardasil 3-dose group).
- The three groups had a comparable ethnical/racial distribution, with an approximate 50% of the subjects in each group of East Asian heritage and an approximate 25% of Caucasian

heritage. Demographic characteristics in the TVC were similar.

## Non-inferiority analysis on primary objective (Cervarix 2-dose vs Gardasil 2D, M36)

The non-inferiority assessment of seroconversion rates is presented in Error! Reference source not found. and the non-inferiority assessment of anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibody GMT (ELISA) is presented in synopsis Table 1 to 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

At the Month 36 time point:

## Non-inferiority in terms of both seroconversion and GMT ratio was met since:

- the upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rates (HPV-6/11/16/18 (0, 6) schedule minus HPV-16/18 (0, 6) schedule) for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies was below 5% in the Month 36 ATP cohort for immunogenicity.
- the upper limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio (HPV-6/11/16/18 (0, 6) schedule divided by HPV-16/18 (0, 6) schedule) for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies was below 2 in the Month 36 ATP cohort for immunogenicity.

## Superiority analysis on primary objective (Cervarix 2-dose vs Gardasil 2-dose, M36)

Because non-inferiority was reached, and the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs Cervarix divided by Gardasil of a given antigen was above 1 in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity, a superiority analysis was performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At the Month 36 time point:

## Superiority in terms of GMT ratio was met as:

- the lower limit of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio (HPV-16/18 (0, 6) schedule divided by HPV6/11/16/18 (0, 6) schedule) for both anti-HPV-18 and anti-HPV-16 antibodies was above 1, in the Month 36 Total Vaccinated cohort.

## Assessor's comment

The primary objective of the study was met.

After Cervarix vaccination as compared to Gardasil vaccination, both administered according to a 2dose schedule in females aged 9-14 years of age, study HPV-071 demonstrated at Month 36.

- -Non-inferiority in terms of seroconversion rates; and
- -Superiority in terms of GMT ratio in the Total Vaccinated cohort.

## Non-inferiority analysis on secondary objective (Cervarix 2D vs Gardasil 3D, M36)

The secondary objective, i.e. to evaluate sequentially if the immunogenicity (as determined by ELISA) of Cervarix administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 months was non-inferior/superior to that of Gardasil vaccine administered according to the standard 3-dose schedule (0, 2, 6 months) at Month 36, was also met for this study.

- -Non-inferiority in terms of seroconversion rates; and
- -Superiority in terms of GMT ratio in the Total Vaccinated cohort.

In the Month 36 ATP cohort for immunogenicity, all initially seronegative subjects in the HPV\\_2D group, and at least 99.3% of subjects in the Gard\\_2D and Gard\\_3D groups had seroconverted for antiHPV-16 antibodies when measured by ELISA. All initially seronegative subjects in the HPV\\_2D group, and at least 86.1% of subjects in the Gard\\_2D and Gard\\_3D groups had seroconverted for anti-HPV-18 antibodies, when measured by ELISA.

## Persistence of HPV antibody titres (Cervarix 2-dose vs Gardasil 2-dose or 3-dose)

GMT levels for neutralising antibodies against both HPV-16 and HPV-18, which had reached a peak response at Month 7, showed a further decline at Month 36 in all three groups. This is in line with previous observations.

## Anti-HPV-16/18 neutralising antibodies measured by PBNA at Month 24

Pseudovirion-based neutralization assays (PBNA) for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 was performed on a subset of 100 randomly selected subjects for each study group.

- In the month 24 ATP cohort for immunogenicity, all initially seronegative subjects in HPV\\_2D and Gard\\_2D groups, and 98.9% of subjects in the Gard\\_3D groups had seroconverted for anti-HPV-16 neutralising antibodies when measured by PBNA.
- All initially seronegative subjects in HPV\\_2D group had seroconverted for anti-HPV-18 neutralising antibodies when measured by PBNA. In Gard\\_2D group, 90.4% of subjects and in Gard\\_3D group, 96.7% of subjects had seroconverted for anti-HPV-18 neutralising antibodies when measured by PBNA at M24.
- GMT levels for neutralizing antibodies against both HPV-16 and HPV-18, which had reached a peak response at Month 7, showed a further decline at Month 24 in all three groups.

## Anti-HPV-16/18 neutralising antibodies measured by PBNA at Month 36

Analyses were performed as planned in the protocol except that the Pseudovirion-Based Neutralization Assay (PBNA) analysis was not performed at the Month 24 time point but well at M36. In the Month 36 ATP cohort for immunogenicity, all initially seronegative subjects in the HPV\\_2D, Gard\\_2D Gard\\_3D groups had seroconverted for anti-HPV-16 neutralising antibodies when measured by PBNA. All initially seronegative subjects in HPV\\_2D group, 86.2% of subjects in Gard\\_2D group and 94.5% of subjects in Gard\\_3D group had seroconverted for anti-HPV-18 neutralising antibodies when measured by PBNA.

GMT levels for neutralising antibodies against both HPV-16 and HPV-18, which had reached a peak response at Month 7, showed a further decline at Month 36 in all three groups.

## T-cell-mediated immune responses

## · CD4+ T cell response

At Month 36, overall CD4+ T cell response (in terms of median frequency of HPV-16/18 antigenspecific CD4+ T cells per million CD4+ T cells expressing at least two different immune markers [all doubles]) was1012.0, 685.0 and 842.5 cells per million CD4+ T cells in HPV\\_2D, Gard\\_2D and Gard\\_3D groups, respectively for HPV-16. HPV-18 specific CD4+ T cell response was 682.0, 350.0 and 516.0 cells per million CD4+ T cells in HPV\\_2D, Gard\\_2D and Gard\\_3D groups, respectively. Figure 4.

## · CD8+ T cell response

As observed in the previous time points, HPV-16 and HPV-18 specific CD8+ T cells response was undetectable (up to 4.0 cells per million CD8+ T cells) in all three groups at Month 36.

## Memory B-cell-mediated immune responses

At Month 36, B cell response (in terms of median frequency of HPV-16/18 antigen-specific memory B cells per million memory B cells in subjects with detectable B cells) was 353.0, 390.0 and 246.0 cells per million memory B cells in HPV\\_2D, Gard\\_2D and Gard\\_3D groups, respectively, for HPV-16. The HPV-18 specific memory B cell response was 116.0 cells, 25.0 and 69.5 cells per million memory B cells in HPV\\_2D, Gard\\_2D and Gard\\_3D groups, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Serious adverse events:

- A SAE with a fatal outcome due to committed suicide was reported for subject  (Gard\\_3D group) at Month 36. The investigator considered that there was no causal relationship between the subject's suicide and the vaccine administered.
- Up to the end of the study (Month 36), a total of 46 subjects (21 subjects in the HPV\\_2D group, 11 subjects in the Gard\\_2D group and 14 subjects in the Gard\\_3D group) reported at least one SAE. None of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to have a possible causal relationship to vaccination.
- All SAEs resolved without sequelae except for the SAEs - colitis ulcerative, anaphylactic reaction (food dependant exercise induced anaphylaxis), tension headache and juvenile idiopathic arthritis which were ongoing at the time of the data lock point of this study for the Month 36 time point.

## Medically significant conditions:

- Up to Month 36, a total of 219 subjects reported at least one MSC (77 subjects in HPV\\_2D group,79 subjects in Gard\\_2D group and 63 subjects in Gard\\_3D group) in the TVC.

## Potential Immune-Mediated Dissorders (pIMDs) up to Month 12:

- A total of six subjects in the TVC (three subjects each in the HPV\\_2D and Gard\\_2D groups) reported at least one pIMD up to Month 12. One pIMD (arthritis reactive) was considered by the investigator to have a possible causal relationship to vaccination.

## Withdrawals due to adverse events /serious adverse events:

- Subject  (Gard\\_3D group) was withdrawn as a result of a fatal SAE (completed suicide). There were no other withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events from Month 24 to Month 36.

## Concomitant medications /vaccinations:

- Up to Month 36, in the Total Vaccinated cohort, any concomitant medication was received by 47.6%, 43.9% and 45.0% of subjects in HPV\\_2D, Gard\\_2D and Gard\\_3D groups, respectively. Any antipyretic medication was received by 30.6%, 28.5% and 26.5% of subjects in HPV\\_2D, Gard\\_2D and Gard\\_3D groups, respectively. Prophylactic antipyretic medication was received by 1.4%, 0.6% and 0.6% of subjects in HPV\\_2D, Gard\\_2D and Gard\\_3D groups, respectively. Any antibiotic medication was received by 13.4%, 11.7% and 14.0% of subjects in HPV\\_2D, Gard\\_2D and Gard\\_3D groups, respectively.

## Pregnancies:

- There was one report of a pregnancy (Gard\\_3D group) up to Month 36, which was electively terminated with no apparent congenital anomaly.

More SAEs were reported for Cervarix over the entire study period up until Month 36, as well as in the period between Month 18 and Month 24, but not between M24 and M36 as shown in Tables 8 and 9 below.

## 2.1.2. Discussion on clinical aspects

## Immunogenicity results

Non-inferiority and superiority of immune responses to both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens was demonstrated at Month 36 when Cervarix was administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0,6 months in 9-14 year old females versus Gardasil administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 months or according to a 3-dose schedule at 0,2,6 months.

## Safety results

Both vaccines were generally well tolerated when administered according to a 3-dose or 2-dose schedule in subjects aged 9-14 years. However, more SAEs were reported in the 2-dose Cervarix group over the entire study period up until Month 36 regardless of the number of Gardasil doses.

Up to the end of the study (Month 36), a total of 46 subjects (21 subjects in the HPV\\_2D group, 11 subjects in the Gard\\_2D group and 14 subjects in the Gard\\_3D group) reported at least one SAE. The occurrence of the SAEs after Cervarix were reported the first 18 months. According to the CSR, none of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to have a possible causal relationship to vaccination.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion

In conclusion, non-inferiority and superiority of immune responses to both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens was demonstrated up to Month 36 by the Applicant when HPV-16/18 vaccine was administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0,6 months in 9-14 year old females versus Merck's HPV-6/11/16/18 L1 VLP recombinant vaccine administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 months or according to a 3-dose schedule at 0,2,6 months.

The safety profile of HPV-16/18 vaccine was in line with the known safety profile of the vaccine, and that of HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine was in line with the Prescribing Information. Both vaccines were generally well tolerated when administered according to a 3-dose or 2-dose schedule in subjects aged 9-14 years.

The HPV-071 PRI study results are in line with the approved PI. No changes to the SmPC are needed. The Article 46 paediatric submission is considered fulfilled and no further regulatory action is needed. The provided data do not cause concern regarding efficacy or safety of Cervarix.

The benefit/risk balance of Cervarix remains positive.

## Recommendation

## Fulfilled:

No regulatory action required.
