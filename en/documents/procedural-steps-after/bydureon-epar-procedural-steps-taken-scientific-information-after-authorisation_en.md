1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

| II/0050            | Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC based on the final CSR of study EXSCEL (EXenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering; 'A randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes after treatment with exenatide once weekly in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ') in fulfilment of LEG 009. In addition, RMP version 31 has been submitted as part of this application. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 20/09/2018 | 23/09/2019 | SmPC | The SmPC section 5.1 has been updated as follows: EXSCEL was a pragmatic cardiovascular (CV) outcome study in patients with type 2 diabetes and any level of CV risk. A total of 14,752 patients were randomised 1:1 to either prolonged release exenatide 2 mg once weekly or placebo, added to the current usual care which could include SGLT2 inhibitors. Patients were followed as in routine clinical practice for a median of 38.7 months with a median treatment duration of 27.8 months. The primary safety (noninferiority) and efficacy (superiority) endpoint in EXSCEL was the time to first confirmed Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE): cardiovascular (CV) related death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or nonfatal stroke. All-cause mortality was the initial secondary endpoint assessed. Prolonged release exenatide did not increase the cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to placebo when added to current usual care (HR:0.91; 95% CI: 0.832, 1.004; P<0.001 for non- inferiority). The study, however, failed to show a statistically significant benefit with exenatide treatment with regards to CV events or CV-related death. The need for additional antihyperglycaemic medication was reduced by 33% with the prolonged-release exenatide group (exposure-adjusted incidence of 10.5 per 100 pt- year) compared to the placebo group (exposure-adjusted |

| II/0004/G   | This was an application for a group of variations. Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 in order to include post-marketing experience of 'anaphylactic reactions, rash, pruritus, urticaria and angioedema', as a result of the assessment of PSUR 13, to update the SmPC with regard to pancreatitis reporting and to address a number of other minor editorial changes in these sections. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update annex II in line with the latest QRD template version 8.3. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   | 21/03/2013   | 26/07/2013   | SmPC, Annex II and PL   | The scope of these type II variations was to update section 4.8 of the SmPC regarding Bydureon post-marketing experience of 'anaphylactic reactions, rash, pruritus, urticaria and angioedema', which was requested as a result of the assessment of PSUR 13. Furthermore, the scope was to make the Bydureon SmPC consistent with the Byetta SmPC with respect to pancreatitis reporting and consequent revision of the frequency category in section 4.8 (table 2) of the SmPC for Bydureon. Additionally, a number of other minor editorial changes were proposed in section 4.8 (table 1) and 5.1 (table 4 and table 5). The MAH implemented frequency categories or the additional category 'not known' for 'anaphylactic reactions' , 'rash', 'pruritus', 'urticaria' and 'angioedema' and moved the information from table 2 (reflecting experience from Byetta) to table 1 (reflecting experience from Bydureon) in section 4.8 of the SmPC and changed the lay-out of table 1 and table 2 according to the lay-out of table 1 of Byetta. In order to assign consistency between Byetta and Bydureon, the MAH proposed to change the frequency category for 'acute pancreatitis' in table 2 for Bydureon (reflecting experience from Byetta) in section 4.8 from 'uncommon' to 'rare' to be consistent with Byetta, on which the experience with acute pancreatitis with exenatide is based on, which was accepted by the CHMP. Further minor editorial changes proposed by the MAH in section 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC were endorsed by the CHMP. The benefit-risk for Bydureon remains favourable.   |
