Additionally correction is introduced in section 5.1 of the SmPC in relation to the biopsies data collection. Recipients of Glybera may display a rise in serum creatine kinase activity that becomes evident about 2 weeks after administration, peaks at around 8 weeks and then returns to baseline by week 26. One patient developed myoglobinuria in association with raised serum creatine kinase activity. Muscle biopsies obtained up to 52 weeks after administration of Glybera show an infiltrate of lymphocytes and macrophages. The long term consequences of this cellular infiltration are not known. The new ADRs 'acute myositis and chronic myositis' and 'elevations in serum creatine kinase activity' have been added to SmPC section 4.8 accordingly. authorised   |
