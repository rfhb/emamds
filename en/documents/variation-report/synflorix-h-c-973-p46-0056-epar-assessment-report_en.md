## I. Introduction

On August 8, 2014, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Synflorix, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## II. Scientific discussion

## Information on the development program

The MAH stated that study Malaria-063 is a stand-alone study. The main objective of the study was to compare  immune  responses  to  the  hepatitis  B  component  of  an  experimental  hepatitis  B+  malaria (RTS,S/AS01E) vaccine, and compare the antibody levels to that of Engerix-B.

It should be noted that Engerix-B, Rotarix, Infanrix/Hib and Polio Sabin are also administered in the study.  Article  46  applications  for  these  concerned  vaccines  have  been  sent  in  parallel  to  relevant authorities.

## Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The commercially available formulation of Synflorix was used in the study.

## Clinical aspects

## Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- MALARIA-063, Phase III randomized, open, controlled study to evaluate the immune response to  the  hepatitis  B  antigen  of  the  RTS,S/AS01E  candidate  vaccine,  when  administered  as  primary vaccination integrated into an EPI regimen to infants living in sub-Saharan Africa

## Clinical study

MALARIA-063,  Phase  III  randomized,  open,  controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  immune response to the hepatitis B antigen of the RTS,S/AS01E candidate vaccine,  when administered as primary vaccination integrated into an EPI regimen to infants living in subSaharan Africa

## Description

This was a phase III, multi-center, open, randomized, controlled trial with 11 study groups. Synflorix was one of the vaccines that were co-administered with the experimental vaccine  RTS,S/AS01E.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Objectives

## Primary:

## Immunogenicity

To  demonstrate  in  terms  of  antibody  response  to  the  HBs  antigen  (HBsAg),  the  non-inferiority  of RTS,S/AS01E to a primary vaccination regimen of a licensed hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B) integrated into an Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) regimen.

Criteria  for  non-inferiority:  one  month  post  Dose  3,  upper  limit  (UL)  of  the 2-sided  95%  confidence interval  (CI)  on  the  difference  in  percent  seroprotection  below  5%  between  recipients  of  licensed hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B) and recipients of RTS,S/AS01E vaccine.

## Secondary:

Immunogenicity

- To  demonstrate  the  non-inferiority  of  antibody  responses  to  the  pneumococcal  conjugate vaccine when co-administered with versus without RTS,S/AS01E as part of an EPI regimen.

Criteria for non-inferiority: one month post Dose 3, UL of the 2-sided 95%CI on the geometric mean  concentration  (GMC)  ratios  of  10  pneumococcal  serotypes  concentrations  (measured with  an  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  [ELISA]  test),  is  below  a  limit  of  2  for  the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when co-administered with versus without RTS,S/AS01E.

- To describe the antibody responses to the 10 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C,  19F  and  23F),  measured  by  ELISA  and  opsonophagocytic  assay  (OPA),  when  the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is co-administered with and without RTS,S/AS01E as part of an EPI regimen.
- To  describe  the  antibody  response  to  the  Protein  D  (PD)  component  of  the  pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when co-administered with versus without RTS,S/AS01E as part of an EPI regimen.

A  number  of  other  objectives  were  also  included  in  the  study,  but  as  these  were  not  related  to Synflorix they will not be assessed within this procedure.

## Safety

- Evaluation of  the  safety  profile  of  the  RTS,S/AS01E  candidate  malaria  vaccine,  when coadministered with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or a rotavirus vaccine integrated into an EPI regimen.

## Study design

Subjects were randomized into 11 study groups in a 1:1:1 : 1:1:1 : 1:1:1 : 3 : 3 ratio (this means five treatment groups of which the three RTS,S/AS01E groups were randomized to receive three different lots).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Blood sampling:

- Groups RERo[P], RE[RoP] and HERo[P] will have a total of seven blood samples taken: at Visit 1 (screening) and Visit 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 (post Dose 3 of RTS,S/AS01E or Engerix-B).
- Groups REP[Ro] and HEP[Ro] will have a total of 8 blood samples taken: at Visit 1 (screening) and Visit 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 (post Dose 3 of RTS,S/AS01E or Engerix-B).
- Blood for safety evaluation was collected at screening (Visit 1) to ensure healthy children were recruited.

## Study population /Sample size

Male or female infants between 8 and 12 weeks of age at the time of first vaccination free of obvious health  problems  as  established  by  medical  history  and  clinical  examination  before  entering  into  the study, who were born to a mother seronegative for HBsAg and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and  for  whom  the  investigator  believed  that  the  parents/Legally  acceptable  representatives  (LARs) would comply with the requirements of the protocol. Results of laboratory screening tests for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, hemoglobin, platelets count and total white cell count had to be within  pre-defined  limits.  Subjects  should  not  have  received  previous  vaccination  with  diphtheria tetanus, B. pertussis (whole-cell or acellular), Haemophilus  influenzae type B, Streptococcus pneumoniae , hepatitis B vaccine or rotavirus vaccine. Signed or thumb-printed informed consent was obtained from the parents/LARs of each subject.

A total of 705 subjects (141 per treatment group) were planned to be enrolled in order to have at least 600 evaluable subjects (approximately 120 subjects in each treatment group).

## Treatments

Study vaccine:  A candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01E. Vaccination schedule /site: 0, 1, 2-month schedule; children 8-12 weeks of age at first vaccination received intramuscular (IM) vaccinations into the left anterolateral thigh.

Reference vaccine/ Comparator, dose and mode of administration.

Hepatitis B vaccine: Engerix-B. 0, 1, 2-month schedule + booster at Month 50; infants 8-12 weeks of age at first vaccination received IM vaccinations into the left anterolateral thigh.

DTPaHib vaccine: Infanrix/Hib. 0, 1, 2-month schedule + booster at Month 16; infants 8-12 weeks of age at first vaccination received IM vaccinations into the right deltoid.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SAEs  from  the  time  of  first  vaccination  until  8  month  post  Dose  1  (Visit  9)  of  RTS,S/AS01E  or  a licensed hepatitis B vaccine.

Fatal SAEs from study start until study end*.

Potential Immune-mediated disorders (pIMDs) from study start until study end*.

* The current report presents fatal SAEs and pIMDs reported between study start and Month 8. Longer follow-up will be reported in annex study reports.

## Statistical Methods

Antibodies against pneumococcal conjugate vaccine antigens: non-inferiority of pneumococcal antigens responses

The  95%  CI  of  the  antibody  GMC  ratio  (HEP[Ro]  over  REP[Ro])  was  calculated  for  each  of  the  10 serotypes (ELISA) one month post Dose 3 of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. If the UL of this CI was below 2, non-inferiority was concluded.

When  a  licensed  hepatitis  B  vaccine  was  co-administered  with  a  pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and EPI vaccines (HEP[Ro]), the incidence of swelling was 3.6% and when  co-administered  with  a  rotavirus  vaccine  and  EPI  vaccines  (HERo[P]),  the incidence of swelling was 0.8%. No Grade 3 swelling was reported in all groups.
- Over a 7-day follow-up period (day of vaccination and 6 subsequent days) after each vaccine dose the solicited general symptoms with highest incidence overall doses were:
- o temperature (26.4%) and irritability/fussiness (7.8%) in REP[Ro] group.
- o temperature (13.7%) and irritability/fussiness (5.3%) in RERo[P] group.
- o temperature (14.2%) and irritability/fussiness (7.8%) in RE[RoP] group.
- o temperature (13.9%) and irritability/fussiness (5.9%) in HEP[Ro] group.
- o temperature (7.8%) and irritability/fussiness (1.6%) in HERo[P] group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All  other  solicited  general  symptoms  (drowsiness  and  loss  of  appetite)  were  reported  after ≤2.4% of vaccine dose.

- Grade 3 temperature (axillary temperature &gt; 39.0°C) was reported after 1.2% of doses in the REP[Ro] group, 0.7% of doses in the RE[RoP] group, 0.2% of doses in the HEP[Ro] group and 1.0%  of  doses  in  the  HERo[P]  group.  No  other  Grade  3  solicited  general  symptoms  were reported.
- Over a 7-day follow-up period (day of vaccination and 6 subsequent days) after each vaccine dose,  the  solicited  general  symptoms  related  to  vaccination  with  highest  incidence  overall doses were:
- o temperature (20.0%) and irritability/fussiness (3.3%) in REP[Ro] group.

- o temperature (9.7%) and irritability/fussiness (2.6%) in RE[RoP] group.
- o temperature (9.7%) and irritability/fussiness (1.7%) in HEP[Ro] group.
- o temperature (5.5%) and irritability/fussiness (0.5%) in HERo[P] group.

All  other  solicited  general  symptoms  related  to  vaccination  were  reported  after  ≤0.5%  of vaccine dose.

- Over  a  30-day  follow-up  period  (day  of  vaccination  and  29  subsequent  days),  at  least  one unsolicited AE was reported by 85.2%, 81.0% and 85.1% in REP[Ro], RERo[P] and RE[RoP] groups  and  85.1%  and  75.5%  in  HEP[Ro]  and  HERo[P]  groups.  Malaria,  gastroenteritis, bronchitis, rhinitis, and pharyngitis were the most frequently reported unsolicited AE in each groups.
- The percentage of subjects reporting at least one Grade 3 unsolicited AE within 30 days post vaccination was 0.7%, 1.4% and 1.4% in REP[Ro], RERo[P] and RE[RoP] groups and 0.7% and 1.4% in HEP[Ro] and HERo[P] groups. Bronchopneumonia and gastroenteritis and were the most frequently reported Grade 3 unsolicited AEs (3 and 2 subjects respectively).
- The percentage of subjects reporting at least one unsolicited AE related to vaccination within 30 days post vaccination was 0.7%, 0.7% and 3.5% in REP[Ro], RERo[P] and RE[RoP] groups and 2.1% and 4.3% in HEP[Ro] and HERo[P] groups. Pyrexia was the most frequently reported unsolicited  AEs  related  to  vaccination  in  each  groups  (1  subject  in  REP[Ro]  and  RERo[P] groups, 5 subjects in RE[RoP] group, 3 subjects in HEP[Ro] group and 6 subjects in HERo[P] group).
- From Dose 1 until 8 months post Dose 1 (Visit 9), the percentage of subjects reporting at least one SAE was 0.7%, 4.9% and 5.0% in REP[Ro], RERo[P] and RE[RoP] groups and 2.1% and 3.6% in HEP[Ro] and HERo[P] groups. Bronchopneumonia and gastroenteritis were the most frequently reported SAEs (6 and 5 subjects respectively). None of the SAEs were judged to be related to vaccination.
- Over  a  30-day  follow-up  period  (day  of  vaccination  and  29  subsequent  days),  4  fatal  SAEs were reported in 2 subjects vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01E vaccine (1 subject in REP[Ro] and 1 subject in RE[RoP]). None of these fatal SAEs were judged to be related to vaccination.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- From  the  start  of  the  study  until  Month  8  (Visit  9),  there  were  8  fatal  SAEs  reported  in  5 subjects  vaccinated  with RTS,S/AS01E vaccine (1 subject in REP[Ro], 2 subjects in RERo[P] and 2 subjects in RE[RoP]). None of these fatal SAEs were judged to be related to vaccination.
- No potential immune mediated disorders were reported from the start of the study until Month 8 (Visit 9).

Assessor's comment: There were no new safety issues for Synflorix based on the results of this study.

## Discussion on clinical aspects

The current study was a study of an experimental malaria vaccine, and Synflorix was one of several vaccines included to study concomitant vaccination. A total of 425 subjects received at least one dose of Synflorix co-administered with the RTS,S vaccine and other vaccines and 279 subjects received at least one dose of Synflorix co-administered with Engerix-B and other vaccines. Thus, the addition of these results to the already presented extensive amount of data does not impact the benefit risk of Synflorix. The immune responses did not cause concern of lack of efficacy, and the safety dada did not give rise to new safety concerns. No further regulatory action is considered necessary.
