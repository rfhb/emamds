Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to include a warning on psychogenic syncope based on the available safety data. The PL was proposed to be updated in accordance. In addition, the company took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the PL of Pumarix, Ambirix, Pandemrix, Pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Prepandrix and Fendrix. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 17/11/2011 | 19/12/2011 | SmPC and PL | Based on a review of literature and a search in the global safety database performed by the MAH, the CHMP recommended including a wording on psychogenic syncope to the product information of the MAH injectable vaccines. The literature review showed an incidence peak occurred around the age of 15 years, with females having more than twice the incidence of males. The syncope reports with secondary injuries were reported most frequently in children and adolescents. Given that psychogenic syncope is not a true side effect, it was not considered appropriate to include syncope as an undesirable effect in section 4.8 of the SmPC. However, as such events can result in injury, and may not have occurred in the absence of the vaccination, the CHMP recommended to add a reference to such events in section 4.4 'Warning and Precaution' of the SmPC and in the PL. |
