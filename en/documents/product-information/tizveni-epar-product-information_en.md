## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Patient Card

Patients treated with Tizveni must be given the Patient Card to be informed about the risks of immunerelated adverse reactions during Tizveni therapy (see also Package Leaflet).

The prescriber must discuss the risks of immune-related adverse reactions during Tizveni therapy with the patient. Immune-related adverse reactions Immune-related adverse reactions have been reported, including fatal cases, during treatment with tislelizumab (see section 4.8). The majority of these events improved with interruption of tislelizumab, administration of corticosteroids and/or supportive care. Immune-related adverse reactions have also been reported after the last dose of tislelizumab. Immune-related adverse reactions affecting more than one body system can occur simultaneously. For suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation to confirm aetiology or exclude alternative aetiologies, including infection, should be ensured. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, tislelizumab should be withheld and corticosteroids administered (see section 4.2). Based on limited data from clinical studies, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid use (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Upon improvement to grade ≤1, corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month. Immune-related pneumonitis Immune-related pneumonitis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients receiving tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Patients with suspected pneumonitis should be evaluated with radiographic imaging and infectious or diseaserelated aetiologies should be ruled out. Patients with immune-related pneumonitis should be managed according to the treatment modifications as recommended in Table 1 (see section 4.2). Immune-related hepatitis Immune-related hepatitis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatitis and changes in liver function. Liver function tests should be performed at baseline and periodically during treatment. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Patients with immune-related hepatitis should be managed according to the treatment modifications as recommended in Table 1 (see section 4.2).

## Immune-related skin reactions

Immune-related skin rash or dermatitis have been reported in patients receiving tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for suspected skin reactions and other causes should be excluded. Based on the severity of the skin adverse reactions, tislelizumab should be withheld or permanently discontinued as recommended in Table 1 (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) have been reported in patients receiving tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for signs or symptoms of SCARs (e.g., a prodrome of fever, flu-like symptoms, mucosal lesions or progressive skin rash) and other causes should be excluded. For suspected SCARs (including severe erythema multiforme [EM], SJS or TEN), tislelizumab should be withheld and the patient should be referred to specialised care for assessment and treatment. If SCARs, including SJS or TEN, is confirmed, tislelizumab should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2).

## Immune-related colitis

Immune-related colitis, frequently associated with diarrhoea, has been reported in patients treated with tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis. Infectious and diseaserelated aetiologies should be ruled out.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, has been reported in patients treated with tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for hyperglycaemia and other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Insulin should be administered for type 1 diabetes. In patients with severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis (grade ≥3), tislelizumab should be withheld and anti-hyperglycaemic treatment should be administered (see section 4.2). Treatment with tislelizumab may be resumed when metabolic control is achieved.

Patients with immune-related colitis should be managed according to the treatment modifications as recommended in Table 1 (see section 4.2). Immune-related endocrinopathies Immune-related endocrinopathies, including thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis and type 1 diabetes mellitus, have been reported in patients treated with tislelizumab. These may require supportive treatment depending on the specific endocrine disorder. Long-term hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may be necessary in cases of immune-related endocrinopathies. Patients with immune-related endocrinopathies should be managed according to the treatment modifications as recommended in Table 1 (see section 4.2). Thyroid disorders Thyroid disorders, including thyroiditis, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, have been reported in patients treated with tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) for changes in thyroid function and clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Hypothyroidism may be managed with HRT without treatment interruption and without corticosteroids. Hyperthyroidism may be managed symptomatically (see section 4.2). Adrenal insufficiency Adrenal insufficiency has been reported in patients treated with tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring of adrenal function and hormone levels should be considered. Corticosteroids and HRT should be administered as clinically indicated (see section 4.2). Hypophysitis Hypophysitis has been reported in patients treated with tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis/hypopituitarism. Monitoring of pituitary function and hormone levels should be considered. Corticosteroids and HRT should be administered as clinically indicated (see section 4.2). Type 1 diabetes mellitus Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Immune-related nephritis with renal dysfunction

Immune-related nephritis with renal dysfunction has been reported in patients treated with tislelizumab. Patients should be monitored for changes in renal function (elevated serum creatinine), and other causes of renal dysfunction should be excluded.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients with immune-related nephritis with renal dysfunction should be managed according to the treatment modifications as recommended in Table 1 (see section 4.2).

## Other immune-related adverse reactions

Other clinically important immune-related adverse reactions were reported with tislelizumab: myositis, myocarditis, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, pericarditis and Guillain-Barré syndrome (see section 4.8).

Patients with other immune-related adverse reactions should be managed according to the treatment modifications as recommended in Table 1 (see section 4.2).

Solid organ transplant rejection Solid organ transplant rejection has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Treatment with tislelizumab may increase the risk of rejection in solid organ transplant recipients. The benefit of treatment with tislelizumab versus the risk of possible organ rejection should be considered in these patients. Infusion-related reactions Severe infusion-related reactions (grade 3 or higher) have been reported in patients receiving tislelizumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusionrelated reactions. Infusion-related reactions should be managed as recommended in Table 1 (see section 4.2). Patients excluded from clinical studies Patients with any of the following conditions were excluded from clinical studies: baseline ECOG performance score greater than or equal to 2; active brain or leptomeningeal metastases; active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that may relapse; any condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressants within the 14 days prior to study treatment; active or untreated HIV; untreated hepatitis B or hepatitis C carriers; history of interstitial lung disease; administration of live vaccine within the 14 days prior to study treatment; infection requiring systemic therapy within the 14 days prior to study treatment; history of severe hypersensitivity to another monoclonal antibody. In the absence of data, tislelizumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. Patients on controlled sodium diet Each ml of this medicinal product contains 0.069 mmol (or 1.6 mg) sodium. This medicinal product contains 16 mg sodium per 10 ml vial, equivalent to 0.8% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Medicinal product no longer authorised

Tislelizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody, cleared from the circulation through catabolism. As such, formal pharmacokinetic interaction studies have not been conducted. As monoclonal antibodies are not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or other drug-metabolising enzymes, inhibition or induction of these enzymes by co-administered medicinal products is not anticipated to affect the pharmacokinetics of tislelizumab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The use of systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants at baseline, before starting tislelizumab, except for physiological doses of systemic corticosteroid (10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), should be avoided because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy. However, systemic corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants can be used after starting tislelizumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions (see section 4.4). Corticosteroids can also be used as pre-medication when tislelizumab is used in combination with chemotherapy, as antiemetic prophylaxis and/or to alleviate chemotherapy-related adverse reactions.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/Contraception

Tislelizumab should not be used in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with tislelizumab. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception (methods that result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) during treatment and for at least 4 months following the last dose of tislelizumab. Pregnancy There are no available data on the use of tislelizumab in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, tislelizumab can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with tislelizumab. However, in murine models of pregnancy, blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 signalling has been shown to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and to result in increased foetal loss. Human IgG4 (immunoglobulins) are known to cross the placental barrier. Therefore, tislelizumab, being an IgG4 variant, has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. Women should be advised of the potential risk to a foetus. Tislelizumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with tislelizumab. Breast-feeding It is unknown whether tislelizumab is excreted in human milk. Its effects on breast-fed newborns/infants and on milk production are also unknown. Because of the potential for serious adverse drug reactions in breast-fed newborns/infants from Tizveni, women should be advised not to breast-feed during treatment and for at least 4 months after the last dose of Tizveni. Fertility Medicinal product no longer authorised

No clinical data are available on the possible effects of tislelizumab on fertility. No reproductive and development toxicity studies have been conducted with tislelizumab. Based on a 3-month repeat-dose toxicity study, there were no notable effects in the male and female reproductive organs in cynomolgus monkeys when tislelizumab was given at doses of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 13 weeks (7 dose administrations) (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Tizveni has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In some patients, fatigue has been reported following administration of tislelizumab (see section 4.8).

## Immunogenicity

Of 1 916 antidrug antibodies (ADA)-evaluable patients treated at the recommended dose of 200 mg once every 3 weeks, 18.3% of patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADA, and neutralising antibodies (NAbs) were detected in 0.9% of patients. Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that ADA status was a statistically significant covariate on clearance; however, the presence of treatmentemergent ADA against tislelizumab appears to have no clinically relevant impact on pharmacokinetics or efficacy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Among ADA-evaluable patients, the following rates of adverse events (AEs) have been observed for the ADA-positive population compared to the ADA-negative population, respectively: grade ≥3 AEs 50.9% vs. 39.3%, serious adverse e vents (SAEs) 37.1% vs. 29.7%, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation 10.8% vs . 10.2% : (for monotherapy); grade ≥ 3 AEs 85.6% vs. 78.2%, SAEs 45.9% vs. 38.2%, AEs leading to treatment withdrawal 13.5% vs . 13.3% (for combination therapy) . Patients who developed treatment-emergent ADAs tended to have overall poorer health and disease characteristics at baseline which can confound the interpretation of the safety analysis. Available data do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn on possible patterns of adverse drug reactions.

## Elderly

No overall differences in safety were observed with tislelizumab monotherapy between patients aged &lt;65 years and patients aged between 65 and 74 years. Data for patients aged 75 years and above are too limited to draw conclusions on this population.

BGB-A317-304 was a randomised, open-label, multicentre phase III study to investigate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab in combination with platinum-pemetrexed versus platinum-pemetrexed alone as first-line treatment for chemotherapy-naïve patients with locally advanced non-squamous NSCLC who were not candidates for surgical resection or platinum-based chemoradiation, or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose There is no information on overdose with tislelizumab. In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse drug reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, ATC code: L01FF09 Mechanism of action Tislelizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) variant monoclonal antibody against PD-1, binding to the extracellular domain of human PD-1. It competitively blocks the binding of both PD-L1 and PD-L2, inhibiting PD-1-mediated negative signalling and enhancing the functional activity in T cells in in vitro cell-based assays.

A total of 334 patients were randomised (2:1) to receive tislelizumab 200 mg combined with pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2  and carboplatin AUC 5 mg/ml/min or cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 (T+PP arm, n = 223) or pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2  and carboplatin AUC 5 mg/ml/min or cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 (PP arm, n = 111). The choice of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) was at the investigator's discretion.

The treatment was administered on a 3-week cycle. After the administration of 4, 5 or 6 cycles of chemotherapy or tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy at the investigator's discretion, patients in the T+PP arm received tislelizumab 200 mg combined with pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2  on a 3-week cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity; patients in the PP arm received pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2  alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, and those with disease progression confirmed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) were given the option to cross over to receive tislelizumab monotherapy on a 3-week cycle.

Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression in tumour cells (TC) (&lt;1% v ersu s 1% to 49% versu s ≥50%) and disease stage (IIIB v ersus IV), as classified according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), 7th edition of Cancer Staging Manual. PD-L1 expression was evaluated at a central laboratory using the Ventana PD-L1 (SP263) assay that identified PD-L1 staining on tumour cells. Tumour assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 6 months, then every 9 weeks for the second 6 months, then every 12 weeks. The baseline characteristics for patients in study BGB-A317-304  were: median age 61 years (range: 25 to 75), 29 % age 65 years or older; 74 % male; 100% Asian (all enrolled in China); 23.4 % with ECOG PS of 0 and 76.6 % with ECOG PS of 1; 18.3 % with disease stage IIIB; 26.6 % with unknown status for ALK rearrangement and 73.4 % with negative ALK rearrangement; 36.2 % never -smokers; 5.4 % with brain metastases. The characteristics of age, sex, ECOG PS, stage, smoking status, PD-L1 TC score and prior anticancer treatments were balanced between the treatment arms. The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 by IRC in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The secondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) per IRC and per investigator. The study met its primary endpoint at the interim analysis (data cut-off date of 23-Jan-2020 and a median duration of study follow-up of 9.8 months), showing a statistically significant improvement in PFS with T+PP compared with PP. The stratified hazard ratio was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.91; p = 0.0054) with a median PFS of 9.7 months with T+PP and 7.6 months with PP. The efficacy results of the final analysis (data cut-off date of 26-Oct-2020 and a median duration of study follow-up of 16.1 months) were consistent with those of the interim analysis. Amongst the 334 patients in study BGB-A317-304, 110 (33%) patients had tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥50% . Of these, 74 patients were in the tislelizumab plus chemotherapy group and 36 patients were in the placebo plus chemotherapy group. Efficacy results of the patients with tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥50% from the final analysis are shown in Table 3 and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS and OS is presented in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.

First-line treatment of squamous NSCLC: BGB-A317-307 BGB-A317-307 was a randomised, open-label, multicentre phase III study to compare the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab in combination with paclitaxel plus carboplatin or nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin with that of paclitaxel plus carboplatin alone as first-line treatment for chemotherapy-naïve patients with locally advanced squamous NSCLC who were not candidates for surgical resection or platinum-based chemoradiation or metastatic squamous NSCLC. The study excluded patients with active brain or leptomeningeal metastases, known EGFR mutations or ALK translocations sensitive to available targeted inhibitor therapy, active autoimmune disease, or any condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily of prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive treatments. A total of 360 patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive tislelizumab 200 mg combined with paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 and carboplatin AUC 5 mg/ml/min (T+PC arm, n = 120), or tislelizumab 200 mg combined with nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m 2  and carboplatin AUC 5 mg/ml/min (T+nPC arm, n = 119), or paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 and carboplatin AUC 5 mg/ml/min (PC arm, n = 121). The treatment was administered on a 3-week cycle, until the patient completed administration of 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy or tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy at the investigator's discretion. Patients in the T+nPC and T+PC arms received tislelizumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in the PC arm with disease progression were given the option to cross over to receive tislelizumab monotherapy on a 3-week cycle. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression in tumour cells (TC) (&lt;1% versus 1% to 49% versus ≥50% ) and tumour staging (IIIB versus IV), as classified according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), 7th edition of Cancer Staging Manual.

The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by IRC per RECIST v1.1 in the ITT analysis which was to be tested sequentially in arms T+PC versus PC and arms T+nPC versus PC. The secondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) per IRC and per investigator.

The study met its primary endpoint at the interim analysis (data cut-off date of 06-Dec-2019 and a median duration of study follow-up of 8.4 months), showing statistically significant improvements in PFS with tislelizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin (T+PC arm) and tislelizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin (T+nPC arm) compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (PC arm). The stratified HR (T+PC arm versus PC arm) was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.69; p &lt;0.0001). The stratified HR (T+nPC arm versus PC arm) was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.64; p &lt;0.0001). Median PFS was 7.6 months in the T+PC arm, 7.6 months in the T+nPC arm and 5.4 months in the PC arm.

## Second-line treatment of NSCLC: BGB-A317-303

BGB-A317-303 was a randomised, open-label, multicentre phase III study to investigate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab compared with docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (squamous or non-squamous), who had experienced disease progression on or after a prior platinum-based regimen.

The study excluded patients with known EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement, prior PD-(L)1 inhibitor or CTLA-4 inhibitor treatment, active autoimmune disease, or any condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily of prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive treatments.

A total of 805 patients were randomised (2:1) ratio to receive tislelizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks (n = 535) or docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n = 270). Randomisation was stratified by histology (squamous versus non-squamous), lines of therapy (second- versus third-line), and PD-L1 expression in tumour cells (TC) (≥25% versus &lt;25%). Administration o f docetaxel and tislelizumab continued until disease progression, as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1, or unacceptable toxicity. PD-L1 expression was evaluated at a central laboratory using the Ventana PDL1 (SP263) assay that identified PD-L1 staining on tumour cells. Tumour assessments were conducted every 9 weeks for 52 weeks after randomisation and continued every 12 weeks thereafter. Survival status was followed every 3 months after discontinuation of the study treatment. The baseline characteristics for the study population were: median age 61 years (range: 28 to 88), 32.4 % age 65 years or older, 3.2 % age 75 years or older; 77.3 % male; 17 .0 % White and 79.9 % Asian; 20.6 % with ECOG PS of 0 and 79.4 % with ECOG PS of 1; 85.5 % with metastatic disease; 30.3 % never-smokers; 46.0 % with squamous and 54.0 % non-squamous histology; 65.8 % with wild -type and 34 % with unknown EGFR status; 46.1 % with wild -type and 53.9 % with unknown ALK status; 7.1 % with previously treated brain metastases. 57.0 % of the patients had a PD-L1 TC score &lt; 25% and 42.5 % had a PD-L1 TC score ≥25%. All patients had received prior therapy with a platinum-doublet regimen: 84.7% patients received one prior therapy, 15.3 % had received two prior therapies. The dual-primary efficacy endpoints were OS in the ITT and PD-L1 TC score ≥25% analysis sets. Additional efficacy endpoints included investigator-assessed PFS, ORR and DoR. BGB-A317-303 met both dual-primary endpoints of OS in the ITT analysis and PDL1 ≥25% analysis sets. At the prespecified interim analysis (data cut-off date 10-Aug-2020 with a median duration of follow-up time of 11.7 months), a statistically significant improvement in OS was observed in the ITT population. Results favoured the tislelizumab arm (HR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.78; p &lt; 0.0001). Median OS was 17.2 months for the tislelizumab arm and 11.9 months for the docetaxel arm. At the final analysis (data cutoff date 15-Jul-2021 with a median duration of follow-up of 14.2 months), a statistically significant improvement in OS was observed in the PDL1 ≥25% analysis set favouring the tislelizumab arm (stratified HR = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.70 ; p &lt; 0.0001) with median OS being 19.3 months for the tislelizumab arm and 11.5 months for the docetaxel arm.

The final analysis (data cut-off date 15-Jul-2021 and a median duration of follow-up of 14.2 months) showed consistent efficacy results in the ITT population compared to the interim analysis.

a Hazard ratio and its 95% CI w ere estimated from unstratified Cox model. Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with tislelizumab in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of malignant neoplasms (except central nervous system, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetics (PK) of tislelizumab were assessed for Tizveni both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. The PK of tislelizumab were characterised using population PK analysis with concentration data from 2 596 patients with advanced malignancies who received tislelizumab doses of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg every 3 weeks, and 200 mg every 3 weeks. The time to reach 90% steady -state level is approximately 84 days (12 weeks) after 200 mg doses once every 3 weeks, and the steady-state accumulation ratio of tislelizumab PK exposure is approximately 2-fold. Absorption Tislelizumab is administered intravenously and therefore is immediately and completely bioavailable. Distribution A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that the steady-state volume of distribution is 6.42 l, which is typical of monoclonal antibodies with limited distribution.

Tislelizumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways.

## Elimination

Based on population PK analysis, the clearance of tislelizumab was 0.153 l/day with an interindividual variability of 26.3% and the geometrical mean terminal half -life was approximately 23.8 days with a coefficient variation (CV) of 31%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Linearity/non-linearity

At the dosing regimens of 0.5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg once every 2 or 3 weeks (including 200 mg once every 3 weeks), the PK of tislelizumab were observed to be linear and the exposure was dose proportional.

## Special populations

The effects of various covariates on tislelizumab PK were assessed in population PK analyses. The following factors had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of tislelizumab: age (range 18 to 90 years), weight (range 32 to 130 kg), gender, race (White, Asian and other), mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLCr] ≥30 ml/min), mild to moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤3 times ULN and any AST), and tumour burden.

Renal impairment No dedicated studies of tislelizumab have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. In the population PK analyses of tislelizumab, no clinically relevant differences in the clearance of tislelizumab were found between patients with mild renal impairment (CLCr 60 to 89 ml/min, n = 1 046) or moderate renal impairment (CLCr 30 to 59 ml/min, n = 320) and patients with normal renal function (CLCr ≥90 ml/min, n = 1 223). Mild and moderate renal impairment had no effect on the exposure of tislelizumab (see section 4.2). Based on the limited number of patients with severe renal impairment (n = 5), the effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tislelizumab is not conclusive. Hepatic impairment No dedicated studies of tislelizumab have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. In the population PK analyses of tislelizumab, no clinically relevant differences in the clearance of tislelizumab were found between patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST &gt;ULN or bilirubin &gt;1.0 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST, n = 396) or moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin &gt;1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST; n = 12), compared to patients with normal hepatic function (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST = ULN, n = 2 182) (see section 4.2). Based on the limited number of patients with severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin &gt;3 x ULN and any AST, n = 2), the effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tislelizumab is unknown. 5.3 Preclinical safety data In repeat-dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys with intravenous dose administration at doses of 3, 10, 30 or 60 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 13 weeks (7 dose administrations), no apparent treatment-related toxicity or histopathological changes were observed at doses up to 30 mg/kg every 2 weeks, corresponding to 4.3 to 6.6 times the exposure in humans with the clinical dose of 200 mg. No developmental and reproductive toxicity studies or animal fertility studies have been conducted with tislelizumab. No studies have been performed to assess the potential of tislelizumab for carcinogenicity or genotoxicity. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Package leaflet: Information for the patient

## Tizveni 100 mg concentrate for solution for infusion tislelizumab

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important information for you.

-Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. -It is important that you keep the Patient Card with you during treatment. -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. -If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Tizveni is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you are given Tizveni 3. How Tizveni is given 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Tizveni 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Tizveni is and what it is used for Tizveni is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance tislelizumab. It is a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein that is designed to recognise and attach to a specific target in the body called programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) which is found on the surface of T and B cells (types of white blood cells that form part of the immune system, the body's natural defences). When PD-1 is activated by cancer cells it can switch off the activity of T cells. By blocking PD-1, Tizveni prevents it from switching off your T cells which helps your immune system fight the cancer. Tizveni is used in adults to treat: · non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, has not already been treated with chemotherapy and cannot be removed by surgery. When used to treat this type of cancer, Tizveni is given in combination with chemotherapy. · non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and has already been treated with chemotherapy. When used to treat this type of cancer, Tizveni is given alone. If you have any questions about how Tizveni works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, ask your doctor. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Tizveni may be given in combination with other anti-cancer medicines. It is important that you also read the package leaflet for these other medicines. If you have any questions about these medicines, ask your doctor.
