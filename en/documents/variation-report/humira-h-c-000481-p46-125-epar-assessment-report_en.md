## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report(s) for:

## · P18-835 -Special drug use-results survey of evaluating safety and effectiveness of Humira in long term treatment in patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa

Humira® (adalimumab) was approved for the treatment of HS in Japan in February 2019. Study P18-835 was conducted based on the GPSP Ordinance (Good Post-marketing Study Practice; Ministerial Ordinance No. 171 of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare dated December 20, 2004). Due to a limited number of Japanese patients (15 patients) in the Phase 3 clinical study of Humira® in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (M15-537), the present study was conducted to evaluate safety and effectiveness of Humira® in long-term treatment in Japanese patients.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

P18-835 -Special drug use-results survey of evaluating safety and effectiveness of Humira in long term treatment in patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Description

## Methods

This was a prospective, non-randomized, unblinded, non-comparative, non-interventional, multi centre Post-Marketing Observational Study (PMOS).

The PMOS was conducted in accordance with Good Post-marketing Study Practice (GPSP), ministerial ordinance of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan. The ordinance requires that new drugs be confirmed as safe and effective in daily medical practice.

No diagnostic or monitoring procedures were performed in this study other than what would be considered standard of care.  The treatment period was aligned with the approved Japan label for Humira® and only data from evaluations conducted routinely as part of daily practice were collected.

To minimize selection bias (e.g., prior medications, prior therapies) which is common practice in PMOS per Japanese regulation, patients who were newly prescribed Humira® for treatment of HS by their physician based on routine clinical practice were included in the study.  Patients who had been treated previously with Humira® were excluded.  The observational period of the study was 52 weeks from the start of Humira® treatment.  None of the study medication prescribed in this study was provided by AbbVie.

## Study participants

A total of 80 patients were planned and 84 patients were enrolled in this study from 65 registered survey sites. One patient was excluded from the safety analysis set due to withdrawal of consent.  A total of 83 patients were evaluated for safety and all were included in the effectiveness analysis set.

## Treatments

Humira® was administered as a subcutaneous injection to adult and pediatric patients according to the dosing schedule shown in Table 1.  For adult patients, the first dose of 160 mg was administered at Week 0 (Day 1) given in 1 day or split between 2 consecutive days.  The second dose of 80 mg was administered at Week 2 (Day 15).  A third dose of 40 mg was administered to 80 patients (96.4%) at Week 4 (Day 29) with subsequent doses administered weekly for the remainder of the observational period.  Three patients (3.6%) received a third dose of 80 mg at Week 4 (Day 29) with subsequent doses administered every 2 weeks for the remainder of the observational period.

As with the adult patients, pediatric patients were administered a first dose of 160 mg at Week 0 (Day 1) on the same day or split between 2 consecutive days.  The second dose of 80 mg was administered at Week 2 (Day 15) and the third dose of 40 mg was administered beginning at Week 4 (Day 29) and continued weekly for the remainder of the observational period.

## Statistical Methods

Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographics and other basic features of the data. Continuous variables were described by the number of valid cases and missing data, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables were described as the total number and percentage per category. Descriptive and exploratory statistical methods were used to analyse the data of the study. All baseline and disease characteristics were summarized for the safety population and effectiveness population. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed tests with a significance level of 0.05. If applicable, inferential statistics were performed at a nominal significance level of 0.05 (two-sided). Missing observations were documented as missing values. All data was analysed on the basis of observed cases. No sensitivity analyses have been performed.

| The performed prospective, non-randomized, unblinded, non-comparative, non-interventional, multi centre PMOS was performed in Japan in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa as a formal request by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Due to a limited number of Japanese patients in the Phase 3 clinical study of Humira® at the approval of the indication hidradenitis suppurativa, the PMOS was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy of Humira® in long-term treatment in Japanese patients. A total of 80 patients were planned and 84 patients were enrolled in this study from 65 registered survey sites. One patient was excluded from the safety analysis set due to withdrawal of consent. A total of 83 patients were evaluated for safety, and all were included in the efficacy analysis set. Humira® was dosed according to label in both adult and paediatric patients who were exposed to Humira® for the first time. Primary endpoints were incidence of serious infections, incidence of adverse drug reactions and incidence of infections. Secondary endpoints were related to clinical efficacy, change from baseline in CRP, assessment of skin pain and Quality of life. The observational period of the study was 52 weeks from the start of Humira® treatment. |

## Efficacy results

The clinical efficacy was evaluated in the study by assessment of overall improvement by the treating physician.  A total of 74 of 83 patients (89.2%) were assessed as responders based on this measure. The response rate was ≥ 89% at all time points, suggesting that the effectiveness of Humira is maintained over the long-term.  The three patients who were treated with 80 mg/week after the third dose of 40 mg were assessed as responders at Week 12 and Week 52.

An evaluation of the response rate by age category showed that 90.7% of patients (68/75) aged ≥ 15 to &lt; 65 years (which included the 4 paediatric patients aged ≥ 15 and &lt; 18 years) and 75.0% of patients (6/8) ≥ 65 years were assessed as responders.

The changes from baseline in abscess count and number of inflammatory nodules (AN count) showed statistically significant decreases (p&lt;0.0001) at all time points (Weeks 12, 24 and 52, and the final assessment).  The proportion of patients who achieved an AN count of 0, 1 or 2 (number, 95% confidence interval) was 73.3% (11/15, 44.9 ~ 92.2), 53.3% (8/15, 26.6 ~ 78.7) and 73.3% (11/15, 44.9 ~ 92.2) at 12, 24 and 52 weeks after the start of treatment, respectively.  The proportion of patients who achieved HiSCR was 86.7% (13/15, 59.5 ~ 98.3), 66.7% (10/15, 38.4 ~ 88.2), and 66.7% (10/15, 38.4 ~ 88.2) at Weeks 12, 24 and 52, respectively.  In summary, the proportion of patients who achieved an AN count of 0, 1, or 2 was maintained at approximately 50% after Week 12.  Similarly, the proportion of patients who achieved HiSCR was ≥ 50% at all time points and remained ≥ 60% after Week 24.

Changes from baseline in CRP, patient global assessment of skin pain, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 30 response rate, and DLQI score also showed statistically significant decreases at all time points (data not shown). The NRS 30 response rate was ≥ 75% at all time points.

## Safety results

A total of 39 AEs were reported by 21 patients (25.3%) and 19 ADRs were reported by 10 patients (12.0%).  Seven serious AEs were reported in 4 patients (4.8%) and 5 serious ADRs in 2 patients (2.4%).  Five patients (13.9%) discontinued from the study due to an AE.

A total of 11 patients (13.3%) reported AEs of infections and infestations.  ADRs with an incidence of ≥ 2% by System Organ Class (MedDRA version 24.0) were infections and infestations (6.0%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (3.6%), and hepatobiliary disorders (2.4%).  In patients who discontinued treatment due to AEs, 13 AEs were reported by 5 patients and 11 ADRs were reported by 4 patients.

The time to onset of AEs was variable and there was no trend toward an increased incidence of delayed AEs with long-term use.  No ADRs were observed in the 3 patients treated with 80 mg/2 weeks after the third dose.

The outcomes of ADRs were death (1 event in 1 patient), recovering (2 events in 1 patient), and recovered (16 events in 8 patients).  One patient with an outcome of fatality was included in the safety specification. This patient was a male in his 70s with a complication of \"intellectual disability\". The patient experienced \"liver disorder\" 65 days after the start of this drug and died 299 days after the onset. Humira® was continued after the onset of the event but was discontinued on Day 97 because the patient \"changed hospital or did not visit the hospital\". The physician assessed the event to be unrelated to Humira®, but the company considered that the relationship could not be ruled out because the event occurred after the administration of this drug, although it was difficult to evaluate due to lack of detailed information. An evaluation of key survey items and safety evaluation items found that there were no events requiring additional measures.

Safety was also evaluated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment; no factor requiring special measures was found.  Pregnant women were not included in this PMOS.

- a. Disease severity staging: I = mild; II = moderate.
- b. This was an assessment of overall improvement of the patient as judged by the treating physician

## CHMP comments:

The mean age of patients included in the study was 42.0 ± 15.2 years. Four individuals were between 15 and 18 years of age, while the majority (86%) were between 19-65 years of age. Males were in majority although females are more commonly affected by HS. Means for weight and BMS were 78.55 ± 23.21 kg and 26.90 ± 6.76 kg/m 2 , respectively. The mean duration of the disease was 12.76 ± 11.14 years. Disease severity classified by Hurley classification was I (mild) for 6 patients (3.6%), II (moderate) for 27 patients (32.5%), and III (severe) for 51 patients (61.4%). Renal and liver impairment were present in 7 of 83 patients, no patient had both renal and hepatic impairment.

36 patients discontinued the study. The most common reasons for discontinuation were \"hospital transfer or missed visits\" and \"improvement of symptoms.\"

Clinical efficacy was evaluated in the study by assessment of overall improvement by the treating physician.  74 of 83 patients (89.2%) were assessed as responders based on this measure.  The response rate was ≥ 89% at all time points investigated including at the last observation (week 52), suggesting that the clinical efficacy of Humira® is maintained over long-term.  There was no difference in response rates between the different aged groups included in the study. Changes in the other secondary endpoints investigated also showed statistically significant results at all time points investigated.

Primary endpoints were incidence of serious infections, incidence of adverse drug reactions and incidence of infections. A total of 11 patients (13.3%) reported AEs of infections and infestations. ADRs with an incidence of ≥ 2% by System Organ Class (MedDRA version 24.0) were infections and infestations (6.0%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (3.6%), and hepatobiliary disorders (2.4%).  One patient with an outcome of fatality was included in the safety specification. This patient was a male in his 70s with a complication of \"intellectual disability\". The patient experienced \"liver disorder\" 65 days after the start of this drug and died 299 days after the onset. Humira® was continued after the onset of the event but was discontinued on Day 97 because the patient \"changed hospital or did not visit the hospital\". The physician assessed the event to be unrelated to Humira®, but the company considered that the relationship could not be ruled out because the event occurred after the administration of Humira®, although it was difficult to evaluate due to lack of detailed information. This view is supported by the assessor.

No factor requiring special measures was found in safety evaluations of patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

There were 4 children aged 15 years to &lt; 18 years enrolled in this study.  No children were &lt; 15 years of age.  Among the paediatric patients (&lt; 18 years old), no AEs were reported.  No safety and efficacy analyses were performed with data collected from these patients which is acceptable considering the limited number of patients included.  The overall clinical efficacy and safety profile of Humira® in this very limited patient group resemble that of the adult population.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The results of this observational study support the clinical safety and efficacy of Humira® used in treatment of patients, also in the very limited population of four individuals &lt; 18 years of age with HS in routine daily practice in Japan.  The study population was examined in an actual clinical setting, without any strict selection criteria; thus, the results of this PMOS study are considered to reflect the actual situation of patients with HS in Japan.  The response rate based on physician global assessment was ≥ 89% at all time points. Hidradenitis Suppurativa showed improvement also in other endpoints.  Response rates were similar across age groups (≥ 15 to &lt; 65 years: 90.7%; ≥ 65years: 75%).  Similar efficacy was also shown in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

Safety and clinical efficacy were also demonstrated in the 4 paediatric patients enrolled in this study. No AEs or ADRs were reported in these 4 paediatric patients over the duration of the study.

The safety results were consistent with the currently documented safety profile of the product, as described in the label.  The benefit-risk of adalimumab is unchanged and no update to the Summary of Product Characteristics has been proposed because of these data.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

No new findings of clinical efficacy and safety were observed in the performed Post-Marketing Observational Study. The MAH has not suggested any update to the Summary of Product Characteristics based on the performed study, a view which is supported by the CHMP.
