## 1. Introduction

Soliris  (eculizumab)  was  initially  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  treatment  of  paroxysmal  nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) in 2007. An extension of the therapeutic indication was approved in the EU for inclusion of treatment of atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in adult and paediatric patients on  24  Nov  2011  (EMEA/H/C/000791/II/027).  Efficacy  and  safety  data  for  this  indication  were  later updated within procedures EMEA/H/C/000791/II/0058/G, EMEA/H/C/000791/II/0071/G and EMEA/H/C/000791/II/0102. The currently authorised indications for Soliris and date of approval can be found in Table 1 Table 2 below.

On  18  November  2025,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  (Study  ECU-aHUS-302, completion date 7 May 2025) for Soliris, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure(s).

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH presents an addendum to the original Clinical Overview for eculizumab (Soliris ® )

This addendum updates the results from Study ECU-aHUS-302, which was a post-approval commitment study, agreed to as a condition for approval in China. Eculizumab is approved in China for the treatment of aHUS in children and adults. The therapeutic efficacy and safety of eculizumab was demonstrated in 3 global pivotal clinical studies conducted at study sites outside of China for registration.

The purpose of this commitment study was to assess the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in participants with aHUS in China.

The MAH stated that Study ECU-aHUS-302 is a stand-alone study.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study ECU-aHUS-302, a Prospective, Single-Arm, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Immunogenicity of Eculizumab in Complement Inhibitor Treatment-Naïve Pediatric and Adult Participants with Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) in China.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study ECU-aHUS-302

## Methods

Study ECU-aHUS-302 was a Phase 3b, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of eculizumab in complement inhibitor treatment-naïve pediatric and adult participants with aHUS in China.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results presented in the report cover the study period from 14 Jul 2023 (first participant first visit) to 07 May 2025 (last participant last visit; clinical data lock date of 04 Jun 2025).

The study consisted of the following periods (up to 35 weeks in total):

- Screening Period: up to 7 days
- Treatment Period: 26 weeks
- Safety Follow-up Phone Call: 8 weeks

## Figure 1. Study Schema

<!-- image -->

The 8-week Safety Follow-up Phone Call was required only for:

1. Participants who discontinued eculizumab treatment during the study
2. Participants  who  did  not  receive  continued  access  to  eculizumab  after  completing  study treatment.

After providing informed consent/assent, participants were to be screened for eligibility for the study during the 7-day Screening Period. If all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were met, participants were enrolled and vaccinated against N meningitidis if not already vaccinated within the period of active coverage specified by the vaccine manufacturer. Participants who were vaccinated less than 14 days prior to receiving the first dose of eculizumab would receive treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 14 days after the vaccination.

## Study participants

## Inclusion criteria

Participants were eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria were met:

## ➢ Age:

1. Participants of any age weighing ≥ 5 kg.

## ➢ Type of Patient and Disease Characteristics

2. Complement treatment naïve with evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombocytopenia, evidence of haemolysis, and kidney injury, based on the following laboratory findings:
- a. Platelet count &lt; 150000/ μ L during the Screening Period or within 28 days prior to the start of the Screening Period, and
- b. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≥ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) during the Screening Period or within 28 days prior to the start of the Screening Period, and hemoglobin ≤ lower limit of normal (LLN) for age and gender during the Screening Period or ≤ 28 days prior to the start of the Screening Period, and
- c. Serum creatinine level ≥ ULN in adults ( ≥ 18 years of age), or ≥ 97.5 th  percentile for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

age at Screening in children (&lt; 18 years of age) (participants who require dialysis for &lt; 3 months are also eligible)

3. Among participants with a kidney transplant:
- a. Known history of aHUS prior to current kidney transplant, or
- b. If no known history of aHUS, persistent evidence of TMA at least 4 days after modifying the immunosuppressive regimen (eg, suspending or reducing the dose) of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI; eg, cyclosporine, tacrolimus) or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi; eg, sirolimus, everolimus)
4. Among participants with onset of TMA postpartum, persistent evidence of TMA for &gt; 3 days after the day of childbirth.
5. Participants must be vaccinated at least 14 days prior to receiving the first dose of eculizumab or be vaccinated and receive treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 14 days after the vaccination, to reduce the risk of meningococcal infection (N meningitidis).
6. Participants &lt; 18 years of age must have been vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae according to local vaccination schedule guidelines.
7. In participants receiving treatment with medications known to cause TMA, persistent evidence of TMA at least 4 days after modifying the excluded medication (eg, gemcitabine, calcineurin inhibitor [CNI; eg, cyclosporine, tacrolimus], or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor [mTORi; eg, sirolimus, everolimus]).

## ➢ Weight

8. Body weight ≥ 5 kg.

## ➢ Sex

9. Male and/or female.
10. Female participants of childbearing potential and male participants must follow protocolspecified contraception guidance.

## Exclusion criteria

Participants were excluded from the study if any of the following criteria were met:

## ➢ Medical conditions

1. Known familial or acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency (activity &lt; 5%).
2. Shiga toxin-related haemolytic uremic syndrome (ST-HUS) as demonstrated by local guidelines.
3. Positive direct Coombs test which, in the judgement of the Investigator, is indicative of a clinically significant immune-mediated haemolysis not due to aHUS.
4. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
5. Unresolved meningococcal disease.
6. Confirmed diagnosis of ongoing sepsis defined as positive blood cultures within 7 days prior to the start of Screening and untreated with antibiotics.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

7. Presence or suspicion of active and untreated systemic infection that, in the opinion of the Investigator, confounds an accurate diagnosis of aHUS or impedes the ability to manage the aHUS disease.
8. Heart, lung, small bowel, pancreas, or liver transplant.
9. Among participants with a kidney transplant, acute kidney dysfunction within 4 weeks of transplant consistent with the diagnosis of acute antibody-mediated rejection according to Banff 2013 criteria.
10. Among participants without a kidney transplant, history of kidney disease other than aHUS, such as:
- a. Known kidney biopsy finding suggestive of underlying disease other than aHUS
- b. Known kidney ultrasound finding consistent with an alternative diagnosis to aHUS (eg, small kidneys for age)
- c. Known family history and/or genetic diagnosis of noncomplement-mediated genetic renal disease (eg, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis)
11. Identified drug exposure-related HUS.
12. History of malignancy within 5 years of Screening with the exception of a nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been treated with no evidence of recurrence.

## Protocol Deviations

Important protocol deviations were reported in 11 (44.0%) participants, and the majority of important protocol deviation related to inclusion criteria (10 out of 11 participants) which was mainly due to Chinese vaccination guidelines on meningococcal vaccination and the local clinical practice on Hib vaccination.

The  participants  with  the  important  protocol  deviations  related  to  vaccination  received  prophylactic antibiotic treatment to prevent infection, and none of these participants developed the corresponding infection.

## Efficacy results

All efficacy analyses were performed using the FAS (N = 25), and the sensitivity analyses of efficacy data were performed using PP Set (N = 23).

## Primary Endpoint

The primary efficacy endpoint was Complete TMA Response during the 26-week treatment period, defined as:

1. Platelet count ≥ 150000/μL
2. lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) normalization (LDH ≤ upper limit of normal)
3. ≥ 25% improvement in serum creatinine from baseline

Participants had to meet all Complete TMA Response criteria concurrently, and each criterion had to be met at 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between.

Note: The criteria for Complete TMA Response were: 1. normalization of platelet count 2. normalization of LDH 3. ≥ 25% improvement in serum creatinine from Baseline

Participants had to mect all Complete TMA Response criteria concurrently, and each criterion had to be met at 2 separate asscssments obtained at least 4 wecks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between.

The proportion of Complete TMA Response was based on the responders among treated participants. The numerator was the number of participants achieving Complete TMA Response during the 26-week treatment period and the denominator was the number of participants in the FAS.

Hematologic normalization included normalization of platelet count and normalization of LDH.

Platelet values obtained from the day of a blood transfusion of platelets through 3 days after the transfusion were excluded from all analyscs.

a 95% CIs for the proportion were based on exact confidence limits using the Clopper Pearson method.

The modification to Complete TMA Response applied strictly to the participants on dialysis at Baseline (ie, participants requiring dialysis within 5 days prior to eculizumab treatment initiation). The definition of Complete TMA Response remained the same for all other participants. Participant had to meet all modified Complete TMA Response criteria at 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between. Hematologic normalization included normalization of platelet count and normalization of LDH.

Platelet values obtained from the day of a blood transfusion of platelets through 3 days after the transfusion were excluded from all analyses.

## Secondary Endpoints

## Time to Complete TMA Response

The median time to Complete TMA Response was 75 days and occurred in Day 22 visit following the first dose of eculizumab. The latest response was observed on Day 127 visit following the first dose of eculizumab.

A Kaplan-Meier cumulative distribution curve is presented for time to Complete TMA Response in the FAS. Participants had to meet all Complete TMA Response criteria concurrently, and each criterion had to be met at 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between. Participants that did not have a response were censored at the date of last visit or study discontinuation at the time when the analysis was performed.

## Dialysis requirement status

There were 11 participants who received kidney dialysis within 5 days prior to treatment start, and 1 additional participant started dialysis after receiving the first dose of eculizumab. All these 12 participants had discontinued dialysis by the end of the study or upon early withdrawal from the study.

## Change from Baseline in eGFR

Overall, the mean eGFR gradually improved from Baseline throughout the study after the participants received eculizumab. However, 3 participants  reported eGFR of 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2  at the majority of the visits due to requiring dialysis for acute kidney injury and 1 participant reported lower eGFR values than Baseline at the majority of the visits.

## Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage

After treatment with eculizumab, there was a notable improvement in the participants' CKD stages, shifting from more severe stages (Stage 4 or 5) at Baseline to less severe stages over time. On Day 183 compared to Baseline: 12 out of 17 (70.6%) evaluable participants were classified as CKD Stage 5 at Baseline, and only 3 (17.6%) participants remained in Stage 5 on Day 183.

## Hematologic parameters

The observed value and change from the Baseline in platelet, LDH, and haemoglobin at each schedule visit in the FAS are presented below.

The platelet counts at Baseline were less than 150 x 10 9  /L for all the participants, and the platelet levels were generally increased relative to Baseline and improved to be within normal limits after treatment.

Baseline value is defined as the average of the values from the assessments performed prior to the first study drug infusion. Platelet values obtained from the day of a blood transfusion of platelets through 3 days after the transfusion were excluded from all analyses.

The LDH value, which was above normal level at Baseline, decreased and remained consistently within normal limits throughout the study.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The MAH has submitted the results from Study ECU-aHUS-302, as per Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. This was a Phase 3b, open-label, single-arm, multicentre study designed to assess the efficacy, safety, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of eculizumab (Soliris) in complement inhibitor treatment-naïve paediatric and adult participants with aHUS in China. This was a post-approval commitment study in China.

The study enrolled participants of any age who weighed ≥5 kg and who had not been previously treated with complement inhibitors. Ultimately, 25 patients were enrolled and treated: 14 (56%) were adults (≥ 18 years) and 11 (44.0%) were paediatric patients (&lt;18 years) at the first infusion. From the 11 paediatric patients, two participants (8.0%) were in the birth to &lt; 2 years old age category, no participants were in the 2 to &lt; 6 years old age category, 7 participants (28.0%) were in the 6 to &lt; 12 years old age category, and 2 participants (8.0%) were in the 12 to &lt; 18 years old age category.

The study included a Treatment period of 26 weeks. During this period, participants received eculizumab by IV administration based on body weight cohorts.

The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of eculizumab in the treatment of aHUS. As secondary objectives, the aim of the study was to characterise the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of eculizumab.

The study population included all Asian patients with a majority of male (76%) participants. The median age at first infusion was 23.90 and the mean weight was 58.62 kg. A total of 21 (84%) participants had ADAMTS13 activity ≥ 5%, and 4 (16.0%) participants had missing data for ADAMTS -13 activity. Eleven (44%) participants underwent kidney dialysis within 5 days before the first dose of eculizumab, and 8 (72.7%) participants received regular dialysis.

The primary endpoint of Complete TMA Response was achieved in 64.0% of participants during the 26week treatment period.

Regarding the secondary endpoints, the results confirmed eculizumab activity. The median time to Complete TMA Response during the 26-week treatment period was 75 days and the latest response was observed on Day 127 visit following the first dose of eculizumab. All the patients who received kidney dialysis within 5 days prior to treatment start or right after the first dose had discontinued dialysis by the end of the study or upon early withdrawal of the study. The mean gradually improved from Baseline throughout the study. An improvement in platelet, LDH, and haemoglobin was observed from Baseline after the participants received eculizumab.

Among the 25 participants, the median treatment duration was 24.10 weeks (range: 0.1 to 27.0 weeks) and the median follow-up duration was 27.60 weeks (range: 1.1 to 36.1 weeks).

Focusing on safety data, 24 (96.0%) participants reported at least 1 AE, and 8 (32.0%) participants reported at least 1 SAE.

Four (16.0%) participants had AEs that were considered related to eculizumab, and none of the related AEs were severe.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most frequently reported AE was hyperkalaemia (28.0%), and the other AEs reported by ≥ 20% of participants were hepatic function abnormal, upper respiratory tract infection, and vomiting.

The most frequently reported related AE was leukopenia (2 [8.0%] participants). The other related AEs were each reported by 1 (4.0%) participant, including clostridium difficile infection, gastroenteritis, infection, pneumonia, rotavirus infection, urinary tract infection, and dermatitis atopic.

The only SAE that occurred in more than 1 participant was pneumonia (2 [8.0%] participants), and other SAEs occurred in 1 (4%) participant each, including bacterial infection, clostridium difficile infection, hepatic function abnormal, infection, retching, rotavirus infection, synovial cyst, and upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Two (8.0%) participants reported a total of 4 eculizumab-related SAEs, including clostridium difficile infection, infection, pneumonia, and rotavirus infection, and each event was reported once.

There were no AEs of special interest, no AEs leading to discontinuation of eculizumab or study withdrawal, and no fatal events/deaths reported in this study.

There were no clinically important changes that would suggest any safety concern in the clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, and ECG assessments, or other observations related to safety in this study.

Overall, the results from this study confirm the positive benefit-risk balance for eculizumab for the treatment of aHUS, including paediatric patients.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

Eculizumab is approved in the EU for the treatment of aHUS in adults and children, based on the results from four studies in adults and two studies performed in children with aHUS, whose results are also included in section 5.1 of the PI.

The MAH has submitted the results from Study ECU-aHUS-302, a study performed in China as a commitment to the approval of Soliris in China. A total of 25 participants were treated, being 11 of them paediatric patients (&lt;18 years of age at first infusion). Based on the results from the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, the activity of eculizumab for the treatment of aHUS has been confirmed in this Chinese population.

Regarding safety, no relevant concerns have been raised, and the toxicity profile seems to be in line with the already known safety profile for eculizumab.

The MAH does not plan to include the results from this study in the Soliris PI. Considering the differences in the population and the fact that results from other paediatric studies performed with European population are already included in the PI, this is agreed.
