##  Description

##  Methods

- Objective(s)

Primary objective:

To demonstrate that the immunogenicity of at least one DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib formulation is noninferior  to  the  licensed  formulation  in  terms  of  seroprotection  rates  to  diphtheria,  tetanus, hepatitis B and PRP antigens and in terms of antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for pertussis antigens one month after the third dose of the primary vaccination.

Criteria for non-inferiority:

- -Non-inferiority  in  terms  of  immune  response  to  diphtheria,  tetanus,  hepatitis  B  and  PRP antigens was demonstrated if the upper limit of the 97.5% confidence interval (CI) on the group difference [Control minus investigational] in the percentage of seroprotected subjects for each antigen was ≤ 10% and,
- -Non-inferiority in terms of immune response to pertussis antigens was demonstrated if, for each of the three antigens, the upper limit of the 97.5% CI on the GMC ratio [Control divided by investigational] was ≤ 1.5.

## Secondary objective:

- -To  assess  the  immunological  response  to  the  study  vaccines  in  terms  of  seroprotection status, seropositivity status and antibody concentrations or titres, one month after the third dose of the primary vaccination.
- -To assess the immunological status towards diphtheria, tetanus pertussis and polio antigens in  terms  of  seroprotection  status,  seropositivity  status  and  antibody  concentrations,  before the first dose of the primary vaccination.
- -To assess the immunological response to pertussis antigens in terms of vaccine response, one month after the third dose of the primary vaccination.
- -To  assess  the  safety  and  reactogenicity  of  the  study  vaccines  in  terms  of  solicited  and unsolicited, local and general symptoms and serious adverse events.

Only the objective related to licensed vaccine is presented.

- To assess the immunogenicity of the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine in terms of seroprotection* rates to diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, and polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate (PRP)  antigens  and  in  terms  of  antibody  geometric  mean  concentrations  (GMCs)  for pertussis antigens one month after the third dose of the primary vaccination.

*A seroprotected subject was defined as a subject whose antibody concentrations were above or equal to the following cut-off values:

- Anti-PRP antibody concentration ≥ 0.15 μg/mL
- Anti-HBs antibody concentration ≥ 10 mIU/mL
- Anti-diphtheria (anti-D) antibody concentration ≥ 0.1 IU/mL
- Anti-tetanus (anti-T) antibody concentration ≥ 0.1 IU/mL
- Study design

This was a double-blind, randomised, multicentre study with three parallel groups, conducted in the Dominican Republic and Finland. Two blood samples were drawn from all subjects: 3.5 mL of blood was collected before the first vaccine dose and 5 mL of blood was collected one month after the third vaccine dose. Subjects were allocated to one of the two sub-cohorts depending on the country of recruitment. Sub-cohort 1 included all subjects in Finland (pneumococcal assays were performed only for this sub-cohort of subjects) and sub-cohort 2 included all subjects from the Dominican Republic.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The three study groups were as follows:

- -Form  A  Group: received  three  doses  of  GSK  Biologicals'  investigational  DATAPaHBVIPV/Hib vaccine and Pfizer's 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine ( Prevenar13 ) at 2, 3 and 4 months of age.
- -Form  B  Group: received  three  doses  of  GSK  Biologicals'  investigational  DBTBPaHBVIPV/Hib vaccine and Pfizer's 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine ( Prevenar13 ) at 2, 3 and 4 months of age.
- -Control  Group: received  three  doses  of  GSK  Biologicals'  licensed  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine ( Infanrix  hexa )  and  Pfizer's  13-valent  pneumococcal  vaccine  ( Prevenar13 )  at  2,  3 and 4 months of age.
- Study population /Sample size

Study Population: Healthy male or female subjects between and including, 60 and 90 days of age at the time of the first vaccination. The subject should not have had previous or intercurrent diphtheria,  tetanus,  pertussis,  polio,  hepatitis  B,  Hib  and/or  pneumococcal  vaccination  or disease,  with  the  exception  of  hepatitis  B  vaccination  at  birth.  Written  informed  consent  was obtained  from  the  parents/legally  acceptable  representative(s)  [LAR(s)]  of  the  subject  before entry into the study.

- Efficacy results

## Immunogenicity:

The immunogenicity analysis was performed on the ATP cohort and Total vaccination cohort.

## Primary objectives: non-inferiority in terms of immune response to diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, pertussis and PRP:

Analysis was performed one month post-primary vaccination, for each investigational group:

- -The upper limits  of  the  standardized  asymptotic  97.5%  CI  on  the  difference  between  the groups (Control minus each investigational group) in terms of diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and PRP seroprotection rates were all below 10%.
- -The upper limits of the 97.5% CI on the anti-PT and anti-FHA GMC ratio (Control divided by each investigational group) were all below 1.5, but, the upper limit of the 97.5% CI on the anti-PRN GMC ratio (Control divided by each investigational group) exceeded 1.5.
- -Thus,  the  non-inferiority  of  the  investigational  DATAPa-HBV-IPV/HibGD  and  DBTBPaHBVIPV/HibGD vaccines  co-administered  with Prevenar  13 to  the  licensed Infanrix  hexa vaccine coadministered with Prevenar 13 was not demonstrated.

## Secondary objectives (descriptive analysis):

One month post-primary vaccination (ATP cohort for immunogenicity)

- -Seroprotective concentrations of antibodies against diphtheria and tetanus were observed in 100% of subjects in the three groups.
- -At  least  97.5%  subjects  in  all  groups  had  seroprotective  levels  of  anti-HBs  antibody concentrations.
- -Seropositive antibody levels against PT, FHA and PRN were observed in 100% subjects in the three groups. Across groups, vaccine response to PT, FHA and PRN was mounted by at least 97.1%, 96.9% and 91% of subjects, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -The percentage of subjects with anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥ 0.15 µg/ml was 92.1% in Form A group, 87.9% in Form B group and 88.5% in the Control Group.
- -Seroprotective titres of antibodies against poliovirus types 1 and 3 were observed in at least 97.4% and 97.9% of subjects,  respectively.  Seroprotective  titres  against  poliovirus  type  2 ranged from 90.5% to 94.8% across the three groups.
- -Across  groups,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  pneumococcal  antibody  concentrations ≥ 0.15 µg/mL was at least 96.5% except for serotypes 6B (90.3%) and 23F (92.9%) and the percentage  of  subjects  with  pneumococcal  antibody  concentrations ≥ 0.35  µg/mL  was  at least 90.1% except for serotypes 6B (70.5%) and 23F (78.1%).

- Safety results

## Safety /reactogenicity:

The safety analysis was performed on the Total vaccinated cohort.

Any  symptom: The  percentage  of  doses  followed  by  a  report  of  any  symptom  (solicited  and unsolicited, local and general) ranged from 87.8% to 91.2% in the three groups. The majority of the symptoms were reported during the first 4 (Days 0-3) days following vaccination.

Solicited  local  symptoms: Injection  site  pain  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  local symptom in the three groups, reported following 52.9%, 52.2% and 41.8% doses in the Form A, Form B and Control groups, respectively. The most common grade 3 solicited local symptom in the three groups was swelling, reported following 7.4% doses in Form A group and 8.1% doses in the Form B and Control groups.

Solicited  general  symptoms: Irritability  (any  and  grade  3)  was  the  most  frequently  reported solicited general symptom in the three groups. Grade 3 fever (&gt; 39.0 °C axillary temperature)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was reported for 0.7% of subjects in Form A and Form B groups and 0.6% of subjects in the Control group.

Unsolicited  symptoms:  During  the  31-day  follow-up  period,  according  to  the  overall/subject analysis, grade 3 unsolicited symptoms were reported for 7.1%, 8.7% and 6.7% of subjects in the  Form  A,  Form  B  and  Control  groups,  respectively.  Unsolicited  symptoms  with  a  causal relationship to vaccination were reported for 21.7%, 21.1% and 23% of subjects in the Form A, Form B and Control groups, respectively.

Concomitant  medication: The  percentage  of  doses  followed  by  at  least  one  concomitant medication  during  the  31-day  follow  up  period  following  vaccination  was  60.1%,  59.2%  and 52.2% in the Form A, Form B and Control groups, respectively. Prophylactic antipyretics were given after not more than 4.6% of doses in the three groups.

Serious adverse events: SAEs were reported for 9 (3.8%), 5 (2.1%) and 4 (1.7%) subjects in the Form A, Form B and Control groups, respectively. One fatal SAE was reported during the entire study period: This fatal case was described for a 2-month-old female (subject 1929) who died 17 days after Dose 1 of the Form A vaccine due to asphyxia and interstitial lung disease. The subject  was  co-sleeping  with  her  parents.  The  majority  of  the  SAEs  reported  across  the groups were lower respiratory illnesses (i.e.  bronchiolitis,  pneumonia,  etc).  None  of the  SAEs were considered to be potentially related to vaccination by the investigator.

Withdrawals due to adverse events /serious adverse events: One death was reported during the study for a subject from the Form A group. Subject number 1929 died 17 days after receiving the first dose of the study vaccine due to asphyxia and interstitial lung disease. This event was considered by the investigator not to be related to vaccination.

Important safety information received after the data lock point (database freeze date): No safety information was received after the data lock point (database freeze date) for this study.

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Inferential  immunogenicity  objectives (One  month  post  primary  vaccination,  for  each investigational group)

The primary objective of the study was not met: non-inferiority of the immunogenicity respons  to Formulation A versus Infanrix hexa and to Formulation B versus Infanrix hexa was not met:

- -Non-inferiority  in  terms  of  immune  response  to  diphtheria,  tetanus  and  hepatitis  B  was demonstrated  since  the  upper  limits  of  the  standardised  asymptotic  97.5%  CI  on  the between  groupdifference  (Control  group  minus  each  investigational  group)  in  terms  of seroprotection rates to D, T and HBs were below the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 10%.
- -For  each  formulation,  the  upper  limits  of  the  97.5%  CI  on  the  GMC  ratio  (Control  group divided by each investigational group) were below 1.5, the pre-defined clinical limit for noninferiority, in terms of immune response to PT and FHA. The upper limits of the 97.5% CI on the  GMC  ratio  for  anti-PRN  was  1.54  (Control  group  divided  by  Form  A  group)  and  1.84 (Control  group  divided  by  Form  B  group),  and  exceeded  the  pre-defined  non-inferiority margin of 1.5.
- -For PRP, the upper limits of the standardised asymptotic 97.5% CI on the group difference (Control  group  minus  each  investigational  group)  for  the  percentage  of  seroprotected subjects was below 10%, the pre-defined clinical limit for non-inferiority. However, in view of the  sequential  nature  of  analysis  non-inferiority  for  PRP  could  not  be  concluded  for  both formulations.

## Descriptive immunogenicity objectives:

- -One month post primary vaccination, between 97.5% and 100% subjects had seroprotective antibodies  against  diphtheria,  tetanus  and  hepatitis  B.  Between  90.5%  to  97.9%  subjects had  seroprotective  antibodies  against  the  three  poliovirus  types.  Anti-PRP  seroprotection rates  ranged  from  87.9%  to  92.1%.  Seropositive  antibody  levels  against  pertussis  were observed in 100% of the subjects in the three groups.

## Safety and reactogenicity objectives:

- -The observed incidence of solicited adverse events tended to be higher in the investigational groups than in the Control group. Overall solicited incidence of fever &gt;38 °C per subject was higher in Form A (33.8%) and Form B (30.8) compared to the control group (18.1%).
- -At  least  one  unsolicited  AE  was  reported  for  153  (63.8%),  165  (68.2%),  and  159  (66.5%) subjects in the Form A, Form B and Control groups, respectively. SAEs were reported for 9 (3.8%),  5  (2.1%)  and  4  (1.7%)  subjects  in  the  Form  A,  Form  B  and  Control  groups, respectively. One fatal SAE was reported during the entire study period: Subject 1929 from Form A group died 17 days after Dose 1 of the study vaccine due to asphyxia and interstitial lung disease. None of the SAEs were considered to be potentially related to vaccination by the investigator.

## V. RAPPORTEUR'S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

##  Overall conclusion

The MAH submitted the results of a double-blind, randomised, multicentre study to assess safety and immunogenicity of 2 new formulations of the MAH's DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine compared to the licensed Infanrix Hexa vaccine when co-administered with Prevenar 13 to healthy infants as a primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age.

The  primary  objective,  i.e.  non-inferiority  of  the  immunogenicity  of  at  least  one  of  the  novel DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine formulations compared to the licensed Infanrix Hexa vaccine, was not met according to the criteria set for non-inferiority, as the immune response to the pertactin component of both novel formulations was not non-inferior to Infanrix Hexa. No divergent safety signals were detected in the comparison of the new formulation with the licensed Infanrix Hexa.

The MAH should continue to investigate in  pertussis  vaccines  that  offer  prolonged  protection compared to  the  currently  authorised  vaccines  in  view  of  the  resurgence  of  pertussis  in  fully vaccinated  individuals  which  appears  to  be  at  least  partly  due  to  waning  vaccine-induced immunity (Cherry, 2012).

## VI. REQUEST FOR SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Request for supplementary information :  In  view of failure to show non-inferiority for both new formulations against the approved formulation in relation to immunogenicity, the applicant should clarify backup development strategy and consequential deliverables.
