Patients received twice daily treatment with immediate release exenatide 5 µg, immediate release exenatide 10 µg or equivalent dose of placebo for 28 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to 28 weeks of treatment; the treatment difference (pooled doses) from placebo was not statistically significant [ 0.28% (95% CI: 1.01, 0.45)]. No new safety findings were identified in this paediatric study. |

| II/0046   | This variation concerned the update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to include new safety and efficacy information from Study H-80-EW-GWDM. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 23/10/2014 | 15/01/2015 | SmPC | Study H-80-EW-GWDM was a 30-week, open-label, active comparator-controlled, non-inferiority study, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of BYETTA (n=315) versus titrated insulin lispro three times daily (n=312) on a background of optimized basal insulin glargine and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Following a basal insulin optimization (BIO) phase, patients with HbA1c above 7.0% were randomized to add either BYETTA or insulin lispro to their existing regimen of insulin glargine and metformin. In both treatment groups, subjects continued to titrate their insulin glargine doses using an algorithm reflecting current clinical practice. All patients assigned to BYETTA initially received 5 mcg BID for four weeks. After four weeks, their dose was increased to 10 mcg BID. Patients in the BYETTA-treated group with an HbA1c of less than or equal to 8.0% at the end of the BIO phase decreased their insulin glargine dose by at least 10%. BYETTA lowered HbA1c by 1.1% from a baseline of 8.3% and insulin lispro lowered HbA1c by 1.1% from a baseline of 8.2% and non-inferiority of BYETTA to titrated lispro was demonstrated. The proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7% was 47.9% with BYETTA and 42.8% with insulin lispro. Weight loss of 2.6 kg from a baseline of 89.9 kg was observed with BYETTA whereas a weight gain of 1.9 kg |

The safety data from the study are in line with the known safety profile of exenatide and has not given rise to any new safety concerns. Only minor changes to section 4.8 of the SmPC were considered necessary. No changes to the identified or potential safety concerns in the RMP or the activities related to these issues are warranted. The variation application does not have any impact on the overall benefit / risk balance for BYETTA which remains unchanged for the authorised indication(s).   |

The latter will be further investigated in a new epidemiological study. Also the possible drug interaction between exenatide and tacrolimus and exenatide and lamotrigine needs further evaluation. In addition, the CHMP agreed on a common PSUR for Byetta and Bydureon (exenatide prolonged release formulation) following the timelines for PSUR frequency of Bydureon as required per Regulation 726/2004. Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Byetta, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time.   |

| II/0018   | Update of section 5.2 of the Summary of Product Characteristics to incorporate the PK data from study H80-EW-GWCC as requested by the CHMP on 29 May 2009 following the review of FUM 009. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics                                                                                                                         | 21/01/2010   | 15/03/2010   | SmPC                    | Long-term controlled data from in very elderly subjects are limited. In pharmacokinetic study H80-EW-GWCC in patients with type 2 diabetes, administration of exenatide (10µg) resulted in a mean increase of exenatide AUC by 36% in 15 elderly subjects aged 75 to 85 years compared to 15 subjects aged 45 to 65 years likely related to reduced renal function in the older age group. There was also a slight difference in weight between groups. Hence, the difference in renal function and weight might explain the difference in exposure between the groups. A combined analysis of PK data from 7 studies suggested that the relationship between exenatide clearance and creatinine clearance is similar for elderly and non-elderly subjects, |

| II/0011 | To include information on weight loss, alopecia and anti-exenatide antibodies as a result of a Company Core Data Sheet update (sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC). The PL has been amended accordingly. In addition, the term 'incretin mimetic' in section 5.1 of the SPC is changed to 'glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP- 1) receptor antagonist'. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 21/01/2010 | 15/03/2010 | SmPC and PL | Company Core Data Sheet has been revised as new information became available from clinical trials and post marketing experience. New data is related to safety information, particularly weight loss, alopecia and anti- exenatide antibodies. Weight loss is well known effect associated with exenatide treatment. However, new data support that rapid weight loss may be harmful for some patients. MAH proposed to include relevant information in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC. Further revision of CCDS suggested association between exenatide treatment and alopecia as well as development of anti-exenatide antibodies. As a result of these findings appropriate changes in section 4.8 of the SPC were proposed by MAH and accepted by CHMP. PL was also updates accordingly to reflect changes in SPC. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity of this variation to make an administrative change, amending the term 'incretin mimetic' to 'glucagon- like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist for consistency purpose. MAH also discussed CHMP's request to include text around the increase of heart rate in the SPC. It was agreed by CHMP that observed increase in heart rate most likely is not of clinical relevance and therefore this information does not need to be added to SPC. |

| II/0006 | Update of sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SPC with information regarding pharmacokinetic data in adolescents, in line with the CHMP conclusions of FUM 008, where the results from study 2993-124 (PK/PD in adolescents) were presented. Also two minor errors are corrected in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SPC. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 20/11/2008 | 07/01/2009 | SmPC | The Product information was updated following the assessment of study 2993-124 ('A randomized, single- blind, dose-rising, placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of exenatide in adolescent subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus'). In 13 patients with type 2 diabetes and between the ages of 12 and 16 years, administration of exenatide (5 g) resulted in slightly lower mean AUC (16% lower) and Cmax (25% lower) compared to those observed in adults. The PK, PD and tolerability parameters determined in Study 2993-124 were comparable to those previously observed in adults and likely attributable to similar body size of adolescents and adults with type 2 diabetes. From this study, it was concluded that no further PK and/or PD-based adjustments for age, weight, or other demographic factors are necessary. |

Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptom of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. Resolution of pancreatitis has been observed with supportive treatment. If pancreatitis is suspected, BYETTA and other potentially suspect medicinal products should be discontinued. Section 4.8 have been updated to include acute pancreatitis. |
| II/0002  | Update of section 4.5 of the SPC to delete the restriction of intake of BYETTA when taking oral contraceptives and to reflect the results of an interaction study between exenatide and oral contraceptives (follow-up measure).

|         | Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   |            |            |                        | before BYETTA (10 µg BID) did not alter the AUC, Cmax or Cmin of either ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel. Administration of the oral contraceptive 30 minutes after BYETTA did not affect AUC but resulted in a reduction of the Cmax of ethinyl estradiol by 45%, and Cmax of levonorgestrel by 27-41%, and a delay in tmax by 2-4 h due to delayed gastric emptying. The reduction in Cmax is of limited clinical relevance and no adjustment of dosing of oral contraceptives is required. Based on these data the CHMP was also of the opinion that no specific recommendations with regards to the dose- timing of oral contraceptives are required when taking BYETTA.   |
