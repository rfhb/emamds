- Primary endpoints:

## Safety:

· Frequency and severity of systemic reactions until 7 days after the first vaccination. Immunogenicity: Rate of subjects with antibody response to the vaccine strain associated with protection 21 days after the second vaccination defined as titer measured by Microneutralization (MN) test ≥ 1:20. · Study design o Description of overall study design and plan This current clinical Phase1/2 study (810706) was designed to determine the safety and immunogenicity of the H5N1 influenza vaccine (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) in healthy male and female infants, children and adolescents from 6 months to 17 years. All subjects received a two dose regimen of one of two doses (7.5 μ g or 3.75 μ g HA) of H5N1 influenza vaccine (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) 21 days apart. A subset received a booster vaccination of H5N1 influenza vaccine (A/Indonesia/05/2005) 12 months after the primary vaccination (at the same dose used for primary vaccination). The study duration for each subject was at least 201 days, or approximately 381 days for the subset of subjects receiving a booster vaccination. The design of this study (810706) is in compliance with the latest version of the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for antigen of prepandemic strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 propagated in Vero cells (EMEA-000156-PIP01-07-M02), accepted by the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) of the EMA on March 11, 2011 (decision P67/2011). Subjects were stratified by age as follows: Stratum A: approximately 300 children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years. Subjects in Stratum A were vaccinated with the 7.5 μ g H5N1 HA antigen dose. A subset of at least 75 subjects received a booster vaccination. Stratum B: approximately 300 children aged 3 to 8 years. Subjects in Stratum B were randomized 1:1 to receive either the 7.5 μ g or 3.75 μ g H5N1 HA antigen dose. A subset of at least 150 subjects (75 in each dose group) received a booster vaccination. Stratum C: approximately 70 infants and young children aged 6 to 35 months. Subjects in Stratum C were randomized 1:1 to receive either the 7.5 μ g or 3.75 μ g H5N1 HA antigen dose. All subjects received a booster vaccination. Subjects were recruited into five study cohorts: Cohort 1: Cohort 1 consisted of the first approximately 30 subjects from Stratum A. Safety data obtained at Day 7 after the first vaccination was reviewed by a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and a recommendation obtained to administer the second vaccination to Cohort 1 and to proceed to Cohort 2. The DMC evaluated the following parameters: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- AEs
- Results of physical examinations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cohort 2: Cohort 2 consisted of the remaining approximately 270 subjects from Stratum A. When safety data through Day 7 after the first vaccination for approximately 120 subjects in this Cohort were available, these were reviewed by a DMC (as described above for Cohort 1) and a recommendation obtained to proceed to Cohort 3. The DMC review also included all safety data after the first and second vaccination for subjects in Cohort 1 available at that point in time.

<!-- image -->

Cohort 3: Cohort 3 consisted of the first approximately 30 subjects from Stratum B randomized 1:1 to either the 7.5 μ g or 3.75 μ g H5N1 HA antigen dose. Safety data through Day 7 after the first vaccination was reviewed by a DMC (as described above for Cohort 1) and a recommendation obtained to proceed to Cohort 4. The DMC review also included all safety data after the first and second vaccination for subjects in Stratum A available at that point in time. Cohort 4: Cohort 4 consisted of the remaining approximately 270 subjects from Stratum B and the first approximately 30 subjects from Stratum C, both randomized 1:1 to either the 7.5 μ g or 3.75 μ g H5N1 HA antigen dose. When safety data through Day 7 after the first vaccination for the approximately 30 subjects in Stratum C were available, these were reviewed by a DMC (as described above for Cohort 1) and a recommendation obtained to proceed to Cohort 5. The DMC review also included all safety data after the first and second vaccination for subjects in Stratum A and Stratum B available at that point in time. Cohort 5: Cohort 5 consisted of the remaining approximately 40 subjects from Stratum C randomized 1:1 to either the 7.5 μ g or 3.75 μ g H5N1 HA antigen dose. The study was planned to be conducted in two parts: Part A: Part A was to start with the screening visit of subjects in Strata A and B and to be concluded when the last subject in Strata A and B had completed the last visit. Part B: Part B was to start with the screening visit in Stratum C and to be concluded when the last subject enrolled in Stratum C had completed the last visit. This clinical study report is a consolidated report of Parts A and B of the study. The study plan is summarized in Figure 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results from the adult study 810701 suggest the 3.75 μ g dose may be sufficiently immunogenic for children up to 8 years. For this reason, both the 7.5 μ g and 3.75 μ g doses were investigated in children aged 3 to 8 years. Also the PDCO/EMA, expressed a concern that half the adult dose may not be sufficiently immunogenic in the youngest subset. For these reasons, both the 7.5 μ g and 3.75 μ gdoses were also investigated in children aged 6 to 35 months. Children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years are considered to be closest to adults in terms of immunogenicity and safety responses and therefore received the 7.5 μ g dose only.

- Any medication taken after vaccination (including non-steroidal anti-rheumatic drugs, and other over-the-counter-drugs). Specifically, any type of antipyretic (given for the treatment of fever or pain) taken within the first 3 hours after vaccination, between 3 and 6 hours after vaccination and later than 6 hours after vaccination was documented;

All subjects received the primary vaccination as two injections of either 7.5 μ g or 3.75 μ g μ g HA antigen strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 at a 21-day interval via intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm or in the anterolateral muscle of the thigh depending on the age of the subject. Children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years (Stratum A) were vaccinated with the 7.5 μ g H5N1 HA antigen dose. Children aged 3 to 8 years (Stratum B) and infants and young children aged 6 to 35 months (Stratum C) were randomized 1:1 to receive either the 7.5 μ g or 3.75 μ g H5N1 HA antigen dose. On Day 360 a subset of at least 375 subjects, comprising of at least75 subjects from Stratum A, and at least 150 subjects from Stratum B (75 subjects in each dose group) and 70 subjects from Stratum C (35 subjects in each dose group) received a heterologous booster vaccination, strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 at the same dose used for primary vaccination. The subject or his/her parent(s)/legal guardian(s) received a Subject Diary. The Subject Diary was divided into Parts I, II and III. Part I of the Subject Diary covered the period from vaccination up to Day 7 after each vaccination. Part II of the Subject Diary covered the period from Day 7 up to Day 21 after each vaccination. Part III of the Subject Diary was used for documentation of AEs during the follow-up period from Visit 5 (Day 42, 21 [ ± 2] days after Visit 3) until Visit 6 (Day 201 [± 14 days]) and from Visit 6 until Visit 7 (Day 360 [ ± 14 days]). The study duration for each subject was at least 201 days, or approximately 381 days for the subset of subjects receiving a booster vaccination. The subject and the subject ' s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) were properly instructed on the documentation of AEs occurring after vaccination and reporting requirements. The following information was collected in the Subject Diary: · Measurement of body temperature orally (in subjects aged 3 to 17 years) or rectally (in subjects aged 6 to 35 months), once every evening from vaccination until Day 6 after vaccination; · Injection site reactions (injection site pain, redness, swelling, and induration); · Systemic AEs (shivering, nausea, vomiting and sweating [in all age strata]; headache, malaise, fatigue, muscle pain and joint pain [in subjects aged 3 to 17 years]; irritability, inconsolable or excessive crying, disturbed sleep, loss of appetite, and drowsiness [in subjects aged 6 to 35 months]); · Other AEs; Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Information on travel activities to countries or regions for which human H5N1 influenza infections have been reported in the past. In addition, the subject was alerted (either by the investigator or the subject ' s parent(s)/legal guardian(s)) not to have close contact with live birds (e.g. at markets, farms and other places where there was an increased risk of H5N1 influenza infection).

•

Training for study personnel at the sites as well as for monitors was provided on the correct handling and use of the e-CRF system. Furthermore, monitors were trained on the Sponsor ' s SOPs, as applicable. In addition, Investigators were also trained on GCP and Good Documentation Practice (GDP) relevant issues (e.g. via Investigator Meetings). o Study population / sample size Healthy children were eligible for enrollment if they were 6 months to 17 years of age, with their parent(s) / legal representative providing signed consent form and able to understand the protocol requirements and to fill in the diary card. Subjects meeting at least one of the following criteria were ineligible for inclusion: · They have a history of exposure to H5N1 virus or a history of vaccination with an H5N1 influenza vaccine; · They are at high risk of contracting H5N1 influenza infection (e.g. contact with poultry); · They currently have or have a history of a significant neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary · (including asthma), hepatic, metabolic, rheumatic, autoimmune, hematological or renal disorder ( a significant disorder is defined as a chronic disease or medical condition associated with impaired health status, increased risk for complications, requiring medical treatment and/or follow-up); · They have any inherited or acquired immunodeficiency; · They have a disease or are currently undergoing a form of treatment or were undergoing a form of treatment within 30 days prior to study entry that can be expected to influence immune response. · Such treatment includes, but is not limited to, systemic or high dose inhaled corticosteroids, radiation treatment or other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs; · They have a history of severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis; · They have a rash, dermatological condition or tattoos which may interfere with injection site reaction rating; They have received a blood transfusion, immunoglobulins or other blood derivatives within 90 days prior to study entry; · They have received any live vaccine within 4 weeks or inactivated vaccine within 2 weeks prior to vaccination in this study; Medicinal product no longer authorised

- They have a functional or surgical asplenia;
- They have a known or suspected problem with alcohol or drug abuse;

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- They were administered an investigational drug within 6 weeks prior to study entry or are concurrently participating in a clinical study that includes the administration of an investigational product;

· They are in a dependent relationship with the study site personnel. Dependent relationships include close relatives (i.e., children, siblings); · If female: are pregnant or lactating. As recommended in Guideline EMEA/CHMP/VWP/263499/2006 , the study was to enroll approximately 300 children and adolescents (9 to 17 years of age, Stratum A) and 300 children (3 to 8 years of age, Stratum B). Additionally, approximately 70 infants and young children (6 to 35 months of age, Stratum C) were to be enrolled in this study. Assuming an approximate dropout rate of 10%, it was expected that 270 subjects in Strata A and B (and 63 subjects in Stratum C) would have evaluable immunogenicity results after two vaccinations. Between 21-December-2009 (first subject first visit) and 24-May-2012 (last subject last visit), a total of 684 subjects were enrolled at 20 centers in Australia, Finland, Singapore and Spain. o Randomization procedure For Stratum B (3 to 8 years) and Stratum C (6 to 35 months), subjects were centrally randomized at an equal number to receive either the 7.5 μ g or 3.75 μ g HA dose of the H5N1 influenza vaccine. Randomization was performed via an interactive voice response system (IVRS). Randomization was carried out in blocks with a block size &gt; 2 using the random number generator algorithm of Wichmann and Hill 19 as modified by McLeod 20. No randomization was required prior to administration of the booster vaccination, since the booster vaccination was to be administered at the same dose used for primary vaccination. All subjects in Stratum A (9 to 17 years) received the 7.5 μ g HA dose of the H5N1 influenza vaccine, so no randomization was required. o Blinding This was a partially blinded study, i.e. single blinded for children aged 3 to 8 years (Stratum B) and infants and young children aged 6 to 35 months (Stratum C) only. For this reason, measures to maintain blinding and unblinding are not applicable for this study. o Treatments All subjects received the primary vaccination as two injections of either 7.5 μ g or 3.75 μ g μ g HA antigen strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 at a 21-day interval via intramuscular injection in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm or in the anterolateral muscle of the thigh depending on the age of the subject. Children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years (Stratum A) were vaccinated with the 7.5 μ g H5N1 HA antigen dose. Children aged 3 to 8 years (Stratum B) and infants and young children aged 6 to 35 months (Stratum C) were randomized 1:1 to receive either the 7.5 μ g or 3.75 μ g H5N1 HA antigen dose. Medicinal product no longer authorised

On Day 360 a subset of at least 375 subjects, comprising of at least75 subjects from Stratum A, and at least 150 subjects from Stratum B (75 subjects in each dose group) and 70 subjects from Stratum C (35 subjects in each dose group) received a heterologous booster vaccination, strain A/Indonesia/05/2005) at the same dose used for primary vaccination.

- o Outcomes/Safety Criteria

The subject and the subject ' s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) were properly instructed on the documentation of AEs occurring after vaccination and reporting requirements. The following information was collected in the Subject Diary:

## Safety:

· Measurement of body temperature orally (in subjects aged 3 to 17 years) or rectally (in subjects aged 6 to 35 months), once every evening from vaccination until Day 6 after vaccination; · Injection site reactions (injection site pain, redness, swelling, and induration); · Systemic AEs (shivering, nausea, vomiting and sweating [in all age strata]; headache, malaise, fatigue, muscle pain and joint pain [in subjects aged 3 to 17 years]; irritability, inconsolable or excessive crying, disturbed sleep, loss of appetite, and drowsiness [in subjects aged 6 to 35 months]); · Other AEs; · Any medication taken after vaccination (including non-steroidal anti-rheumatic drugs, and other over-the-counter-drugs). Specifically, any type of antipyretic (given for the treatment of fever or pain) taken within the first 3 hours after vaccination, between 3 and 6 hours after vaccination and later than 6 hours after vaccination was documented; · Information on travel activities to countries or regions for which human H5N1 influenza infections have been reported in the past. In addition, the subject was alerted (either by the investigator or the subject ' s parent(s)/legal guardian(s)) not to have close contact with live birds (e.g. at markets, farms and other places where there was an increased risk of H5N1 influenza infection). Clinical Laboratory Assessments As requested by the EMA and in analogy with studies in adults (i.e. studies 810601 and 810705), alanine amino transferase (ALT) values were determined at Day 1 (prior to first vaccination), at Day 22 (prior to second vaccination) and at Day 43 (21 days after second vaccination) in the first approximately 100 subjects in Stratum A (children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years) and the first approximately 100 subjects in Stratum B (children aged 3 to 8 years). Based on the actual occurrence of related ALT increases in Stratum A and B and the DMC assessment (which included, besides review of AEs and results of physical examinations, review of all ALT values after the first and second vaccination from the subset of subjects in Stratum A and B available at that point in time) prior to proceeding to Cohort 5 (i.e. the remaining approximately 40 subjects from Stratum C [infants aged 6 to 35 months]), ALT investigation was to be expanded to Stratum C. o Statistical and analytical plans Analysis of Primary Endpoint: Medicinal product no longer authorised

The rates of subjects with at least one systemic reaction within 7 days after the first vaccination and their two-sided 95% CIs were calculated separately for each age stratum. The analysis was performed on the safety analysis dataset.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunogenicity:

The rates of subjects with antibody response to the vaccine strain associated with protection 21 days after the second vaccination defined as titer measured by MN test ≥ 1:20 and their two -sided 95% CIs were calculated separately for each age stratum.

In addition, a separate immunogenicity analysis within each age stratum may be performed on subjects who have versus those who have not received an H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine between 7 days after the first and 21 days after the second vaccination. The analysis was performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) dataset. o Protocol amendments The major changes to study conduct were as follows: Amendment 4, Version 2011 Mar 09 Reduction in number of subjects to be enrolled in Stratum C (infants and young children aged 6 to 35 months) (from 300 to at least 70 subjects). This was in response to difficulties in enrolment in this age stratum due to the mostly mild character of the H1N1 infections which had changed the general public's perception about the seriousness of the H1N1, with many people deeming vaccination unnecessary. As a consequence, investigators in this study experienced a strong reluctance from parents to allow their children to participate, particularly in Stratum C. Amendment 3, Version 2010 Dec 21 Reduction in the number of subjects receiving a 12-month booster vaccination in all age strata (reduced to 75 subjects in Stratum A and 150 subjects in Strata B and C). This was in order to reduce the burden on study participation for a substantial number of subjects through reduction of the number of blood draws. Based on booster data in previous clinical studies with Baxter's H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine, the immune response induced following a booster vaccination could be assumed to be substantially higher (seroprotection rates &gt; 80%) than the response observed after a two-dose primary vaccination. As a result of these higher seroprotection rates after the booster, the width of the two-sided 95% CI of the proportion of subjects with antibody response associated with protection would be substantially narrower than after the primary immunization. Therefore, a reduction in the sample size to at least 75 subjects/dose group would be sufficient to appropriately evaluate the immune response to the booster vaccination in this study. Update on the strain to be used for the booster vaccination. The H5N1 influenza vaccine containing the A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain was used for the 12-month booster vaccination. CHMP comment Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

More than 75 subjects per Stratum A and B were vaccinated with the booster vaccine at the end of the study. Only in Stratum C less than 75 subjects were boostered.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Amendment 2, Version 2009 Dec 17

Number of cohorts reduced from 6 to 5 cohorts.

This is due to preliminary safety data on Baxter's H1N1 pediatric clinical study showing a favorable safety profile, therefore the number of cohorts were amended in order to shorten the overall recruitment period.

Reduction of period in which administration of an H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine is prohibited to subjects enrolled in the study. This was due to favorable safety profile of the H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine. However, in order to try and avoid interference of H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccinations with the analysis of safety and immunogenicity endpoints of the H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine as much as possible, subjects should preferably avoid administration of an H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine until the Day 43 visit. Primary safety endpoint (frequency and severity of systemic reactions after the first and second vaccination) changed from 21 days to 7 days. In order to avoid a potential interference of vaccination with an H1N1 pandemic vaccine on analysis of the primary safety endpoint, this endpoint was amended, analyzing the frequency and severity of systemic reactions until 7 days after the first vaccination. Amendment 1, Version 2009 Sep 28 Amendments consisted of corrections and changes added for clarity/ Changes in the conduct of the study or planned analyses are summarized in each of the 4 protocol amendments to the Protocol version 2009 Jul 01.  Results · Recruitment/number analyzed Of the 684 subjects enrolled in the study, 675 subjects (300 in Stratum A, 303 in Stratum B and 72 in Stratum C) received the first vaccination on Day 1 with either 7.5 μ g or 3.75 μ g HA antigen strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (Table 1). Of these subjects, 657 (296 Stratum A, 291 Stratum B and 70 Stratum C) received the second vaccination of HA antigen strain A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004 on Day 21 at the same dose as Day 1. Of those subjects who received two primary vaccinations, 402 (191 Stratum A, 150 Stratum B and 61 Stratum C) received the booster vaccination of HA antigen strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 on Day 361 with the same dose as used in the primary vaccination (Table 1).

Nine (9) subjects were not assigned to a treatment for the following reasons; 5 withdrawals by subject (3 in Stratum A, 2 in Stratum B), 3 screen failures (2 in Stratum A, 1 in Stratum C) and 1 subject refused to give a blood sample (Stratum B), (Table 2). A total of 675 subjects (300 Stratum A, 303 Stratum B and 72 Stratum C) were available for the safety dataset, 656 subjects (296 Stratum A, 291 Stratum B and 69 Stratum C) for the intent-to-treat (ITT) dataset and 591 subjects (270 Stratum A, 259 Stratum B and 62 Stratum C) for the per-protocol (PP) dataset. CHMP comments: The study was overall well conducted, with satisfactory accrual of study subjects and implementing vaccination with study vaccines and safety outcome analysis for 100% of randomized subjects. The dropout rate (13.5%) is low for such a long study duration. · Preliminary safety analysis The H5N1 influenza vaccine was administered i.m. in a 2-dose primary vaccination scheme at a 21-day interval, followed by a heterologous booster 360 days after the first vaccination. Primary vaccination containing the strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 at a dose of 7.5 µg or 3.73 µg was administered to healthy children aged 6 months to 17 years and the heterologous booster vaccination containing the strain A/Indonesia/05/2005.

CHMP comments: Most of the subjects did not report any systemic or local reactions after vaccination. The highest rate of reporting was after the first vaccination compared to the second and booster vaccination. No real dose dependency was seen between the 7.5 µg and 3.75 µg dose groups in regards to frequency of adverse events in the age group 3 to 8 years. In the smaller age group 6 months to 35 months a higher rate of systemic reactions was observed in the higher dose group compared to the lower dose group. The majority of reactions were mild to moderate in severity. Only 5 subjects in Stratum A experienced severe systemic reactions after the first vaccination: severe fatique and severe nausea lasting 2 days from which the subject recovered; severe naopharyngitis lasting 7 days; severe myalgia lasting 3 days; severe arthralgia lasting 4 days and severe myalgia lasting 3 days; severe vomiting, myalgia and headache lasting less than 24 hours. After the second vaccination two subjects experienced severe systemic reactions. In Stratum A experienced severe fatique on the day of vaccination lasting 5 days and in Stratum C experienced severe cough one day after vaccination lasting less than 24 hours. Overall, currently no data regarding adverse reactions in pediatric population are yet available in the SmPC. Some adverse events, which were observed in children after vaccination with H5N1 strain were not listed yet (i.e. irritablitity, loss of appetite,…) and other adverse reactions were reported in different frequencies compared to adults and elderly. Comparable results were obtained when fever was assessed, which is shown in Table 3. In the next Table 3 are shown the subject with fever including the severity after each vaccination.

CHMP comment Above 39.5 °C temperature was only observed in children less than 9 years after all three administrations of pandemic influenza vaccines. A trend of a higher fever rate was seen in the higher dose groups of the 3 to 8 years children and the 6 to 35 months old children compared to the 3.75 µg dose group in both age Strata. Overall less fever was documented from vaccination to vaccination. Regarding the information of adverse reaction pyrexia it is noted currently only as common. The above mentioned Table 3 clearly demonstrated that pyrexia was observed more frequently at least in Stratum C than 1 to 10 %. Therefor action is required to update the SmPC.

After the first vaccination Injection site pain was mostly reported in all age Strata. In Stratum A injection site pain and headache were reported with a high incidence. With a lower incidence injection site pain, headache and fatigue were reported in Statum B compared to Stratum A. The smallest age group reported disturbed sleep and irritability with the highest incidence. Again action is required to update the SmPC regarding the adverse reactions observed in children after vaccination.

CHMP comment Less severe reactions were reported after the booster vaccination compared to first and second vaccination although less children were vaccinated with the booster vaccine. · H5N1 Safety Evaluation During the safety follow-up period following H5N1 administration: -There were no deaths and no vaccine-related SAEs reported during the study -In total 8 SAEs were reported, which were not associated to the study vaccine (HennochSchonlein purpurea, acute appendicitis, stomach pain, ankle fracture, stomatitis, visual field defect, abdominal injury and conjunctivitis viral) -The majority (~ 70%) of subjects did not experience any systemic or injection site reactions after vaccination and no real dose effect was seen in Stratum B and C who received either 7.5 µg or 3.75 µg HA per vaccination Injection site reaction rates within 21 days after vaccination were ≤ 30.4% in Stratum A, ≤ 37.2% and ≤ 30.6% in Stratum B and ≤ 19.4% and ≤ 19.4% in Stratum C, in the 7.5 μ g and 3.75 μ g dose group, respectively. The most commonly reported specifically queried symptom after each vaccination was injection site pain in all three strata (Table 2) Medicinal product no longer authorised

Systemic reaction rates within 21 days after the first, second and booster vaccination were ≤ 30.3% in Stratum A, ≤ 16.3% and ≤ 21.3% in Stratum B and ≤ 36.1% and ≤ 30.6% in Stratum C, in the 7.5 μ g and 3.75 μ g dose group, respectively (Table 2). The most commonly reported specifically queried symptoms of systemic reactions after each vaccination were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

headache, malaise, fatigue and muscle pain in Strata A and B. In Stratum C, irritability, inconsolable or excessive crying, disturbed sleep, loss of appetite and drowsiness were the most commonly reported symptoms after the first and second vaccination and irritability, loss of appetite and drowsiness were most commonly reported after the booster vaccination (Tables 4, 5 and 6).

Thus, due to the reports that the HI assay may not be an appropriate method for evaluation of human immune responses to avian hemagglutinin; immunogenicity evaluation was focused on the MN assay, supported by antibody response determined by SRH (as recommended by EMA).

-Fever occurred at low rates after each vaccination, with generally lower rates after the second and booster vaccination as compared to the first vaccination. Fever rates within 7 days after the first, second and booster vaccination ranged from 1.0% to 2.7% in Stratum A, from 1.4% to 6.4% in Stratum B, and from 10.7% to 19.4% in Stratum C. The majority of fever cases were ≤ 38.4 ° C 14(only five subjects had body temperatures of ≥39.5 ° C, with a highest reported body temperature of 40.0 ° C) [Table 3]. -Adverse reactions were predominantly mild or moderate in severity. Severe reactions were experienced by a total of 14 subjects (Table 7); all subjects recovered from these symptoms without sequelae. -Alanine amino transferase (ALT) levels were determined prior to the first vaccination (Day 1), prior to the second vaccination (Day 22) and 21 days after the second vaccination (Day 43) in the first approximately 100 subjects in Stratum A (children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years) and Stratum B (children aged 3 to 8 years). Only 1 subject showed an abnormal result with a toxicity grade of 1 on Day 43. CHMP comments: Pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1 was demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated in this study. The safety and reactogenicity profile of H5N1 seen was as expected, based on previous experience with this vaccine in adults and elderly. The rank order of frequency of each solicited systemic reaction observed in this study differed slightly in the younger population: pyrexia was numerically more frequent in children than in adults and elderly. Systemic reactions observed in the study were numerically in same frequency reported in children as in adults and elderly, e.g. pain. Only 8 unrelated SAEs were reported within the study and only 14 subjects reported severe systemic or local reactions after vaccination. Concerning abnormal laboratory results only 1 subject showed an abnormal result. · Preliminary immonogenicity analysis Blood was drawn at Day 1 (prior to vaccination ), Day 22 (21 ± 2 days after the first vaccination), Day 43 (21 ± 2 days after the second vaccination), Day 361, ( ± 14 days prior to booster vaccination) and Day 382 (21 ± 2 days after booster vaccination) for analysis of antibody response against the primary vaccine strain clade 1 A/H5N1/Vietnam/1203/2004, and prior to and after the booster vaccination (Day 361 and 382, respectively) for analysis of antibody response again the booster vaccine strain A/Indonesia/05/2005, using MN, SRH and HI assays. It has been demonstrated that the MN assay is more sensitive and/or specific than the HI assay for detection of functional/protective antibodies against avian influenza strains.

The number of subjects demonstrating seroconversion (defined as a minimum four-fold titer increase as compared to baseline) after the first and second vaccinations as measured by MN assay is shown in Table 8. When measured by MN assay seroconversion was observed 9.1 %, 16.4 % and 9.1% in Strata A, B and C (respectively), at 21 days after the first vaccination,for the 7.5 μ g dose study group; and 12.9% and 8.6% in Strata B and C (respectively), among those in the 3.75 μ g dose group. A

An antibody response associated with protection as determined by MN (MN titer ≥ 1:20) 21 days after the first vaccination was shown in 52.6% of subjects in Stratum A (9 to 17 years old), receiving the 7.5 μ g vaccine dose. Protection rates 21 days after the first vaccination were lower among younger subjects ( ≤ 17.1% in Stratum B [3 to 8 year olds], and ≤ 3.0% in Stratum C [6 to 35 month olds]), with more subjects showing protection after receiving the 7.5 μ g dose as compared with the 3.75 μ g dose. When determined by MN assay, rates of subjects with an MN titer associated with protection (MN titer ≥ 1:20) at Day 361 in Strata A, B and C (7.5 μ g dose group) were 31.1%, 16.5% and 28.0% (when measured against the primary vaccine strain, A/Vietnam/1203/2004 ). These rates increased by Day 382, after the heterologous booster vaccination, to: 94.1%, 94.7%, and 100.0%, respectively. In the 3.75 μ g dose group, in Strata B and C, prior to the booster vaccination, the rates were 13.5% and 19.4%, compared to after the booster vaccination, when rates were 91.7% and 93.8%. Against the A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain, 15.4%, 12.5% and 5.3% of subjects in Strata A, B and C (7.5 μ g dose), and 5.7% and 10.3% of subjects in Stratum B and C (3.75 μ g dose) showed MN titers associated with protection (MN titer ≥ 1:20) pre-booster (i.e. Day 361). After the booster, seroprotection rates against the A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain increased substantially to 93.1%, 97.2% and 100.0% (Strata A, B and C with the 7.5 μ g dose) and 91.4% and 100.0% (Strata B and C with the 3.75 μ g dose).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

substantial increase in seroconversion rate as measured by MN was observed after the second vaccination: 31.8%, 72.2%, and 65.6% in Strata A, B and C (respectively), for the 7.5 μ g dose study group; and in 53.4% and 60.0% in Strata B and C (respectively), among those in the 3.75 μ g dose group.

When measured by MN assay, the fold increase in antibody titer for Strata A, B and C (respectively), for the 7.5 μ g dose group, was 1.6, 2.1, and 1.4 at Day 22 and 3.1, 6.3 and 6.8 at Day 43 as determined by MN assay. In the 3.75 μ g dose group, in Strata B and C, the fold increases were 1.7 and 1.6 at Day 22 and 4.6 and 6.3 at Day 43. CHMP comment The H5N1 influenza vaccine (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) was shown to induce a substantial antibody response after two vaccinations in subjects aged 6 months to 17 years. In Stratum A rates of subjects achieving MN antibody titers associated with protection (MN titer ≥ 1:20) at 21 days after the second vaccination were highest with 85.4 % compared to 72.9 % in Stratum B, and 68.8 % in Stratum C, who received the 7.5 µg dose in Strata B and C. A trend of higher protection was observed among subjects in Strata B and C, who received the higher dose group compared to the lower dose group of 3.75 µg HA. These data generated in a pediatric population at 21 days after the second vaccination  should be added to the current SmPC in section 5.1. Therefor action is required to submit a Typ II-variation. A heterologous (A/Indonesia/05/2005) booster vaccination at 12 months after a two-dose primary vaccination was also shown to induce a strong antibody response against the strains used for the booster and primary vaccination. Among subjects receiving the 7.5 μ g dose, 93.1% of subjects in Stratum A, 97.2% in Stratum B and 100.0% in Stratum C showed MN antibody titers associated with protection (MN titer ≥ 1:20) against the A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain at 21 days after the booster; among those receiving the 3.75 μ g dose, these rates were 91.4% (Stratum B) and 100.0% (Stratum C). When tested against the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain, among those subjects receiving the 7.5 μ g dose, 94.1% of subjects in Stratum A, 94.7% in Stratum B, and 100.0% in Stratum C, showed MN antibody titers associated with protection (MN titer ≥ 1:20) at 21 days after the booster vaccination; among subjects receiving the 3.75 μ g dose, 91.7% and 93.8% of subjects in Strata B and C, respectively, reached these MN antibody levels. Also heterologous boosterabilty of children with H5N1 should be included in the SmPC. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Safety and reactogenicity profile of the non-adjuvanted Vero cell-derived H5N1 containing 7.5 µg or 3.75 µg HA antigen was safe and well tolerated by enrolled subjects aged 6 months to 17 years, which were enrolled in 3 age Strata.

CHMP comment Results obtained with the SRH assay are generally consistent with the MN results.Evaluating the required CHMP criteria wich were stated for influenza vaccines were investigated in the SRH-test. After two vaccinations with the H5N1 vaccine A/Vietnam strain Stratum A and the higher dose group of Stratum B achieved the CHMP criteria of seroprotection. The higher dose group given to Stratum C did not achieve the required CHMP criteria. In regards to the CHMP criterium seroconversion all Strataand dose groups achieved the required 40 % after two doses of H5N1 A/Vietnam. The same results were seen for GMTR, where all Strata and dose groups achieved the required 2.5 fold increase. One year after primary vaccination most of the subjects were primed with a heterologous strain A/Indonesia. All age Strata and both dose groups were boosterable with the heterologous  strains and achieved high antibody titers after booster vaccination. 2. CHMP overall conclusion and further action if required The study was well conducted, with all randomized participants being vaccinated and analyzed for safety and immunogenicity outcomes. The dropout rate was low. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The immune response to H5N1 vaccine in two dose groups of the clade 1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain given at a 2-dose schedule 21 days apart was assessed in 3 different age groups. In addition, the immune response to a 12 month booster vaccination with a heterologous non-adjuvanted Vero cellderived H5N1 vaccine (A/Indonesia/05/2005) containing the same dose as used for the 2-dose primary vaccination was assessed (also in the 3 pediatric age groups).

After 2-dose priming Stratum A achieved a protective level of antibodies titers of 85.4 %. Stratum B and C given two doses of 7.5 µg HA achieved antibody titers of 72.9 % in Statum B and 68.8 % in Stratum C in the MN-assay. Regarding seroconversion all three age Strata met the required antibody response in the SRH-test after two doses, which are required by CHMP for influenza vaccines. For GMT increase the antibody response was met for both doses in all three age Strata. Results of this study also demonstrated that a booster vaccination with a cross clade influenza H5N1 strain A/Indonesia/05/2005) 12 months after a 2-dose primary vaccination induces a strong antibody response against the strains used for the booster and primary vaccination. These data demonstrate that the vaccine is able to induce a cross-reactive memory response after a two dose priming that can be effectively boosted up to one year after initial priming in infants, children and adolescents aged 6 months to 17 years. Overall these data of safety and immunogenicity generated in a pediatric population should be implemented in the SmPC and PIL of the pandemic influenza vaccine H5N1. The design of this study (810706) is in compliance with the latest version of the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for antigen of prepandemic strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 propagated in Vero cells (EMEA-000156-PIP01-07-M02), accepted by the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) of the EMA on March 11, 2011 (decision P67/2011). PAC is not fulfilled - Further action is required. A Type II variation to include the paediatric data of safety and immunogenicity after two doses as well as after a booster dose with a heterologous strain  in the SmPC is deemed to be necessary.
