The RMP version 2.2 has also been submitted.                                                                             | 11/01/2018 | 15/03/2018 | SmPC and Labelling | The SmPC section 5.1 has been updated following the completion of PRI03C study with the data on long- term immune persistence following the vaccination with Vaxelis. The purpose of this study was to provide the results of the long-term persistence of anti-Hepatitis B surface antigen (antiHBsAg) and pertussis antibody (PT, FHA, PRN and FIM) responses in children previously vaccinated with Vaxelis or Infanrix hexa. The data was collected 3 to 4 years after completion of a 2+1 or 3+1 vaccination schedule. |

|                     | In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce editorial changes in Annex IIIA. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   |            |     | The proportion of children seroprotected (anti-HBsAg ≥10 mIU/mL - accepted correlate of protection) after those vaccination schedules decreased by approximately 30% in approximately 4 years. Considerable study data suggest that individuals who have ever had a seroprotective response to HB vaccination will have a memory response that is protective against clinical disease if exposed to the HB virus. The immunogenicity findings also support the long-term persistence of pertussis antibody responses. After approximately 4 years, the percentages of children with anti-pertussis antibodies above Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) were as follows: anti-PT 58.4%, anti- FHA 80.9%, anti-PRN 66.1% and anti-FIM 94.3%. Clinical data had confirmed that Vaxelis is comparable to currently licensed vaccine controls with respect to immunogenicity and safety, when given concomitantly with other licensed routine paediatric vaccines.   |
