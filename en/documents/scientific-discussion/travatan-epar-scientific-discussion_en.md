## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

This module reflects the initial scientific discussion for the approval of Travatan. This scientific discussion has been updated until 1 November 2003. For information on changes after this date please refer to module 8B.

## 1. Introduction

Travoprost  is  a  prostaglandin  analogue  intended  for  use  to  reduce  intraocular  pressure  (IOP)  in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The product is presented in a concentration of 40 µ g/ml of preserved eye drops (0.004%). The dose is one drop of Travoprost Eye Drops in the conjunctival  sac  of  the  affected  eye(s)  once  daily.  Travoprost  Eye  Drops  contains  travoprost  (AL6221), a prostaglandin analogue, in a sterile ophthalmic solution formulation and it is a selective, full agonist for the FP prostanoid receptor. FP receptor agonists are reported to reduce IOP by increasing uveoscleral outflow.

## Rationale for the product

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. It is a frequent disease and it has been estimated that 66.8 million have glaucoma, 6.7 million of whom are bilaterally blind. Open angle glaucoma is the most common type, mainly primary but also, in some cases, open angle glaucoma is secondary  to  the  exfoliation  syndrome  or  other  primary  ocular  diseases.  Glaucoma  is  an  optic neuropathy  that  leads  to  loss  of  optic-nerve  tissue  with  an  excavation  of  the  ophthalmoscopically visible  optic  nerve  head  and  consequently,  to  a  progressive  loss  of  vision.  The  elevated  IOP  is  the main risk factor for its development and reduction of IOP has been demonstrated to protect against further damage to the optic nerve, even in patients with IOP that is statistically \"normal\" (so called normal tension glaucoma).

Up to 10% of people over 40 years of age have IOPs above 21 mmHg (normal range 10 to 21 mmHg); those  who  have  such  high  pressures  but  no  optic-nerve  damage  are  considered  to  have  ocular hypertension.  In  medical  practice,  patients  who  have  ocular  hypertension  should  be  periodically examined (optic nerve, visual fields) to determine whether there is evidence of a progressive damage which  would  indicate  the  need  to  start  with  treatment.  However,  a  high  IOP  without  optic-nerve damage, in some cases (e.g. additional risk factors for glaucoma) may be treated.

The  current therapeutic approach in open angle glaucoma  is focused on lowering  IOP  by pharmacological means, surgically, or with laser therapy. Although different priorities may be given to the  laser  therapy,  it  is  generally  accepted  that  pharmacological  treatments  should  be  the  first  step, moving to laser trabeculoplasty as an alternative when medical treatment, often in combination, has failed or is unsuitable. Filtering surgery is usually done as the last step, after the previous approaches have  failed.  The  initial  target  IOP  for  each  patient  is  chosen  individually  according  to  the  current amount of optic damage and the pressure at which the damage occurred, but it will be further adjusted according  to  the  disease  progression  in  subsequent  examinations  of  visual  field.  Although  different clinical aspects will guide the choice of the target initial pressure, it is common to pursue a decrease of the IOP between 20% and 40% depending on the degree of associated damage. Once the patient has achieved a 'safe' IOP at which the disease does not progress, additional lowering of the IOP would provide marginal benefit entailing a higher risk of adverse reactions.

Medical treatment is initiated with a topical drug, a beta-blocker if contraindications are not present, and if necessary, a second topical drug is added or tested in monotherapy. The possible second line drugs  are  alpha-adrenergic  agonists  (such  as  brimonidine  or  apraclonidine),  carbonic  anhydrase inhibitors  (such  as  dorzolamide  or  brinzolamide)  and  prostaglandin  agonists  (such  as  latanoprost). Other treatments such as topical cholinergic agonists or systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have a more limited value. Beta-blockers, and particularly timolol, which is the most popular product, have an  excellent  pressure-lowering  efficacy,  long  duration  of  action  and  a  few  ocular  side  effects. However, systemic side effects of topical beta blockers (bronchospasm and cardiac side effects) may limit  its  use  in  special  populations  (patients  suffering  from  asthma,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary disease, bradycardia, elderly.). In those patients, alpha-adrenergic agonists are being increasingly used

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

as  the  first  treatment  as  are  carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitors.  Both  types  of  drugs  are  efficacious  in lowering IOP and their main side effects are ocular.

Prostaglandin analogues are the most recent pharmacological group to treat topically open angle glaucoma. Instead of decreasing the production of aqueous humor produced by the ciliary body, as the above-mentioned pharmacological treatments, these products lower the IOP by means of increasing the aqueous humor outflow through the uveoscleral pathway.

Prostaglandin analogues were not initially recommended for first-line therapy due to lack of long-term experience with this new class of medication, especially regarding safety issues. These safety issues were mainly the iris pigmentation changes, the eyelash changes and the occurrence of macular oedema. All these adverse events are known to be associated with prostaglandin analogues and they precluded the first line indication. TRAVATAN (travoprost 40 microg/ml) therefore initially gained Marketing Authorisation with a second line indication:

'Decrease  of  elevated  intraocular  pressure  in  patients  with  ocular  hypertension  or  open-angle glaucoma  who  are  intolerant  or  insufficiently  responsive  to  another  intraocular  pressure  lowering medication, as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy.'

However, the Marketing Authorisation Holder subsequently submitted a Type II variation to extend the  indication  to  first  line  therapy  and  the  following  indication  was  accepted  based  on  better understanding of the mechanism of action of prostaglandin analogues, as well as reassuring long term efficacy and safety data:

'Decrease  of  elevated  intraocular  pressure  in  patients  with  ocular  hypertension  or  open-angle glaucoma.'

## 2. Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## Composition

Travatan  eye  drops  are  formulated  as  0.004%  sterile,  preserved,  isotonic,  multidose  ophthalmic solutions using well-known excipients. They contain 40 micrograms of travoprost per ml of solution. A mixture of benzalkonium chloride, sodium edetate and boric acid is used as a preservative system. Polyoxyl hydrogenated castor oil 40 (HCO-40) is used as surfactant.

The  container,  a  2.5  ml  bottle  consists  of  a  novel  natural  syndiotactic  polypropylene  (sPP),  with  a conventional  polypropylene  dispensing  plug,  and  a  white  polypropylene  closure.  Each  filled  and sealed bottle is placed in a foil overwrap to preserve shelf life.

## Active substance

Travoprost  (INN)  is  a  new  active  substance,  a  prostaglandin  analogue  ester  prodrug  of  the  active moiety (+)-fluprostenol. The molecule has 5 chiral centres and two double bonds.

Travoprost is (5Z,13E)-(9S11R,15R)-9,11,15-trihydroxy-16-(m-trifluoromethylphenoxy)-17,18,19,20tetranor-5,13-prostadienoic acid, isopropyl ester.

Hydrolysis of Travoprost 40 µ g/ml gives the equivalent of 36,6 micrograms /ml of (+)-fluprostenol.

Information on the active substance has been supplied in the form of an EDMF.

The  commercial  manufacturing  process  is  carried  out  in  four  main  stages.  Four  compounds  are designated as starting materials: 4-(m-trifluorophenoxy)-3-hydroxy-1-butyne (CH4060),  bicyclo [3,2,0] hept-2-en-6-one (CH4065), (4-caboxybutyl) triphenylphosphonium bromide, and 2iodopropane.

The route of synthesis, elemental analysis, IR, UV/VIS, two-dimensional NMR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and  HPLC/mass  spectrometry,  have  confirmed  the  chemical  structure  of  travoprost,  with  regard  to chirality and double bond configuration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A  detailed  description  of  the  manufacturing  process  was  provided  including  reaction  conditions, quantities of materials and yields, as well as process and chemical flowchart.

The main impurities identified are the C5-C6 trans isomer, and the travoprost free acid, synthetic byproducts.

The impurity limits in the specifications are justified by toxicological studies.

The residual solvent specified, ethyl acetate (class 3 solvent used in purification) is checked by GCFID. During the manufacturing process other solvents are used, but only ethyl acetate and 1-butanol were  detected  in  batches.  The  absence  of  benzene  in  the  active  substance  is  supported  by  the  data submitted and will be checked in the first three production batches.

Potential trace lithium from a reagent was not detected. Trace metals analysis was carried out. These analyses included zirconium, magnesium and copper, which are used in the synthetic process. These metals were not found above detection limit (Cu, Mg, Zr &lt;13ppm)

The analytical methods used in routine controls are suitably described. Related substances and assay are carried out using the same HPLC methods, using a isocratic elution system and UV detection at 220 nm

A  specific  optical  rotation  test  is  included  in  the  routine  controls  and  the  diastereomeric  purity  is controlled by a suitable HPLC method.

Analytical results of three batches of active substance  manufactured by the current process met the proposed specifications, and show satisfactory uniformity.

The stability studies have generally been performed under ICH Q1A conditions, and 4ºC/ 35%RH. At the condition 40ºC / 75% RH only a batch was studied.

## Other ingredients

All the excipients are controlled by monographs in the Ph Eur, except Polyoxyl hydrogenated castor oil 40 (Polyoxyl HCO 40), which meets the requirements of the Japanese Pharmaceutical excipients monograph (JPE). This grade material was chosen because it contains a lower content of free PEG, and is considered to be acceptable.

None of the excipients are derived from materials of animal or human origin or come into contact with such materials during their manufacture, and satisfactory certificates of analysis are presented for all the excipients.

The specifications for all excipients except strong acids and bases include microbiological contamination with limits of 100 cfu per g or ml except in the case of purified water where the limit is 1 cfu/100 ml.

## Product development and finished product

Formulations containing 0 to  0.006% travoprost were developed for clinical studies, with  the same composition  of  the  formulation  proposed  for  marketing.  The  supply  of  the  active  substance  as  oil implied  the  necessity  of  a  surfactant  (castor  oil)  in  the  formulation  as  a  solubilising  agent.  The trometamol/borate/mannitol  buffer  system  was  selected  to  also  provide  the  correct  osmolality  and support the preservative.

Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) was chosen as the preservative on the basis of its well-established use in  eye  preparations.  The  concentration  of  0.015%  was  selected  on  the  basis  of  stability  data  and satisfactory preservative efficacy testing and is within the range typically used in eye preparations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

However, the addition of boric acid and disodium edetate was necessary to aid preservation against gram-negative  bacteria  and  fungi  respectively.  The  final  formulation  meets  Ph  Eur  Criteria  A  for initial and 52 week stability samples.

Sterile  filtration  was  selected  as  the  manufacturing  process  because  terminal  sterilisation  led  to deformation of the packaging components and unacceptable degradation of the active ingredient.

## Development of the novel container

Standard  low-density  polyethylene  (LDPE)  'DROP-TAINER'  bottles  resulted  in  adsorption  of  the active ingredient and classical polypropylene (PP) containers were considered insufficiently 'squeezable'. A new resin class, syndiotactic polypropylene (sPP) was used in the place of the more traditional resin due to its modest increase in flexibility and a lower rate of moisture transmission than LDPE.

The drop-size has been evaluated and averages 25 microlitres. It remains consistent when 64 doses, equivalent to one month's use in both eyes, are dispensed.

## Manufacturing process

Initial  compounding  comprises  dissolution  of  travoprost  stock  solution,  BAC  solution  and  HCO-40 trometamol, boric acid, mannitol and disodium edetate in purified water. Water to 90% final volume is added  and  the  pH  adjusted.  The  solution  is  sterile  filtered  through  two  0.22  micron  filters  before making  up  to  the  final  volume  with  water  also  passed  through  the  sterilising  filters.  The  Ethylene oxide  pre-sterilised  bottles  are  aseptically  filled  and  plugs  and  closures  fitted  before  labelling  and packaging.

Appropriate in-process controls are in place. The analytical results for three 50 or 100 litre batches of finished product showed that the manufacturing process is adequately controlled.

## Product specifications

The  finished  product  specification  is  acceptable  for  a  product  of  this  type,  and  comprises  tests  for identity  and  assay  of  active  ingredient;  degradation  products;  identity  and  assay  of  benzalkonium chloride,  boric  acid  and  disodium  edetate  pH  osmolality  colour  and  clarity  of  solution  (Ph  Eur); particulates (Ph Eur); sterility (Ph Eur) and fill volume (results of gravimetric in-process control).

Travoprost  is  identified  by  TLC  and  RP-HPLC  and  assayed  by  the  same  HPLC  method.    Three degradation products are named in the specification: AL-5848, AL-12419 and AL-12535.

Unspecified  degradation  products  are  reported  and    an  upper  limit  for  individual  unspecified impurities is set. This product meets ICH impurity guidelines.

## Stability of the product

Three batches have been placed on stability trial. A variety of storage conditions have been studied: long-term  at  25ºC/40%RH  (52  weeks);  accelerated  at  40ºC/15%RH  and  30ºC/40%RH;  accelerated light conditions with and without carton; 4ºC/35%RH and freeze-thaw cycles.

The stability data support the shelf life as can be found in the SPC with no special storage precaution and a shelf life after first opening of 28 days.

## 3. Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects

## Pharmacodynamics

Pharmacodynamic studies have been carried out to assess the potency and selectivity of travoprost in reducing intra ocular pressure (IOP) and improving optic nerve head blood flow (ONHBF). The exact mechanism(s) by which travoprost reduces IOP has not been fully elucidated to date. It is known that PGF2 α and latanoprost, a PGF2 α analogue, increase aqueous humour outflow through the uveoscleral pathway in the cynomolgus monkey and man. Travoprost (AL-6221), a synthetic prostaglandin PGF2 α analogue, is a pro-drug of its free-acid active form (AL-5848), a selective and potent full agonist of the prostaglandin FP receptor. Travoprost by analogy to the action of PGF2 α and latanoprost is anticipated to lower IOP by an action on uveoscleral outflow.

## In vitro studies

The receptor binding affinity of travoprost has been studied in the bovine corpus luteum assay, ligand binding  assays,  and  FP  mediated  stimulation  of  phosphoinositol  turnover.  The  potency  and  agonist activity  of  travoprost  has  been  compared  to  other  prostanoids  such  as  latanoprost  and  unoprostone. Travoprost  was  observed  to  be  a  selective  agonist  at  the  FP  prostanoid  receptor.  Compared  to latanoprost  and  unoprostone,  the  free  acid  (AL-5848)  of  travoprost  was  observed  to  have  higher potency, greater selectivity and full agonist properties for the prostaglandin FP receptor.

## In vivo studies

The ability of travoprost to reduce IOP was evaluated in ocular hypertensive monkeys using a multiple dose protocol. Travoprost significantly reduced IOP  in monkeys  after once and twice daily administration. IOP response was sustained through 24 hours, and returned to baseline by 48 hours after the last once daily instillation of travoprost. An increase in ONHBF was evident in rabbits after topical administration of travoprost for seven days. No effects on systemic blood pressure, heart rate or acidbase  status  were  observed.  A  single  subcutaneous  dose  of  vehicle  or  travoprost  produced  no significant changes in the electroretinogram in rabbits. This finding suggests that travoprost produces no  functional  changes  in  the  photoreceptors  or  the  inner  retinal  layers  of the  eye  at  doses approximately 2000-fold higher than the maximum recommended clinical dose.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

AL-5848  was  essentially  inactive  at  a  variety  of  common  central  and  peripheral  receptors  e.g. adenosine, alpha-1 adrenergic, alpha-2 adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, muscarinic, nicotinic, dopamine, serotonin,  melatonin  and  glutamate  receptors.  Therefore,  potential  for  pharmacodynamic  drug interactions is low.

## General and safety pharmacology programme

## Ocular effects

In  rabbits,  travoprost  produced  a  significant  incidence  of  hyperaemia  (~30%)  during  the  first  two hours following ocular instillation. However, at five hours after dosing conjunctival hyperaemia could no longer be detected. Hyperaemia can result from a vasodilatory effect of different agents and this finding has been also observed with other locally applied prostanoids.

## Systemic Effects

Although  systemic  exposure  to  travoprost,  or  its  active  free-acid  form,  is  likely  to  be  negligible,  a thorough investigation  of  systemic  pharmacology  has  been  undertaken,  with  evaluation  of  potential effects  on the CNS, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, renal system and the uterus.

CNS effects in mice using doses of up to 30 µ g/kg of travoprost were minimal. In the rat, at i.v. doses of up to 250-fold in excess of the therapeutic clinical dose, travoprost produced no significant effects on the cardiovascular system of rats. In the dog, similar i.v. doses of travoprost and its free acid form produced significant changes in all cardiovascular parameters (29-50% increase in cardiac

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

contractility). The responses were much attenuated at lower i.v. doses. Tests in dog cardiac Purkinje fibers  showed  that  travoprost  has  no  biologically  meaningful  effect  on  action  potential  duration, resting  membrane  potential,  maximum  rate  of  depolarization  or  upstroke  amplitude.  These in  vitro results suggest no significant potential for QT interval prolongation by travoprost in clinical use.

Travoprost given i.v. to guinea pigs or to rats produced no meaningful effects on the respiratory or renal systems, respectively. Effects on GI propulsion and induction of uterus contraction occurred as a result  of  the  prostanoid  receptor  agonist  activity  of  AL-5848.  However,  the  doses/concentrations required to produce such effects were many fold higher than those anticipated in clinical use.

## Pharmacokinetics

The  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  of  travoprost  have  been  studied  in  rats  by administration of [ 3 H]-travoprost by the oral, i.v. and s.c. routes, and in rabbits, dogs and monkeys by the topical ocular route. The analytical method used was fully validated for precision, accuracy and stability for each species and matrix.

## Absorption

After ocular topical administration, travoprost is well absorbed into the eye and systemic circulation of rabbits and dogs. Maximal concentrations in the aqueous humour and iris-ciliary body were measured at  1  hour after  administration. Maximal plasma concentrations are reached at approximately 30 min after ocular administration.

The bioavailability of oral travoprost was found to be low in rats. However, with s.c. administration of travoprost,  maximal  plasma  concentrations  and  AUCs  increased  in  a  dose-proportional  manner. Following i.v. administration, plasma concentrations of travoprost declined in a biphasic manner with a mean elimination half-life of 15.6 minutes. A moderate volume of distribution (Vdbeta, 2.6 L/kg) and rapid clearance (CLTotal, 6.9 L/kg hr) were also found.

Travoprost  was  absorbed  transdermally  in  rabbits.  Therefore,  although  it  is  likely  that  travoprost  is absorbed through human skin to a lesser extent than rabbit, this possibility is mentioned in the SPC.

## Distribution

At 30 min after ocular administration of 3 H-travoprost to the rabbit, radioactivity was highest in the cornea &gt; conjunctiva &gt; iris ciliary body &gt; aqueous humour. At 1 hour, concentrations had decreased in the  cornea  and  conjunctiva,  but  increased  in  all  other  tissues.  At  1-2  hours,  the  radioactivity concentration  peaked  in  the  aqueous  humour,  iris  ciliary  body,  lens,  choroid,  retina  and  vitreous humour, and declined thereafter. The terminal half-lives of radioactivity in the cornea and lens were estimated to be ca 14 and 29 hours respectively.

Single  or  repeated-dose  s.c.  administration  of 3 H-travoprost  to  rats  produced  highest  radioactivity concentrations in the kidneys, liver, lung and plasma. In pregnant rats, radioactivity levels in amniotic fluid and foetal tissues were ca 3% of those in maternal plasma. Radioactivity was secreted in milk in lactating rats, maximal secretion occurring at 6 hours (milk:plasma radioactivity 11:1). AL-5848 was moderately ( ca 80%) bound to plasma proteins in rat, monkey and human plasma in vitro.

## Metabolism

Metabolism, which is the major route of elimination of both travoprost and AL-5848, has been studied in  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys.  Pathways  of  AL-5848  metabolism  resemble  those  of  endogenous prostaglandin-F2 α , including reduction of the delta 13-14 double bond, oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl and beta-oxidative cleavages of the carboxylic acid side chain

The  only  metabolites  detected  in  man  were  the  15-oxo-1,2,-dinor  compounds  with  a  saturated  and unsaturated  13,14  bond,  whereas  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  the  corresponding  tetranor compounds were also present. All four metabolites were identified in urine/plasma in the rat. In the monkey, metabolites containing the reduced ∆ -13 double bond were not detected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Excretion

Following a single dose of 3 H-travoprost to rats, overall excretion of radioactivity (at 168h) was 34.6% and  74.0%  in  urine  and  faeces  respectively.  Only  0.3%  of  dose  remained  in  the  carcass.  Using  a similar dosing regimen in bile-duct cannulated rats, 54% of dosed radioactivity was recovered in bile over 72 h; 51.6% was excreted in the first 4 h.

## Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

In a non-GLP ocular study in the rabbit involving the use of eye drops (containing concentrations of travoprost of up to 25 times the strength of the 0.004% solution), the treated animals showed minimal to moderate hyperaemia with a similar level of ocular discomfort, but there were no signs of systemic toxicity.  I.v.  administration  of  travoprost  in  the  rat  produced  no  toxic  signs  at  10  mg/kg,  whereas mortalities occurred at higher doses, the LD50 being estimated as 65 mg/kg. In the mouse, i.v. doses up to 100 mg/kg resulted in no mortalities, although lethargy was apparent at 25-100 mg/kg and diarrhoea at 100 mg/kg. A similar pattern of acute toxicity has been reported for other prostanoids.

## Repeated dose toxicity

Repeated-dose ocular studies in the rabbit, up to 6 months in  duration, were  uneventful apart from some minor changes in serum chemistry parameters. In the 6-month study, the NOAEL corresponded to ca 5  times the maximum intended clinical exposure. The plasma concentration of AL-5848 at 30 min after dosing was 8-18 times the clinical Cmax. In a 12-month ocular study in the monkey, increased iris pigmentation and minor corneal epithelium surface irregularity were observed with both travoprost and the positive control latanoprost, and so appear to be class effects for PGF2 α analogues. The slight, species-specific, enlarged-eye syndrome observed with travoprost at doses similar to those intended for clinical use has also been reported for other prostanoid receptor agonists.

Repeated-dose systemic toxicity studies up to 6 months' duration in rodents were uneventful in the mouse but revealed dose-related hyperostosis and endosteal fibrosis in femur and sternum, as well as splenic extramedullary haematopoiesis in the rat. The effects on bone appear to be pharmacologically mediated and are possibly specific to the rat. At the NOAEL for effects on bone, plasma AL-5848 concentration was virtually 100 times the anticipated clinical Cmax.

## Genotoxicity

The standard battery of genotoxicity tests, three in-vitro and two in-vivo studies, showed no evidence of genotoxic potential. Bacterial reverse mutation assays in S. typhimurium and E. coli were negative. In  one  mouse  lymphoma  assay,  there  were  somewhat  equivocal  results,  but  a  repeat  assay  was negative.  A  mouse  micronucleus  assay  and  a  rat  bone  marrow  chromosome  aberration  assay,  both gave negative results.

## Carcinogenicity

The carcinogenic potential of travoprost has been investigated in two-year studies in rats and mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential at  doses  up  to  and  including  100 µ g/kg/day  when administered by s.c. injection to rats or mice.

## Reproduction toxicity

A  conventional  series  of  reproductive  toxicity  studies  has  been  undertaken  in  the  rat  and  mouse. Studies in the pregnant rabbit revealed significant foetal loss. In rodents, the reproductive toxicity of travoprost was characterised by early resorptions, post-implantation loss, reduced foetal weight and increased  skeletal  malformations,  the  effects  being  more  pronounced  in  the  mouse  than  the  rat. Reduced duration of gestation and adverse effects on pup survival were also observed. The effects on reproduction are those expected for the pharmacological activity of travoprost. The use of Travatan in women who are or may become pregnant should therefore be contraindicated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special studies

Travoprost showed no potential for delayed contact sensitisation in the guinea pig maximisation test. Furthermore, no potential of travoprost to induce a carcinogenic response was found in a SHE assay (cell transformation assay in Syrian hamster embryo cells).

An exploratory study in the rabbit demonstrated that significant systemic exposure to AL-5848 can result from dermal application of travoprost eye drops. Exposure of unprotected skin to travoprost may thus result in systemic exposure. This issue is addressed in the SPC.

## Environmental risk assessment

No significant intrinsic hazardous properties have been associated with travoprost, its metabolites of degradation products, based upon a significant battery of studies in mammalian species investigating various aspects of toxicity. A Phase I environmental risk assessment showed that travoprost is likely to be well below the recommended threshold levels for the aqueous and soil compartments. Based on the data submitted, no adverse environmental effects are predicted for travoprost.

## 4. Part IV: Clinical aspects

All clinical trials were performed according to GPC standards and agreed international ethical principles.

## Clinical pharmacology

## Pharmacodynamics

In a dose finding study (C-97-02), Travoprost was found to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in man about two hours after administration, and its maximum effect (-6.6 to -8.5 mmHg) was reached after approximately twelve hours. IOP reduction with travoprost was maintained for at least 24 hours. The exact mechanism(s) by which travoprost reduces IOP has not been fully elucidated to date. Drugs that lower IOP either decrease the formation rate or increase the drainage rate of aqueous humour. It is known that PGF2 α and latanoprost, a PGF2 α analogue, increase aqueous humour outflow through the uveoscleral pathway in the cynomolgus monkey and man. Travoprost, a synthetic prostaglandin PGF2 α analogue, is a prodrug of a highly selective, potent (Ki= 52 nM), full agonist of the prostaglandin FP receptor. Thus, travoprost, by analogy to the action of PGF2 α and latanoprost, is anticipated to lower IOP by an action on uveoscleral outflow. The IOP lowering effect of travoprost has been assessed in two  dose-finding  (Studies C-96-52  and  C-97-02).  These  studies  are  described  under Dose response studies and main clinical studies.

## Pharmacokinetics

The clinical pharmacokinetics of travoprost has been investigated in three multiple dose topical ocular studies: Studies C-99-08, C-99-97 and C-00-05. Study C-99-08 was conducted in normal volunteers to characterise the steady-state pharmacokinetics of Travoprost and AL-5848 acid metabolite following topical  ocular  administration  of  Travoprost  0.004%  and  Travoprost  0.0015%.  Study  C-99-97  was conducted  in  subjects  with  normal  renal  function  or  renal  impairment.  The  objective  was  to characterise  the  steady-state  pharmacokinetics  of  Travoprost  and  its  acid  metabolite  (AL-5848) following  topical  ocular  administration  of  Travoprost  0.004%.  Study  C-00-05  was  carried  out  in subjects with normal hepatic function or hepatic impairment.

Following once daily topical ocular administration of Travoprost 15 µ g/ml and 40 µ g/ml Eye Drops to healthy volunteers (Study C-99-08) for 7 days, low systemic exposure to AL-5848 was demonstrated. Peak AL-5848 plasma concentrations of 25 pg/ml or less were observed between 10 and 30 minutes post-dose. Thereafter, plasma levels declined rapidly to below the 10 pg/ml assay quantitation limit at 1  hour  post-dose.  Due  to  the  low  plasma  concentrations  and  rapid  elimination  following  topical dosing, the elimination half-life of AL-5848 in man could not be determined. The similarity of AL5848 plasma concentrations on Day 1 and Day 7 would indicate no plasma accumulation.

Metabolism is the major route of elimination of both travoprost and AL-5848. In  vivo and in  vitro , travoprost  is  rapidly  hydrolysed  to  AL-5848  by  esterases.  The  metabolic  pathway  of  AL-5848

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

parallels that of latanoprost and endogenous PGF2 α , which is characterised by reduction of the 13-14 double bond, oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl and β -oxidative cleavages of the upper side chain.

In order to assess potential clinical exposure to travoprost metabolites, plasma samples from subjects with severe renal impairment (C-99-97) and severe hepatic impairment (C-00-05) were screened by HPLC/MS/MS. Overall, these findings indicate negligible levels of metabolites in human plasma even in subjects with severely compromised renal or hepatic function. There seems to be no necessity to adjust  the  dose  when  travoprost  is  administered  to  patients  with  diverse  degree  of  renal  or  hepatic impairment.

No specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients under 18 years of age.

## Interaction studies

No  studies  evaluating  drug-drug  interactions  have  been  performed.  Since  travoprost  undergoes  a biotransformation  pathway  similar  to  endogenous  prostaglandin-F2 α ,  and  since  systemic  levels  of active metabolite following topical ocular administration are negligible, interactions with concomitant medications in patients receiving topical ocular doses is unlikely. In vitro experiments have shown the travoprost  free  acid  to  be  moderately  bound  (about  80%)  to  plasma  proteins  in  humans,  indicating drug-drug interactions through protein binding to be unlikely.

## Clinical efficacy

The application consisted of a total of 10 complete trials: two phase I studies, two phase II studies and six phase III studies. The phase II/III studies included the two main dose-finding phase II studies (C96-52, C-97-02) and three pivotal phase III monotherapy studies (C-97-71, C-97-72, C-97-79) and one pivotal phase III study in adjunctive therapy with timolol (C-97-73). There were two additional studies for efficacy and safety: one phase II plus brimonidine and one phase III open label. In addition to these complete  studies,  seven  ongoing  studies  were  included  in  the  submission.  The  target  population included in pivotal trials  was  males and females of any race, aged 63,8 (mean) diagnosed of openangle  glaucoma  (with  or  without  pigment  dispersion  or  pseudoexfoliation  component)  or  ocular hypertension.  Patients  in  pivotal  trials  were  required  to  have  open-angle  glaucoma  or  ocular hypertension  with  an  IOP  of  24-36  mmHg  at  8/9  a.m.,  and  21-36  mmHg  at  10/11  a.m  and  21-36 mmHg at 4 p.m.

## Dose-response studies and main clinical studies

## Study C-96-52

Study C-96-52 was a four-week, randomised, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel group  dose-response  study.  The  main  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  IOPlowering efficacy of three concentrations of Travoprost Ophthalmic Solution compared to vehicle in adult patients of any race and either sex with primary open-angle glaucoma (with or without pigment dispersion  or  pseudoexfoliation  component)  or  ocular  hypertension.  A  total  of  138  patients  were randomised to travoprost in concentrations of 0.0001%, 0.001% and 0.002% or placebo. All groups received  the  topical  ocular  medication,  one  drop,  once  daily  in  each  eye  for  28  days.  The  primary efficacy  variable  was  mean  IOP  reduction  from  a  diurnally  adjusted  baseline  in  the  patient's  worse eye.

Results  demonstrated  dose-dependent  IOP  reductions  with  increasing  concentrations  of  travoprost, which  were  significantly  greater  than  Vehicle  at  all  IOP  measurement  times  (p &lt; 0.02).  Overall,  the greatest IOP lowering efficacy was produced by travoprost 0.002%, with IOP changes ranging from 5.6 to -7.4 mmHg with a 24-h duration of action. The results of this study suggest that the maximum effective  dose  was  not  established  since  there  was  a  significant  difference  between  0.001%  and 0.002% at the 8 AM (trough) and 10 AM time points.

## Study C-97-02

This study had the same entry criteria and primary endpoint as study C-96-52. A total of 227 patients were randomised to travoprost in concentrations of 0.001%, 0.002%, 0.004% and 0.006% or placebo. All groups received the topical ocular medication, one drop, once daily in each eye for 28 days.

All four concentrations of Travoprost (0.001%, 0.002%, 0.004% and 0.006%) produced significantly greater IOP reduction than Vehicle at all IOP measurement times (p ≤ 0.0001).  Travoprost 0.004% and 0.006% produced significantly greater IOP reduction relative to travoprost 0.001% at all time points (p&lt;0.05). The greatest IOP lowering efficacy was produced by travoprost 0.004% with IOP changes ranging from -6.6 to -8.5 mmHg with a 24 h duration of action.

## Main studies

## Monotherapy

## Study C-97-71

## 1.  Description of the study

This was a 12-month, randomised, double blind, multicenter, active-controlled, parallel group study. All patients, of any race and either sex, were diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma (with or without pigment dispersion or pseudoexfoliation component) or ocular hypertension. All eligible patients were required to have post-washout IOP measurements at 8 AM of 24 mmHg to 36 mmHg, inclusive, in a least  one  eye  (the  same  eye)  at  both  eligibility  1  and  2  visits.  Additionally,  10  AM  and  4  PM  IOP measurements were required to be 21 mmHg to 36 mmHg in a least one eye (the same eye) at both eligibility 1 and 2 visits.

Eight hundred and one (801) eligible patients who met all inclusion criteria were randomised equally into one of four treatments groups and dosed once-daily with either travoprost 0.0015% (n=205) or 0.004%  (n=200)  or  latanoprost  0.005%  (n=196)  or  twice  daily  with  timolol  0.5%  (n=200)  for  a treatment period of 12 months.

## 2.  Primary endpoints/assays

The primary efficacy variable was mean IOP in patient's worse eye at 8 AM, 10 AM and 4 PM. IOP was measured at 8AM, 10 AM and 4 PM on week 2, month 3, month 6 and month 12 visits and at 8 AM and 10 AM on month 1.5, month 4.5 and month 9 visits.

## 3.  Statistical analysis

All  patients  who  received  drug  were  considered  evaluable  for  safety  analysis.  All  patients  who received  drug  and  had  at  least  one  on-therapy  visit  were  considered  evaluable  for  intent-to-treat analysis. The primary analysis was performed on only those patients who met the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria and on all data points ruled evaluable. The statistical objectives of this study were  to  demonstrate  that:  1)  Travoprost  0.004%  is  non  inferior  to  timolol  0.5%  in  IOP  lowering efficacy,  2)  Travoprost  0.0015%  is  non  inferior  to  timolol  0.5%  in  IOP  lowering  efficacy,  3) Travoprost 0.004% is non inferior to latanoprost 0.005% in IOP lowering efficacy and 4) Travoprost 0.004% is superior to travoprost 0.0015% in IOP lowering efficacy.

Hypothesis tests were performed using repeated measures ANOVA. Non-inferiority was deemed to have been established if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference between  travoprost  and  timolol  (travoprost-timolol)  was  less  than  1.5  mmHg.  Mean  IOP  was  also estimated  by  the  least  squares  means  from  the  repeated  measures  analysis  of  variance.  Descriptive statistics were calculated for IOP, IOP change from baseline, and percent change from baseline.

## RESULTS

## 4 Study populations/accountability of patients

Eight hundred and one (801) patients were randomized to one of four treatments. All of them received active substance and were included in the safety analysis. Of the 801 randomized patients, 787 were assessed for the ITT analysis. The 14 remaining patients were excluded from the ITT analysis due to no on-treatment visit data.

Seven hundred and sixty (760) patients were included in the per protocol analysis. Protocol deviation was the reason for the remaining 41 patients not being included into the per protocol analysis.. One hundred and twenty-three (123) patients discontinued study. Main reasons were: Adverse event (47), Non-compliance (5), Inadequate control of IOP (14), Patient decision (5), Non qualifying IOP (16), Lost of follow up (10), Site closure (13), Use of contraindicated medications (6), Other (7).

## 5.  Efficacy results

Of the 787 patients included in the ITT analysis, 392 were male and 395 were female. The mean age of the patients was 64.2 years and the ages ranged from 22 to 94. The frequencies of patients by race

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  566  Caucasian,  177  Black,  6  Asian  and  38  other  races  as  follows:  37  Hispanic  and  1  Native American. The diagnoses were distributed as follows: 530 patients were diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma, 247 with ocular hypertension, 6 with pigmentary glaucoma and 4 with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma.

There were no statistically significant demographic differences among treatment groups at baseline

Travoprost  (0.0015%  and  0.004%)  dosed  once  daily  produced  IOP  reductions  that  were  equal  or superior to IOP reductions produced by Timolol 0.5% dosed twice daily at all visits over the twelvemonth treatment period based on tests of non-inferiority.

Subsequent to the tests of non-inferiority, superiority of Travoprost to Timolol was demonstrated by greater IOP reductions ranging from 1.0 to 1.8 mmHg at 16 of 18 visits in the Travoprost 0.0015% group and 1.1 to 1.9 mmHg at 17 of 18 visits in the Travoprost 0.004% groups.

The IOP reductions produced by Travoprost 0.004% and 0.0015% were non inferior to those produced by  Latanoprost  0.005%  dosed  once-daily  at  all  visits  over  the  twelve  month  treatment  period.  Non inferiority  of  travoprost  (for  both  concentrations)  vs.  latanoprost  was  reflected  by  upper  95% confidence limits that  were  less  than  +1.5  mmHg at  all  the  time  points  comparing  the  groups.  The largest values for the upper 95% confidence limit were +1.08 mmHg for the comparison travoprost 0.004% to latanoprost 0.005% and +1.2 mmHg for travoprost 0.0015% to latanoprost 0.005%. Mean IOPs  were  lower  for  Travoprost  (up  to  0.9  mmHg  for  0.0015%  and  up  to  1.3  mmHg  for  0.004%) compared  to  Latanoprost  0.005%  at  4  of  5  visits  over  the  first  1.5  months  of  therapy  and  the differences were statistically significant at 3 of the time points (0.004% vs. latanoprost)

The IOP reductions produced by Travoprost 0.004% were greater than  those produced by Travoprost 0.0015% at most treatment visits by up to 0.5 mmHg, although these differences were not significant. The by visit analysis demonstrated that the mean IOP produced by travoprost 0.004% was lower than that produced by travoprost 0.0015% at 13 of 18 visits.

Travoprost dosed once daily produced clinically relevant and statistically significant reductions from baseline. The IOP reductions were statistically significant compared to baseline at all treatment visits and ranged from -5.9 to -7.7 mmHg in the 0.0015% group and from -6.6 to -8.0 mmHg in the 0.004% group.

The clinical relevance of the IOP reductions was further demonstrated by the percent of patients in each treatment group who responded to treatment. A clinically relevant response  was considered if their IOP decreased to 17 mmHg or lower, or if their IOP decreased by 30% or more. The percentage of responders was54.7% for travoprost 0.004%, 49.3% for travoprost 0.0015%,  49.6% for latanoprost and 39.0% for timolol.

## Study C-97-72

## 1.  Description of the study

This was a 6-month, randomised, double blind, multicenter, active-controlled, parallel group study to compare the  safety  and  efficacy  of  travoprost  0.0015%  and  0.004%  dosed  once  daily  with  timolol 0.5% dosed twice daily. This study had the same entry criteria and primary endpoint as study 97-71. Also the same hypotheses as those used in study 97-71 comparing travoprost with timolol were tested.

## RESULTS

## 2 Study populations/accountability of patients

Six hundred and five (605) patients were randomized to one of three groups of treatments. All of them received the drug and were included in the safety analysis. Eleven patients were excluded from the ITT analysis due to no on-treatment visit data and so, 594 were included in the ITT analysis.

The PP analysis included 557 patients of the 605 randomized, since 48 patients were excluded from the PP analysis due to protocol deviations.

Five hundred and twelve (512) patients completed the study. Ninety three (93) patients discontinued study  prematurely.  Main  reasons  were:  Adverse  event  (23),  Inadequate  control  of  IOP  (8),  Patient decision  (5),  Lost  of  follow  up  (1),  Ineligible  entry  criteria  or  protocol  deviation,  including:  Non

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

qualifying  IOP,  Use  of  contraindicated  medications,  Concurrent  investigational  medication,  Noncompliance (56).

## 3.  Efficacy results

Of the 594 patients included in the ITT analysis, 293 were male and 301 were female. The mean age of the patients was 63.7 years and the ages ranged from 21 to 91; 274 patients (46%) were younger than 65 years at the time of the enrolment. The frequencies of patients by race were 488 Caucasian, 63 Black,  4  Asian  and  39  other  races  as  follows:  36  Hispanic,  1  Native  American,  1  Indian,  and  1 Spanish/Irish. The diagnoses were distributed as follows: 382 patients were diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma, 196 with ocular hypertension, 14 with pigmentary glaucoma and 2 with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma.

There were no statistically significant demographic differences among treatment groups at baseline. Travoprost  (0.0015%  and  0.004%)  dosed  once  daily  produced  IOP  reductions  that  were  equal  or superior  to  IOP  reductions  produced  by  timolol  0.5%  dosed  twice  daily  based  on  tests  of  noninferiority. Superiority to timolol 0.5% was demonstrated at 9 of 13  (vs. 0.0015% group) and 10 of 13 (vs. 0.004%) treatment visits.

Comparisons of Travoprost vs. timolol (travoprost 0.004% vs. Timolol 0.5% and travoprost 0.0015% vs. Timolol 0.5%) were planned and carried out as tests of non inferiority. The per protocol data set was used for the non inferiority tests and the ITT data set was used for the superiority tests. For all tests,  comparisons  were  made  first  between  travoprost  0.004%  and  timolol  0.5%  then  travoprost 0.0015% and timolol, in accordance with the planned sequential testing strategy.

The  95%  confidence  limits  in  the  PP  population  showed  that  travoprost  0.004%  and  travoprost 0.0015%  were  non  inferior  to  timolol  0.5%  at  all  treatments  visits  for  both  the  combined  and individual visit results. All the upper 95% confidence intervals were less than +1.5 mmHg, the upper limit of clinical relevance established to demonstrate non inferiority in this study. The largest value for the upper 95% confidence limit was +0.42 mmHg.

Subsequent to the tests of  non-inferiority,  superiority  of  travoprost  to  timolol  was  demonstrated  by greater IOP reductions at 10 of 13 visits for the travoprost 0.004%/timolol comparison and at 9 of 13 for travoprost 0.0015%/ timolol comparison.

Travoprost  (0.0015%  and  0.004%)  dosed  once  daily  produced  clinically  relevant  and  statistically significant IOP reductions from baseline. IOP changes were greatest in the travoprost 0.004% group and ranged from -6.6 to -8.0 mmHg when compared to those treated with travoprost 0.0015% --5.9 to -7.5 mmHg) and timolol (-5.2 to -7.1 mmHg).

The clinical relevance of the IOP reductions was further demonstrated by the percent of patients in each treatment group who responded to treatment. A clinically relevant response was considered if IOP decreased to 17 mmHg or lower, or if their IOP decreased by 30% or more. The percentage of responders was 50.5% for travoprost 0.004%, 45.1% for travoprost 0.0015% and 35.4% for timolol. The IOP reductions produced by both concentrations of travoprost were maintained over the 6-month treatment  period.  The  IOP  reductions  produced  by  Travoprost  0.004%  were  greater  than  those produced by Travoprost 0.0015% at most treatment visits by up 0.7 mmHg, although these differences were not significant.  The  by  visit  analysis  demonstrated  that  the  mean  IOP  produced  by  travoprost 0.004% was lower than produced by travoprost 0.00015% at 8 of 13 visits.

## Study C-97-79

## 1.  Description of the study

This was a 9-month, randomised, double blind, multicenter, active-controlled, parallel group study to compare the safety and efficacy of 0.0015% and 0.004% once daily travoprost with 0.5% twice daily timolol.  This  study  had  the  same  entry  criteria  and  primary  endpoint  as  study  97-71  except  that measurements  were  taken  at  9  a.m.  and  11  a.m.  rather  than  8  a.m.  and  10  a.m.  Also  the  same hypotheses as those used in study 97-71 comparing travoprost with timolol were tested.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## RESULTS

## 2 Study populations/accountability of patients

Five hundred and seventy-three (573) patients were randomized to one of three groups of treatments. All of them received the drug and were included in the safety analysis. One patient was excluded from the ITT analysis due to no on-treatment visit data and so, 572 were included in the ITT analysis.

The PP analysis included 507 patients of the 573 randomized, since 66 patients were excluded from the PP analysis due to protocol deviations.

Five hundred  and  twenty-four    (524)  patients completed  the  study. Forty-nine (49) patients discontinued  study  prematurely.  Main  reasons  were:  Adverse  event  (27),  Non-compliance  (3), Inadequate control of IOP (10), Patient decision (3), Lost of follow up (2), Ineligible entry criteria or protocol deviation, including women not menopausal (3), Patient moved to other location (1).

## 3.  Efficacy results

Of the 572 patients included in the ITT analysis, 284 were male and 288 were female. The mean age of the patients was 63.3 years and the ages ranged from 31 to 88; 296 patients ( 52%) were younger than 65 years at the time of the enrolment. The frequencies of patients by race were 560 Caucasian, 7 Black,  4  Asian  and  1  other  races.  The  diagnoses  were  distributed  as  follows:  313  patients  were diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma, 221 with ocular hypertension, 9 with pigmentary glaucoma and 29 with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma.

There were no statistically significant demographic differences among treatment groups at baseline.

Based on tests of non-inferiority, travoprost (0.0015% and 0.004%) dosed once daily produced IOP reductions that were equal or superior to IOP reductions produced by timolol 0.5% dosed twice daily. Superiority of 0.004% to timolol 0.5% was demonstrated at 9 AM, 11 AM and 4 PM, combined across all treatment visits.

The  95%  confidence  limits  in  the  PP  population  showed  that  travoprost  0.004%  and  travoprost 0.0015% were non inferior to timolol 0.5% since intervals were less than +1.5 mmHg, the upper limit of clinical relevance established to demonstrate non inferiority in this study. The largest value for the upper 95% confidence limit was +0.88 mmHg.

Subsequent to the tests of  non-inferiority,  superiority  of  travoprost  to  timolol  was  demonstrated  by greater  IOP  reductions  at  10  of  15  visits  for  the  travoprost  0.004%/timolol  comparison..  These combined data showed that the IOP lowering efficacy of travoprost relative to timolol improves over the course of the day.

Travoprost  0.0015%  and  0.004%  dosed  once-daily  produced  clinically  relevant  and  statistically significant  IOP  reductions  from  baseline  at  all  treatment  visits.  The  IOP  changes  observed  for travoprost ranged from -7.1 to -8.4 mmHg for the 0.0015% concentration and from -8.1 to -9.0 for travoprost 0.004%. These changes ranged from -6.5 to -7.9 mmHg for timolol.

The clinical relevance of the IOP reductions was further demonstrated by the percent of patients in each treatment group who responded to treatment. A response was considered clinically relevant if the IOP decreased to 17 mmHg or lower, or if their IOP decreased by 30% or more. The percentage of responders was 63.3% for travoprost 0.004%, 54.8% for travoprost 0.0015% and 47.1% for timolol. The IOP reductions for timolol in this study were similar to previously published studies.

The IOP reductions produced by both concentrations of travoprost were maintained over the 9-month treatment  period.  The  IOP  reductions  produced  by  Travoprost  0.004%  were  greater  than  those produced by Travoprost 0.0015% at all treatment visits, with a statistically significant difference at 11 AM. The by visit analysis demonstrated that the mean IOP obtained with travoprost 0.004% was lower than mean IOP produced by travoprost 0.0015% at all treatment visits by up to 1.1 mmHg in favour of the  0.004%  concentration.  The  combined  analysis  collapsed  across  all  visits  demonstrated  that travoprost 0.004% had better control of IOP over the course of the day by up to 0.6 mmHg, with this difference being statistically significant at 11 AM measurement time.

## Adjunctive therapy

## Study C-97-73

## 1. Description of the study

This was a 6-month, randomised, double blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. All patients, of any race and either sex, were diagnosed with uncontrolled open-angle glaucoma (with or  without  pigment  dispersion  or  pseudoexfoliation  component)  or  ocular  hypertension  while maintained on timolol 0.5%. All eligible patients were on timolol 0.5% therapy and were required to have 24 mmHg to 36 mmHg mean IOP at 8 AM and 21 mm Hg to 36 mm Hg at 10 AM and 4 PM on both eligibility days.

Four hundred and twenty seven (427) eligible patients who met all inclusion criteria were randomised to  receive  one  of  the  following  three  treatments:  travoprost  0.0015%  once  daily  plus  timolol  0.5% twice daily (n=142), travoprost 0.004% once daily plus timolol 0.5% twice daily (n=146) or travoprost placebo once daily  plus timolol 0.5% twice daily dosed (n=139) for a treatment period of 6 months.

## 2.  Primary endpoints/assays

IOP was measured at 8AM, 10 AM and 4 PM on week 2, month 3 and month 6 visits and at 8 AM and 10  AM  on  month,  1.5  and  month  4.5  visits.  This  study  had  the  same  primary  endpoint  as  the monotherapy studies.

## 3.  Statistical analysis

All  patients  who  received  drug  and  had  at  least  one  on-therapy  visit  were  considered  evaluable  for safety and intent-to-treat analysis. The primary analysis was performed on only those patients who met the  protocol  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  and  on  all  data  points  ruled  evaluable.  The  statistical objectives of this study were to demonstrate that: 1) Travoprost 0.004% is superior to vehicle in IOP lowering  efficacy,  2)  Travoprost  0.0015%  is  superior  to  vehicle  in  IOP  lowering  efficacy  and  3) Travoprost 0.004% is superior to travoprost 0.0015% in IOP lowering efficacy

Tests of hypotheses were performed using repeated measures analysis of variance. The family-wise error rate for testing multiple hypotheses between the travoprost and placebo treatments groups was controlled at alpha =0.05. Descriptive statistics were calculated for IOP, IOP change from baseline, and percent change from baseline. Mean IOP was also estimated by the least squares means from the repeated measures analysis of variance.

## RESULTS

## 4 Study populations/accountability of patients

Four hundred and twenty seven (427) patients were randomized to one of three groups of treatments. Of these all but one (426) were included in the safety analysis. The patient who was excluded from the safety analysis did not receive the study medication. Seventeen patients were excluded from the ITT analysis due to no on-treatment visit data and therefore, 410 were included in the ITT analysis. The PP analysis included 362 patients randomized, since 65 patients were excluded from the PP analysis due to protocol deviations. Three hundred and forty nine (349) patients completed the study. Seventy eight (78)  patients  discontinued  study  prematurely.  Main  reasons  were:  Adverse  event  (16),  Noncompliance (3), Inadequate control of IOP (24), Patient decision (4), Lost of follow up (4), Ineligible entry criteria or protocol deviation (27).

## 5.  Efficacy results

Of the 410 patients included in the ITT analysis, 180 were male and 230 were female. The mean age of the patients was 63.7 years and the ages ranged from 11 to 89; 206 patients (50.2%) were younger than 65 years at the time of the enrolment. The frequencies of patients by race were 283 Caucasian, 94 Black,  3  Asian  and  30  other  races  as  follows:  29  Hispanic  and  1  Cuban.  The  diagnoses  were distributed  as  follows:  360  patients  were  diagnosed  with  open-angle  glaucoma,  35  with  ocular hypertension, 7 with pigmentary glaucoma and 8 with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma.

There were no statistically significant demographic differences among treatment groups at baseline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Travoprost  (0.0015%  and  0.004%)  dosed  once  daily  produced  statistically  superior  additional  IOP reductions  compared  to  Vehicle  at  all  treatment  visits  when  used  adjunctively  with  Timolol  0.5% dosed twice daily.

The difference between travoprost 0.004% and vehicle ranged from 4.2 mmHg to 5.0 mmHg, and the difference between travoprost 0.0015% and vehicle ranged from 3.7 mmHg to 4.5 mmHg.

The 95% confidence limits showed that travoprost 0.004% and travoprost 0.0015% were superior to vehicle at all treatments visits for both the combined and individual visit results. All the upper 95% confidence interval were less than 0 mmHg and the p-values also showed that both concentrations of travoprost were superior to vehicle in IOP lowering efficacy.

Travoprost (0.0015% and 0.004%) dosed once daily in the evening produced clinically relevant and statistically significant IOP reductions from baseline when used adjunctively with Timolol 0.5% dosed twice daily. The IOP changes observed for the travoprost 0.0015% group ranged from -5.1 to  -6.7 mmHg  and from -5.7 to -7.2 mmHg for travoprost 0.004%.

The clinical relevance of the IOP reductions was further demonstrated by the percent of patients in each  treatment  group  who  responded  to  treatment.  A  patient  was  considered  to  have  a  clinically relevant response if  IOP decreased by 6 mmHg or more, or if their IOP decreased to 20 mmHg or lower. The percentage of responders was 66.4% to 86.9% for travoprost 0.004%, 66.2% to 82.7% for travoprost 0.0015% and 23.1% to 43.3% for placebo.

The IOP reductions produced by both concentrations of travoprost were maintained over the 6-month treatment period when used adjunctively with timolol 0.5%.

The IOP reductions produced by Travoprost 0.004% dosed once-daily were marginally greater than those  produced  by  Travoprost  0.0015%  at  all  treatment  visits  when  used  adjunctively  with  timolol 0.5%  dosed  twice-daily  with  a  maximum  difference  of  1.1  mmHg  in  favour  of  the  0.004% concentration (at month 1.5, 8AM; p=0.0293).

## Clinical studies in special populations

## Patients with renal impairment

One  study  has  been  performed  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  (C-99-97)  in  order  to  assess  the pharmacokinetic  parameters  in  subjects  with  normal  and  impaired  renal  function.  (see  section pharmacokinetics). No efficacy parameters were measured in this trial. The results of this trial showed that travoprost 0.004% did not accumulate in patients with several degrees of impaired renal function. There is thus no pharmacological reason to think that efficacy in patients with impaired renal function would be different from patients with normal renal function.

## Patients with hepatic impairment

One study has been performed in patients with hepatic impairment (C-00-05) in order to assess the pharmacokinetic parameters in subjects with normal and impaired hepatic function. The results of this trial  showed  that  travoprost  0.004%  did  not  accumulate  in  patients  with  impaired  hepatic  function. There  is  thus  no  pharmacological  reason  to  think  that  efficacy  in  patients  with  impaired  hepatic function would be different from patients with normal hepatic function.

## Supportive studies

The applicant submitted also a study with combined administration treatment of Travoprost/Brimonidine  (C-99-18)  which  provides  additional  information  on  the  additive  effect  of Travoprost with other anti-glaucomatous agents. Additionally, the Applicant reported one open-label, monotherapy study (C-98-09) conducted in Mexico, in which patients were treated with Travoprost 0.004% dosed once daily.

## Study C-99-18

This phase II double-blind, multicenter, parallel group study randomised 81 patients to one of three treatments: travoprost 0.0015% once daily/travoprost 0.0015% BID + brimonidine 0.2% BID (n=33); Travoprost  0.0015%  once  daily/  travoprost  0.0015%  BID  (n=32);  travoprost  0.0015%  once  daily/

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

travoprost vehicle BID (n=16). All patients were dosed with travoprost 0.0015% once daily for four weeks in the run-in period (phase I). The duration of the concomitant therapy phase (phase II) was 6 weeks.

The main criteria for inclusion was identical to pivotal trials in monotherapy (see above).

Concomitant  twice  daily  dosing  of  Travoprost  0.0015%  plus  Brimonidine  resulted  in  greater  IOPlowering efficacy than twice daily dosing of Travoprost 0.0015% alone.  These differences in favour of Travoprost plus Brimonidine were 0.68, 3.75, and 1.24 mmHg at 8:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m, respectively, and were clinically relevant and statistically significant at the 10:00 a.m. and 4.00 a.m. time points. Both once and twice daily dosed Travoprost 0.0015% produced clinically relevant and statistically significant reductions in IOP ranging from 5.38 to 7.06 mmHg and from 4.47 to 6.47 mmHg, respectively. Switching from once to twice daily dosing of Travoprost 0.0015% resulted in 0.59 to 0.91 mmHg less IOP reduction.

## Study C-98-09

This open label study included 30 patients with open-angle glaucoma (with or without a pseudoexfoliation  or  pigment  dispersion  component)  or  ocular  hypertension.  Patients  received travoprost 0.004% dosed once daily; one drop in each eye (at 8 PM), for three months.

The primary efficacy variable was mean IOP change from baseline at the 8 AM time points for the patient's worse eye as defined earlier. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test IOP measurements against a pre-treatment baseline. Additionally, descriptive statistics were calculated for IOP, IOP change from baseline, and IOP percent change from baseline.

The efficacy results presented are based primarily upon the per protocol data set of 29 patients. IOP changes from baseline for Travoprost 0.004% were clinically relevant and statistically significant at all treatment visits with the changes ranging from -8.2 to -8.9 mmHg. The clinical relevance of the IOP reductions was demonstrated by the percentage of patients who responded to treatment.  Patients were considered to have a clinically relevant IOP response to treatment if their IOP decreased by 6 mmHg or more, or if their IOP decreased to 20 mmHg or lower. The percentage of patients with a clinically relevant IOP response to treatment based on these criteria ranged from 95.8% to 100% .

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

Three pivotal studies (C-97-71, C-97-72, C-97-79) have been performed in order to assess the IOP lowering efficacy of travoprost. All of them compared travoprost in concentrations of 0.0015% and 0.004% to timolol 0.5%, which is the standard therapy of glaucoma. One of the three trials included also an additional arm  with latanoprost, which  is the only approved product in the  same pharmacological  group  in  Europe.  The  design  of  all  three  trials  is  an  accepted  design  for  the development  of  antiglaucoma  products  and  the  selected  population  is  representative  of  the  target population although most patients have their IOP close to the lower limit of the inclusion criteria.

The main hypothesis in all trials was the demonstration of non-inferiority versus active comparators and a second hypothesis of superiority was planned a priori if non-inferiority was proven. The results have been consistent in all three monotherapy pivotal trials. The IOP lowering efficacy of comparative treatments (timolol and latanoprost) has been in accordance to previous published results. Travoprost (0.0015% and 0.004%) dosed once daily produced both clinically relevant and statistically significant IOP reductions when used as a monotherapy. The IOP reductions were maintained over the entire 6 to 12 month treatment period.

The chosen non-inferiority margin is less than half the observed difference in change from baseline in IOP between timolol and placebo. In the view of the CPMP, in some circumstances a tighter margin may be appropriate but the chosen margin appears reasonable here. In any case the results indicate a satisfactory outcome even if a tighter margin were chosen. It is stated that if non-inferiority is being considered a per protocol analysis will be performed and if in fact superiority is found the analysis will be repeated using the ITT population. In the view of the CPMP, this approach is acceptable.

The CPMP raised a major objection regarding the absence of justification to accept the coexistence of the  two  different  dosages  due  to  the  marginal  difference  of  efficacy  and  safety  between  them.  The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Applicant provided new analysis on efficacy and considered that travoprost 40 µ g/ml would present the most favourable risk/benefit ratio over travoprost 15 µ g/ml. The CPMP concluded that travoprost 0.0040% is numerically superior to travoprost 0.0015% in analyses on mean IOP efficacy. The rate of responders  is  superior  with  travoprost  0.0040%.  The  applicant  has  provided  a  new  analysis  of responders using more strict criteria that probably means that all patients included have really attained their target IOP that is supposed to stop further optic nerve damage. This analysis showed that 56.3% of patients were controlled with travoprost 0.004% when data were pooled over the three monotherapy studies whereas 49.8% were controlled with travoprost 0.0015%.

Additionally,  in  subgroup  analyses  of  the  studies,  mean  IOP  reduction  in  black  patients  was  up  to 1.8mmHg greater  than  in  non-black  patients  following  treatment  with  0.004%  travoprost.  It  is  not known at this time whether this difference is attributed to race or to heavily pigmented irides.

A second major objection was raised, as in the view of the CPMP, there was no justification to obtain a  first  line  indication.  Although  a  more  potent  effect  on  the  decrease  of  IOP  may  be  obtained  with travoprost  in  comparison  to  timolol,  the  patients  that  need  additional  treatment  based  on  their individual  target  IOP  and  the  obtained  effect  may  be  identified  in  the  follow  up.  In  comparison  to timolol, travoprost has, in general, worse ocular tolerability and a limited knowledge on its mechanism of  action  and  on  the  long-term  adverse  effects.  Efficacy  and  safety  may  be  comparable  to  that  of latanoprost,  indicated  in  patients  that  do  not  tolerate  or  have  insufficient  response  to  any  other treatment.  The  applicant  agreed  with  the  recommendation  of  the  CPMP  and  the  wording  of  the indication in the SPC was been modified to only include the second line.

The efficacy of travoprost 0.0015% and 0.004% as adjunctive therapy has been studied in one pivotal trial  (C-97-73)  where  patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  timolol  have  been  randomised  to  add placebo,  travoprost  0.0015%  or  travoprost  0.004%  to  timolol.  As  no  comparison  to  another  active treatment (e.g. latanoprost) in adjunctive therapy has been performed, there is information about the absolute  efficacy  of  travoprost  when  added  to  timolol  in  patients  not  well  controlled  with  timolol alone,  but  we  do  not  know  how  it  compares  with  other  possible  approved  adjunctive  therapies  to timolol.  When  used  adjunctively  with  timolol  0.5%  BID,  travoprost  (0.0015%  and  0.004%,  dosed once  daily)  produced  both  clinically  relevant  and  statistically  superior  IOP  reductions  compared  to vehicle.  The  IOP  reductions  were  maintained  over  the  entire  6-month  treatment  period.  The differences  between  travoprost  0.004%  and  0.0015%  were  not  statistically  significant.  The  CPMP raised a third major objection regarding the limitations of the indication in adjunctive therapy (limited data with brimonidine, absence of data with other antiglaucomatous agents). This has been solved and the wording of the SPC has been modified in order to reflect these limitations.

## Extension of indication to first line therapy

The application submitted for the extension of the indication to first line therapy included 4 Phase I studies, one Phase II study, one Phase III efficacy/safety study and 4 Phase IV post-marketing studies as well as interim analyses of the ongoing long term study C-99-10.

All these studies have been conducted according to applicable regulations on Good Clinical Practice.

## Efficacy

## Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies

The new phase I pharmacodynamic studies (C-00-11, C-00-56) confirmed the IOP lowering effects of travoprost when it is administered to Japanese healthy volunteers. They confirm the results of previous dose-finding studies and provided additional short-term data on safety.

The pharmacokinetic study C-00-57 was submitted during the CPMP review process of the original Travatan MAA, and consequently, its results were taken into account and reflected in the SPC during the  intial  authorisation  process.  Study  C-00-15  confirmed  the  known  pharmacokinetic  profile  of travoprost and its active metabolite, and did not give rise to any changes to the SPC.

## Clinical studies

The one phase II study submitted, C-00-20, is not included in the efficacy summary as only safety data has been analysed so far. One phase III short-term efficacy and safety study has been completed since the initial MAA (Study C-99-58) and is currently being analysed.

Four Phase IV post marketing studies, including one comfort study, two 24-hour dosing studies and one  adjunctive  therapy  study,  have  been  submitted  (C-01-24,  C-01-52,  C-01-103  and  C-00-57)  of which  the  analyses  are  ongoing  for  two  studies  (C-01-24,  C-01-103).  Study  C-01-52  was  a  safety study evaluating ocular comfort and hyperaemia.

Study  C-00-57 was  a  Phase  IV  efficacy  and  safety  randomised  trial  of  TRAVATAN  dosed concomitantly to levobetaxolol hydrochloride 0.5% (BETAXON) or TRAVATAN alone in glaucoma or ocular hypertensive patients dosed for 10 weeks. There was a clinically relevant additional lowering of  IOP (-2.2  to  -2.7  mmHg)  at  10  AM  when BETAXON was dosed adjunctively once daily in the morning to TRAVATAN dosed once daily in the evening.

Regarding the ongoing efficacy studies, the most relevant for the present variation is the long-term study C-99-10 that includes 139 patients that have been exposed for up to 4 years to travoprost.

The population participating in this study is those patients who successfully completed participation in clinical trial C-97-79 and who, in the opinion of the investigator, could continue with the same masked therapy. There was no interruption of therapy between participation in C-97-79 (which had a treatment duration of nine months, patients were treated with travoprost 0.0015%, travoprost 0.004% or timolol 0.5%)  and  C-99-10.  Participation  in  study  C-99-10  lasts  for  a  total  of  60  months  with  safety assessments performed quarterly for the first 2 years and semi-annually in the final 3 years. Although study C-99-10 was ongoing, an interim analysis of the data collected was submitted.

Descriptive statistics demonstrate that the IOP reductions produced by TRAVATAN at the initiation of the study were consistently maintained throughout the study (currently patients have been followed for up to 4 years).

*In this ongoing study, up to July 2002, only 15 patients have reached the 45-month visit to provide data on this length of therapy.  Thus data beyond 39 months is of limited value.

ITT = Intent-to-Treat;  LOCF = Last-observation-carried-forward

Of the 196 patients initially enrolled in Study C-99-10, 67 were treated with TRAVATAN and 72 with travoprost 0.0015%. During the 4-year period, 12 patients withdrew from the trial, 6 due to adverse events, 5 requiring alternate therapy and 1 due to non-compliance. Therefore, 55/67 patients (82%) remain in the study in the TRAVATAN group (see the following table).

In  the  Request  for  Supplementary  Information  the  CPMP  queried  whether  bias  may  have  been introduced as only patients continuing from study C-97-79 were recruited for the ongoing Study C-9910.

In  order  to  demonstrate  that  biases  have  not  been  introduced  during  the  selection  of  those  patients coming from study C-97-79 who participated in Study C-99-10, the MAH compared demographic, efficacy  and  safety  profiles  from  different  groups  of  patients.  The  main  comparison  was  between patients  who entered  study  C-99-10 (n=196) at  the  31  sites  that  participated  in  this  study  vs.  those patients who did not (n=135). Data have been also presented for the 28 sites that did not participate in C-99-10 (n=193) and for the overall intention-to-treat population (n=572).

Data  presented  show  that  the  demographic  characteristics  of  patients  from  the  different  subgroups were similar, with two non relevant exceptions, i.e. patients who completed C-97-79 and did not enter C-99-10 were older than those who did (15.2% vs. 4.5%, older than 75 years, respectively) and there

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

was a higher proportion of patients with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma amongst patients from centres that did not participate in study C-99-10.

Regarding efficacy, the IOP reductions were similar between the established groups.

From the safety point of view, there were no differences in the frequency and incidence of adverse events between patients who entered study C-99-10 and those who did not. Only a higher proportion of hypertension and cardiovascular disease was observed in those patients who were not enrolled in study C-99-10.

The CPMP concluded that these comparisons did not show any differences that would significantly bias in favour of patients entering the continuation study C-99-10.

In the Request for Supplementary Information the MAH was asked to comment on the IOP control in patients developing increased iris pigmentation.

The MAH presented mean and individual data for 9 patients, of which 2 already had increased iris pigmentation at study entry. The numbers of patients are clearly limited, but the CPMP agreed with the MAH that no adverse relationship between increased iris pigmentation and IOP is seen. This needs to be closely reviewed by the MAH particularly in the ongoing review of study C-02-20.

In the Request for Supplementary Information the CPMP pointed out that the risk of accumulation and release of pigment into the anterior chamber with a subsequent obstruction of the trabecular meshwork and additional increase in IOP might still be a concern that should be further studied. Limited data do not suggest that increased iris pigmentation is associated with any other symptoms, and the MAH will conduct a trabecular meshwork study including an evaluation of the effects of travoprost treatment on patients with iris colour changes (C-01-78). Therefore, the MAH was asked to confirm that this study and  other  studies  that  address  this  issue  are  designed  to  provide  information  to  1)  exclude  any correlation between increased iris pigmentation and anterior chamber pigmentation, and 2) exclude a correlation with anterior chamber pigmentation and increased IOP.

In the response the MAH confirmed the intention of conducting a clinical study (C-01-78) which will evaluate  the  pigmentation  of  trabecular  meshwork  in  30  subjects  after  2  years  of  treatment  of TRAVATAN compared to 30 subjects with no prior exposure to a prostaglandin analogue, and who are  in  need  of  trabeculectomy.  The  MAH argued that although the study may include patients who present with an iris pigmentation change, the study is not targeted to exclude a possible correlation between increased iris pigmentation, anterior chamber pigmentation and IOP.

The MAH is conducting two long-term safety studies, C-02-20 and C-99-10, and proposed to monitor the trabecular meshwork pigmentation of the patients enrolled in both studies, using gonioscopy. This information collected in C-02-20, i.e., in patients who will likely not present iris pigmentation at study start, will assess the incidence of this effect and of trabecular meshwork pigmentation in a glaucoma population. Furthermore, the same information collected in C-99-10 (from Visit Month 48 onwards) will  assess  the  correlation  between  iris  pigmentation  and  trabecular  pigmentation,  in  addition  to monitoring the IOP over five years of treatment. This proposal was acceptable to the CPMP .

The CPMP also requested that the MAH should further discuss the extent of efficacy and safety data in  patients  with  a  wider  range  of  glaucoma  aetiologies,  and  in  combination  with  a  wider  range  of glaucoma medication in view of the proposed first line indication.

The  MAH  responded  that  there  was  a  small  number  of  patients  with  pigmentary  glaucoma  or pseudoexfoliative  glaucoma in the original Phase  III  studies,  where  there  were  no  clear  differences with regard to IOP control or adverse events noted compared to other patients. This is supported by review  of  the  post  marketing  surveillance.  There  is  an  ongoing  study  in  chronic  angle-closure glaucoma (C-01-38) and the MAH proposed to submit the results of this study to the CPMP. This proposal was acceptable to the CPMP.

In addition to the previously submitted data on combination treatment with timolol, levobetaxolol and brimonidine, a study involving combination with the topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor brinzolamide is to be initiated. The MAH proposed to submit the protocol for this study to the CPMP for review, which was considered acceptable to the CPMP.

The MAH was also asked in the Request for Supplementary Information to provide a proposal how further to study the safety and efficacy of TRAVATAN in the first line treatment of raised intraocular

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pressure. The MAH proposed to provide the CPMP with safety reports annually of each of the four studies of TRAVATAN that are currently ongoing or planned. This is acceptable to the CPMP.

The MAH has proposed to investigate the possibility to undertake the follow up of about 2000 patients in  the  United  Kingdom  under  the  Prescription  Event  Monitoring  (PEM)  Scheme.  This  follow  up procedure would start once TRAVATAN is approved with a first-line indication. The MAH proposed to submit the protocol to the CPMP for review, which was considered acceptable to the CPMP .

## Clinical safety

## Patient exposure

A total of 2,927 patients or subjects were included in the safety analysis of the ten completed phase IIII  travoprost  studies.  Of  these,  2881  patients  participated  in  phase  II  and  III  studies  and  46 participated in phase I studies.

One thousand nine hundred and twenty-five (1925) subjects/patients have been exposed to Travoprost to  date  in  ten  clinical  studies.  The  combined  number  of  subjects/patients  evaluated  for  safety  with Travoprost 0.0015% and Travoprost 0.004% in monotherapy was 1,367. Duration of exposure ranged from 1 to 365 days with Travoprost 0.0015% (mean exposure: 233.0 days; median: 259.0 days) and from 1 to 470 days with Travoprost 0.0040% (mean exposure: 210.9 days; median: 194.0 days).. The safety of Travoprost 0.0015% was evaluated in 657 subjects/patients (ages 18 to 88 years), and the safety of Travoprost 0.004% was evaluated in 710 subjects/patients (ages 20 to 94 years).

The mean age of the patients included in pivotal trials was 63.8 years (47% up to 65 years and 53% over  the  65).  Both  male  and  female  (with  the  exception  of  women  of  childbearing  potential)  were allowed in the studies. Other demographic data collected in the studies included the iris colour and the etiology  of  increased  IOP  (ocular  hypertension,  open-angle  glaucoma,  pigmentary  glaucoma  and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma. Patients with IOP higher than 36 mmHg were excluded.

Travoprost  concentrations  used  in  the  complete  clinical  trials  ranged  from  Travoprost  0.0001%  to 0.006% (1 to 60 µ g/ml) and the dosing regimen was one drop once a day (preferably in the evening). Only  one  study  (C-99-18)  assessed  the  BID  dosing  regimen  during  6  weeks  (C-99-18)in  32  adult patients  (ages  32  to  75  years)  with  open-angle  glaucoma,  ocular  hypertension,  or  pigmentary glaucoma.

## Adverse events and serious adverse events/deaths

No  serious  adverse  events  related  to  Travoprost  15  or  40 µ g/ml  were  reported  during  the  studies. Adverse  events  related  to  Travoprost  15  or  40 µ g/ml  were  generally  mild  to  moderate,  usually resolved with or without treatment, and generally did not interrupt continuation in the study.

## Ocular adverse events related to travoprost

The  most  common  ocular  adverse  events  related  to  Travoprost  15  or  40 µ g/ml  were  ocular hyperaemia, ocular discomfort (burning, stinging), and ocular pruritus.

## Systemic adverse events related to travoprost

In the monotherapy studies, 26 of the 657 patients (4.0%) experienced 29 systemic events related to Travoprost  15 µ g/ml,  and  26  of  the  710  patients  (4.1%)  experienced  34  systemic  events  related  to Travoprost 40 µ g/ml.

The  most  frequent  systemic  events  associated  with  Travoprost  40 µ g/ml  were  headache (1.4%), skin discolouration (0.6%), hypotension (0.3%), and bradycardia (0.3%).  In comparison, the most  frequent  systemic  events  related  to  Latanoprost  0.005%  were  hypotension  (0.5%),  arthritis (0.5%), and taste perversion (0.5%). There were no reports of systemic events related to Placebo.

Numerous concomitant medications were used during the studies. Few drug interactions were noted for  patients  receiving  Travoprost  15  or  40 µ g/ml.  One  patient  receiving  Travoprost  15 µ g/ml

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

experienced conjunctivitis and ocular hyperaemia related to a possible drug interaction with sodium cromoglycate  and  ketorolac.  Another  patient  receiving  Travoprost  40 µ g/ml  experienced  blurred vision  related  to  a  possible  drug  interaction  with  naproxen.  A  third  patient  receiving  Travoprost  40 µ g/ml experienced dry eye and ocular pruritus related to an unspecified possible drug interaction.

## Serious Adverse Events

## Serious Ocular Events Related to Therapy

No  serious  ocular  events  related  to  Travoprost  Eye  Drops  were  reported.  Severe  ocular  pain  and ocular hyperaemia related to Travoprost 15 µ g/ml was reported in one of the 657 patients (0.2%), and ocular  pain  and  ocular  discomfort  related  to  Travoprost  40 µ g/ml  were  reported  in  two  of  the  710 patients (0.3%). In the monotherapy studies with Travoprost 15 µ g/ml, 10 of the 657 patients (1.5%) were  discontinued  due  to  ocular  events  (hyperaemia,  discomfort,  pain,  pruritus,  cells,  conjunctival follicles,  eye  disorder  [corneal  pigment  stippling],  ocular  fatigue,  and/or  conjunctivitis)  related  to therapy . In the monotherapy studies with Travoprost 40 µ g/ml, 30 of the 710 patients (4.2%) were discontinued  due  to  ocular  events  (hyperaemia,  discomfort,  pain,  pruritus,  flare,  cells,  foreign  body sensation, conjunctivitis, hair disorder [increased eyelash length], browache, and/or dry eye) related to therapy. Ocular hyperaemia and ocular discomfort were the most frequent reasons for discontinuation of patients with treatment-related ocular events.

## Serious Systemic Events Related to Therapy

No  deaths  or  other  serious  events  related  to  Travoprost  15  or  40 µ g/ml  were  reported  during  the studies.  One  patient  receiving  Travoprost  15 µ g/ml  and  Timolol  0.5%  experienced  a  serious  lung disorder (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) related to Timolol 0.5%. No severe systemic event was related to Travoprost Eye Drops. Four of the 657 patients (0.6%) discontinued due to headache, asthenia, abdominal pain, decreased libido, rhinitis, erythema and/or pruritus related to Travoprost 15 µ g/ml (See Part IV). Six of the 710 patients (0.8%) discontinued due to headache, asthenia, malaise, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, skin discolouration and/or contact dermatitis related to Travoprost 40 µ g/ml.

## Serious events unrelated to travoprost

One  hundred  serious  events  unrelated  to  Travoprost  15  or  40 µ g/ml  were  reported.  Seventy-two patients receiving Travoprost 15 or 40 µ g/ml discontinued from the study due to adverse events; 45 patients discontinued due to treatment-related adverse events and 27 patients were discontinued due to treatment-unrelated adverse events. Six patients receiving Travoprost 15 or 40 µ g/ml experienced fatal treatment-unrelated adverse events secondary to intercurrent illness

No other serious events related to Travoprost 15 or 40 µ g/ml were reported during the studies. In the monotherapy studies, 101 serious events unrelated to Travoprost 15 or 40 µ g/ml were reported in 67 patients. In the adjunctive therapy studies, one serious expected event (lung disorder - exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) related to Timolol 0.5% was reported in a patient receiving Travoprost 15 µ g/ml with Timolol 0.5%. In the adjunctive therapy studies, fifteen additional serious events unrelated to Travoprost 15 or 40 µ g/ml were reported in nine patients.

## Discontinuations due to adverse events

Seventy-two of the 1367  patients  (5.3%)  were discontinued  from  the  studies  due  to  adverse  events related  or  unrelated  to  Travoprost  15  or  40 µ g/ml  in  monotherapy  studies.  Forty-five  of  the  1367 patients (3.3%) receiving Travoprost 15 or 40 µ g/ml discontinued from the studies due to non-serious treatment-related adverse events. Fifteen of the 1367 patients (1.1%) receiving Travoprost 15 or 40 µ g/ml discontinued from the studies due to serious treatment-unrelated adverse events.  Twelve of the 1367 patients (0.9%) receiving Travoprost 15 or 40 µ g/ml discontinued from the studies due to nonserious treatment-unrelated adverse events.

Thirty-one of the 657  patients  (4.7%)  receiving Travoprost  15 µ g/ml discontinued from the studies due to treatment-related and -unrelated adverse events. Forty-one of the 710 patients (5.8%) receiving

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Travoprost  40 µ g/ml  discontinued  from  the  studies  due  to  treatment-related  and  -unrelated  adverse events. For comparison, six of the 196 patients (3.1%) receiving Latanoprost 0.005% discontinued due to treatment-related and -unrelated adverse events. Twenty-eight of the 727 patients (3.9%) receiving Timolol 0.5% discontinued from the studies due to treatment-related and -unrelated adverse events.

For  patients  receiving  Travoprost  15  or  40 µ g/ml,  the  most  frequent  reason  for  discontinuation  of patients with treatment-related adverse events was ocular hyperaemia.

## Laboratory findings

Blood  chemistry,  haematology  and  urinalysis  values  were  measured  in  two  studies.  No  clinically significant changes from baseline within treatment groups were observed. There was no evidence of Travoprost Eye Drops having any clinically relevant effect on laboratory data.

## Special safety issues

## Visual Acuity

No  clinically  significant  difference  in  visual  acuity  change  from  baseline  was  observed  between Travoprost Eye Drops and Latanoprost 0.005% or Timolol 0.5%.

## Ocular Signs

Ocular signs (cornea, iris/anterior chamber, lens, vitreous) were observed at Screening, Eligibility 2 (baseline) and all subsequent visits in eight clinical studies (Protocols C-96-52, C-97-02, C-97-71, C97-72, C-97-73, C-97-79, C-98-09, C-99-18). Any clinically significant increase of one or more units from baseline in ocular signs was identified and reported as an adverse event.

In the monotherapy studies, clinically significant increase in ocular signs was noted in 33 of the 643 evaluated patients (5.1%) receiving Travoprost 15 µ g/ml and 40 of the 676 evaluated patients (5.9%) receiving  Travoprost  40 µ g/ml.  In  the  adjunctive  therapy  studies,  eight  of  the  139  patients  (5.8%) receiving  Travoprost  15 µ g/ml  with  Timolol  0.5%  and  six  of  the  143  patients  (4.2%)  receiving Travoprost 40 µ g/ml with Timolol 0.5% experienced clinically significant increase in ocular signs.  In comparison, 11 of the 196 patients (5.6%) receiving Latanoprost 0.005% and 38 of the 723 patients (5.3%) receiving Timolol 0.5% experienced clinically significant increase in ocular signs.

## Dilated Fundus

Dilated  fundus  examination  (retina/macula/choroid,  optic  nerve,  disc  pallor)  was  performed  at Screening (baseline), final, and unscheduled visits (if warranted) in seven clinical studies (Protocols C-96-52, C-97-71, C-97-72, C-97-73, C-97-79, C-98-09, C-99-18).  In one clinical study (C-96-52), dilated  fundus  at  the  final  visit  was  collected  only  at  one  selected  clinical  investigator  site.    Any clinically significant increase of one or more units from baseline in dilated fundus parameters at the final visit was reported as an adverse event. No clinically significant difference in fundus parameters was observed between Travoprost 15 or 40 µ g/ml and other treatment groups.

## Visual Fields

Automated perimetry was collected for safety evaluation, no clinically relevant changes from baseline were observed in patients receiving Travoprost Eye Drops and other treatments.  Analysis of visual fields  showed  that  no  clinically  relevant  deterioration  from  baseline  in  mean  deviation,  corrected pattern  standard  deviation,  mean  defect,  or  corrected  loss  variance  was  observed  in  any  treatment group.

## Cells and Flare

Assessment of aqueous flare and/or inflammatory cells was performed at Eligibility 2 (baseline) and all subsequent visits in seven clinical studies (Protocols C-96-52, C-97-02, C-97-71, C-97-72, C-9773, C-97-79, C-98-09). Clinically significant increase of one or more units from baseline in aqueous flare or inflammatory cells was reported as an adverse event. In the monotherapy studies, two of the 657  patients  (0.3%)  receiving  Travoprost  15 µ g/ml  and  three  of  the  710  patients  (0.4%)  receiving Travoprost 40 µ g/ml discontinued due to cells and/or flare. In the adjunctive therapy studies, one of the 142 patients (0.7%) receiving Travoprost 15 µ g/ml with Timolol 0.5% and two of the 145 patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(1.4%) receiving Travoprost 40 µ g/ml with Timolol 0.5% discontinued due to cells and/or flare.  In comparison, none of the 196 patients receiving Latanoprost 0.005% discontinued due to cells and/or flare,  and  two  of  the  727  patients  (0.3%)  receiving  Timolol  0.5%  discontinued  due  to  cells  and/or flare.

In the monotherapy studies, five of the 595 evaluated patients (0.8%) receiving Travoprost 15 µ g/ml and 11 of the 676 evaluated patients (1.6%) receiving Travoprost 40 µ g/ml experienced a clinically significant increase from baseline in aqueous flare.  In the adjunctive therapy studies, five of the 139 patients (3.6%) receiving Travoprost 15 µ g/ml with Timolol 0.5% and two of the 143 patients (1.4%) receiving  Travoprost  40 µ g/ml  with  Timolol  0.5%  experienced  a  clinically  significant  increase  in aqueous flare.  In comparison, two of the 196 patients (1.0%) receiving Latanoprost 0.005% and four of  the  723  patients  (0.6%)  receiving  Timolol  0.5%  experienced  clinically  significant  increase  in aqueous flare.

In the monotherapy studies, eight of the 595 evaluated patients (1.3%) receiving Travoprost 15 µ g/ml and ten of the 628 evaluated patients (1.6%) receiving Travoprost 40 µ g/ml experienced a clinically significant increase from baseline in inflammatory cells. In the adjunctive therapy studies, eight of the 139  patients  (5.8%)  receiving  Travoprost  15 µ g/ml  with  Timolol  0.5%  and  six  of  the  143  patients (4.2%) receiving Travoprost 40 µ g/ml with Timolol 0.5% experienced a clinically significant increase in inflammatory cells.  In comparison, one of the 196 patients (0.5%) receiving Latanoprost 0.005% and nine of the 723 patients (1.2%) receiving Timolol 0.5% experienced clinically significant increase in inflammatory cells.

## Corneal Health Assessment

Clinical Study C-97-71 included a 12-month evaluation of Travoprost Eye Drops on corneal health by assessing  corneal  thickness  and  endothelial  cell  density.  No  clinically  relevant  or  statistically significant mean change from baseline in corneal thickness or endothelial cell density was observed between Travoprost Eye Drops, Timolol 0.5% and Latanoprost 0.005%.

## Pulse and Blood Pressure

No  treatment  related  cardiovascular  events  relevant  to  blood  pressure  or  pulse  were  reported  for Travoprost Eye Drops.

## Iris Pigmentation

Iris pigmentation change was observed in approximately 2 to 3% of patients receiving Travoprost 15 or  40 µ g/ml compared to approximately 5% of patients receiving Latanoprost 0.005%. This unique side  effect  is  based  on  the  ability  of  prostaglandin  analogues  to  stimulate  melanin  formation  in melanocytes. For latanoprost, it has been reported that it is possible that this agent only selectively stimulates the iridal melanocytes from mixed coloured irides. Stimulation of melanogenesis of iridal melanocytes may not be a general response. No increased proliferation of normal dermal and uveal melanocytes has been observed. It is unknown  whether this darkening is reversible upon discontinuation of a prostaglandin analogue.

## Eyelashes

Hypertrichosis  has  been  reported  in  the  literature  with  topical  prostaglandin  analogues  and  was therefore also evaluated specifically by the Applicant. The assessment was performed by independent and  masked  readers  using  the  same  photographs  as  for  the  evaluation  of  iris  colour  changes.  The evaluation indicated that 839 of the 2,391 patients (35.1%) receiving Travoprost Eye Drops, Timolol 0.5%  or  Latanoprost  0.005%  in  monotherapy  or  adjunctive  therapy  studies  experienced  eyelash changes over the course of the studies.

The  majority  of  the  eyelash  changes  associated  with  Travoprost  Eye  Drops  included  changes  in colour,  length,  density  and/or  thickness.  A  concentration-related  change  was  observed  between patients receiving Travoprost 15 µ g/ml (48.1%) and 40 µ g/ml (59.2%).  Patients receiving Latanoprost 0.005% also experienced similar changes (25.8%).  This is a common cosmetic effect observed with this class of compounds and did not appear to pose any safety issues to the patient or interfere with daily activity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Macular disorder

Cystoid macular oedema (CME)  has also been reported during treatment with ophthalmic prostaglandin F2 α analogues and is currently included in the SPC for Latanoprost.No reports of CME in  any  patient  treated  with  Travoprost  15  or  40 µ g/ml  have  occurred.    Even  though  there  were  no reports of CME in the Travoprost clinical trials, it should be noted that many of the risk factors for CME were exclusion criteria in the studies.

## Safety in special populations

## Renal impairment

One study has been performed in subjects with normal and impaired renal function. In study (C-99-97) following  multiple  topical  ocular  doses  of  travoprost  40 µ g/ml  (one  drop  in  each  eye  once  in  the morning)  for  7  days,  plasma  and  urine  samples  for  travoprost  and  AL-5848  (the  free  acid) determinations were collected after the morning dose on Days 1 and 7. Plasma concentrations of AL5848 could not be correlated with creatinine clearance. Regarding safety, no serious adverse events related  to  or  unrelated  to  travoprost  were  reported  during  the  study.  There  were  no  clinically significant mean changes from baseline in laboratory data observed in subjects receiving Travoprost 40 µ g/ml. There were no clinically significant mean changes from baseline in pulse, systolic blood pressure  or  diastolic  blood  pressure.  Travoprost  was  safe  and  well  tolerated  in  subjects  with  renal impairment. There seems to be no necessity of adjustment of dose in renal impaired patients.

## Hepatic impairment

Steady state pharmacokinetics of travoprost in subjects with normal and impaired hepatic function has been evaluated following multiple topical ocular doses in study C-00-05. No serious adverse events related  to  or  unrelated  to  travoprost  were  reported  during  the  study.  There  were  no  clinically significant mean changes from baseline in laboratory data observed in subjects receiving Travoprost 40 µ g/ml. There were no clinically significant mean changes from baseline in pulse, systolic blood pressure  or  diastolic  blood  pressure.  Travoprost  was  safe  and  well  tolerated  in  adult  subjects  with normal or impaired hepatic function. There seems to be no necessity of adjustment of dose in patients with impaired hepatic function.

## Pregnant and potential childbearing Women

No studies with travoprost including pregnant or potential childbearing women have been performed and  pregnancy  was  one  of  the  exclusion  criteria.  Travoprost  Eye  Drops  has  potential  hazardous pharmacological  effects,  with  respect  to  the  course  of  pregnancy,  to  the  unborn  and  neonate. Reproduction and development studies have demonstrated a potent effect on foetal loss with a high rate  of  resorption  observed  in  pregnant  rats  and  mice  at  doses  at  or  above  1 µ g/kg/day.  Therefore, Travoprost Eye Drops should not be used during pregnancy . Travoprost and its metabolites may pass into breast milk and Travoprost Eye Drops should therefore not be used in nursing women or breastfeeding should be stopped.

A statement that travoprost should not be used during pregnancy, unless clearly necessary, and must not be used in women attempting pregnancy has been included in the SPC.

## Children

Travoprost has not been assessed in patients under 18 years of age. In line with to the absence of data in pediatric population, a statement not recommending the use of travoprost in patients under 18 years of age has been included in section 4.2 of SPC. Although from the available evidence this is correct, in the  view  of  the  CPMP,  the  issue  relative  to  the  product  safety  and  efficacy  in  children  should  be further addressed by the applicant.

## Post marketing experience

## Iris colour changes

In December 2001, the MAH submitted the first annual update on all patients that were treated with travoprost during the controlled clinical studies, and who experienced iris colour changes in the two studies (C-97-77 and C-99-10), which were both ongoing.

Study C-97-77 is a two-year follow-up safety study of patients with iris pigmentation changes resulting from participation in Travoprost (AL-6221) Phase III Clinical Trials C-97-71, C-97-72, C97-73, C-97-79 and C-99-10.

A total of 35 patients who experienced changes in iris colour entered C-97-77. Ten of them were treated with travoprost 0.004%, fifteen with travoprost 0.0015% and ten with latanoprost 0.005% prior to entering C-97-77. Currently 24 patients have completed the 2 year follow-up, 8 are still ongoing and 3 patients dropped out.

Ten patients have been treated with travoprost 0.004%, latanoprost 0.005% and/or isopropyl unoprostone for a period of time during their participation in C-97-77.

The iris colour did not change during the 2-years follow-up in any of patients suggesting that the iris colour changes seem to be permanent.

Study C-99-10 included patients  who  had  successfully  completed  C-97-79  (9-month  comparison  of travoprost (0.0015% and 0.004%) and timolol 0.5%) and by enrollment the patients were invited to continue treatment for up to 5 years.

Out of the 573 patients randomised to Protocol C-97-79, 196 rolled-over into this extension study C99-10. Twelve patients with iris colour changes are being followed in the extension study C-99-10. Two patients with iris colour changes experienced an increase in lens scores.

Only one spontaneous report of iris discolouration had been received. This was a consumer report and no further details regarding treatment duration were available.

Based on this first annual update the CPMP concluded that the iris colour changes induced by travoprost are permanent and requested the MAH to amend the Product Information accordingly, which the MAH did through a Type II variation.

Macular oedema, asthma, asthma exacerbation and abnormal hair growth on eyelids.

Nine cases of macular oedema have been reported since the international birthdate, 5 of them during the reporting period of the second PSUR (covering the period from 1 May 2002 to 31 October 2002). Considering the number of cases reported and the fact that macular oedema had also been reported with other drugs of the same therapeutic class, the CPMP requested this reaction to be added to section 4.8 of the SPC.

During the reporting period for the second PSUR, 3 cases of hair growth abnormal and one case of hypertrichosis were reported. The CPMP therefore requested that the term 'abnormal hair growth on eyelids' was added to the section 4.8 of the SPC and reflected in the Package Leaflet.

Three cases of asthma aggravated and 1 case of asthma were reported in the second PSUR. Since the international birthdate 3 cases of asthma aggravated and 2 of asthma have been reported. Rare cases of asthma, asthma exacerbation and dyspnoea have been reported with other prostaglandin F2 α analogue. The CPMP therefore requested following the assessment of the second PSUR that asthma and asthma exacerbation should be added to section 4.8 of the SPC. These terms were also added to the Package Leaflet.

## Discussion on Clinical Safety

The  extent  of  exposure  to  travoprost  monotherapy  during  the  clinical  development  plan  seems acceptable and includes 657 patients exposed to 0.0015% (mean time of exposure 233 days) and 710 to  0.004%  (mean  time  of  exposure  211  days).  The  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  any  related adverse event was about 40% of those patients receiving Travoprost 0.0015% and about 50% of those receiving  Travoprost  0.004%.  Most  of  adverse  events  were  mild  and  non-serious  and  5.3%  of  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

patients  treated  with  travoprost  0.0015%  and  6.2%  of  the  of  the  patients  treated  with  travoprost 0.0040% discontinued treatment due to any adverse event, related or unrelated to the therapy.

Most related adverse reactions were ocular, mainly hyperemia, (27.4% for travoprost 0.015%, 37.3% for travoprost 0.004% and 24.0% for latanoprost) burning or stinging, pruritus, iris discolouration and others. With regard to related systemic adverse reactions, they appeared in about 4% of patients The most frequently reported reaction was headache (1.4%). No deaths or other serious events related to Travoprost  15  or  40 µ g/ml  were  reported  during  the  studies.  No  treatment-related  changes  in biochemical or haematological parameters have been found

Ocular  side  effects  were  comparable  to  those  described  with  latanoprost.  Travoprost  has  been compared to latanoprost in one study in monotherapy. The frequency of related ocular hyperaemia was 46.0% for travoprost 0.0040% and 24.0% for latanoprost and the frequency of iris discolouration was 3.0%  for  travoprost  0.0040%  and  5.1%  for  latanoprost.  Overall,  in  the  view  of  the  CPMP  the tolerability  of  travoprost  is  not  inferior  to  latanoprost.  In  comparison  to  timolol,  the  frequency  of ocular  side  effects  is  higher  with  travoprost  than  with  timolol.  On  the  other  hand,  less  systemic cardiovascular and respiratory effects could be expected although this has not been evidenced in the submitted clinical trials.

The CPMP requested that a sentence about glaucomas or ocular hypertension superior to 36 mmHg should be included in the SPC, stating that there is no available data on these cases. Regarding iris pigmentation,  it  was  also  requested  by  the  CPMP  that  the  statement:  'It  is  unknown  whether  this darkening is reversible upon discontinuation of a prostaglandin analogue' should be included in the SPC.

Travoprost 0.0040% has an acceptable safety profile. The most frequent adverse ocular event related to  both  concentrations  has  been  hyperaemia.  The  frequency  and  incidence  of  hyperaemia  and discontinuation rate due to hyperaemia with travoprost 0.0040% was superior to travoprost 0.0015% and the severity of hyperaemia in the travoprost 0.0040% group was also superior. However, it should be  recognised  that  hyperaemia  has,  from  a  clinical  point  of  view,  a  limited  relevance  and  that  this incremental  incidence  of  hyperaemia  may  be  considered  as  counterbalanced  by  the  higher  efficacy obtained.

## Safety data for the extension of indication to first line therapy

The Safety Update for TRAVATAN submitted in the application for first line indication included new safety  data  from  10  studies  that  have  been  completed  since  the  MAA  was  submitted  in  November 2000. Furthermore, adverse event experience in the clinical trials initially included in the MAA and post-marketing data were presented.

The major concerns regarding prostaglandin analogues as first line therapy were the adverse events such  as  iris  colour  changes,  eyelash  changes,  periocular  skin  changes  and  cystoid  macular  oedema (CME). Data on these adverse events were therefore also included in the safety update as well as longterm safety data (C-99-10).

## Patients exposure

The additional 10 clinical studies completed since the MAA included an overall total of 786 patients (including  86  from  C-00-20)  of  which  263  patients  (including  21  from  C-00-20)  were  exposed  to TRAVATAN as  monotherapy.  The  overall  exposure  for  TRAVATAN  monotherapy  in  completed clinical studies as of September 2002 included 973 patients as presented in the following table. This table  also  includes  exposure  information  as  a  reference  point  based  upon  the  previous  MAA submission.

*Cumulative exposure to Travoprost as monotherapy in completed clinical studies, including C-00-20.  C-00-20 is not included in the efficacy or exposure section as efficacy or exposure data analysis is ongoing.

**Two patients were evaluated for safety but information on exact length of exposure is missing.

***Includes 20 patients from C-00-20 not included in efficacy or exposure summary as only the safety data has been analysed and efficacy and exposure data analysis is ongoing.

When the MAA was submitted, a total of 655 patients had been exposed to travoprost 15 µ g/ml in monotherapy  (292  for  more  than  9  months)  and  708  patients  had  been  exposed  to  TRAVATAN (travoprost  40 µ g/ml),  of  which  271  patients  had  been  treated  for  9  months  or  more.  Other concentrations of travoprost and  combinations with other anti-glaucoma  medications  were tested in short-term studies, adding up to 1,921 patients that had been exposed to the drug.

In  the  first  line  indication  variation  application  569  additional  patients  were  included  who  have completed treatment with travoprost in short-term clinical trials and 139 who had entered in the longterm  study,  C-99-10.  Out  of  the  total  of  708  travoprost  treated  patients,  460  were  exposed  to TRAVATAN of which 67 patients were enrolled in C-99-10.

In total, 3,622 patients encompassing all treatments studied were included in the analysis. Of these, 2,922 were described in the original MAA.  A total of 896 patients are providing new data, however, this  includes  196  patients  who  rolled  over  into  study  C-99-10  (new  since  the  original  MAA)  from study C-97-79 (included in the original MAA).

The details regarding exposure of patients in the long-term study C-99-10 are presented in the section on efficacy.

## Adverse events

Overall, in the additional 10 studies (C-00-05, C-00-15, C-00-56, C-00-11, C-00-20, C-99-58, C-0124,  C-01-52,  C-01-103,  C-00-57)(N=263)  no  deaths  or  other  serious  adverse  events  were  reported. The types of adverse events observed during these studies were similar to those reported in the MAA. No serious, unexpected, related adverse events have been reported in the additional completed clinical studies.  The  most  common  ocular  adverse  events  (related  and  not-related  combined)  reported  were ocular  hyperaemia  (36.1%),  ocular  pruritus  (4.9%),  dry  eye  (3.8%),  ocular  pain  (3.4%)  and photophobia (2.7%). The most common systemic adverse event was headache (1.9%), with all other systemic adverse events occurring at an incidence of 0.8% (2/263) or less.

Ocular  adverse  events  related  to  TRAVATAN  monotherapy  in  the  additional  10  studies  that  were most  common  were  ocular  hyperaemia  (36.1%),  ocular  pruritus  (4.6%),  ocular  discomfort  (3.0%), ocular  pain  (2.7%)  and  photophobia  (2.3%).    Headache  (0.8%)  was  the  most  common  systemic adverse  event  reported  as  related  to  TRAVATAN  monotherapy,  with  all  other  systemic  related adverse events occurring at an incidence of 0.4% (1/263).

Adverse events for  ocular  hyperaemia,  ocular  pruritus,  dry  eye,  ocular  pain,  and  photophobia  were generally mild and did not require adjunctive treatment. Ocular hyperaemia, ocular pruritus, dry eye, ocular  pain,  and  photophobia  were  generally  related  to  treatment  and  are  included  in  the  SPC  for TRAVATAN.    There  were  no  new  ocular  adverse  events  reported  that  had  not  previously  been reported (as either related or not-related) for travoprost 0.004% monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy in the MAA submission.

The  most  common  systemic  adverse  event  (related  and  not  related  combined)  reported  in  the additional  ten  studies  was  headache  (1.9%).    The  systemic  adverse  events  reported  in  the  ten additional studies were similar in type to those reported in the MAA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Two new systemic adverse events (maculopapular rash and skin disorder) were reported, once each, in the  ten  newly  completed  studies  that  had  not  been  reported  previously  in  clinical  studies  with travoprost.    Both  of  these  resolved  and  were  considered  not-related  to  study  medication.  Facial oedema,  arthralgia,  systemic  pruritus,  and  urticaria  have  not  been  reported  with  travoprost  0.004% previously, but have been reported with travoprost 0.0015% in earlier studies. These adverse events were considered not-related to study drug.

No clinically relevant difference in safety was observed in the 10 additional completed studies when compared  with  the  MAA  clinical  study  database.  This  was  based  upon  an  assessment  of  reported adverse events, and other safety parameters (see table below).

The other safety parameters included in one or more of the ten recently completed studies were visual acuity,  ocular  signs  and  symptoms  (slit-lamp  and  fundus  examinations),  cardiovascular  parameters (pulse  and  blood  pressure),  ocular  hyperaemia,  iris  and  eyelash  photographs,  pupil  diameter, laboratory  parameters  (haematology,  blood  chemistry  and  urinalysis),  visual  field  and  physical examination. These other safety assessments did not identify any new safety issues for TRAVATAN. No clinically relevant treatment-related changes in laboratory parameters were observed during these studies.

The most common ocular adverse events (related and not-related combined) reported in the combined MAA and additional  10  studies  include  ocular  hyperaemia  (39.4%),  ocular  pruritus  (6.6%),  ocular pain (5.0%), and ocular discomfort (4.8%). The most common systemic adverse events (related and not-related  combined)  include  headache  (3.1%),  hypertension  (3.0%),  infection  (2.6%),  and  flu syndrome  (2.0%).  These  adverse  events  are  consistent  with  those  reported  in  the  MAA  for TRAVATAN.

Ocular adverse events related to TRAVATAN monotherapy in the combined MAA and additional 10 studies  that  were  most  common  were  ocular  hyperaemia  (37.0%),  ocular  pruritus  (5.3%),  ocular discomfort (4.0%), and ocular pain (3.3%).  Headache (1.2%) was the most common systemic adverse event reported as related to TRAVATAN monotherapy, with all other systemic related adverse events occurring at an incidence of 0.5% (5/973) or less.  Overall, no deaths or other serious adverse events related to therapy were reported.

## Long-Term Safety Data

An interim safety analysis has been done for study C-99-10 in order to provide long-term safety data to support a first-line indication for TRAVATAN.

Regarding deaths, three patient deaths were reported which included two in the travoprost 0.0015% group (pulmonary emboli and carcinoma) and one in the travoprost 0.004% group (lung carcinoma) and  all  were  unrelated  to  the  study  drug.  All  serious  adverse  events  reported  to  date  have  been assessed as not-related to the use of study medication.

The most frequent adverse event assessed to be related to study drug is ocular hyperaemia occurring at an  incidence  of  13.9%  in  the  travoprost  0.0015%  group,  an  incidence  of  23.9%  in  the  travoprost 0.004% group, and an incidence of 3.5% in the timolol 0.5% group. Other treatment related ocular adverse  events  reported  with  travoprost  0.004%  included  iris  discolouration  (9.0%),  ocular  pain (6.0%),  ocular  discomfort  (4.5%),  ocular  pruritus  (3.0%),  dry  eye  (1.5%),  foreign  body  sensation (1.5%), increased IOP (1.5%), and ocular irritation (1.5%).

Four  patients  discontinued  due  to  treatment  related  adverse  events,  which  included  three  in  the travoprost 0.004% group (ocular discomfort, ocular dryness, ocular hyperaemia and ocular pain) and one in the timolol 0.5% group (dyspnoea).

## Iris pigmentation changes

Change of iris colour is based on the ability of prostaglandin analogues to stimulate melanin formation in melanocytes. The exact mechanism of action is still being elucidated but current studies suggest that natural prostaglandins (such as PGF2 α ) as well as some prostaglandin analogues enhance the activity of tyrosinase, an enzyme that up-regulates an aminoacid essential in the pathway of melanogenesis. Melanogenesis may also be mediated through an increase of endogenous PGE2. However, although this increased pigmentation is not resulting from increased cell division, it is generally not reversible,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and is considered a safety concern. Iris colour change resulting from increased melanogenesis can be classified as a class effect of prostaglandin analogues.

Iris  pigmentation  changes  have  been  reported  in  subjects  treated  with  TRAVATAN.  In  the  MAA, there were 15 subjects (2.1%) from the TRAVATAN 0.0040% treatment group and 20 subjects (2.5%) from the TRAVATAN 0.0015% treatment group reported to have had iris pigmentation changes.

Two  studies  have been completed  since the MAA  filing  that collected information on iris pigmentation  changes  (C-00-11  and  C-99-58).  These  studies  have  no  shown  changes  in  iris pigmentation.

Although  iris  colour  photographs  were  taken  in  7  of  the  studies  included  in  the  MAA  and  one completed study  since  the  MAA  (Study  C-00-11),  iris  colour  changes  have  only  been  noted  in  the longer-term studies (6 months duration or more).

To  further  evaluate  iris  pigmentation  changes,  two  ongoing  studies  (C-97-77  and  C-99-10)  are following subjects for  up to five years. Study C-97-77 enrolled 35 subjects with a documented iris pigmentation  change  from  a  previous  MAH  sponsored  clinical  trial,  while  C-99-10  includes  196 subjects on randomised treatment with travoprost 0.0015%, travoprost 0.0040% or timolol 0.5% for up to five years.

The  ongoing  C-99-10  long-term  study  is  collecting  iris  colour  photographs,  and  iris  pigmentation changes have been seen in this study as well.  Currently, 5 of the 196 (6.9%) subjects treated with travoprost 0.0015% and 6 of 196 (9%) subjects treated with travoprost 0.0040% have adverse events reported for iris pigmentation change in this ongoing study.

Iris pigmentation changes have been seen in a total of 21 patients on TRAVATAN as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy, with on-therapy patient follow-up extending up to 4 years.  When examining the time-course of the patients with iris pigmentation changes in these studies with a minimum duration of 6  months  (C-97-71,  C-97-72,  C-97-79,  C-97-73  and  C-99-10),  most  of  these  changes  (16  of  21) occurred within one year of therapy.  The remaining 5 cases were reported between one and 2 years of therapy.  To date, no additional iris colour changes have been reported after 2 years of therapy.

*Includes patients (N=741) from longer-term studies on TRAVATAN as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy (C-97-71, C-97-72, C-97-79, C-97-73 and C-99-10).

**Includes patients 200 patients from C-97-71 on TRAVATAN monotherapy for up to 12 months.

***Includes 196 patients from C-97-71 on XALATAN monotherapy for up to 12 months.

A direct comparison was provided between TRAVATAN and XALATAN in clinical study C-97-71, which  had  a  study  duration  of  12  months.  The  incidence  of  iris  colour  change  was  2.3%  for TRAVATAN, and 5.2% for XALATAN. The distribution over time appears to be comparable for both drugs with the occurrence having a threshold of approximately 3 months of initial therapy.

In  the  ongoing  worldwide post marketing surveillance of TRAVATAN, 3 reports (reporting rate of 0.0002%) of iris hyper pigmentation have been received.

The CPMP in their Request for Supplementary Information asked the MAH to provide an update on whether  the  MAH  has  any  iris  histology  from  surgical  specimens  in  TRAVATAN  treated  patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

developing increased iris pigmentation. The MAH responded that at present it has no such material, but this should be available from the planned study C-01-78 in patients undergoing trabeculectomy. This was acceptable to the CPMP.

## Eyelash and periocular skin changes

Eyelash  changes  (colour,  length,  density,  and/or  thickness)  have  been  reported  in  the  literature  for prostaglandin analogues and also occurred during the clinical trials with TRAVATAN. It is possible that termination of prostaglandin analogue treatment may reverse this effect but conclusive evidence has not yet been obtained.  This is also true in respect of findings of peri-ocular skin changes. It has been  reported  in  the  literature  that  prostaglandin  analogues  may  stimulate  the  melanogenesis  in epidermal melanocytes and thereby probably mediate tanning of the skin.  It is considered that these changes are also possibly reversible with discontinuing use of medication, but conclusive evidence is not  yet  available.  The  transit  time  of  the  basal  layer  to  the  stratified  corneum  is  4  to  5  weeks,  and shedding  of  the  cornified  layer  requires  two  more  weeks.  Thus  it  takes  at  least  7  weeks  for  skin pigmentation to disappear after discontinuing use of medication. In contrast, iris melanocytes remain stable and changes in iris pigmentation after prostaglandin use persist or regress very slowly.

Adverse events reported for eyelash changes were uncommon in the studies completed following the MAA with  1  patient  (0.1%)  with  exposure  to  travoprost  0.0015%  as  monotherapy  and  7  patients (0.8%)  with  exposure  to  travoprost  0.0040%  as  monotherapy  experiencing  events  coding  to  hair disorder. Also, in the ongoing long-term safety study, 2 patients (2.8%) with exposure to travoprost 0.0015% as monotherapy (one case was related to  the  study  medication  an  the  remaining  one  was considered unrelated) and no patient with exposure to travoprost 0.0040%  as monotherapy experienced events coding to trichiasis.

## Macular oedema

Macular  oedema,  and  particularly  cystoid  macular  oedema  (CME)  has  been  reported  in  patients treated  with  prostaglandin  analogues.  However,  a firm  causal  relationship  has  still  not  been  proven using valid scientific methodology. There have been no reports to date in any clinical investigational study, completed or ongoing, of CME.

Eight cases had been reported in post-marketing surveillance reports (incidence inferior to 0.000303%). There is somewhat limited information available from these patients, but some evidence suggests that this is a class effect for prostaglandin analogues. However, the CPMP in the Request for Supplementary Information asked the MAH to analyse the observed cases of CME.

The MAH responded that since this variation application was submitted, there has been an additional report of CME filed via the post-marketing Spontaneous Adverse Event Reporting System, although this  report  does  not  meet the  minimum reporting criteria. There are therefore a total of 9 reports of CME in the TRAVATAN post-marketing database. Due to the extremely small numbers of patients involved,  any differentiation  is  difficult  to  justify.  The  data  on  patients  who  developed  CME  when treated  with  TRAVATAN  does  not  allow  a  distinction  between  phakic/aphakic  patients  with  or without torn posterior lens capsule.

The  CPMP  considered  that  the  warning  in  section  4.4  should  be  reworded  to  state  that  caution  is recommended  when  using  TRAVATAN  in  aphakic  patients,  in  pseudophakic  patients  with  torn posterior lens capsule or anterior chamber lenses, or in patients with known risk factors for macular oedema.

## Post marketing experience

A total of 2,532,140 units of TRAVATAN have been prescribed world wide between March 2001 and 30  September  2002.  During  this  period  the  MAH  received  two  hundred  and  seventy-one  (271) spontaneous reports possibly associated with the use of TRAVATAN. One hundred and four of these reports fulfilled minimum reporting criteria.

During  the  period  covered  by  this  report,  no  serious  attributable  adverse  events  from  clinical  trials have been received or been published in the literature.

No serious case reports associated with the use of TRAVATAN, meeting minimum reporting criteria, have been received by the MAH's Department of Product Safety before the initial date of this safety report.

All  spontaneous  adverse  events  for  TRAVATAN  were  extremely  uncommon  ( ≤ 0.00304%)  based upon worldwide sales.

Including all spontaneous post-marketing reports, the most frequently reported ocular adverse events were  ocular  hyperaemia,  ocular  pain,  ocular  irritation,  hair  disorder  (eyelash),  and  photophobia. Headache was the most frequently reported systemic adverse event. These events are similar in type to those reported in clinical trials with Travoprost 0.004% and are consistent with the current SPC for TRAVATAN.

Five cases (SOC Eye disorders: 2 cases, Cardiac disorders: 3 cases met the criteria for a serious report. All other adverse reactions received in the period covered by this report were non-serious.

Post-marketing ocular adverse events reported to date with TRAVATAN, but not observed in previous clinical  studies  included  macular  oedema  (8  reports),  IOP  increase  (6  reports),  allergic  reaction  (4 reports),  blindness  (3  reports),  and  reaction  aggravation  (3  reports).  Other  ocular  and  non-ocular adverse events observed in post-marketing reports and not reported previously in clinical trials were isolated adverse events in small numbers of subjects (2 or less).

## Eye disorders

The most frequently reported eye disorders were non serious and labelled (Ocular hyperaemia, Eye pain, Photophobia, Visual acuity reduced; Vision blurred; Eye irritation; and Growth eyelashes). One case of iris hyper pigmentation has been reported.

Two serious cases were received in this period and classified under this SOC. In one case the report included  retinal  haemorrhage,  blindness  not  otherwise  specified,  visual  acuity  reduced,  ocular hyperaemia, and abnormal sensation in eye. In the other case blindness unilateral, eye pain, headache not otherwise specified were reported. Evaluation of these serious reports by the MAH indicated that underlying diseases in both cases are the most likely explanation for the loss of vision reported.

The CPMP, after review of first 6 month PSUR, requested specific monitoring of the following eye disorders:

## Macular Oedema: as reported above.

Cycloplegia:  Two  cases  were  received  during  this  reporting  period.  Neither  case  was  considered serious.  The  information  collected  did  not  allow  further  analysis.  Two  other  cases  were  coded  as Accommodation disorder. In one case the event had resolved and patient resumed taking the product without further problems. In the other case, the accommodation disorder was not the primary event, but only one of eight non-serious complaints. No additional follow up was possible.

Specific literature searches had been implemented with no relevant results.

The MAH was asked in the Request for Supplementary Information to submit an updated review of all cases of intraocular inflammation and to discuss iritis and uveitis in more detail in particular any predisposing factors in the cases that might form a basis for a warning in section 4.4 of the SPC.

The  MAH  reviewed  the  adverse  event  codes  of  Flare,  Cells,  Iritis,  and  Uveitis  from  the  twenty completed  clinical  studies  in  order  to  provide  an  update  on  intraocular  inflammation  seen  in TRAVATAN monotherapy patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall,  intraocular  inflammation  (determined  by  the  codes  of  flare,  cells,  iritis  and  uveitis)  occurs rarely.  Overall,  these  events  are  non-serious,  mild  to  moderate,  usually  resolve  with  or  without treatment  and  generally  do  not  interrupt  patient  continuation  in  the  studies.  No  clear  pattern  of predisposing factors for iritis/uveitis with TRAVATAN is noted, except that 1 patient with uveitis had a  history  of  this  with  other  prostaglandin  analogues.  There  were  no  other  cases  with  a  history  of iritis/uveitis mentioned, and only a few patients had undergone prior ocular surgery.

The number of cases with TRAVATAN is presently small, but the CPMP proposed that a statement should  be  added  to  the  TRAVATAN  SPC  to  state  that  in  patients  with  predisposing  factors  for iritis/uveitis, TRAVATAN can be used with caution.'

## Cardio-vascular events:

During the period covered by this PSUR, a total of ten reports were received that included events subsequently coded as cardiac disorders and three cases as vascular disorders.

Three cases were serious (2 cases of myocardial infarction, 1 case of hypertensive crisis and tachycardia). The MAH's assessment reveals other, more likely, causes for the reactions reported such as underlying pathologies or concomitant medications. The remaining seven cases were non serious and can be regarded as isolated events that could have more than one possible cause.

The  three  cases  of  vascular  disorders  received  during  this  period  were  non  serious  and  labelled (bradycardia, hypotension and hypertension).

None of the cases received reveals any safety concern related to specific effects of TRAVATAN upon the vascular system.

Clinical studies completed or ongoing since the product was first approved have not identified any cardiovascular events that would impact the safety profile.

No relevant new information related to cardiovascular effects of TRAVATAN has been found in the literature.

## Nervous system disorders

All  events  in  this  SOC  were  classified  as  non-serious.  The  most  frequently  described  reaction  was Headache (n = 11), a labelled event, followed by Dizziness  (n = 3), which was the primary reaction in only one case.

## Respiratory thoracic and mediastinal disorders

All events were non-serious. The most frequently reported event was Asthma exacerbation (3 cases). In these patients, with pre-existing asthmatic disease, the current status and control of the illness was unknown, and direct causality is difficult to establish in such predisposed patients. However, there is an additional isolated case, where TRAVATAN allegedly caused Asthma Not Otherwise Specified.

In  the  Request  for  Supplementary  Information  the  CPMP  asked  the  MAH  to  discuss  the  studied exposure in patients with known asthma.

The  MAH  responded  that  including  all  studies  with  a  TRAVATAN  monotherapy  arm,  only  11 patients had a history of either previous or currently ongoing asthma. Of these 11 patients, only 1 had an adverse event for asthma. Additionally, six patients treated with TRAVATAN monotherapy had a history of either previous or currently ongoing COPD or emphysema. None of these patients had an adverse event related to COPD or emphysema exacerbation. Although only a small number of patients with known asthma, COPD or emphysema have been identified in clinical trials, based upon this data, no safety risks have been identified in this population of patients. The CPMP noted, however, that on review of the updated PSUR submitted a total of 3 spontaneous reports of asthma exacerbation were reported, plus 1 case of asthma and isolated cases of COAD exacerbation and dyspnoea. It is known that prostaglandin F2alfa has bronchoconstrictor effects and although a rare adverse event it can not be considered an unexpected adverse event.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Systemic allergic reactions

The MAH was also asked in the Request for Supplementary Information to give a fuller discussion on new reports from studies and marketing surveillance involving systemic allergic events.

Details of 2 new systemic adverse events from completed clinical studies since the MAA and seven post-marketing reports related to systemic allergic events were reviewed by the MAH. The 2 reports from clinical studies were of maculopapular rash and 'skin disorder'.

The  CPMP  considered  that  when  looking  at  the  fuller  description  of  the  spontaneous  reports submitted,  in  the  main  they  are  not  indicative  of  systemic  allergy  and  that  the  extent  of  data  is insufficient to require a change in the labelling.

## Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders

All  events  received  are  non-serious.  The  most  commonly  reported  events  were  'Skin  hyper pigmentation' and 'Hair colour changes'. These events are adequately explained as possible in the SPC.

## Summary on safety

Globally,  3,622  patients  encompassing  all  treatments  studied  are  included  in  the  submitted  current analysis. Of these, 2,922 were described in the original MAA and 896 patients are providing new data.

Regarding  the  exposure  across  time,  in  the  original  MAA,  there  were  no  data  on  patient  exposure beyond 12 months. In the application for first line therapy, there are safety and efficacy available data for 139 patients (study C-99-10) treated with travoprost for up to 48 months. Of these patients, 106 were treated for more than 3 years on either travoprost 15 µ g/ml or travoprost 40 µ g/ml.

The  additional  studies  and  new  safety  data  confirm  the  established  adverse  events  profile  for TRAVATAN since the reported  ocular  and  non-ocular  adverse  events  in  the  additional  10  studies were similar in type, severity and intensity to those reported in the MAA and to those included in the current SPC for TRAVATAN. Therefore, no new safety concerns or risks have been identified based upon the adverse event data or other safety parameters for TRAVATAN in the additional short-term studies.

The most common ocular adverse events related to TRAVATAN monotherapy in the ongoing longterm study are similar to those reported in the initial MAA regarding type, severity and intensity. The ocular tolerability for TRAVATAN when it is administered beyond 12 months appears similar to the ocular  tolerability  in  the  short-term  administration.  Overall,  post-marketing  adverse  events  were generally similar in type to those observed in clinical studies with Travoprost 0.004%.

Two new studies have been performed and completed since the MAA and two ongoing studies are being carried out in order to further assess the iris pigmentation changes related to travoprost.

The submitted data appears to point out to the fact that changes on iris colouration are produced within the first two years of therapy, mainly, the first year, without no additional iris colour changes after the second  year  of  therapy.  Therefore,  although  the  completion  of  the  ongoing  studies  could  provide definitive data  on  iris colour  changes,  the  available  data  support  the  fist  line  indication  for TRAVATAN based on the fact that no additional iris  colour  changes  have  been  reported  after  the second year of therapy.

Regarding  eyelash  changes  the  most  relevant  study  is  still  ongoing  and  definitive  data  will  not  be available until its finalisation. However, the complaints of eyelash changes seems to be very rare and it  does  not  appear  to  be  a  clinically  relevant  issue  that  precludes  the  utilisation  of  TRAVATAN  as first-line therapy.

Although a causal relationship between the use of prostaglandin analogues and the occurrence of CME has  not  been  proven  for  travoprost,  CME  could  be  considered  as  a  class  effect  for  prostaglandin analogues.

## 5. Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment

## Benefit/risk assessment

## Quality

Pharmaceutical  data  show  that  the  active  substance  and  finished  product  are  manufactured  and controlled in a satisfactory way, resulting in a product of uniform quality suitable for ophthalmic use. A number of minor issues were unresolved at the time of the opinion and these will be dealt with as Follow up measures. These follow up measures have no impact on the benefit risk ratio and do not prevent a positive opinion.

## Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology

Overall,  the  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  provided  adequate  evidence  that  travoprost  is  well tolerated and produces a significant reduction of IOP. The general pharmacology studies showed, that secondary pharmacological activity following systemic administration is generally unremarkable and the effects, as a result of the prostanoid receptor agonist activity of travoprost, occur at doses/concentrations many fold higher than those anticipated in clinical use.

The toxicity studies were, in general, uneventful. However, in view of the pronounced effects in the reproductive  toxicity  studies  and  the  significant  excretion  into  maternal  milk,  use  of  travoprost  in pregnancy and lactation should be discouraged. This information has been included in the SPC.

## Efficacy

Travoprost  dosed  once  daily  produced  both  clinically  relevant  and  statistically  significant  IOP reductions when used as a monotherapy. The IOP reductions were maintained over the entire 6 to 12 month treatment periods. The CPMP concluded that Travoprost 0.0040% is numerically superior to travoprost  0.0015%  in  analyses  on  mean  IOP  efficacy  and  the  rate  of  responders  is  superior  with travoprost 0.0040%.

In comparison to timolol, travoprost has, in general, worse ocular tolerability and a limited knowledge on  its  mechanism  of  action  and  on  the  long-term  adverse  effects.  Efficacy  and  safety  may  be comparable  to  that  of  latanoprost,  indicated  in  patients  that  do  not  tolerate  or  have  insufficient response to any other treatment. The applicant agreed with the recommendation of the CPMP and the wording of the indication in the SPC was been modified to only include the second line.

The efficacy of travoprost as adjunctive therapy to timolol has been studied in one pivotal trial. As no comparison to another active treatment (e.g. latanoprost) in adjunctive therapy was performed, there is information  about  the  absolute  efficacy  of  travoprost  when  added  to  timolol  in  patients  not  well controlled  with  timolol  alone,  but  we  do  not  know  how  it  compares  with  other  possible  approved adjunctive  therapies  to  timolol.  When  used  adjunctively  with  timolol,  travoprost  produced  both clinically relevant and statistically superior IOP reductions compared to vehicle. The IOP reductions were maintained over the entire 6-month treatment period. The differences between travoprost 0.004% and 0.0015% were not statistically significant. The CPMP raised a third major objection regarding the limitations of the indication in adjunctive therapy (limited data with brimonidine, absence of data with other antiglaucomatous agents). This has been solved and the wording of the SPC was modified in order to reflect these limitations.

The initial Marketing Authorisation application did contain comparative efficacy data to standard first line therapy (timolol) and another prostaglandin analogue (latanoprost) that showed similar efficacy of travoprost than with both comparators. In the application for first line therapy the long-term efficacysafety study C-99-10 showed that the IOP reduction produced by TRAVATAN at the initiation of the study  were  consistently  maintained  throughout  the  study.  Although  the  number  of  patients  treated beyond 36 months was scarce (n=51), this can be taken as a further confirmation of the maintenance of the effect along the time. Taking into account the intended chronic use of this medicinal product this  can  be  considered  a  clinically  relevant  characteristic.  The  findings  are  consistent  with  the  data reported in the initial dossier. TRAVATAN has shown at least similar efficacy or superior efficacy to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

standard  therapy  (timolol)  with  some  characteristics  that  suggest  its  use  as  first  line  treatment  (i.e. different contraindications, more commodity of use because of a single administration per day).

## Safety

The safety profile of travoprost is in accordance with that expected from the pre-clinical studies. Most of adverse events were mild and non-serious and 6.2% of the of the patients treated with travoprost 0.0040% discontinued treatment due to any adverse event, related or unrelated to the therapy. Most related adverse reactions were ocular, mainly hyperemia, burning or stinging, pruritus, iris discolouration and others. With regard to related systemic adverse reactions, they appeared in about 4% of patients and the most frequently reported reaction was headache. N o  deaths  or  other  serious events  related  to  Travoprost  15  or  40 µ g/ml  were  reported  during  the  studies.  No  changes  in biochemical or haematological parameters have been found.

Ocular side effects were comparable to those described with latanoprost and in the view of the CPMP the tolerability of travoprost is not inferior to latanoprost. In comparison to timolol, the frequency of ocular  side  effects  is  higher  with  travoprost  than  with  timolol.  On  the  other  hand,  less  systemic cardiovascular and respiratory effects could be expected although this has not been evidenced in the submitted clinical trials.

In the application for first line therapy data were submitted on 896 additional patients including safety data  for  139  patients  (study  C-99-10)  treated  with  travoprost  for  up  to  48  months.  The  additional safety data confirm the established adverse events profile for TRAVATAN. The reported ocular and non-ocular adverse events were similar in type, severity and intensity to those reported in the MAA and to those included in the current SPC for TRAVATAN.

Ocular tolerance of TRAVATAN is accepted to be somewhat poorer than timolol, with high rates of ocular hyperaemia in particular, although events are usually not severe and this is balanced by a more favourable systemic safety profile.

The majority of increased iris pigmentation cases occurred within 1 year of starting therapy and most often  within  2  years  of  treatment.  It  appears  to  reach  a  maximal  observable  level  with  continued treatment up to 4 years. Limited data seem to suggest that increased iris pigmentation is not associated with  any  other  symptoms.  Data  indicate  that  if  treatment  is  stopped  (and  in  10  cases  where prostaglandin analogues were continued), iris changes do not reverse but neither do they continue to progress during 2 years of follow-up. The mechanism of action for increased iris pigmentation is not fully understood, but is thought to result from increased melanogenesis rather than from increased cell division.

## Benefit/risk assessment

Travoprost  is  a  synthetic  prostaglandin  PGF2 ∀ analogue  proposed  to  be  used  in  topical  ocular administration in open angle glaucoma. The mechanisms involved in the decrease of the intraocular pressure  (IOP)  are  not  well  known  but  are  supposed  to  be  related  to  the  increase  of  the  aqueous humour outflow through the uveoscleral pathway. Some uncertainty exists about the effects on other tissues in the eye and the possible long-term effects of such an inflammatory mediator.

Two different concentrations (0.0015% and 0.0040%) were studied in pivotal clinical trials without differences in efficacy and  marginal differences in safety. Although the applicant initially proposed both dosages to be approved, the CPMP concluded that Travoprost 0.0040% is numerically superior to travoprost  0.0015%  in  analyses  of  mean  IOP  efficacy  and  the  rate  of  responders  is  superior  with travoprost 0.0040%. There thus is no justification for the co-existence of both concentrations.

Travoprost lowers IOP in monotherapy with a slightly higher efficacy than timolol at the cost of a worse ocular tolerability. When compared to a similar product, latanoprost, efficacy and safety seem comparable. Timolol is the first line product to decrease IOP in open angle glaucoma and although efficacious and well tolerated has some limitations in certain populations due to the potential systemic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

side  effects  (mainly  bronchoconstriction).  Therefore,  travoprost  could  be  useful  for  some  patients where timolol (or other alternative products such carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, α 2 agonists) can not be used. Due to the fact that in clinical trials it shows a higher decrease of IOP and a higher rate of responders, it could be accepted also to treat patients with insufficient response to timolol, although a specific trial in these patients is lacking.

The combined therapy of travoprost plus timolol obtains an additional decrease of IOP in patients with insufficient  control  with  timolol  alone.  However,  some  ocular  adverse  reactions  also  increase  and, unfortunately, there are not comparative data to other accepted similar combined therapies (i.e. timolol plus latanoprost). In addition, only one trial where travoprost is added to timolol has been performed and there is no information from controlled clinicaltrials of the combination of trvoprost with other products  also  indicated  when  timolol  cannot  be  used  (carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitors,  a2  agonists). Therefore, although the adjunctive therapy is an interesting place in therapeutics of the product, it can only be accepted taking into account these limitations and with a consequent wording in the SPC.

Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered initially that the benefit/risk profile of Travatan was favourable in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients  with  ocular  hypertension  or  open-angle  glaucoma  who  are  intolerant  or  insufficiently responsive  to  another  intraocular  pressure  lowering  medication,  as  monotherapy  or  as  adjunctive therapy.  However,  following  the  assessment  of  new  data  submitted  in  the  context  of  a  Type  II variation  the  CPMP  considered  that  a  current  better  understanding  of  the  mechanism  of  action  of prostaglandin analogues, as well as reassuring long term safety data available for travoprost supported the use of TRAVATAN as a first-line antiglaucoma therapy. Furthermore, although beta-blockers are still the well-established initial therapy it should be recognised that prostaglandin analogues may be a convenient alternative in some patients due to the initial good efficacy, which is sustained over time, the less frequent administration, a more favourable systemic safety and contraindications profile. The CPMP therefore considered that the benefit/risk profile of Travatan is favourable in the treatement of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.
