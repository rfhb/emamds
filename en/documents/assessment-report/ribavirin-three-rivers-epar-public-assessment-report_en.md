## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Ribavirin Three Rivers 200 mg Hard Capsule is a generic medicinal product containing ribavirin as the active substance. The application for 200 mg tablets was submitted under the Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC i.e. generic application referring to a reference medicinal product.

Ribavirin Three Rivers is presented as hard capsules containing 200 mg of ribavirin as active substance. The excipients used in the preparation of the capsules are well known excipients such as croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose and povidone. The capsule shell contains gelatine and titanium dioxide (E171). The capsule shell imprint contains shellac, propylene glycol, concentrated ammonia solution and colouring agents (Yellow iron oxide E172, Indigotine E132 and Titanium dioxide E171).

Ribavirin  is  a  purine  nucleoside  analogue  that  is  active  against  a  number  of  DNA  and  RNA  viruses. There are numbers of proposed mechanisms of action for ribavirin. These include indirect effects such as  inhibition  of  inosine  monophosphate  and  immunomodulatory  effects  and  direct  effects  such  as polymerase  inhibition  and  interference  with  viral  RNA  capping.  Ribavirin  has  demonstrated  antiviral activity in vitro against respiratory syncytial virus and in vivo in infected cotton rats when administered intraperitoneally or by aerosol. Pharmacokinetic  properties  as  well  as  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  are  documented  for  the  reference medicinal product Rebetol. Two single dose bioequivalence studies with the Ribavirin Three Rivers and with the reference product Rebetol were submitted to support the application. The indication for Ribavirin Three Rivers is different from the reference medicinal product. It is part of the indication approved for the reference medicinal product. The therapeutic indication of Rebetol is: Rebetol  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  hepatitis  C  and  must  only  be  used  as  part  of  a combination regimen with peginterferon alfa-2b (adults) or interferon alfa-2b (adults and children of 3years of age or older). There is no safety or efficacy information on the use of Rebetol with other forms of  interferon  (i.e.,  not  alfa-2b),  or  on  the  use  of  Rebetol  with  peginterferon  alfa-2b  in  children  or adolescents. The therapeutic indication of Ribavirin Three Rivers is: Ribavirin Three Rivers is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and must only be used as part of a combination regimen with interferon alfa-2b (adults, children (3 years of age and older) and adolescents).  Ribavirin monotherapy must not be used. There is no safety or efficacy information on the use of Ribavirin with other forms of interferon (i.e., not alfa-2b). 2.2. Quality aspects 2.2.1. Introduction Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ribavirin Three Rivers hard capsules are packaged in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle, closed with a child-resistant (CR) polypropylene (PP) screw cap.

## 2.2.2. Active substance

The active substance in this product is Ribavirin (INN) or 1-ß-D-Ribofuranosyl-1 H -1,2,4-triazole-3 carboxamide (Chemical Name) and has the following structure:

Ribavirin  is  a  white  to  off-white  powder  with  lumps,  soluble  in  water,  slightly  soluble  in  anhydrous ethanol and insoluble in ether and chloroform. It has a specific rotation between -33.5 to -37.0° (USP 28) or -33 to -37° (Ph. Eur. 5), pH value in water  4.0 - 6.5, melting Point Onset 169 ± 2°C. The API exhibits polymorphism, with two forms, one melting at 170 û C and one melting at 180 û C.  The polymorphic form manufactured in this EDMF is the low melting point one. Ribavirin contains four chiral centers in the sugar portion of the molecule. Thus, there are 16 possible stereoisomers. Ribavirin is synthesized as a single isomer (ß-D-isomer) by the current synthetic route. 2.2.2.1. Manufacture Information about manufacturing process has been provided using Active Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure. A three step synthesis involving coupling step (formation of ribavirin ester), ammonolysis (formation of  crude  ribavirin)  and  re-crystallisation  (formation  of  ribavirin)  has  been  well  described. Controls of critical steps and intermediates are sufficient to ensure quality of the final compound. The active substance has been characterised using Infra-red (IR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Ultra-violet  (UV)  and  Mass  Spectrometry  (MS)  techniques.    The  active  substance  exhibits  two polymorphic forms. Based on the analysis melting points (by DSC), X-ray powder diffraction patterns, and IR spectra it can be concluded that the ASMF Holder produces Ribavirin a single polymorphic form (lower melting point only).  In addition, it has been demonstrated that the polymorphic form remains stable and no change occurs over time. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Potential impurities have been well discussed in relation to their origin and potential carry-over into the final drug substance.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.2.2. Specification

The  drug  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  physical  appearance,  identification  (IR),  specific rotation, loss of drying, pH, sulphated ash, heavy metals, related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), melting  range  and  residual  solvents  (GC).  The  specification  generally  complies  with  the  Ph  Eur monograph for ribavirin with additional in-house tests for which suitable validation data are provided.

2.2.3.1.

The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain hard capsules, containing quantitatively and qualitatively the same drug substance as the reference medicinal product, Rebetol 200mg capsules and to be bioequivalent.

A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Most of the methods are Ph Eur apart from  polymorph  testing  (by  melting  point)  and  residual  solvents.  Full  method  validation  data  was provided for the non compendial (in-house) analytical methods. Impurities have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety. The GC method for residual solvents has been suitably validated for reproducibility, linearity, method precision,  accuracy  (recovery),  limit  of  detection  and  limit  of  quantitation.  All  residual  solvent acceptance criteria are in line with ICH recommended limits and proposed limits for impurities comply with the Ph Eur monograph for ribavirin. In general analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the drug substance. Data  on  three  commercial  batches  of  ribavirin  have  been  provided  by  the  ASMF  Holder  and  the requirements in the drug substance specification were met. 2.2.2.3. Stability Stability data has been provided from three batches of material stored at ICH long term conditions Three  commercial  batches  have  been  stored  under  ICH  long  term  conditions  (up  to  24  months  at 25 û C/65%RH).    The  data  demonstrates  that  the  API  is  stable.    No  adverse  stability  trends  are observed. The parameters tested during stabilities studies are Identification, pH, Specific Rotation, Loss on Drying, HPLC Related Substances (Impurity F, Any other impurity, and Total), and Assay. The acceptance criteria and analytical procedures are the unchanged from those performed at release. The stability studies confirmed the proposed re-test period with the storage condition statement 'Store in the original containers'. 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product Pharmaceutical Development Medicinal product no longer authorised

The manufacturing process for Ribavirin Capsules has undergone very little change since this product was developed as a generic version of an already approved drug in the U.S. market. The original (pilotscale) manufacturing process was developed simultaneously with the formulation development. Upon

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

identification of a formulation that provided the necessary dissolution and other desired properties, the same process was utilized for the manufacture of the original (pilot-scale) batch.

During  the  optimization  and  scale  up  of  the  manufacturing  process  the  following  processes  were validated  and  optimized:  Wet  Granulation,  Extrusion/Spheronization,  Pellet  Drying  and  Sieving, Encapsulation, Packaging and Labeling

The excipients used in the drug product are the same as those in the reference product Rebetol 200mg capsules with the exception of the use of povidone in the proposed product and magnesium stearate in Rebetol and the use of different printing inks.  The applicant states that compatibility with all other excipients  can  be  justified  on  the  basis  of  Rebetol  and  the  stability  data  generated  on  the  finished product is sufficient to indirectly demonstrate compatibility with povidone and the printing ink.  This is acceptable. The excipients used in the manufacture of Ribavirin Capsules are microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, povidone, and purified water.   These excipients are controlled using the PhEur specifications.  Satisfactory certificates of analysis have been provided. The primary container closure system for Ribavirin Capsules is a high-density polyethylene bottle with a child-resistant, polypropylene induction-seal screw cap.  The applicant propose a 100ml bottle for the 84 pack size and a 250ml bottle for the 112,140 and 168 pack sizes 2.2.3.2. 2.2.3.3. Adventitious agents Only  lactose  monohydrate  and  hard  gelatin  capsules  are  of  human  or  animal  origin.  Valid  PhEur Certificates of Suitability for the bovine gelatin used to make the capsules are provided and the lactose monohydrate that was used to manufacture the capsules is from bovine milk from cows in the USA. Based on this information, the excipients used to manufacture capsules do not pose a TSE risk. Manufacture of the product The manufacturing process involves wet granulation, followed by extrusion and drying to produce pellets, which are encapsulated into capsules Validation of the manufacturing process of Ribavirin Capsules was performed using three consecutive full-scale  production  batches.  The  critical  steps  in  the  manufacturing  process  to  be  monitored  were identified  as:  granulation,  extrusion,  spheronization,  drying,  pellet  sifting,  and  capsule  filling.  These steps were identified as critical because they directly or indirectly affect the quality attributes of the pellet and capsule content uniformity and capsule dissolution. The validation data demonstrate that the manufacturing process is robust and reproducible and ensure that  the  product  has  the  quality,  purity,  strength,  and  identity  that  it  purports.  The  manufacturing process has been suitably validated. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.3.4. Product specification

The product specification is standard for tablets and contains tests with suitable limits for appearance, identification (HPLC and UV), dissolution, uniformity of dosage units (by mass variation), assay (HPLC), impurities and degradation products (HPLC), microbial limits (Ph Eur) and water content. Degradation products  are  controlled  and  their  limits  are  justified  by  reference  to  stability  studies  and  toxicology studies.

Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

2.2.3.5. Full details of all analytical methods have been provided. Batch analysis data on key parameters are provided from six commercial scale batches of Ribavirin Capsules  according  to  the  European  specification.  Batches  met  the  proposed  specification  limits. Results  showed  that  tablets  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly  according  to  the  finished  product specifications. Stability of the product Stability studies were carried out for three batches under ICH conditions of 25ºC/60%RH (long term, 36 months)  in  the  proposed  100ml  bottles  and  40ºC/75%RH  (accelerated,  6 months)  in  the  250ml bottles.  Bracketing  studies  in  10ml  containers  containing  10  capsules  and  1300ml  containers containing 1000 capsules have also been conducted, for which complete long-term (36 months) and accelerated (6 months) stability data in are available. The data shows no adverse stability trends and all specifications are met. In addition, two stability studies have been completed on Ribavirin Capsules stored in bulk containers (Sanitainers and 2-mil LDPE Bag/Fiber Drums), which showed no adverse stability trends. Photostability  studies  in  accordance  with  ICH  requirements  have  been  conducted.  The  drug  product was found not be light sensitive. The stability parameters and specifications for Ribavirin Capsules are  identical to that proposed for batch release except that only stability-indicating parameters are retained (i.e., the Identification and Uniformity of Dosage Units (weight variation) tests are omitted on stability). Based on the stability data the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC are acceptable. 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

Ribavirin  is  an  approved  product  of  long-established  use.  Its  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetic  and toxicology profiles are well understood and well documented.

The  applicant  has  provided  an  acceptable  summary  of  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and toxicology of ribavirin based on published literature. No further studies are required and the applicant has adequately justified why no such data was provided.

<!-- image -->

The impurity profiles of both the drug substance and medicinal product are compliant with the Ph. Eur. Monograph and ICH guidance and are acceptable. A suitable justification for the absence of a formal environmental risk assessment has been provided, based on the expectation that introduction of these generic products onto the market is unlikely to result in an increase in the combined sales of all ribavirin-containing products, which in turn is unlikely to increase exposure of the environment to ribavirin. 2.4. Clinical aspects Introduction This  application  concerns  a  generic  medicinal  product  that  contains  a  single  strength  of  200  mg ribavirin in a hard capsule. Pharmacokinetic properties as well as clinical efficacy and safety have been well demonstrated for the reference product Rebetol. To support the marketing authorisation application, the applicant had conducted two bioequivalence studies  with  the  EU  reference  product  under  fasting  and  fed  condition.  Furthermore,  the  applicant presented two additional bioequivalence studies conducted with the US reference product under fasting and  fed  condition.  Detailed  assessment  of  the  US  studies  has  not  been  included  in  the  CHMP assessment report. No  CHMP  scientific  advice  was  sought  for  the  development  programme,  neither  was  scientific recommendation given by Member States. GCP All bioequivalence studies were complying with GCP, as claimed by the applicant. A routine inspection was carried out for the bioequivalence studies performed with the EU reference product (M1ER07001 and M1ER07002) since the clinical/analytical sites used in these trials had not been previously inspected by the European Medicines Agency. No critical findings were observed at either the Clinical Laboratory or the Clinical Facility. The overall compliance with GCP and GLP was deemed to be satisfactory for the studies reviewed and the data submitted in the application is acceptable. Clinical studies Medicinal product no longer authorised

To support the application, the applicant has submitted four bioequivalence studies conducted under fed or fasting conditions with either the EU or the US reference product. These studies are summarized in table 1 below. Studies M1ER07001 and M1ER07002 are further described in the relevant sections.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Methods

## Study design

Study M1ER07001 was a single dose, randomised, open-label, two-period, crossover bioequivalence study conducted under fasting conditions.

Each of the study subjects received three 200 mg capsules of ribavirin (600 mg as a single dose) of the test or the reference product according to the randomisation schedule in period 1 and 2. Subjects were housed at the clinical facility the night before drug administration and remained at the clinical facility until  the  24  hour  blood  sample  collection.  Subjects  were  fasted  for  at  least  10  hours  prior  to administration of study drug which was administered with 240 mL water. Washout period was 5 weeks between the period 1 and 2.

Reference Product:

44 subjects were to be enrolled, but 43 subjects were actually dosed, one subject was excluded due to non-compliance with age. The study population was comprised of healthy surgically sterile male and/or postmenopausal or surgically sterile female volunteers under fasting conditions. 3 men and 40 women were enrolled.

Blood samples were collected prior to dosing (0 hour) and after dose administration at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours post dosing. Nineteen blood samples (approximately 114 ml) were collected over the course of each study period.  All samples were cooled by an ice bath until processed. Samples were processed within 60 min after the withdrawal. The study was conducted at the clinical trial site of the Allied Research International - Cetero Research, Florida, USA.

A SAS® program and the generalized linear model of the analysis of variance with sequence, subject within sequence, period and treatment effects was used to calculate the least square means for the parameters  AUC0-72  and  Cmax  using  ln-transformed  data.  Ratios  of  least-squares  means  and  90% confidence intervals  for  the  difference  between  formulation  least-squares  means  were  calculated  for the Cmax and AUC0-72.

Analytical methods Analytical part of the bioequivalence study was conducted at the BA Research Co. - Cetero Research in Canada from 23 April 2008 to 9 May 2008. The analysis was performed by a LC/MS/MS system. The positive ions were measured using ElectroSpray Ionisation technique in MRM mode. Study samples were analysed in a total of 22 analytical sequences, including 2 repeats. Within-study accuracy  and  precision  was  within  the  acceptance  range,  98%  to  101%  and  2.0%  to  6.6%, respectively,  based  on  the  back-calculated  concentrations  of  quality  control  (QC)  samples  and calibration curve samples. Calibration curve ranged from 20.0 ng/ml to 2000.0 ng/ml. The  specificity  of  the  assay  was  documented  during  sample  analysis  by  assaying  pre-dose  samples from period 1. During validation plasma from 8 donors was evaluated and no significant interfering peaks  were  observed  at  the  retention  times  of  ribavirin.  Matrix  effect  was  also  studied.  Dilution integrity by factor 10 and analyte stability at various storage conditions were shown. The long term stability  at  three  concentrations  was  established  and  covered  the  actual  sample  storage  period. Recovery for sample preparation with acetonitrile was determined. The  analytical  method  was  validated  according  to  the  FDA  Guidance  on  the  Bioanalytical  Method Validation.  Within-study  validation  was  shown  based  on  the  back-calculated  concentrations  of  the quality control samples and calibration curve samples. Pharmacokinetic Variables Pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, Tmax, were determined. These parameters for each individual were  tabulated  and  graphically  presented.  Non-compartmental  analysis  and  the  linear  trapezoidal method were used to calculate AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ ,  AUC0-72/ AUC0-∞ ,  Kel,  t1/2,  as  well  as  ln-transformed AUC0-∞ were also calculated for information purposes only. For the calculation of Kel the R2 had to be &gt;0.8000. Actual blood collection times were used for pharmacokinetic calculations. All values below the lower limit of quantitation (BLQ) were considered as zero during the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. Statistical methods The  primary  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  Cmax  and  AUC0-72  transformed  to  their  natural logarithms. AUC0-72 was chosen as the appropriate parameter for bioequivalence because ribavirin has a  long  terminal  half-life  estimated  to  be  greater  than  200  hours.  Therefore  the  truncated  AUC  was deemed to be the appropriate bioequivalence parameter. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Results

38 out of 43 subjects enrolled completed the study. Among the 5 dropouts of the study, one subject was tested positive  for  cotinine  and  one  subject  was  tested  positive  for  pregnancy.  Therefore,  they were withdrawn prior to Period 2 dosing. Also, three subjects did not show for Period 2 dosing. The subject who had a positive pregnancy test was later found to have an abnormal cystic ovarian mass and pregnancy was excluded.

There were 14 non-serious (mild or moderate) adverse events and one serious adverse event during the conduct of the study. The serious adverse event detected was considered unlikely related to the drug by the investigator. All adverse events were followed until resolution with the exception of one serious adverse event (abnormal cystic ovarian neoplasm) which is being followed up.

None of the pre-dose samples contained detectable levels of ribavirin. For period 2, for most of the study subjects an interfering peak was detected at the retention time of ribavirin, but all these samples were quantified less than the LLOQ and were reported as zero. None of the first post-dose samples was reported as a Cmax. The ratio of AUC0-t / AUC0-∞ ranged from 55%  to  82%.  Since  ribavirin  has  long  elimination  half  life,  AUC0-t  was  chosen  as  a  primary pharmacokinetic parameter according to the study protocol. Pharmacokinetics parameters of the  38 subjects who completed the clinical part are presented in tables 3 and 4 below. Table 3: Summary of individual and mean pharmacokinetic parameters of Ribavirin Table 4: Summary of the statistical analysis for Ribavirin Ln-transformed data The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for AUC0-72, AUC0-∞ and Cmax were all contained within the usual Bioequivalence acceptance range of 0.80 to 1.25. The 90% CI for AUC0-∞ was 94.66106.96. Safety data Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Study M1ER07002 - Bioequivalence study with the EU reference product under fed conditions

## Methods

## Study design

Study M1ER07002 was a single dose, randomised, open-label, two-period, crossover bioequivalence study conducted under fed conditions.

Washout period was 5 weeks between the period 1 and 2.

The mean age of subjects was 46 years, with the range of 25 to 55 years. Inclusion and exclusion criteria presented were acceptable for the product and for this type of study.

Each of the study subjects received three 200 mg capsules of ribavirin (600 mg as a single dose) of the test  or  the  reference  product  according  to  the  randomisation  schedule  in  period  1  and  2.  The randomization scheme was computer generated using SAS version 9.1. According to the study report, 600 mg dose was selected to represent a usual therapeutic dose. Subjects were housed at the clinical facility the night before drug administration and remained at the clinical  facility  until  the  24  hour  blood  sample  collection.  Subjects  were  fasted  for  at  least  10  hours prior  to  administration  of  standardised  high-fat  breakfast  in  period  1  and  2.  Study  drug  was administered after receiving the breakfast with 240 mL water. The standardized breakfast was received 30 minutes prior to dosing and consisted of eight ounces of whole milk, two eggs fried in butter, two strips of bacon, two slices of toast with butter, and four ounces of hash brown potatoes. Blood samples were collected prior to dosing (0 hour) and after dose administration at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours post dosing. Nineteen blood samples (approximately 114 ml) were collected over the course of each study period.  All samples were cooled by an ice bath until processed. Samples were processed within 60 min after the withdrawal. This study was conducted at the clinical trial site of the Allied Research International - Cetero Research, Florida, USA. The clinical part of the study was undertaken from 15 March 2008 (first dosing) to 19 April 2008 (second dosing). The amended final study protocol and revised consent (dated 10 March 2008) was approved by the Ethics  Committee of the Florida Institutional  Review  Board Services  on  12 March  2008.  Subsequent changes were made in the consent form including the addition of a statement that the drug was FDA approved. A revised consent form dated 7 April 2008 was approved and used for the second period. The final study report was dated 9 October 2008. Test and reference products The test and reference product used in study M1ER07002 were identical to the study products used in study M1ER07001. Population studied 44 subjects were to be enrolled, but 43 subjects were actually dosed. The study population comprised of healthy surgically sterile male and/or postmenopausal or surgically sterile female volunteers under fasting conditions. One man and 42 women were enrolled. Seven of the enrolled women were younger than 40 years of age. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Analytical methods The  analytical  part  of  the  bioequivalence  study  was  conducted  at  the  BA  Research  Co.  -  Cetero Research,  Canada  from  5  May  2008  to  21  May  2008.  The  analysis  was  performed  using  the  same methods as used in study M1ER07001. Study  samples  were  analysed  in  a  total  of  20  analytical  sequences.  Within-study  accuracy  and precision was within the acceptance range, 97% to 101% and 1.2% to 5.2%, respectively, based on the  back-calculated  concentrations  of  quality  control  (QC)  samples  and  calibration  curve  samples. Calibration curve ranged from 20.0 ng/ml to 2000.0 ng/ml. The method validations are described within the M1ER07001 study section. Pharmacokinetic Variables Pharmacokinetic variables used in study M1ER07002 were identical to those used in the fasted study M1ER07001. Statistical methods Statistical  methods  used  in  study  M1ER07002  were  identical  to  those  used  in  the  fasted  study M1ER07001. Results 36 out of  43  subjects  enrolled  completed  the  study.    One  subject  experienced  an  adverse  event  in period 1 and was therefore withdrawn. One subject tested positive for cotinine and one subject with a positive pregnancy test were withdrawn before period 2. Four of the subjects voluntarily withdrew prior to period 2 (due to a family emergency). One  subject  did  not  complete  breakfast  before  drug  administration  in  period  1  (98%  consumed). Pharmacokinetic analysis including and excluding this subject were provided. None of the pre-dose samples contained detectable levels of ribavirin. For period 2, most of the study subjects had an interfering peak which was detected at the retention time of ribavirin, but all these samples were quantified less than the LLOQ and were reported as zero. None of the first post-dose samples was reported as a Cmax. The ratio of AUC0-t /AUC0-∞ ranged from 56% to 79% after test. Since ribavirin has long elimination half life, AUC0-t was chosen as a primary PK parameter according to the study protocol.

a  Arithmetic mean b  Median Table 7: Summary of the statistical analysis for Ribavirin Ln-transformed data Similar results were obtained in the secondary analysis which included data from the subject who did not complete the breakfast. For ribavirin, the Test/Reference ratios of geometric means were 1.015 (90% CI 0.9795 - 1.0513) for AUC0-72, and 1.041 (90% CI 0.9973 - 1.0860) for Cmax. The  point  estimates  and  their  90%  CI  for  AUC0-∞ were  also  within  the  acceptance  range  (98.89, 106.41) (analysis included the subject who did not complete breakfast). In  conclusion,  the  point  estimates  and  the  90% CIs for AUC0-72 and Cmax were contained within the conventional defined acceptance range of 0.80 to 1.25. Safety data There were 38 non-serious adverse events during the conduct of the study. There was one serious adverse event which was not considered related to the drug by the Investigator. One subject had a positive pregnancy test before period 2 with unknown outcome or follow up.  Conclusions Based on the presented bioequivalence studies Ribavirin Three Rivers 200 mg capsule is considered bioequivalent with Rebetol 200 mg capsule.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacodynamic data have been provided by the applicant. These data are not required for this particular application.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.3. Additional data

The  applicant  also  provided  results  of  two  further  Bioequivalence  studies  with  the  US  reference product. Description of these two studies is provided in Table 1.

<!-- image -->

2.4.4. Post marketing experience Although the same medicinal product has been approved in Turkey in December 2006 and in the USA in April 2004, no post-marketing data have been presented in the dossier by the applicant. 2.5. Pharmacovigilance 2.5.1. PSUR The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference product. 2.5.2. Description of the Pharmacovigilance system The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements. The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market. 2.5.3. Risk management plan The  applicant  has  submitted  a  justification  for  not  submitting  a  Risk  Management  Plan  as  this  is  a generic  application.  This  was  considered  acceptable  in  principle.  However,  any  additional  risk minimisation  measures  that  might  be  put  in  place  for  the  reference  product  will  also  have  to  be implemented for this generic product 2.6. Discussion on Clinical aspects Two  bioequivalence  studies  were  conducted  to  support  this  generic  application.  A  single-dose  twoperiod  crossover  study  under  fasting  and  under  fed  condition  with  the  test  and  the  EU  reference product were submitted. The bioequivalence study under fed conditions was considered as a pivotal study  for  this  application  since,  according  to  the  SmPC  of  the  reference  product  Rebetol,  ribavirin should be administered with food. In both studies, bioequivalence of the two products was demonstrated with the standard bioequivalence criteria 0.8-1.25. Medicinal product no longer authorised

600 mg dose (3 x 200 mg tablet) was selected for the bioequivalence study on the grounds that the 600 mg represents the dose used in clinical practice. As ribavirin has a linear pharmacokinetics and is highly soluble, the choice of 600 mg dose was acceptable.

Washout period  was  sufficient  for  the  analytical  method  used.  No  detectable  levels  of  ribavirin  was seen  in  pre-dose  samples  from  period  2,  although  interfering  peaks  less  than  LLOQ  were  seen  for almost all subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cmax  and  AUCt  were  selected  as  primary  pharmacokinetic  parameters.  Ribavirin  accumulates  in  red blood  cells  (60:1  compared  with  plasma),  and  extremely  long  elimination  is  attributable  to  the redistribution from the cellular compartment. Ribavirin is highly soluble and is absorbed quickly with Tmax around 1 to 2 h. On these grounds it could be concluded that the blood collections time (72 h) was sufficient  to  entirely  cover  the  absorption  phase. 90% CI for the AUCinf fell also within the standard 0.8-12.5 range.

Overall, a benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

Finally, the SmPC of this generic product is in line with the one of the reference product. As requested, the  applicant  has  removed  information  on  the  patented  indications.  However,  safety  information, details of adverse events and warning and information about these indications have been retained in the product information. 2.7. Recommendation Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment The application contains adequate quality data. From a non clinical perspective the applicant provided an  adequate  summary  of  the  current  scientific  knowledge  related  to  ribavirin  based  on  published literature. In addition, the impurity profiles of the test and reference products were compared, and the absence of an environmental risk assessment was adequately justified. Regarding clinical data, an appropriate summary of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of ribavirin for treatment of chronic hepatitis C was provided. The application was based on two single dose bioequivalence studies between Ribavirin Three Rivers and the EU reference product conducted under fed and fasting conditions. Standard statistical methods were used for the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters and bioequivalence. Analytical method used was validated and withinstudy accuracy and precision was demonstrated. In both studies, bioequivalence was shown. The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are required beyond those included in the product information. However, any additional risk minimisation measures that might be put in place for the reference product will also have to be implemented for this generic product. Recommendation 'Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio  of  Ribavirin  Three  Rivers  in  the  treatment  of  chronic  hepatitis  C  only  to  be  used  as  part  of  a combination  regimen  with  interferon  alfa-2b  (adults,  children  (3  years  of  age  and  older)  and adolescents) was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
