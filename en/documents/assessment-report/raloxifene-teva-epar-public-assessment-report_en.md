## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Raloxifene  Teva  60  mg  Film-coated  Tablets  is  a  generic  medicinal  product  containing  raloxifene hydrochloride as active substance. The reference medicinal product Evista 60 mg Film-coated Tablets has been authorised for at least 10 years in the Community (Eli Lilly Nederland B.V., registered since 05 August 1998). The active substance of the reference product is raloxifene hydrochloride.

Studies have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Raloxifene Teva, and its bioequivalence with the reference product Evista.

Raloxifene is indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. A significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral, but not hip fractures has been demonstrated. When determining  the  choice  of  raloxifene  or  other  therapies,  including  oestrogens,  for  an  individual postmenopausal woman, consideration should be given to menopausal symptoms, effects on uterine and breast tissues, and cardiovascular risks and benefits.

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterised by low bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue, with consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures. As a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM), raloxifene has selective agonist or antagonist activities on tissues responsive to oestrogen. It acts as an agonist on bone and partially on cholesterol metabolism (decrease in total and LDL-cholesterol), but not in the hypothalamus or in the uterine or breast tissues.

Raloxifene biological actions, like those of oestrogen, are mediated through high affinity binding to oestrogen receptors and regulation of gene expression. This binding results in differential expression of  multiple  oestrogen-regulated  genes  in  different  tissues.  Recent  data  suggests  that  the  oestrogen receptor  can  regulate  gene  expression  by  at  least  two  distinct  pathways  which  are  ligand-,  tissue-, and/or gene-specific.

The recommended dose is one tablet daily by oral administration, which may be taken at any time of the day without regard to meals. No dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly. Due to the nature of this disease process, raloxifene is intended for long term use.

Generally calcium and vitamin D supplements are advised in women with a low dietary intake.

Use in renal impairment: raloxifene should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with moderate and mild renal impairment, raloxifene should be used with caution.

Use in hepatic impairment: raloxifene should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment.

Raloxifene is associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolic events that is similar to the reported  risk  associated  with  current  use  of  hormone  replacement  therapy.  The  risk-benefit  balance should be considered in patients at risk of venous thromboembolic events of any aetiology. Raloxifene should  be  discontinued  in  the  event  of  an  illness  or  a  condition  leading  to  a  prolonged  period  of immobilisation. Discontinuation should happen as soon as possible in case of the illness, or from 3 days before the immobilisation occurs. Therapy should not be restarted until the initiating condition has resolved and the patient is fully mobile.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

The  product  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablets  for  oral  use  containing  60  mg  of  raloxifene hydrochloride as active substance

Other ingredients are defined in the SPC section 6.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The tablets are packed in transparent PVC/PVdC - Aluminium blisters.

## Active Substance

Raloxifene hydrochloride  is  the  common  name  for  the  chemical  substance  [6-Hydroxy-2-(4hydroxyphenyl)benzo[b]thien-3-yl]-[4-[2-(1piperidinyl)ethoxy]phenyl]methanone hydrochloride. The  molecular  formula  is C H NO S.HCl 28 27 4 ,  with  the  relative  molecular  mass  510.05  and  the following structural formula:

<!-- image -->

The active substance is well known and has been satisfactorily characterised. It forms a pale yellow powder practically  insoluble  in  water and  methanol,  freely  soluble  in N , N -dimethylformamide. Characterisation data provided confirms that there are five potential polymorphs for this drug substance. The applicant satisfactorily supported the non-conversion of the polymorphic form obtained after synthesis.

## Manufacture

Raloxifene hydrochloride is supplied by one manufacturer only. An Active Substance Master File was submitted  to  support  the  quality  of  active  substance.  A  detailed  description  of  the  manufacturing process, including process flow diagram and in-process controls were provided and there is evidence that the process is under control and delivers an active substance of consistent quality.

## Specification

The drug substance specification as tested by the finished product manufacturer includes relevant tests with justified  limits  with  regards  to  description,  identification,  heavy  metals,  sulphated  ash,  loss  on drying, assay, related substances, residual solvents, density and particle size distribution.

Adequate  validation  data  was  presented  for  the  in-house  analytical  methods.  Satisfactory  batch analysis results were provided for three batches.

## Stability

ICH  compliant  stability  studies  in  accelerated  (40  ±  2  °C/75  ±  5  %  RH)  and  long-term  storage conditions (25 ± 2 °C/60 ± 5 % RH) have been performed up to 6 months and 72 months, respectively. The following parameters were investigated: appearance, water content, related substances, and assay. The stability data support the proposed re-test period of 24 months with no special storage conditions.

## Finished Product

## Pharmaceutical Development

The aim was to obtain an immediate-release tablet containing qualitatively and quantitatively the same drug substance and exhibiting the same bioavailability as the reference product Evista 60 mg Filmcoated Tablets, marketed by Eli Lilly.

All excipients used in the proposed generic product are standard and a satisfactory justification for the choice of the excipients is provided.

The impurity profiles of the generic product and the reference product were presented and found to be similar.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Several  trial  batches  were  manufactured  using  different  manufacturing  processes  and  different formulations  in  order  to  select  adequate  excipients  and  manufacturing  conditions  to  develop  tablets that exhibit acceptable physical and chemical characteristics.

Satisfactory data are provided to justify the proposed manufacturing process of the finished product.

The product is packed in transparent PVC/PVdC - aluminium blisters inside a cardboard box.

## Adventitious Agents

The active substance, raloxifene hydrochloride, and all excipients are absent of BSE/TSE risk.

## Manufacture of the Product

A  detailed  description  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  in-process  controls  was  provided.  The manufacturing process is a standard process utilised in tablet manufacture

Process validation data were provided and the critical steps of the manufacturing process have been identified and validated.

## Product Specification

The  finished  product  specifications  include  the  following  parameters:  description,  appearance, identification,  dissolution,  uniformity  of  dosage  units,  assay,  related  substances,  loss  on  drying, residual solvents and microbiological quality. The specifications are adequate to control the medicinal product.

All  analytical  methods  used  to  test  the  drug  product  have  been  properly  described.  All  nonpharmacopoeial methods were validated.

Satisfactory batch data have been provided and the results comply with the specification and confirm consistency of the product.

## Stability of the Product

ICH  compliant  stability  studies  in  accelerated  (40  ±  2  °C/75  ±  5  %  RH)  and  long-term  storage conditions (25 ± 2 °C/60 ± 5 % RH) have been performed up to 6 months and 12 months, respectively. The  parameters  tested  were:  appearance,  loss  on  drying,  dissolution,  related  substances,  assay  and microbiological purity. The proposal to extrapolate this data to 24 months shelf life is acceptable.

## Comparability Exercise for Drug Product

Compatibility of the formulation with the proposed container closure system was demonstrated by the ongoing stability studies.

## 2.3 Non-Clinical aspects

Since  Raloxifene  Teva  is  essentially  similar  product  to  reference  product,  no  additional  safety  and toxicology studies were considered necessary.

## Discussion on Non-Clinical aspects

Raloxifene is a Selective Oestrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM). Raloxifene's biological actions, like those of oestrogen, are mediated through high affinity binding to oestrogen receptors and regulation of gene expression. The non-clinical overview considered in detail aspects of the effects of raloxifene which are not directly relevant to the proposed therapeutic indication.

## 2.4 Clinical Aspects

## Introduction

The initial CHMP assessment addressed pharmacokinetic data in respect of one bioequivalence study (study  XX)  and  one  study  investigating  intra-subject  variability  (study  YY).  However,  using  the standard 80.00 to 125.00 criteria bioequivalence was not demonstrated. The applicant provided a new study (study ZZ) to provide evidence of acceptable bioequivalence.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It is stated that all clinical work has been conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) as  referenced  in  the  ICH  guidelines  (ICH  E6),  local  regulatory  requirements,  and  the  principles enunciated in the Declaration of Helsinki.

## Clinical studies

This application is a generic application, therefore, demonstration of therapeutic equivalence is shown by  means  of  pharmacokinetic  bioavailability  studies.  New  clinical  studies  are  neither  required  nor submitted. Bioequivalence between the test product and the reference product has been investigated in two cross-over study after a single dose in fasting conditions of the 60 mg film coated tablet (Study XX and ZZ). The second study (Study YY) was to investigate intra-subjects variability.

## Pharmacokinetics

## Study XX

Methods

## Study design

Study  XX  was  an  open-label,  single-dose,  randomized,  two-period,  two-sequence,  two-treatment, crossover study, designed to evaluate the comparative bioavailability of two formulations of raloxifene administered  to  healthy,  male  and  post-menopausal  and/or  surgically  sterile  female  subjects  under fasting conditions.

The study products were administered as a single oral dose of 1 x 60 mg tablets of either the test or reference formulation with 240 ml of water, after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours prior to drug administration  and  for  at  least  4  hours  following  drug  administration.  The  study consisted  of  2 treatment phases of 120 hours. Patients were recruited in 2 groups of 40, for logistical ease. There was a 14 day washout period between the treatments.

In each period, 29 blood samples from 28 time points were obtained from an arm vein of each subject by direct veno puncture or from an indwelling cannula. During each study period, blood samples (1 x 6 ml each) were taken from each subject at pre-dose and after dose administration at 0.33, 0.67, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4.33, 4.67, 5, 5.33, 5.67, 6, 6.33, 6.67, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours.

This  study  was  performed  by  qualified  investigators  in  a  clinical  facility  located  in  Canada.  The clinical  laboratory  facility  was  also  located  in  Canada..  The  Analytical,  Pharmacokinetic,  Statistical and Report Issuing facility was also located in Canada.

The clinical study protocol No XX was approved by the Ethics Committee on 24/04/2008. The clinical phase was performed in two groups and two periods. Subjects of group 1 were tested on 08/05/2008 and  22/05/2008  (period  1  and  2  respectively).  Subjects  of  group  2  were  tested  on  11/05/2008  and 25/05/2008 (period 1 and 2 respectively). The analysis of the samples was conducted in the period from 28/05/2008 to 30/05/2008 for group 1 and in the period from 30/05/2008 to 02/06/2008 for group 2.

The study was complying with GCP, as claimed by the applicant.

## Test and reference products

Raloxifene 60 mg Tablets by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (manufacturing Date: Feb. 10, 2008) has been compared to Evista® 60 mg Film Coated Tablets by Eli Lilly and Company Limited, UK (exp. date 10 2008).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Population(s) studied

Eighty  subjects  were  recruited,  and  79  subjects  who  completed  the  study  were  included  in  the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. Subject 28 was excluded from the study at Period 2 check-in due  to  non-compliance.  There  were  61  male  between  age  of  18  -  55  years  and  18  were  postmenopausal and/or surgically sterile female subjects between age of 18 - 65 years. All subjects were judged to be healthy based on a medical history, ECG, laboratory evaluation and physical examination

## Analytical methods

Raloxifene  was  measured  in  plasma  using  a  validated  chromatographic  assay  method  (LC-MS/MS method),  with  a  lower  limit  of  quantification  of  0.0100  ng/ml.  The  sample  analysis  calibration standards range was from 0.0100 to 1.50 ng/ml. The validation of the analytical method is satisfactory.

## Pharmacokinetic Variables

The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  AUC t ,  AUCinf ,  C max ,  T max ,  K el and  T 1/2 were  estimated  based  on plasma raloxifene levels for each subject included in the statistical analysis.

## Statistical methods

Descriptive statistics were estimated for the pharmacokinetic parameters in each treatment. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to log-transformed AUC t , AUCinf , C max and to untransformed K el and T1/2 parameters. The significance of the sequence, period, treatment, and subject within- sequence effects were tested. The least square means, the differences between the treatments least square means, and the corresponding standard errors of these differences were estimated for log-transformed AUC t , AUCinf, Cmax parameters. Based on these statistics, the ratios of the geometric means for treatments and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals were calculated. Values for the T max parameter were analyzed by a non-parametric approach.

Based on the log-transformed parameters, the following criteria were used to evaluate the bioequivalence between the test and reference products:

· The 90% confidence intervals of the relative mean plasma raloxifene AUC t and AUCinf of the test to reference products should be between 80-125%.

·  The  90%  confidence  interval  of  the  relative  mean  plasma  raloxifene  C max of  the  test  to  reference products should be between 75-133%.

The Applicant claimed that the widening of the bioequivalence range for raloxifene is justified due to the following:

1) High variability of the drug:

In-house data indicates that the C max intra-subject coefficient of variation for Evista® is greater than 30%.

2) Evidence demonstrating that raloxifene's efficacy is not related to C max , and by the drug's proven safety at relatively high doses:

a. Efficacy: Administration of raloxifene with a standardized high fat meal increases C max by 28%. Despite this difference, the product monograph for raloxifene (Evista®) states that the drug can be given either with or without food, indicating that the efficacy of the drug is not related to its C max .

b. Safety: A large, multinational placebo-controlled trial assessed the safety of 60 mg and 120 mg daily  doses  of  raloxifene  in  over  five  thousand  post-menopausal  women  for  36  months.  The majority of adverse events that occurred during the study were mild, and generally did not require discontinuation of therapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety was assessed based on the severity and causality of adverse events experienced by subjects who underwent drug administration.

The 90% confidence interval of the relative mean raloxifene C max of  the  test  to  reference product is outside the 80-125% range.

## Study YY

## Methods

## Study design

Study YY was an open-label, two-period, single-treatment study, designed to estimate the intra-subject variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters AUC t ,  AUC inf and C max for  Evista® after single-dose administration to healthy female subjects under fasting conditions.

Subjects  were  given  a  single  dose  of  Evista®  (raloxifene  hydrochloride)  60  mg  Tablets  on  two separate occasions under fasting conditions. In each period, an optional pre-study snack was provided to each subject after check-in and prior to fasting. Subjects fasted overnight for at least 10 hours prior to  drug  administration  and  for  at  least  4  hours  following  drug  administration.  The  washout  interval between successive drug administrations was 14 days.

This  study  was  performed  by  qualified  investigators  in  a  clinical  facility  located  in    Canada.  The clinical  laboratory  facility  was  also  located  in  Canada.  The  Analytical,  Pharmacokinetic,  Statistical and Report Issuing facility was also located in Canada.

The  clinical  study  protocol  No  YY  was  approved  by  the  Ethics  Committee  on  14/02/2008.    The clinical phase was performed in two periods. Subjects in period 1 were tested on 23/02/2008 and in period 2 on 08/03/2008. The analysis of the samples was conducted on 14/03/2008 and 19/03/2008 for period 1 and 2 respectively.

The study was complying with GCP, as claimed by the applicant.

## Test and reference products

The Test product was Evista® 60 mg Tablets (Eli Lilly and Company Ltd., UK), e xpiration Date: 102008

## Population(s) studied

The  study  population  included  16  non-smoking,  post-menopausal  and/or  surgically  sterile  female volunteers between 18-65 years of age with a BMI between 19 and 30, who were judged to be healthy based  on  a  medical  history,  ECG,  laboratory  evaluation  and  physical  examination.  14  subjects completed  the  study  were  included  in  the  pharmacokinetic  and  statistical  analysis.  Subject  15  was excluded from the study after Period 1 dosing due to an adverse event (vomiting) and Subject 7 was excluded from the study prior to Period 2 check-in due to non-compliance. All the 16 subjects were included in the safety analysis.

## Analytical methods

Plasma  concentrations  of  raloxifene  were  measured  by  validated  analytical  methods  (LC-MS/MS method).  Concentrations  of  raloxifene  were  measured  from  the  samples  collected  over  a  120-hour interval after dosing in each period. Protocol deviations were minor one and related to washout period, or samples were collected with one minute difference from the pre-specified time.

## Pharmacokinetic Variables

Based on plasma raloxifene data the intra-subject variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters AUC t , AUCinf and Cmax was estimated.

## Statistical methods

Descriptive statistics were estimated for the pharmacokinetic parameters in each treatment. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to log-transformed AUC t , AUCinf and C max and to untransformed Kel and  T 1/2 parameters.  The  significance  of  the  period  and  subject  effects  were  tested.  The  least square means, the differences between the period least square means and the corresponding standard errors  were  estimated  for  log-transformed  AUC t ,  AUCinf  and  C max parameters.  Based  on  these statistics,  the  ratios  of  the  geometric  means  for  each  period  and  the  corresponding  90%  confidence intervals were calculated. Values for the T max parameter were analyzed by a non-parametric approach.

## Study ZZ

## Methods

## Study design

Study  ZZ  was  a  two-treatment,  four-period,  replicate-design  crossover  study  in  the  fasted  state, designed  to  demonstrate  the  bioequivalence  of  Raloxifene  60  mg  Tablets  (Teva  Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.) with the reference product, Evista® 60 mg Film Coated Tablets (Daiichi Sankyo UK Ltd., UK).

The study products were administered as a single oral dose of 1 x 60 mg tablets of either the test or reference  formulation  after  an  overnight  fast  of  at  least  10  hours  prior  to  drug  administration.  The study consisted  of  4  treatment  periods.  Patients  were  recruited  in  2  groups.  There  was  a  14  day washout period between the treatments.

In each period, 25 blood samples from 24 time points were obtained. Each sample was 6 ml. Blood samples were collected at: 0(x2), 1, 2, 3, 4, 4.33, 4.67, 5, 5.33, 5.67, 6, 6.5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours. The washout between the start of each period was 2 weeks.

This  study  was  performed  by  qualified  investigators  in  a  clinical  facility  located  in  Canada.  The clinical  laboratory  facility  was  also  located  in  Canada.  The  Analytical,  Pharmacokinetic,  Statistical and Report Issuing facility was also located in Canada.

The clinical study protocol No ZZ was approved by the Ethics Committee on 23/07/2009. Amended study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on 28/07/2009.

The clinical phase was performed in two groups and 4 periods. Subjects of group 1 were tested on 01/08/2009, 15/08/2009, 29/08/2009 and 12/09/20097 (periods 1,2,3 and 4 respectively). Subjects of group  2  were  dosed  on  23/08/2009,  6/09/2009,  20/09/2009  and  4/10/2009  (period  1,2,3  and  4 respectively). The analysis of the samples was conducted in the period from 18/09/2009 to 28/09/2009 for group 1 and in the period from 13/10/2009 to 15/10/2009 for group 2.

The study was complying with GCP, as claimed by the applicant.

## Population(s) studied

The study enrolled 60 individuals who were randomised to sequences of either TRTR or RTRT (where

T denotes test  and  R  denotes  reference)  and  any  subjects  who  completed  both  a  test  and  reference period were included in the analysis. Subject 04 was dismissed from the study prior to Period 4 dosing due  to  adverse  events  (out  of  range  mid-study  haematology  test  results).  Subject  51  voluntarily withdrew from the study prior to Period 4 check-in due to an adverse event (feeling tired) Subject 31 voluntarily withdrew from the study prior to Period 4 check-in for personal reasons. These subjects were included in the analysis. Subject 15 was dismissed from the study after Period 2 dosing due  to  adverse  events  (vomiting  and  loose  stool).  Measurements  were  taken  up  to  48  hours.  The subject  has  been  randomised  to  the  TRTR  sequence  The  study  population  included  non-smoking and/or light-smoking, post-menopausal and/or surgically sterile female volunteers from 18 to 65 years of age, with a BMI from 19 to 30, who were judged to be healthy based on a medical history, ECG, laboratory evaluation, and physical examination.

## Analytical methods

Raloxifene  concentrations  were  measured  from  plasma  by  a  validated  analytical  method.  Subject plasma  concentrations  of  Raloxifene  were  measured  according  to  a  liquid  chromatographic  (LC) tandem mass spectrometric detection (MS/MS) method Plasma samples were assayed for raloxifene according to the principles of Good Laboratory Practice.

The validation of the analytical method is satisfactory.

Deviations  in  blood  sampling  times  of  more  than  1  minute  were  reported.  Deviations  from  the scheduled  sampling  time  were  accounted  for  in  the  pharmacokinetic  calculations  since  the  actual sampling times were used.

## Pharmacokinetic Variables

AUCt, AUCinf, Cmax, Tmax, Kel, and Thalf were estimated based on raloxifene plasma levels for each subject included in the data set.

## Statistical methods

Descriptive statistics were estimated for the pharmacokinetic parameters in each treatment. A mixed model was applied to log-transformed AUC t ,  AUC inf ,  C max and  ANOVA to untransformed K el and T1/2 parameters.  The  significance  of  the  group,  sequence-within-group,  period  within-  group, treatment, and treatment-within-group interaction were tested.

The standard bioequivalence approach was followed in this study. The treatment least-squares means, the differences between the treatment least-squares means, and the corresponding standard errors of these  differences  were  estimated  for  log-transformed  AUC t ,  AUCinf,  and  C max parameters  were calculated.  Based  on  these  statistics,  the  ratios  of  the  geometric  means  for  treatments  and  the corresponding 90% confidence intervals were calculated. Values for the T max parameter were analyzed by a non-parametric approach.

The Applicant stated that: 'Since the within-subject variability for C max of the reference product was ≥ 30%, the following criteria were used to evaluate the bioequivalence between the test and reference products' :

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- The 90% confidence intervals of the relative mean AUC t of the test to reference products should be between 80% and 125%.
- The 90% confidence intervals of the relative mean C max of the test to reference products should be between 75% and 133%.

Safety was assessed based on the severity and causality of adverse events experienced by subjects who underwent drug administration.

There  were  no  deaths  or  other  serious  AEs  reported  during  the  study.  Subjects  04,  15  &amp;  51  were withdrawn due to adverse events.

##  Conclusions

The 90% confidence interval of the relative mean raloxifene C max of  the  test  to  reference product is within the 75-133% range.

Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study  Raloxifene  Teva  is  considered  bioequivalent  with Evista® 60 mg Film Coated Tablets.

## Post marketing experience

No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

##  PSUR

The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference product.

##  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.  The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market.

##  Risk Management Plan

The  application  is  based  on  a  reference  medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring specific risk minimization activities have been identified.

## Discussion on Clinical aspects

The overall  design  of  the  two  initially  submitted  studies  for  this  application  is  appropriate  and  the results have demonstrated bioequivalence for AUCs. However, in study XX the applicant selected a wider range for C max (75 - 133%). The justification presented was based on the demonstration of high intra-subject  variability  of  the  drug  in  Study  YY  as  claimed  by  applicant.  However,  the  estimated intra-subject coefficient of variation of plasma raloxifene for AUC t was 12.03%, for AUCinf 12.86% and for C max 30.37%. No confidence interval was given and it cannot be concluded that the drug is highly variable. Furthermore the two studies conducted were carried out on two different populations and  the  assumption  of  high  variability  can  not  be  extrapolated  to  the  pivotal  bioequivalence  study. Therefore  using  the  80-125%  CI  for  C max showed  that  that  the  product  failed  to  demonstrate bioequivalence  with  the  reference  product  Evista®.  The  applicant  conducted  a  new  bioequivalence study (study ZZ) in order to address major concern. The applicant provided an acceptable trial design to demonstrate high variability and thus justify the widening of the acceptance limits to 75 - 133% for Cmax.  The  results  of  a  new  study  excluded  one  subject  from  the  estimation  of  C max ,  despite  this subject provided data on C max for the first 2 periods. The applicant was requested to repeat the analysis for C max including subject 15. The inclusion of the data for Subject 15 changed the ratio for C max from 84.49% (CI 78.23 - 91.26%) to 83.75% (CI 77.49 - 90.51%) which was still within the pre-specified CI of 75% - 133%. Therefore this has not altered final conclusion of bioequivalence.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

The  application  contains  adequate  quality,  non  clinical  and  clinical  data  has  been  shown.  A benefit/Risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  available  data,  the  CHMP  considered  majority  decision  that  the benefit/risk ratio of Raloxifene Teva in the treatment of treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal  women  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  marketing authorisation.
