## I. RECOMMENDATION

This type II variation relates to the following changes: Update of section 4.2 'Posology and Method of Administration',  4.3  'Contraindications',  4.4  'Special  warnings  and  precautions  for  use'  and  5.2 'Pharmacokinetic properties' of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and section 2 'Before you  take  Telzir'  and  section  3  'How  to  take  Telzir'  of  the  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  with  data  from clinical  study  APV10017  to  implement  dosing  recommendation  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic impairment.

Based on the review of the data on safety and efficacy, this type II variation application:

is  approvable .  Since  all  issues have  been  resolved .  The  amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the product information are acceptable.

## II. ASSESSMENT

## II.1. Introduction

A  Marketing  Authorisation  was  granted  by  the  European  Commission  on  12  July  2004  for  Telzir (fosamprenavir  -  FPV).  FPV  in  combination  with  low  dose  ritonavir  (RTV)    is  indicated  for  the treatment  of  Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus  Type  1  (HIV-1)  infected  adults,  adolescents  and children of 6 years and above in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) medicinal products. For ARV naïve and experienced adult patients the recommended dose is 700 mg FPV twice daily with 100 mg RTV twice daily, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. FPV is rapidly and almost  completely  hydrolysed  to  amprenavir  (APV)  and  inorganic  phosphate  prior  to  reaching  the systemic circulation. The conversion of FPV to APV appears to primarily occur in the gut epithelium.

APV is primarily metabolised by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme. RTV, also an HIV PI, is  a  CYP3A4 substrate  and  is  a  potent  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4.  RTV  acts  as  a  pharmacokinetic  (PK) enhancer, resulting in an increased plasma APV concentration by inhibiting APV metabolism. APV is also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, and both APV and RTV may induce CYP3A4. Therefore medicinal products that are inducers, inhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4 must be used with caution when administered concurrently with FPV and RTV.

As no specific study was performed in patients with hepatic impairment with Telzir, the MAH was required  to  provide  adequate  data  to  support  the  use  of  Telzir  in  patients  with  various  degrees (including  severe)  of  hepatic  impairment  as  a  follow-up  measure  (FUM  014)  to  be  fulfilled  postauthorisation.

Part of this FUM was submitted in December 2006 in the format of a type II variation (II/20 approved on 2 July 2007) in order to update the SPC, subsequent to a phase I, parallel, open-label, two week, repeat-dose study (APV 10017) designed to evaluate the plasma APV and RTV pharmacokinetics in HIV-1  infected  adult  patients  with  mild,  moderate,  and  severe  hepatic  impairment  compared  to matched control patients with normal hepatic function. At this time, results were only provided for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment but were not available for patients with severe hepatic impairment, as the recruitment was still ongoing for this group.

As a result of this type II variation, the following dosing recommendations were adopted for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment:

'For adults with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 5-6) the recommended dose is 700 mg fosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily.

For  adults  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score:  7-9)  the  recommended  dose  is 450 mg fosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily.'

Since,  at  the  time,  no  data  were  available  for  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment,  FPV  in combination with RTV remained contra-indicated in these patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Noteworthy,  the  number  of  HIV  infected  patients  with  underlying  hepatic  impairment  receiving FPV/RTV, since the approval for use in mild/moderate hepatic impairment in the EU on 2 July 07, is unknown. However, ongoing observational cohorts study (WEUKSTV2430) being conducted in the EU will assess the post-marketing safety experience in this patient population, in line with a CHMP request.

Within this current submission, the MAH provides the remaining results of the previously submitted study  APV  10017.  These  results  only  concern  the  population  of  patients  with  severe  hepatic impairment with their matching control with normal hepatic function.

## II.2 Clinical Aspects

The design of study APV 10017 was previously assessed in the setting of the type II variation II/20 approved in July 2007.

| Patients      | Adult male and female HIV-1 infected patients from the US and EU, 18 to 65 years of age, with a body mass index (BMI) within the range of 19-35 kg/m 2 Patients were either hepatically impaired or had normal hepatic function. The patients classified as hepatically impaired had liver fibrosis with known medical history of alcohol abuse. The degree of impairment was defined with Child-Pugh scores. Hepatically impaired patients could not have signs of hepatic function deterioration. Patients must have had clinically stable HIV-1 disease for 3 months prior to study entry on current antiretroviral therapy (ART). Concurrent ART consisting of NRTIs or N(t)RTIs was allowed during the study; concurrent use of NNRTIs and protease inhibitors (PIs) was not allowed. |

The lower limit of quantification was 10 ng/ml for APV and RTV and 5 ng/ml for FPV. - Plasma unbound APV concentrations were measured at 2 hours (all patients), 12 hours (groups A, B, D) and 24 hours (group D) after dosing on Day 14. APV unbound concentration were measured in plasma ultrafiltrate with a validated LC/MS/MS method. The lower limit of quantification was 0.5 ng/ml. - Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs), physical examination, clinical laboratory evaluations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and vital signs. - In addition, Child-Pugh scores, plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA), CD4+ cell counts, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classification, and HIV- associated conditions were collected during the study. |
| Statistical methods     | - The following plasma APV and RTV parameters were reported: AUCo- τ (over the dosing interval), Cavg the average plasma concentration over the dosing interval at steady-state (calculated as AUCo- τ / τ ), CL/F the apparent oral clearance, the C τ (average pre-dose concentrations collected at steady state), C2h unbound and C τ                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Discussion on the Study design

In the previous assessment regarding study APV 10017 (Telzir II/20), the CHMP made the following comments:

This study is so far the unique study in hepatic impairment performed in the target population of HIV infected patients. This is one particular interest of this study to be underlined, even if it has implied to switch virologically stable patients to FPV/RTV at various tested adjusted doses that could have been suboptimal for these patients.

In addition,

- -this study has enrolled patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment including the difficultto-treat population of patients with severe hepatic impairment;
- -this study was a multiple dose study therefore expected to give more confidence in the results for a medicinal product to be used chronically;
- -the number of patients enrolled per arm is satisfactory;
- -strictly  in  line  with  the  European  guideline,  the  unbound  concentrations  of  medicinal  product were measured. This is of relevant importance since unbound concentrations is very likely to be modified  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  (as  a  result  of  hypoproteinemia)  for  such  a medicinal product highly protein bound;
- -several dose adjustments were tested including two in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. In this field, it has to be underlined that a mix with fosamprenavir BID and ritonavir QD is not optimal  since  it  might  induce  some  confusion  for  patients.  In  addition  the  resort  to  the  oral solution is also not optimal for patients Nevertheless it has to be admitted that given the unique 700 mg dosage the MAH does not have much latitude to adjust the dose.

Overall, this study initiated at the time the European guideline was released for consultation is strictly in line with the spirit of the guideline.

The results of study APV 10017 relative to patients with severe hepatic impairment and their matching control with normal hepatic function are reported below.

Severe hepatic impairment = hepatic fibrosis + Child-Pugh score of 10-15

Group E: FPV 300mg BID + RTV 100mg once daily x 14 days

Group F: FPV 700mg BID + RTV 100mg BID x 14 days

1. Subject 53 completed a single day of dosing whereas Subject 283 completed 13/14 days of dosing.
2. Subject 291 Completed the 14 day dosing period, missing a single dose of FPV on the evening of Day 12.

3. Subject 154 was randomized, but not dosed.

A total of 17 patients were enrolled in the study in Groups E and F and received study medications. Three  patients  in  the  severe  hepatic  impairment  cohort  withdrew  from  the  study,  two  for  adverse events and one due to a protocol violation.

Severe hepatic impairment = hepatic fibrosis + Child-Pugh score of 10-15

Group E: FPV 300mg BID + RTV 100mg once daily x 14 days

Group F: FPV 700mg BID + RTV 100mg BID x 14 days

Patients in the severe hepatic impairment had lower CD4+ cell counts and were more likely to be coinfected with Hepatitis C when compared with patients having normal hepatic function. Risk factors also  differed  between  groups,  with  injectable  medicinal  product  use  being  the  most  common  risk factor  (7/10,  70%)  for  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  compared  with  homosexual  contact being the most common risk factor (5/7, 71%) for patients with normal hepatic function.

## Child-Pugh scores

At Pre-baseline (Day -4), patients in the severe hepatic impairment group had total Child-Pugh scores ranging from 10 to 13. Most hepatically impaired patients had Grade 1 encephalopathy (8/10, 80%). Most patients had mild (Grade 2; 4/10, 40%) or moderate (Grade 3, 5/10, 50%) ascites.

1. N=7 for t1/2

2. N=6 for t1/2

When plasma APV PK was normalised to a 700mg FPV dose, severe hepatic impairment significantly increased plasma total APV Dose Normalised (DN)-AUC(0τ ) by 80%, DN-Cmax by 88%, and DN-C τ by  45%  following  administration  of  FPV/RTV.  The  dosage  regimen  tested  in  severe  hepatic impairment, FPV 300mg BID + RTV 100mg once daily, delivered 23% lower plasma APV AUC(0τ ) , 19%  lower  Cmax,  and  38%  lower  C τ values  compared  to  patients  with  normal  hepatic  function receiving FPV/RTV 700/100mg BID. Plasma Median tmax was delayed 1.5 hours in the severe hepatic impairment group and APV t1/2 values were similar between patients with severe hepatic impairment and patients with normal hepatic function. Variability in plasma APV PK values was higher for the severe hepatic impairment group.

1. N=7 for 2-hour assessments

2. N=5 for C τ assessments

Patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  had  a  higher  %unbound  APV  12  hours  after  dosing  and similar  plasma  unbound  concentration  at  12  hours  after  dosing  (unbound  C τ )  compared  to  patients with normal hepatic function. However, at the 2-hour time point, there was no clear difference in the %unbound  APV  between  the  groups,  and  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  receiving  FPV 300mg BID + RTV 100mg once daily had lower plasma unbound APV concentration 2 hours after dosing (C2h) than patients with normal hepatic function receiving FPV/RTV 700/100mg BID.

On average, plasma unbound APV C τ values (the parameter considered to be associated with virologic efficacy)  were  comparable  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  and  in  patients  with  normal hepatic function.

## Discussion on the PK results

The APV PK parameters were lower (about -20 to -30%) in patients with severe hepatic impairment receiving FPV 300 mg BID + RTV 100 mg QD compared to patients with normal hepatic function receiving FPV/RTV 700/100 mg BID. The PK variability was also increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Of importance, the mean C τ concentration of unbound APV is similar in patients with severe hepatic impairment compared with patients with normal hepatic function, whereas the mean C2h concentration  of  unbound  APV  is  decreased  by  more  than  20%  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic impairment compared with patients with normal hepatic function.

For  both  parameters  it  should  be  noted  that  the  PK  variability  is  increased  in  patients  with  severe hepatic impairment compared with patients with normal hepatic function and therefore the bounds for confidence interval are very large.

Severe hepatic impairment = hepatic fibrosis + Child-Pugh score of 10-15

Group E: FPV 300mg BID + RTV 100mg once daily x 14 days

Group F: FPV 700mg BID + RTV 100mg BID x 14 days

1. RTV AUC(0τ ) is over 24 hour dosing interval for severe HI group and over 12 hour dosing interval for normal hepatic function group.  Comparison of AUC(0τ ) between the groups shows the impact of severe HI on plasma RTV exposure.
2. Cavg normalizes AUC for the dosing interval; i.e., Cavg = AUC(0τ )/24 for severe HI group and Cavg = AUC(0τ )/12 for normal hepatic function group.  Comparison of Cavg between the groups allows a comparison of observed RTV exposures over the same interval of time.

Despite  reducing  the  RTV  dose  to  100mg  once  daily,  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  had 64% higher plasma RTV Cmax, 40% higher Cavg, and 38% higher C τ values compared to patients with normal hepatic function receiving FPV/RTV 700/100mg BID.

The  variability  in  RTV  PK  parameters  was  increased  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment compared with patients with normal hepatic function.

## Discussion on the Ritonavir concentrations

The exposure of RTV is highly increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment (AUC multiplied by almost a 3 fold factor) compared to patients with normal hepatic function. This increase in RTV exposure could lead to a deterioration of its safety profile.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. Safety results

A total  of  9  of  17  patients  (53%)  experienced  one or  more  treatment-emergent  adverse  event (AE) irrespective of cause during the study.  Gastrointestinal disorders was the system organ class with the most AEs reported (Group E: 4/10 (40%); Group F: 0).

A total of 3 of 17 patients (18%) reported one or more treatment-emergent drug-related AE during the study.  All  drug-related  AEs  were  reported  by  patients  in  the  severe  hepatic  impairment  group. Dyspepsia was the only drug-related AE reported by more than one subject.

Two  patients,  both  in  the  severe  hepatic  impairment  group  were  withdrawn  from  the  study  and discontinued  from  investigational  product  due  to  AEs.  Subject  53  (Group  E)  discontinued  from investigational product following the first day of dosing due to Grade 1 vomiting that the investigator considered to be related to study medicinal product. Subject 283 (Group E) was withdrawn from the study due to Grade 4, serious, hepatic encephalopathy that the investigator considered not to be related to study medications.

There was no meaningful change in clinical laboratory evaluations.

The MAH acknowledged that APV10017 was a short term PK study, and that the long-term safety of the combination in patients with severe hepatic impairment is unknown. MAH proposed to study the safety of FPV/RTV-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in this population in the ongoing cohort  study  WEUKSTV2430,  an  observational  study  involving  EU  cohorts  (ICONA,  HEPAVIH, MASTER)  which  is  currently  assessing  the  long-term  safety  of  the  approved  FPV/RTV  dosing regimen in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The MAH proposed to address the safety of this regimen over the longer term in patients with severe hepatic impairment in its ongoing observational cohort Study WEUKSTV2430 (FUM 45 and FUM 45.1; letter of undertaking dated 30 April 2007).

## Discussion on the safety results

No  safety  concern  emerged  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  in  this  study.  However,  as underlined by the MAH, the number of patients is very limited. Therefore, the MAH's proposal to investigate the safety of FPV/RTV treatment regimen in patients with severe hepatic impairment in the ongoing cohort study is fully endorsed.

## 4. Pharmacodynamic results

All of the patients who entered the study with plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/ml remained suppressed through  Day  14.  Additionally,  all  of  the  patients  entering  the  study  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  &gt;50 copies/ml had a decrease in their plasma HIV-1 RNA levels between Baseline and Day 14, with one subject  in  each  treatment  group  achieving  undetectable  (&lt;50  copies/mL)  levels  on  Day  14.  No substantial changes in CD4+ cell counts occurred in either treatment group from Baseline to Day 14.

## III. CHANGES TO THE PRODUCT INFORMATION

Of note, the same changes are proposed for Telzir film-coated tablets and for Telzir 50 mg/ml oral solution. They are reported below.

CHMP's comments and proposed changes (addition, deletion) are reported below.

## Summary of Product Characteristics

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

...

## Hepatic impairment

For adults with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 5-6) the recommended dose is 700 mg fosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily.

For  adults  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score:  7-9)  the  recommended  dose  is 450 mg fosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily. As it is not possible to achieve this fosamprenavir dose using the tablet formulation, these patients should be treated with fosamprenavir oral suspension.

For adults with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 10-15): fosamprenavir should be used with caution and at a reduced dose of 300 mg fosamprenavir twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir once daily.  As  it  is  not  possible  to  achieve  this  fosamprenavir  dose  using  the  tablet  formulation,  these patients should be treated with fosamprenavir oral suspension.

## CHMP's comment:

The MAH's proposal to specify that Telzir should be used with caution in adults with severe hepatic impairment is supported, given the characteristics of this difficult-to-treat population more at risk of adverse events and in view of the PK results (high inter-variability, increase in RTV exposure).

To avoid administration error of ritonavir, it is worth emphasising on the once daily regimen as in the package  leaflet:' only' once  daily  for  all  the  wording  of  the  recommendation  in  case  of  hepatic impairment (i.e. mild, moderate, severe)

Even with these dose adjustments for adults with mild or,  moderate or severe hepatic impairment, some patients may have higher than anticipated amprenavir and ritonavir plasma concentrations due to inter-patient variability (see section 5.2), therefore safety monitoring is warranted.

## CHMP's comment:

Due to the high variability lower or higher exposure can be observed therefore the recommendation should be completed as follows:

'Even with these dose adjustments for adults with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment, some patients  with  hepatic  impairment  may  have  higher  or  lower  than  anticipated  amprenavir  and/or ritonavir plasma concentrations as compared to patients with normal hepatic function due to increased inter-patient variability (see section 5.2), therefore safety a close monitoring of safety and virologic response is warranted.

Telzir in combination with ritonavir is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2).

## CHMP's comment:

For  completeness,  the  MAH  should  propose  a  statement  about  the  lack  of  data  for  children  with hepatic impairment, along with a recommendation for the prescriber.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.3 Contraindications

...

Patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

...

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

…

## Liver disease

Telzir  with  ritonavir  should  be  used  with  caution  and  at  reduced  doses  in  adults  with  mild  or, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2) and is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). .

Patients  with chronic  hepatitis  B  or  C  and  treated  with  combination  antiretroviral therapy  are  at  an increased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products.

Patients  with  pre-existing  liver  dysfunction,  including  chronic  active  hepatitis,  have  an  increased frequency  of  liver  function  abnormalities  during  combination  antiretroviral  therapy  and  should  be monitored  according  to  standard  practice.  If  there  is  evidence  of  worsening  liver  disease  in  such patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Hepatic impairment

…

The  plasma  amprenavir  pharmacokinetics  were  evaluated  in  a  14  day  repeat-dose  study  in  HIV-1 infected adult subjects with mild or,  moderate or severe hepatic impairment receiving fosamprenavir with ritonavir compared to matched control subjects with normal hepatic function.

In  subjects  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score  of  7-9),  a  reduced  dose  of fosamprenavir 450 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily is predicted to deliver similar plasma amprenavir Cmax and AUC(0-12), but approximately 35 % lower plasma total amprenavir C12 values and approximately 88 % higher plasma unbound amprenavir C12 values than achieved in subjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen.

In  subjects  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score  of  10-13),  a  reduced  dose  of fosamprenavir 300 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily delivered 19% lower plasma amprenavir Cmax, 23% lower AUC(0-12), and 38% lower C12 values, but  similar  unbound  plasma  amprenavir  C12  values  than  achieved  in  subjects  with  normal  hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen. Despite reducing the dosing frequency of ritonavir, subjects with severe hepatic impairment had 64% higher  ritonavir  C max ,  40%  higher  ritonavir  Cavg,  and  38%  higher  ritonavir  C12  than  achieved  in subjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen.

CHMP's comment:

It  is  considered  more  appropriate  to  mention  in  the  SPC  the  value  of  AUC  instead  of  Cavg  for ritonavir. Since AUC was increased by about 3 fold, it is worth giving this information to prescribers. Therefore, the following modification is proposed:

'In  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score  of  10-13),  a  reduced  dose  of fosamprenavir 300 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

delivered 19% lower plasma amprenavir Cmax, 23% lower AUC(0-12), and 38% lower C12 values, but similar unbound plasma amprenavir C12 values than achieved in patients with normal hepatic function receiving  the standard  fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen. Despite reducing the dosing frequency of ritonavir, patients with severe hepatic impairment had 64% higher ritonavir Cmax, 40% higher ritonavir Cavg 2.8 fold higher AUC, and 38% higher ritonavir C12 than achieved in patients with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen.'

Fosamprenavir with ritonavir was generally well-tolerated in subjects with mild to, moderate or severe hepatic impairment, and these regimens had similar adverse event and clinical laboratory profiles as previous studies of HIV-1 infected subjects with normal hepatic function.

Fosamprenavir with ritonavir is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).

## IV. REQUEST FOR SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the review of the data on clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety within this procedure, this type II variation could be approvable provided that the CHMP's proposed changes for the SPC are taken into account.

## Changes to the Product Information

The  MAH  should  submit  a  revised  Product  Information  considering  the  above  comments  and  the changes requested in the SPC as detailed in part III of this Assessment Report.

## The CHMP proposed to extend the timetable as follows:

## 30 days (including 15 days for Rapporteur assessment)

## V. ASSESSMENT OF THE RESPONSES TO THE REQUEST FOR SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Overall  the  MAH  agreed  on  all  the  changes  to  the  SPC  and  PL  requested  by  CHMP  or  provided alternative  wording  with  supporting  rational  that  was  considered  satisfactory.  Wording  details  are given below. No further changes are deemed necessary in the framework of this procedure.

## Question 1:

## SPC - Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration

- -The  MAH's proposal to specify  that  Telzir  should  be  used  with  caution in  adults  with  severe hepatic impairment is supported, given the characteristics of this difficult-to treat population more at  risk  of  adverse events and in view of the PK results (high inter-variability, increase in RTV exposure).

To avoid administration error of ritonavir, it is worth emphasizing on the once daily regimen as in the package leaflet: 'only' once daily for all the wording of the recommendation in case of hepatic impairment (i.e. mild, moderate, severe).

The MAH considered that the wording 'only once daily' is appropriate for the package leaflet, but that the SPC already clearly informs the prescribers that the dosage regimen for ritonavir is once daily. However, to provide further emphasis, the MAH proposed that the word 'once' should be changed to bold type in the SPC. This proposal is endorsed by the CHMP.

- -Due to the high variability lower or higher exposure can be observed therefore the recommendation should be completed as follows:

' Even with these dose adjustments for adults with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment, some  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  may  have  higher  or  lower  than  anticipated  amprenavir and/or ritonavir plasma concentrations as compared to patients with normal hepatic function due to increased inter-patient variability (see section 5.2), therefore safety a close monitoring of safety and virologic response is warranted .'

The MAH agreed with this proposed wording in section 4.2 of the SPC. The CHMP has no further comment.

- -For completeness, the MAH should propose a statement about the lack of data for children with hepatic impairment, along with a recommendation for the prescribers.

The following wording proposed by the MAH is endorsed by the CHMP: 'No dose recommendation can be made for children and adolescents with hepatic impairment as no studies have been conducted in these age groups'.

## Question 2:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## SPC - Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

…

## Hepatic impairment

It is considered more appropriate to mention in the SPC the value of AUC instead of this of Cavg for ritonavir.  Indeed,  since  AUC  was  increased  by  about  3  fold,  it  is  worth  giving  this  information  to prescribers.

## Expression of RTV exposure in section 5.2

RTV was administered BID to patients with normal hepatic function and QD to patients with severe hepatic impairment. The 2.8-fold increase in plasma RTV AUC(0τ ), therefore, reflects exposures over different time intervals, specifically AUC(0-12) for the BID regimen and AUC(0-24) for the QD regimen. To represent exposure over the same interval of time either Cavg (calculated as AUC(0τ ) / τ for both the BID and QD regimens) or AUC(0-24) (where AUC(0τ ) for  the  BID regimen ( τ =12) is multiplied by 2 and the AUC(0τ ) for the QD regimen ( τ =24) is unchanged) can be used. In Section 5.2 of the SPC, the MAH emphasised the comparison of the observed plasma RTV AUC adjusted for the dosing interval difference because this is representative of the exposure that patients will have to RTV over a given period of time. This was the basis for the original proposal to include the comparison of RTV Cavg within Section 5.2 of the SPC.

The  MAH  accepted,  however,  to  present  AUC  values  in  the  SPC  but  proposed  to  represent  RTV exposure as AUC(0-24) rather than AUC(0τ ) for both regimens. In essence, patients with severe hepatic impairment receiving FPV 300mg BID + RTV 100mg QD will have 40% higher AUC's over a 24hour period of time (AUC(0-24)) than will patients with normal hepatic impairment receiving FPV/RTV 700/100mg BID.

This  approach  together  with  the  following  wording  proposed  by  the  MAH  was  endorsed  by  the CHMP:

'In  subjects  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child-Pugh  score  of  10-13),  a  reduced  dose  of fosamprenavir 300 mg twice daily with a reduced dosing frequency of ritonavir 100 mg once daily delivered 19% lower plasma amprenavir Cmax, 23% lower AUC(0-12), and 38% lower C12 values, but similar  unbound  plasma  amprenavir  C12  values  than  achieved  in  subjects  with  normal  hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen. Despite reducing the dosing frequency of ritonavir, subjects with severe hepatic impairment had 64% higher  ritonavir  Cmax,  40%  higher  ritonavir  Cavg  AUC(0-24),  and  38%  higher  ritonavir  C12  than achieved in subjects with normal hepatic function receiving the standard fosamprenavir with ritonavir 700 mg / 100 mg twice daily regimen'.

## Question 3:

## PL - Section 3 How to take Telzir

The  CHMP proposed  to  adopt  different  statements  for  the  Telzir  tablet  PL  and  for  the  Telzir  oral solution PL as follows.

## Tablet

## Adults with liver disease

If  you  have  mild  liver  disease,  the  dose  is one  Telzir  tablet  (700  mg)  twice  daily with  100  mg ritonavir only  once  daily. If  you  have  moderate  or  severe  liver  disease  the  recommended  dose  of Telzir  has  to  be  lowered  (use  Telzir  oral  suspension).  is 450  mg  twice  daily (use  Telzir  oral suspension) with 100 mg ritonavir only once daily .

## Oral suspension

## Adults with liver disease

If you have mild liver disease, the dose is 14 ml Telzir oral suspension (700 mg fosamprenavir) twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir only once daily.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you have moderate liver disease the dose is 9 ml Telzir oral suspension (450 mg fosamprenavir) twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir only once daily.

If  you  have  severe  liver  disease  the  dose  is 6  ml  Telzir  oral  suspension (300  mg  fosamprenavir) twice daily with 100 mg ritonavir only once daily.

The MAH accepted that the wording should be modified, but proposed for the tablets a more patientfriendly alternative wording, as follows, that is endorsed by the CHMP.

'If  you  have  moderate  or  severe  liver  disease,  the  dose  of  Telzir  has  to  be  lowered.  This  dose adjustment can not be made with Telzir tablets. You must take Telzir oral suspension.'

With  regards  to  the  proposal  to  amend  the  oral  suspension  PL,  the  MAH  accepted  the  wording proposed by the CHMP. The CHMP has no further comment.

## VI. OVERALL DISCUSSION AND BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT

In  the  context  of  a  public  health  need  for  ARV  products  to  treat  patients  with  severe  hepatic impairment, the CHMP would like to emphasise the importance of study APV10017, especially that this study was well designed, in line with the European guideline.

Based  on  the  pharmacokinetic  results  obtained  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  it  is acceptable  to  recommend  the  dose  studied  in  APV10017  for  these  patients  i.e.  FPV  300  mg  twice daily with RTV 100 mg once daily.

At  last,  it  is  appreciated  that  the  MAH  proposes  to  study  the  safety  of  FPV/RTV  in  patients  with severe  hepatic  impairment  in  the  ongoing  cohort  study  which  is  currently  assessing  the  long-term safety  of  the  approved  FPV/RTV  dosing  regimen  in  patients  with  mild  and  moderate  hepatic impairment.

The MAH's initial proposed change to the product information was appropriate. Indeed, the need for a close  monitoring  of  patients,  linked  to  the  high  inter-patient  variability,  was  clearly  mentioned. However the CHMP requested additional changes to the SPC and PL in order to further simplify the product information and to further clarify the recommendations to the treating physicians. The MAH addressed  satisfactorily  all  requests  made  by  the  CHMP  and  provided  the  corresponding  updated product information.

## VII. EPAR CHANGES

The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope:

Update  of  section  4.2  'Posology  and  Method  of  Administration',  4.3  'Contraindications',  4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use' and 5.2 'Pharmacokinetic properties' of the Summary of Product  Characteristics  (SPC)  and  section  2  'Before  you  take  Telzir'  and  section  3  'How  to  take Telzir'  of  the  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  with  data  from  clinical  study  APV10017  to  implement  dosing recommendation in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
