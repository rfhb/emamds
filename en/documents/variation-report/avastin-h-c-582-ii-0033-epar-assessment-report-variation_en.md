| Marketing authorisation holder:                 | Roche Registration Ltd.                                                                                                              |

## 1. Scope of the variation and changes to the dossier

| Scope of the variation:            | To extend the indication to the use of Avastin in combination with capecitabine for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer in whom treatment with other chemotherapy options including taxanes or anthracyclines is not considered appropriate. Patients who have received taxane and anthracycline-containing regimens in the adjuvant setting within the last 12 months should be excluded from treatment with Avastin in combination with capecitabine. For further information about HER2 status, refer to section 5.1. Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated to reflect the change in the indication accordingly. Finally Annex II has been updated in order to take into account the latest version of the RMP.   |

## 3. Scientific discussion

## 3.1. Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and the highest rate of occurrence is in Western Europe and North America. In 2002, an estimated 1.15 million new cases of breast cancer occurred globally, of which approximately 350,000 occurred in Europe and 230,000 in the US. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in women with approximately 400,000 deaths annually (Parkin et al, CA Cancer J Clin (2005), 55:74-108). For women who are not candidates for  hormonal  therapy  and  whose  tumours  are  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2  (HER2)negative, cytotoxic chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for metastatic disease or locally recurrent disease  requiring  systemic  therapy  (Kataja  et  al,  Ann  Oncol  (2008),  19,  Suppl  2:ii1-ii13).  A  large number of cytotoxic agents have demonstrated activity in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (mBC), including anthracyclines, taxanes, alkylating agents, vinca alkaloids, and antimetabolites, such as  5-fluorouracil,  capecitabine,  or  methotrexate.  In  the  metastatic  setting  despite  the  variety  of chemotherapy agents available, patients are typically treated with palliative intent.

No  single  regimen  has  emerged  as  a  sole  standard  of  care  that  can  be  applied  to  all  patients. Compared  with  single  agent  regimens,  combinations  of  cytotoxic  agents  may  provide  a  greater objective response rate and longer progression-free intervals in the first-line setting. However, those gains  come  at  the  expense  of  more  side  effects  and  overlapping  toxicity.  As  a  result,  the  use  of sequential single agent cytotoxic therapy remains a frequent approach.

The introduction of taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) in the 1990s has led to significant improvements in  the  management  of  mBC.  A  Cochrane  meta-analysis  of  randomized  trials  comparing  taxanecontaining  with  non-taxane-containing  chemotherapy  regimens  in  women  with  mBC  showed  that regimens containing taxanes improved overall survival (OS), time to progression (TTP), and objective response  rates  (ORR)  (Ghersi  et  al,  Cochrane  Database  Syst  Review  (2005),  18(2):CD003366). Paclitaxel  and  docetaxel  share  similar  chemical  structures  and  anti-tumour  activities  but  differ  in haematological toxicity profiles (Verweij et al, Ann Oncol (1994), 5:495-505).

Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody. It inhibits angiogenesis by neutralizing all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and by blocking their binding to VEGF receptors. Bevacizumab was initially approved in the European Union (EU) on January 12, 2005 for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum (mCRC) in combination  with  intravenous  5-fluorouracil / folinic  acid  or  intravenous  5-fluorouracil / folinic acid / irinotecan.

The  following  type  II  variations  were  subsequently  approved  in  the  EU  to  extend  the  use  of bevacizumab: (1) in combination with paclitaxel for first-line treatment of mBC (March 27, 2007), (2) in  combination  with  platinum  based  chemotherapy  for  first-line  treatment  of  unresectable  advanced metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) other than predominantly squamous cell histology  (August  21,  2007),  (3)  in  combination  with  interferon  alfa-2a  for  first  line  treatment  of advanced  and/or  metastatic  renal  cell  cancer  (December  14,  2007),    (4)  in  combination  with fluoropyrimidine-based  chemotherapy  for  treatment  of  mCRC  (January  25,  2008)  and  (5)  in combination with docetaxel for first-line treatment of mBC (July 23, 2009).

This variation concerned an application for extension of the approved indications for Avastin to include:

''Avastin (bevacizumab) with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy is indicated for first-line treatment of patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer.  For  further  information  as  to  HER2  status,  please  refer  to Section 5.1''.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A revised proposed wording for the requested indication has been presented by the MAH at the Oral Explanation as follows:

''Avastin  in  combination  with  capecitabine  is  indicated  for  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with metastatic breast cancer in whom other chemotherapy options are not preferred. Patients who have received  taxane  and  anthracycline-containing  regimen  in  the  adjuvant  setting  within  the  last  12 months should be excluded from treatment with Avastin in combination with capecitabine.

For further information as to the observed differential efficacy depending  on the choice of chemotherapy regimen and as to HER2 status, please refer to section 5.1''.

## 3.1.1 GCP aspects /Scientific Advice

According to the MAH, the primary study in this application, AVF3694g was conducted in accordance with  current  United  States  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  Good  Clinical  Practices  (GCPs),  the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E6 Guideline for GCP and national and local ethical and legal requirements.

## 3.2 Clinical aspects

## 3.2.1 Clinical pharmacology

No new PK/PD or interaction studies have been submitted with the current application.

## 3.2.2 Clinical efficacy

The data in the current application are mainly from a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled  phase  III  trial  (AVF3694g)  comparing  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  to placebo and chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated mBC. It is supported by data from previously  submitted  phase  III  studies  E2100  and  BO17708  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with paclitaxel and docetaxel, respectively, as first-line treatment for patients with mBC. An earlier phase III  study of bevacizumab in combination with capecitabine in patients with mBC who had previously failed  therapy  with  anthracycline  and  a  taxane  (AVF2119g)  was  also  submitted.  All  studies  are presented in Table 1.

##  Main study

## AVF3694g (Ribbon-1) Study

AVF3694g is a phase III, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled study, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab combined with any of several standard cytotoxic chemotherapies (two taxanes, four anthracycline-based therapies, or capecitabine).

## METHODS

## Study Participants

The inclusion criteria were the following:

-  Histologically  or  cytologically  confirmed  adenocarcinoma  of  the  breast,  with  measurable  or  nonmeasurable locally recurrent or metastatic disease. Locally recurrent disease must not have been amenable to resection with curative intent.
-  ≥ 18 years of age.
-  Patients  in  the  anthracycline-based  chemotherapy  cohort  had  to  have  adequate  left  ventricular function at study entry, which was defined as a left ventricular ejection function (LVEF)  50% by either multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO).
-  Patients, who had received recent radiation therapy, had to have recovered from any significant (Grade  3) acute toxicity prior to day 0 of the study.
-  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.
-  For  women  of  childbearing  potential,  use  of  accepted  and  effective  method  of  non-hormonal contraception.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Key exclusion criteria were as follows:

-  HER-2 positive patients not previously treated with trastuzumab were excluded from the study as were patients.
-  Prior chemotherapy for locally recurrent or mBC.
-  Prior hormonal therapy &lt;1 week prior to Day 0 (baseline).
-  Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy within 12 months prior to Day 0, prior anthracycline treatment as part of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy for localized breast cancer (anthracyclinebased chemotherapy cohort only).
-  Investigational therapy within 28 days of Day 0.
-  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day 0, or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course o the study.
-  Minor surgical procedures, such as fine needle aspirations or core biopsies, within 7 days prior to Day 0.
-  Prior therapy with bevasizumab, sorafenib, sunitimib, or other vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway-targeted therapy.

## Treatments

Eligible patients with locally recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast were randomized in a  2:1  ratio  to  receive  chemotherapy  plus  bevacizumab  [15 mg/kg  every  3  weeks  (q3w)]  or chemotherapy  plus  placebo  in  a  double-blind  fashion.  The  protocol  specified  three  chemotherapy options, from which the investigator chose one prior to randomization of each individual patient:

1. Taxane: Either of the following taxanes administered intravenously every 3 weeks:

Docetaxel 75-100 mg/m 2

Paclitaxel protein-bound particles (Abraxane) 260 mg/m 2

2. Anthracycline-based (for patients not previously treated with anthracyclines): Any of the following combinations, administered intravenously q3w for a maximum of 8 cycles:

FEC:5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m 2 , epirubicin 90-100 mg/m 2 , and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m 2  on day 1

FAC:5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m 2 , doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 , and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m 2

AC:Doxorubicin 50-60 mg/m 2  and cyclophosphamide 500-600 mg/m 2

EC:Epirubicin 90-100 mg/m 2  and cyclophosphamide 500-600 mg/m 2

3. Capecitabine: 1000 mg/m 2  orally twice daily on days 1-14 of each 3-week cycle.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the study was to determine the clinical benefit of the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy regimens for previously untreated mBC.

Secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab combined with any of several  standard  cytotoxic  chemotherapies  (two  taxanes,  four  anthracycline-based  therapies,  or capecitabine).

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was Progression Free Survival (PFS) based on investigator assessment for  1)  patients  receiving  either  taxane  therapy  or  anthracycline-based  therapy  and  2)  patients receiving capecitabine therapy.

PFS was defined as the time from randomization to time of first documented disease progression or death,  whichever  occurred  first.  Patients  without  an  event  were  censored  at  the  last  tumour assessment or last follow-up for disease progression at which they were known to be progression free. Patients without any post-baseline tumour assessment were censored at randomization.

The secondary efficacy endpoints included

-  Objective response rate (ORR): complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by  response  evaluation  criteria  in  solid  tumours  (RECIST)  determined  on  two  consecutive investigator assessments  4 weeks apart during first-line therapy. The primary analysis of OR was  based  on  patients  in  the  Intent-to  treat  (ITT)  population  with  measurable  disease  at baseline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Duration  of  objective  response  (DR):  the  time  from  date  of  objective  response  to  disease progression  or  death  due  to  any  cause,  whichever  occurred  first.  Only  patients  who  were responders were included in the analysis of duration of response.
-  Overall  Survival:  the  time  from  randomization  until  death  from  any  cause.  For  patients  who had not died at the time of analysis or were lost to follow-up, data were censored at the date the patient was last known to be alive. This was the randomization date plus 1 day for patients who were randomized, not treated, and immediately lost to follow-up.
-  One-Year  Survival  Rate:  the  percentage  of  patients  who  were  alive  at  1  year  after  the randomization.
-  Progression Free Survival Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessed.

## Sample size

Cohort 1 (Taxane or Anthracycline-Based Chemotherapy)

The  sample  size  for  this  cohort  was  based  on  the  assumption  of  a  projected  enrolment  rate  of approximately 38 patients per month, a two-sided log-rank test and a 5% significance level. Based on these assumptions, a total of 600 patients (300 taxane treated patients and 300 treated anthracycline patients)  would  result  in  approximately  405 events  during  a  total  trial  period  of  approximately 28 months. This allowed for approximately 90% power to detect an improvement in median time to disease progression or death from 7 months in the chemotherapy  placebo arm to 10 months in the chemotherapy  bevacizumab arm [Hazard Ratio (HR)  0.70].

## Cohort 2 (Capecitabine)

Based  on  an  accrual  assumption  of  29 patients  recruited  per  month,  a  total  of  600 patients  would result in approximately 415 events during a total trial period of approximately 28 months. This allowed for  approximately  80%  power  to  detect  an  improvement  in  median  time  to  disease  progression  or death from 6 months in the placebo-containing arm to 8 months in the bevacizumab-containing arm (HR  0.75) at the 5% level of significance.

## Randomisation

Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the bevacizumab-containing arm or the placebo-containing arm using the hierarchical dynamic randomization schema with the following stratification factors:

-  choice of chemotherapy (taxane, anthracycline-based, capecitabine),
-  disease-free interval ( ≤ 12 months, &gt; 12 months since completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, or  definitive surgery if no adjuvant chemotherapy,
-  prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes, no),
-  number of metastatic sites (&lt; 3, ≥ 3).

Patients were to start their first dose of study treatment on the day of randomization but not later than 5 working days after randomization.

## Blinding (masking)

The  study  included  a  double-blinded  treatment  phase  and  an  optional  open-label  post-progression phase  during  which  patients  were  followed-up  for  survival.  During  the  blinded  treatment  phase, patients received chemotherapy and bevacizumab or placebo every 3 weeks until disease progression, treatment limiting toxicity, or death due to any cause.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical methods

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint

Both analysis cohorts were independently powered to detect a statistically significant increase in PFS at a type I error rate of 0.05 for each cohort.

The analysis of PFS was formally tested using a stratified log-rank test at the two-sided   0.05 level. The stratification  factors  in  the  stratified  analyses  were  those  used  for  randomization:  disease-free interval (  12 months,  12 months), prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes, no), number of metastatic sites (  3,  3),  and  choice  of  chemotherapy  (taxane,  anthracycline-based;  Cohort  1  only).  The  HR  was estimated using a stratified Cox regression model with the same stratification variables as used in the stratified log-rank test.

In  both  the  investigator  and  IRC-based  analysis,  for  those  patients  who  received  non  protocolspecified  antineoplastic  therapy  (NPT)  30 days  prior  to  investigator  or  IRC-determined  disease progression, PFS data were censored at the time of the last tumour assessment prior to the initiation of  NPT.  For patients  who  started  open-label  bevacizumab  prior  to  documented  disease  progression based  on  investigator  or  IRC  review,  data  were  censored  at  the last  tumour  assessment  prior  to initiation of open-label bevacizumab.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

For the key secondary endpoints of ORR, OS, and 1-year survival rate, the following test procedures were used to maintain an overall type I error rate of   0.05 (two-sided):

-  Step 1: The secondary endpoint of ORR was tested at the type I error rate of 0.01.
-  Step 2a: If a statistically significant result was observed for ORR, OS was tested at the type I error rate of 0.05.
-  Step 2b: Otherwise, OS was tested at the type I error rate of 0.04.
-  Step  3:  One-year  survival  rate  was  compared  only  when  a  statistically  significant  result  was observed in OS between the two treatment arms. The type I error rate for 1-year survival rate was the same as that used for OS.

No adjustments for  multiplicity  (of  endpoints  or  treatment  comparisons)  were  incorporated  into  the analyses of duration of objective response and PFS based on IRC-reviewed data.

ORR was formally compared between the two treatment arms using the Cochran-Mantel  Haenszel test, stratified by the randomization stratification factors.

OS was formally tested at the time of the final PFS analyses. This was considered as the final analysis of OS. A stratified log-rank test was used to compare the OS between treatment arms. The HR was estimated using the stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model.

One-year survival rate for each treatment arm was estimated using the Kaplan  Meier method and the 95% confidence intervals using Greenwood's formula. The difference in 1-year survival rate between treatment arms was assessed using the normal approximation method.

PFS Based on IRC-Reviewed Data was analyzed as for the primary analysis of PFS.

Three types of analysis populations were defined as follows:

-  The ITT population, defined as all patients who were randomized, regardless of whether they received any study drug or completed the full course of treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  The safety evaluable population (SAP) was defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.
-  The post-progression SAP was all patients who received bevacizumab in the optional open-label post-progression phase.

## PFS Sensitivity Analyses

The following sensitivity analyses were conducted for PFS:

-  Without  censoring  NPT:  For  patients  who  started  NPT  prior  to  progressive  disease,  any progression or death occurring after initiation of NPT was considered a PFS event. Otherwise, PFS was censored at the last tumour assessments.
-  Early discontinuation: Initiation of NPT prior to progressive disease or death or discontinuation of  first-line  therapy  for  a  reason  other  than  progressive  disease  or  death  was  treated  as  an event.  The  time  of  event  was  the  last  tumour  assessment  prior  to  NPT  or  treatment discontinuation plus 1 day.
-  Missing tumour assessments: For patients with a PFS event who missed scheduled assessments or  had  assessments  that  were  deemed  'unable  to  assess'  immediately  prior  to  progressive disease, the date of progression was replaced by the date of the first missing assessment.
-  PFS on treatment: For patients who died or had disease progression  63 days after the last dose of  blinded  study  drug,  PFS  was  censored  at  the  last  tumour  assessment  within  63  days  (one tumour assessment cycle) after the last dose of blinded study drug. Data were censored at the last tumour assessment for patients who did not have disease progression or die.
-  Worst-case  analysis:  For  patients  who  were  lost  to  follow-up,  i.e.,  alive  without  any  tumour assessments  126  days  (two  tumour  assessment  cycles)  prior  to  the  clinical  data  cut-off, patients in the bevacizumab-containing arm were considered to have disease progression at the first missing tumour assessment. For patients in the placebo-arm who were lost to follow-up, PFS was censored at the last available tumour assessment.

The following post-hoc sensitivity analyses were performed on the updated OS data to assess how the use of bevacizumab in the open-label phase may have affected OS.

##  Discounting OS for patients who received bevacizumab in the open-label phase

Assuming that the use of bevacizumab in the open-label phase prolonged OS, the survival time after the  initiation  of  bevacizumab  in  the  open-label  phase  was  discounted  by  25%  and  50%  for  both treatment arms.

##  Censoring OS at the initiation of bevacizumab use in the open-label phase

This  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  to  assess  the  treatment  effect  of  bevacizumab  on  OS, assuming that bevacizumab in the open-label phase was not available.

##  OS in patients who did or did not receive bevacizumab in the open label phase .

OS was compared between treatment arms in patients who did or did not receive bevacizumab in the open-label phase.

## RESULTS

## Participant flow

A total of 1237 patients (1232 female and 5 male) with locally recurrent or mBC were randomized to treatment with either Taxane/Anthracycline (T/Anth) + Bevacizumab (Bv) (N = 415), T/Anth + Placebo

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(Pl) (N = 207), Capecitabine (Cap) + Bv (N = 409) or Cap + Pl (N = 206). In the taxane subgroup, 203 patients were enrolled in the T + Bv arm and 104 patients in the T  Pl arm. In the anthracyclinebased chemotherapy subgroup, 212 patients were enrolled in the Anth  Bv arm and 103 patients in the Anth  Pl arm.

In Cohort 1, 36 patients (8.7%) in the T/Anth  Bv arm and 7 patients (3.4%) in the T/Anth  Pl arm remained on blinded study drug at the time of the clinical data cut-off for the final analyses (July 31, 2008). In Cohort 2, 55 patients (13.4%) in the Cap  Bv arm and 22 patients (10.7%) in the Cap  Pl arm remained on blinded study drug at the time of the clinical data cut-off. The patient disposition is presented in Table 2.

a &gt; 60 days since last administration of study drug, treatment completed, or other; b Includes all patients who discontinued from either the blinded treatment phase or the optional open-label post-progression phase.

## Recruitment

The study period was from 15 December 2005 to 31 July 2008. A total of 1237 patients were enrolled at 232 centres in the United States, Europe, and the rest of the world.

## Conduct of the study

The protocol was finalized on 4 October 2005 and amended five times as follows:

-  The first amendment to Study AVF3694g (effective on 1 February 2006) revised the protocol to provide more clarity and rigorous guidelines for study therapy in both the blinded treatment and  optional  open-label  post-progression  phases.  Safety  information  was  updated  to  be consistent with current standard bevacizumab dose modification guidelines. Protocol-specified selected  adverse  events  and  special  reporting  for  non-serious  cardiac  adverse  events  were further  defined.  All  intracranial  haemorrhages  were  to  be  reported  as  serious  and  were therefore  subject  to  serious  adverse  event  reporting  requirements.  Safety  monitoring  of  left ventricular  function  during  initial  screening  was  added  for  patients  with  prior  exposure  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

anthracycline-based  therapy,  rather  than  only  for  patients  entering  the  anthracycline-based chemotherapy subgroup. All Grade ≥ 2 left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) events were to  be  reported  immediately  to  the  sponsor  to  allow  for  a  timely  and  thorough  review  of cardiotoxicity events by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).

-  The  second  amendment  to  the  protocol  was  effective  on  22  November  2006.  Secondary objectives  and  outcome  measures  were  amended  to  include  1-year  survival  rate.  Additional changes were made to provide more clarity and rigorous guidelines for study therapy during both  the  blinded  treatment  and  optional  open-label  post-progression  phases.  A  provision allowing  optional  unblinding  was  added  for  patients  with  documented  progressive  disease  if such information was believed to be instrumental in determining the next course of treatment.
-  The third amendment to the protocol was effective on 20 February 2007. The amendment was triggered by the FDA's comments on the study design. Key changes to the protocol included the  following:  The  sample  size  of  the  capecitabine  cohort  was  increased  to  fully  power  the capecitabine cohort in order to ascertain the clinical benefit of the addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine  therapy.  The  second  primary  objective  of  this  trial  was  amended  in  order  to ascertain  the  clinical  benefit,  as  measured  by  PFS,  of  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to capecitabine therapy compared with capecitabine alone.
-  In response to the FDA's comments on Amendment 3, the protocol was amended a fourth time on 24 July 2007 to provide more information in support of the primary endpoint of PFS and the secondary endpoint of overall survival. An IRC assessment of PFS was added as a sensitivity analysis to provide support for the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS. Additional capture of subsequent anti-cancer therapy during the survival follow-up phase for all patients was  designed  to  provide  information  on  therapies  that  may  have  contributed  to  the  OS  of patients  after  they  had  discontinued  from  the  blinded  treatment  phase  of  the  study.  The definition of PFS was also revised to allow better characterization and to be more consistent with the definitions accepted by the regulatory communities.
-  The  protocol  was  amended  a  fifth  time  on  27  March  2008.  The  optional  open-label  postprogression  phase  was  extended  to  all  patients  receiving  study  treatment  when  the  study analysis  was  complete  if  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  showed  significant  improvement  with bevacizumab  without  a  detrimental  effect  on  patient  safety.  The  maximum  duration  of treatment with bevacizumab was increased to 48 months.

## Supportive studies

Studies E2100, BO17708 and AVF2119G are supportive studies. Studies E2100 and BO17708 (Avado study)  formed  the  basis  for  the  approval  of  bevacizumab  in  mBC  in  combination  with  paclitaxel (EMEA/582/II/08)  and  docetaxel  (EMEA/582/II/24),  respectively.  In  the  3 rd   RSI,  the  MAH  was specifically  asked  by the CHMP  to  present  supportive data on the  bevacizumab-capecitabine combination based on study AVF3693g (Ribbon-2).

Final analysis of OS in BO17708 has been submitted as part of the responses to the 2 nd  RfSI. However, the  assessment  of  these  data  was  deferred  to  the  Article  20  procedure  that  was  initiated  on  23 September 2010.

##  AVF2119G

This  was  a  randomised,  open-label  Phase  III  trial  designed  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of capecitabine with or without bevacizumab, in women with mainly refractory/resistant mBC (previously exposed to anthracyclines and taxanes or with relapses &lt; 12 months after adjuvant therapy).

Patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  capecitabine  (2,500  mg/m2/d)  twice  daily  on  day  1 through 14 every 3 weeks, alone or in combination with bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) on day 1.

The  primary  end  point  was  PFS,  as  determined  by  an  independent  review  facility  (IRF).  From November 2000 to March 2002, 462 patients were enrolled (230 patients in the capecitabine arm and 232 in the capecitabine + bevacizumab arm).

## Results in Study AVF2119G

The  combination  of  capecitabine+bevacizumab  did  not  increase  PFS  as  determined  by  the  IRF.  The median PFS was 4.86 months for the capecitabine+bevacizumab arm v.s. 4.17 for the bevacizumab arm (HR=0.98 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.25]; P =0.857).

The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in figure 4.

Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier Curve of Progression-Free Survival: AVF2119G study

<!-- image -->

The response rates results were 19.8% [95% CI, 14.7 to 25.0]  for the capecitabine/bevacizumab arm v.s.  9.1%  [95%  CI,  5.4  to  12.9]  for  the  bevacizumab  arm  (p  =  0.001)  as  determined  by  the  IRF review.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Study AVF2119g, QoL data was collected using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) instrument, which consists of 36 items from 5 subscales (physical well-being, functional wellbeing, emotional well-being, social well-being, breast cancer subscale). FACT-B was administered to patients every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks then every 9 weeks thereafter. The Trial Outcome IndexBreast  (TOI-B),  which  includes  the  physical  well-being,  functional  well-being,  and  breast  cancer subscales of the FACT-B instrument, was pre-specified as the primary measure of QoL. The primary analysis of QoL was based on the time to deterioration in QoL (TDQ). TDQ is defined as the time from randomization to the earliest time-point of clinically meaningful decline in QoL or disease progression/death.

No  significant  difference  was  observed  between  treatment  arms  in  TDQ,  based  on  the  other  six summary scores of the FACT-B instrument (FACT-B total, physical well-being, functional well-being, emotional well-being, social well-being, breast cancer subscale).

##  AVF3693g (Ribbon-2)

Study  AVF3693g  was  a  Phase III,  multicenter,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind  trial designed  to evaluate the efficacy  and  safety  of  bevacizumab  when  combined  with  standard chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy plus placebo in  patients  with  previously  treated  HER2negative  mBC.  All  patients  in  this  study  had  received  only  one  prior  line  of  therapy  for  metastatic disease. The study was designed to demonstrate prolongation of PFS by addition of bevacizumab to any of four commonly used second-line mBC  cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment options in recurrent/metastatic  breast  cancer,  namely  taxanes,  gemcitabine,  capecitabine,  or  vinorelbine.  The dose  and  schedule  of  capecitabine  used  in  this  trial  was  the  generally  used  starting  dose  of 1000 mg/m 2  orally twice daily on Days 1-14 of each 3 week cycle.

In  Study  AVF3693g,  the  choice  of  chemotherapy  for  an  individual  patient  was  determined  at  the discretion of the individual investigator prior to randomization. The primary efficacy endpoint of Study AVF3693g was PFS based on investigator assessments, pooled across chemotherapy cohorts. Although no  chemotherapy  subgroup  was  individually  powered,  a  pre-specified  secondary  endpoint  was  PFS outcome by chemotherapy cohort.

## Results in Study AVF3693g

The stratified HR for PFS for the chemotherapy + bevacizumab arm relative to the chemotherapy + placebo  arm  (pooled,  ITT  analysis)  was  0.78  (p  =  0.0072),  representing  a  22%  risk  reduction  of disease progression or death with a delta at the median of 2.1 months (table 15).

a The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival. The stratified log-rank test was used to assess the  difference  in  overall  survival  between  the  bevacizumab-containing  and  non-bevacizumab -containing  arms. Hazard ratios for pooled overall survival were obtained using a stratified Cox model. The stratification factor was each study (AVF3694g T/Anth, AVF3694g Cap, BO17708, E2100).

##  Biomarkers

In reply to CHMP request, the MAH has performed an extensive review of the attempts to identify a valid biomarker predictive of benefit from VEGF-targeted therapy.

The  introduction  of  a  new  assay  to  measure  VEGF-A  levels  has  produced  highly  interesting  results compatible with relevant predictive value of VEGF-A and VEGFR2 as promising candidate markers with prognostic and predictive properties for bevacizumab. Further investigation of these markers and assay characterisation  will  be  performed  to  further  understand  these  data.  The  MAH  has  adequately described the steps taken in the development of the old and new ELISA assay, the availability of serum samples  from  all  finalised  and  ongoing  randomised  studies  for  the  reassessment  VEGF-A  levels  at baseline  and  on  treatment  as  well  as  the  timelines  for  the  submission  of  these  data  which  at  the earliest will be in Q1, 2011.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

##  Discussion on clinical efficacy

No  new  PK/PD  or  interaction  studies  have  been  submitted  with  the  current  application.  This  is acceptable as several former trials have investigated the interaction of bevacizumab with all the major groups of chemotherapies.

The  protocol  of  AVF3694g  (Ribbon-1)  study  specified  three  chemotherapy  options,  from  which  the investigator chose one prior to randomization of each individual patient. The selected chemotherapy regimens represent the current standard of care in the first-line treatment of locally recurrent/mBC in the EU.

The demographic data and disease characteristics were well balanced between treatment arms.

For the primary endpoint PFS (investigator-assessed) in the taxane/anthracycline cohort, HR was 0.64 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.80]; p&lt;0.0001).

The  CHMP  concluded  at  an  earlier  stage  of  the  procedure  that  the  gain  in  terms  of  PFS  in taxane/anthracycline  +  bevacizumab  treated  patients  was  overall  considered  of  modest  clinical significance.  Furthermore,  no  adjustment  for  multiplicity  was  incorporated  into  the  analysis  of  PFS based on IRC-reviewed data. Finally, no investigations of QoL had been included in the Ribbon-1 study submitted which was considered a shortcoming of the present application.

As  a  consequence  to  major  objection  raised  by  the  CHMP,  an  indication  including  anthracycline  or Abraxane (albumin-bound paclitaxel) was no longer requested.

The data from the capecitabine cohort of the AVF3694g study showed a statistically significant effect of bevacizumab on PFS (median PFS of 8.6 months in the capecitabine+bevacizumab arm versus 5.7 months in the capecitabine + placebo arm, respectively) with a stratified HR of 0.69 ([95% CI, 0.564 to  0.840];  p=0.0002).    The  effect  of  adding  bevacizumab  to  capecitabine  on  PFS  over  time  is  not supported by a sustained OS advantage.

No QoL data was collected in study AVF3694.

In study AVF2119g the addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine (as a 1st to 3rd line therapy following previous  treatment  with  anthracycline  and  a  taxane)  resulted  in  a  doubling  of  the  ORR  (19.8%) compared with patients treated with capecitabine alone (9.1%). However, the increased response rate was not associated with an improvement in PFS (HR=0.98 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.25]) or in OS (HR=1.08 [95% CI, 0.80 to 1.45]). Study AVF2119g enrolled patients who were more heavily pretreated in a more advanced stage of  the  disease  or  patients  with  disease  characteristics  associated  with  a  poor prognosis.

In  the  3 rd RSI,  the  MAH  was  specifically  asked  by  the  CHMP  to  present  supportive  data  on  the bevacizumab + capecitabine combination based on study AVF3693g (Ribbon-2). In the subgroup of 144  patients  (21%)  who  received  capecitabine  in  combination  with  either  bevacizumab  (n=  97)  or placebo (n=47), the addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine lead to a median PFS of 6.9 months in the  bevacizumab  arm  vs.  4.1  months  in  the  placebo  arm.  However,  no  statistical  significance  was reached.

The SAG-O was consulted on the following question:

-  The SAG-O should discuss the use, clinical relevance and benefit/risk balance of the bevacizumab + capecitabine  combination  as  1st  line  treatment  in  patients  with  mBC  based  on  the  results  of cohort 2 of the AVF3694g (Ribbon-1) study and the supportive AVF2119g study (2nd line).

The SAG agreed that in principle the effect observed in terms of PFS for bevacizumab + capecitabine (median 5.7 and 8.6 months for placebo + capecitabine and bevacizumab + capecitabine, respectively)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

based on the AVF3694g trial was modest but clinically relevant for the same reasons listed above, and that the benefit-risk balance was positive. However, the SAG had different views about the strength of evidence of efficacy of the bevacizumab + capecitabine combination due to inconsistencies with the results of study AVF2119g.

According to one view, the evidence of clinical efficacy is convincing in the population studied. It should be noted that selection criteria for the pivotal AVF3694g trial excluded patients with prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  within  12  months.  This  group  of  patients  represents  a  population  with better  prognosis.  Therefore,  extrapolations  to  the  general  metastatic  breast  cancer  population  are difficult.  In  addition,  this  combination  appears  to  be  less  active  compared  to  a  number  of  available options including taxanes and should therefore only be used in case of clear preference for decreased toxicity at the expense of decreased antitumor activity, or in case of failure to taxanes in the adjuvant setting. Prescribing information should give clear instructions about the risk of decreased efficacy with this combination. Concerning the apparently inconsistent results of supportive study AVF2119g, these were not considered of concern because the trial was conducted in a more advanced setting (second and third-line treatment).

Other  SAG  members  questioned  the  consistency  of  the  efficacy  results  of  the  bevacizumab  + capecitabine  combination.  The  effect  on  PFS  associated  with  bevacizumab  in  combination  with capecitabine was somewhere in between the effect associated with bevacizumab with paclitaxel and docetaxel and as such, the effect was convincing. However, the results of supportive study AVF2119g in  second  and  third-line  treatment  strongly  question  the  validity  of  this  observation.  Although  in  a different population (mainly refractory/resistant mBC previously exposed to anthracyclines and taxanes or with relapses &lt; 12 months after adjuvant therapy), in this study the median PFS was 4.86 months for the capecitabine + bevacizumab arm v.s. 4.17 for the capecitabine arm (HR=0.98 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.25]; P =0.857). According to this view, the conflicting results in terms of PFS in trials AVF3694g and AVF2119g have not been sufficiently explained. Rather, they may indicate that the efficacy has been overestimated in trial AVF3694g and that there is insufficient evidence of efficacy for bevacizumab + capecitabine combination. Further data to confirm the efficacy of this combination should be provided before a positive benefit-risk balance can be established in the light of the results observed in study AVF2119g. Confirmation of efficacy is particularly important since this combination already appears to be less active compared to a number of available options including taxanes.

A revised proposed wording for the requested indication has been presented by the MAH at the Oral Explanation as follows:

''Avastin  in  combination  with  capecitabine  is  indicated  for  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with metastatic breast cancer in whom other chemotherapy options are not preferred. Patients who have received  taxane  and  anthracycline-containing  regimen  in  the  adjuvant  setting  within  the  last  12 months should be excluded from treatment with Avastin in combination with capecitabine.

For further information as to the observed differential efficacy depending  on the choice of chemotherapy regimen and as to HER2 status, please refer to section 5.1''.

## 3.2.3 Clinical safety

The safety data is based on the later clinical cut-off date of 23 February 2009 of study AVF3694g.

-  Patient exposure

Overall,  817  patients  were  exposed  to  bevacizumab  (15  mg/kg  q3w).  The  mean  number  of bevacizumab doses per patient for all 3 types of chemotherapy regimens (during the blinded treatment phase) is presented in table 19.

-  Adverse events of special interest

## Arterial Thromboembolic Events

The incidences of ATEs were  2.0% between treatment arms. One event in the Cap+Pl arm led to the death of the patient.

## Bleeding

Eleven patients (5.4%) in the T+Bv arm experienced 15 grade 3 or 4 bleeding events compared to none in the T+Pl arm. Nine of the events were GI haemorrhages, 4 events were epistaxis, and there was one event each of post-procedural haemorrhage and haematoma. Bleeding events in the other two chemotherapy subgroups were uncommon (incidence  0.5%). The only grade 5 bleeding event (haemothorax) was reported in the Cap+Pl arm.

## Febrile Neutropenia

The incidence of febrile neutropenia observed in the T+Bv arm was 8.4% vs. 2.0% in the T+Pl arm. Six of the 17 reported events in the T+Bv arm were grade 4, whereas both events in the T+Pl arm were grade 3. The incidence of febrile neutropenia events was 3.8% in the Anth+Bv vs. 5.0% in the Anth+Pl  arm.  There  was  one  case  of  grade  5  febrile  neutropenia  in  the  Anth+Pl  arm.  No  febrile neutropenia events were reported in the capecitabine cohort.

## Fistula

There were 4 reports of fistula during the trial, one in each of the taxane and capecitabine containing arms. The one case reported in the T+Bv arm was a grade 5 abdominal abscess. No fistula events were reported in the anthracycline-based chemotherapy subgroup.

## Gastrointestinal (GI) Perforation

The incidence of GI perforations was 2.5% in the T+Bv arm vs. 1.0% in the T+Pl arm (one of these events in the T+Bv arm was grade 4 and one grade 5). There were no GI perforation events in the anthracycline-based chemotherapy subgroup or in the capecitabine cohort.

## Hypertension

The incidence of hypertension in the bevacizumab-containing arms compared with the placebo-containing arms across the three chemotherapy regimens was 1) taxane: 9.4% vs. 2.0%, 2) anthracycline: 10.5% vs. 0.0% and 3) capecitabine: 10.6% vs. 1.0%. Most AEs of hypertension were grade 3. In the Anth+Bv arm, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 hypertension was 16.2% in patients  65 years of age vs. 8.7% in those &lt; 65 years of age.

## Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (LVSD)

Five  patients  (2.5%)  experienced  LVSD  in  the  T+Bv  arm  (four  grade 3  events  and  one  grade 2) compared  to  none  in  the  T+Pl  arm.  According  to  the  patient  narratives,  4  of  these  5  patients  had received previous adjuvant therapy with an anthracycline of the clinical study report.

For patients who were treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, the cardiac adverse event rate was 6.2% in the Anth+Bv arm vs. 6.0% in the Anth+Pl arm. For patients who received anthracyclines concomitantly  with  bevacizumab,  the  incidence  of grade 3  or  higher  Congestive  Heart  Failure  (CHF) was 6 of 210 patients (2.9%) in the Anth+Bv arm vs. none of 100 patients in the Anth+Pl arm.

The incidence of LVSD was 1.5% in the Cap+Bv arm compared and 0.5% in the Cap+Pl arm. Two grade 5 cardiac AEs (cardiogenic shock, cardiac failure/cardiorespiratory arrest) were reported in the Cap+Bv arm.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Neutropenia

The incidence of neutropenia in the bevacizumab-containing arms compared with the placebo-containing arms across the three chemotherapy regimens was 1) taxane: 9.4% vs. 4.9%, 2) anthracycline: 4.3% vs. 4.0% and 3) capecitabine: 1.2% vs. 1.0%. One grade 5 neutropenia event was reported in the Anth+Pl arm.

## Proteinuria

A higher incidence of proteinuria, especially grade 3 proteinuria, was observed in the bevacizumab-containing  arms  compared  with  the  placebo-containing  arms  across  the  3  classes  of chemotherapy (T+Bv: 4.4%; Anth+Bv: 2.9%; Cap+Bv: 2.2%) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.0%).

Overall,  a  higher  percentage  of  Abraxane-treated  patients  experienced  proteinuria  than  docetaxeltreated  patients.  An  increase  in  the  incidence  of  proteinuria  was  observed  in  the  bevacizumabcontaining  arm  compared with the placebo-containing arm for both subgroups (Abraxane: 7.5% vs. 0.0%; docetaxel: 2.4% vs. 0.0%).

## Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS)

One patient in the T+Bv arm (0.5%) had a grade 3 RPLS event. No RPLS events were reported in either the anthracycline-based chemotherapy subgroup or the capecitabine cohort.

## Sensory Neuropathy

More  patients  in  the  taxane  subgroup  had  sensory  neuropathy  reported  than  in  the  anthracycline subgroup, although the incidence and grade of sensory neuropathy were similar across treatment arms with  each  subgroup  (Taxane  8%-9%:  anthracycline  0%-0.5%).  Most  cases  in  the  taxane  subgroup were grade 3. There was a higher incidence of grade  3 sensory neuropathy events in the Cap+Bv arm relative to the Cap+Pl arm (3.0% vs. 0.5%).

## Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE)

The incidence of VTE events in the bevacizumab-containing arms compared with the placebo-containing arms across the three chemotherapy regimens was 1) taxane : 4.9% vs. 2.0%, 2) anthracycline: 2.9% vs. 1.0% and 3) capecitabine 5.0% vs. 3.5% (most of the increase was in grade 3 events).  Four  grade  5  VTE  events  (all  cases  of  pulmonary  embolism)  occurred  in  placebo  treated patients; one each in the T+Pl and Anth+Pl arm, and two in the Cap+Pl arm.

## Wound Dehiscence

The incidence of wound dehiscence between the bevacizumab-containing and placebo-containing arms across the three chemotherapy regimens was: 1) taxane: 1.5% vs. 1.0%, 2) anthracycline: 1.0% vs. 0.0% and 3) capecitabine: 0.7% vs. 0.0%). Most of the events were grade 3.

-  Serious adverse events and deaths

## Serious adverse events (SAEs)

Serious  adverse  events  reported  during  the  blinded  treatment  phase  which  occurred  with  a  2% difference in incidence between treatment arms in any chemotherapy class are summarized in table 22.

Anth  anthracycline-based chemotherapy; Bv = bevacizumab; Cap = capecitabine; MedDRA  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; Pl = placebo; T = taxane.

As expected, the incidence of reported SAEs was higher in the bevacizumab-containing arms compared to  the  placebo-containing  arms:  1)  taxane  subgroup:  41.9%  vs.  26.5%,  2)  anthracycline-based subgroup: 22.9% vs. 16.0% and 3) capecitabine cohort: 25.2% vs. 20.4%. The only individual SAE occurring  at  a  &gt;5%  higher  incidence  in  patients  treated  with  bevacizumab  was  febrile  neutropenia (7.4% in the T+Bv arm and 2.0% in the placebo arm). SAEs with a  2% but &lt;5% higher incidence in T+Bv patients compared to T+Pl were diarrhoea (3.0% vs. 0%), sepsis (3.0% vs. 1.0%), dehydration (3.0% vs. 1.0%), GI perforation (2.0% vs. 0%), and cellulitis (2.5% vs. 0%). In patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy, febrile neutropenia was the only SAE which occurred with a  2% incidence in Anth+Bv (3.3%) and Anth+Pl patients (5.0%). In the capecitabine cohort, there were no SAEs with a  2% higher incidence in patients receiving bevacizumab or placebo.

## Deaths

Table 23 provides an overview of the incidence of deaths and the cause of death according to the trial treatment received.

Anth  anthracycline-based chemotherapy; Bv = bevacizumab; Cap = capecitabine; Pl  placebo; T = taxane

The most common cause of death in all treatments arms was disease progression which accounted for 91% of all deaths. Approximately 10% of deaths occurred within 30 days of the last dose of blinded study  drug.  Of  these  deaths,  60%  were  due  to  investigator-reported  disease  progression;  the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

remaining deaths were due to an adverse event. None of the deaths from causes other than disease progression were attributed to study drug by the investigators.

d  One patient had Grade 5 hypotension on the Selected AE CRF and Grade 5 sepsis on the SAE CRF. Clinical review deemed these two adverse events to be the same event.

##  Laboratory findings and vital signs

Laboratory  tests  for  safety  were  not  performed  in  study  AVF3694g  with  the  exception  of  screening laboratory values and urine protein/creatinine ratio.

For  patients  who  were  treated  with  anthracycline-based  chemotherapy,  the  mean  left  ventricular ejection  fraction  (LVEF)  decreased  slightly.  The  decline  in  LVEF  in  the  two  treatment  arms  was:  1) Anth+Bv arm baseline vs. highest postbaseline value: 65.7% vs. 59.6% and 2) Anth+Pl arm baseline vs. highest postbaseline value: 64.7% vs. 60.8%. There were no other notable findings in the analyses of vital signs.

-  Safety in special populations

## Adverse events by age group

In general, elderly patients (  65 years old) experienced a higher incidence of Grade  3 adverse events compared with younger patients, regardless of treatment arm. Consistent with what was reported in the overall study population, the incidence of adverse events in the bevacizumab-containing arm was higher than that in the placebo-containing arm for each subgroup across chemotherapy classes.

## Adverse Events by Age Group in Patients Receiving Capecitabine Therapy

Adverse  events  with  a  2%  difference  in  incidence  between  treatment  arms  and  more  than one occurrence  in  each  subgroup  are  summarised  for  patients  treated  with  capecitabine  therapy  in table 25.

Of the 605 patients who received capecitabine therapy, 150 (24.8%) were  65 years old. Hypertension was the only adverse event with a  5% incidence in either subgroup. Adverse events with a  2% but &lt;5% difference in incidence between treatment arms and more than one occurrence per subgroup, but not  meeting  these  criteria  in  the  overall  population  were  diarrhoea,  mucosal  inflammation,  pain, asthenia,  sepsis,  hip  fracture,  dehydration,  mental  status  change,  pleural  effusion,  pulmonary embolism and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome.

No data was submitted.

-  Discussion on clinical safety

The overall incidence of adverse events was higher in Bv-treated arms than in the placebo-containing arms across all 3 chemotherapy regimens.

In Cap-treated patients, hypertension was the only AE with  5% increase in incidence in the Cap + Bv arm versus the Cap + Pl arm. Adverse events with a  2% but  5% difference in incidence between treatment arms were peripheral sensory neuropathy, and proteinuria.

Among patients with AEs, patients with Grade 3-5 events were quite frequent, particularly in the T+Bv arm (57.1%).

The addition of Bv to the 3 different chemotherapy backbones resulted in a higher incidence of SAEs compared to the Pl-containing arms: T: 41.9% (Bv) vs. 26.5% (Pl), Anth: 22.9% (Bv) vs. 16.0% (Pl), Cap: 25.2% (Bv) vs. 20.4% (Pl).

A higher incidence of hypertension was observed in all the bevacizumab-containing arms compared to the placebo-containing arms across the 3 chemotherapy regimens (T: 9.4% vs. 2.0%; Anth: 10.5% vs. 0.0%; Cap: 10.6% vs. 1.0%). Most adverse events of hypertension were grade 3. Likewise, a higher incidence of proteinuria, especially grade 3 proteinuria, was observed in the bevacizumab-containing arms compared with the placebo-containing arms across the 3 classes of chemotherapy (T+Bv: 4.4% (highest  in  Abraxane-treated  patients);  Anth+Bv:  2.9%;  Cap+Bv:  2.2%)  compared  to  patients receiving placebo (0.0%). For patients who were treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, the cardiac adverse event rate was similar across treatment arms (Anth+Bv: 6.2% vs.; Anth+Pl: 6.0%). However, more patients had a higher grade of LVSD in the Anth+Bv arm compared with the Anth+Pl arm. In addition, an independent and blinded cardiologist has re-evaluated these events and concluded that only 2 patients had true evidence of severe treatment-related CHF.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A  higher  proportion  of  T/Bv  and  T/Anth-treated  patients  discontinued  study  treatment  due  to  AEs compared to their respective Pl-containing arms : T : 25.1% (Bv) vs. 8.8% (Pl), Anth : 15.2% (Bv) vs. 4.0% (Pl), Cap : 12.6% (Bev) vs. 11.9% (Pl). The most common events leading to discontinuations were GI perforations, proteinuria and hypertension.

The  most  common  AEs  related  to  the  treatment  of  bevacizumab  are  hypertension  and  proteinuria. Much  attention  is  being  put  on  severe,  bevacizumab-associated  events  like  high  grade  bleeding, arterial thromboembolic events, GI perforation and wound-healing complications. These events occur at low incidence. Overall, the safety profile of bevacizumab in mBC seems consistent with our previous experience in other indications. Finally, no difference in toxicity-related mortality has been observed between treatment arms.

Information has been updated under Sections 2.4 Warnings and Precautions and 2.6 Undesirable Effects to reflect the removal of the contraindication. In particular, information relating to CNS bleeding has been added to these sections. A corresponding approval to remove this contraindication from the Avastin SPC was granted as per the Commission Decision of 25 March 2009 (Variation number: EMEA/H/C/582/II/025). | Routine. EU SmPC section 4.4: Haemorrhage Patients treated with Avastin have an increased risk of haemorrhage, especially tumour-associated haemorrhage. Avastin should be discontinued permanently in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 bleeding during Avastin therapy. Patients with untreated CNS metastases were routinely excluded from clinical trials with Avastin, based on imaging procedures or signs and symptoms. Therefore, the risk of CNS haemorrhage in such patients has not been prospectively evaluated in randomised clinical studies. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CNS bleeding, and Avastin treatment discontinued in case of intracranial bleeding. There is no information on the safety profile of Avastin in patients with congenital bleeding diathesis, acquired coagulopathy or in patients receiving full dose of anticoagulants for the treatment of thromboembolism prior to starting Avastin treatment, as such patients were excluded from clinical trials.

Clinical safety data suggest that the incidence of hypertension is likely to be dose-dependent. Pre existing hypertension should be adequately controlled before starting Avastin treatment. There is no information on the effect of Avastin in patients with uncontrolled hypertension at the time of initiating therapy. Monitoring of blood pressure is generally recommended during therapy. In most cases hypertension was controlled adequately using standard antihypertensive treatment appropriate for the individual situation of the affected patient. The use of diuretics to manage hypertension is not advised in patients who receive a cisplatin- based chemotherapy regimen. Avastin should be permanently discontinued, if medically significant hypertension cannot be adequately controlled with antihypertensive therapy, or if the patient develops hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.

## 4. Benefit Risk Assessment

## Benefits

The data from the capecitabine cohort of the AVF3694g (Ribbon-1) study resulted in 2.9 months gain in median PFS (8.6 months in the capecitabine + bevacizumab arm compared with 5.7 months in the capecitabine-placebo arm). The HR was 0.69 ([95% CI, 0.56 to 0.84]; log rank p=0.0002). In support of the primary analysis, the ORR was 35.4% in the capecitabine + bevacizumab arm vs. 23.6% in the capecitabine + placebo arm (p=0.0097).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

In the more heavily pretreated patient population in supportive study AVF2119g, the increased ORR was not associated with an improvement in PFS (HR=0.98 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.25]) or OS (HR=1.08 [95% CI, 0.80 to 1.45]) which may reflect the increasing degree of tumour resistance that develops over time with the successive lines of therapy.

No statistical significance was reached in the PFS results of study AVF3693g (Ribbon-2) .In addition, the  ORR  was  35.8%  in  the  bevacizumab  arm  vs.  15.4%  in  the  control  arm  (p=0.0225)  but  no statistically significant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No formal comparison with other standard available first line therapeutic options are made neither the patient population which may eventually benefit from first line capecitabine has been clearly defined.

## Risks

The  safety  profiles  of  both  capecitabine  as  well  as  bevacizumab  have  been  well-characterized. Common  AEs  associated  with  capecitabine  include  gastrointestinal  disorders,  hand-foot  syndrome, fatigue,  asthenia,  anorexia,  cardiotoxicity,  increased  renal  dysfunction  in  patients  with  pre-existing renal insufficiency and thromboembolism. The addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine has not lead to new safety concerns.

The overall incidence of reported AEs was higher in the combination arm (40.1%) compared to the placebo arm (26.9%). Particularly, the incidences of hypertension, peripheral sensory neuropathy and proteinuria  were  increased.  There  were  no  SAEs  with  a ≥ 2%  difference  in  incidence  between treatment arms. The percentage of deaths unrelated to disease progression was 2.5% in the placebocontaining arm vs. 1.5% in the bevacizumab-containing arm.

Concerning  the  bevacizumab  +  capecitabine  combination,  the  proportion  of  patients  experiencing grade 3-5 adverse events was 37% versus 23% associated with capecitabine + placebo.

## Benefit-risk balance

The  claimed  improvement  in  PFS  associated  with  the  combination  of  bevacizumab+capecitabine compared to capecitabine  alone  based  on  the  AVF3694g  trial  was  modest  and  no  important  effects have been observed in terms of other clinically relevant endpoints such as OS or health-related quality of life. No important effects were observed in terms of clinical efficacy in study AVF2119g in a relevant patient population.

The  bevacizumab  +  capecitabine  combination  was  associated  with  significant  toxicity.  This  is  of particular  relevance  since  the  proposed  indication  is  aimed  at  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with metastatic  breast  cancer  for  whom  a  more  tolerable  regimen  is  preferred  compared  to  more  active chemotherapy.

In the absence of an established clinical efficacy or other clinically relevant benefits, and considering the  significant  toxicity  of  the  combination  of  bevacizumab+capecitabine,  the  benefit-risk  cannot  be considered positive in the proposed indication.

## Recommendation

On 16 December the CHMP considered this Type II variation and agreed that the changes to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be refused on the following grounds:

-  The  claimed  improvement  in  PFS  associated  with  the  combination  of  bevacizumab+capecitabine compared to capecitabine alone based on the AVF3694g trial was modest and no important effects have been observed in terms of other clinically relevant endpoints such as OS or health-related quality of life.
-  No important effects were observed in terms of clinical efficacy in study AVF2119g in a relevant patient population.
-  The  bevacizumab  +  capecitabine  combination  was  associated  with  significant  toxicity.  This  is  of particular relevance since the proposed indication is aimed at first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer for whom a more tolerable regimen is preferred compared to more active chemotherapy.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  In  the  absence  of  an  established  clinical  efficacy  or  other  clinically  relevant  benefits,  and considering the significant toxicity of the combination of bevacizumab+capecitabine, the benefitrisk cannot be considered positive in the proposed indication.

## 5. Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 16 December 2011

Following the CHMP conclusion that the benefit-risk for Avastin in combination with capecitabine for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer in whom other chemotherapy options are not  preferred,  could  not  be  considered  positive,  the  MAH  submitted  detailed  grounds  for  the re-examination of the grounds for refusal.

## Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the MAH

The MAH presented in writing and at an oral explanation a number of arguments regarding the grounds for refusal:

## Ground No 1

The  MAH  argued  that  in  Study  AVF3694g,  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  capecitabine  has demonstrated a statistically significant, clinically relevant, and robust improvement in PFS, which was supported by a superior ORR as well as by a numerical improvement in OS:

-  Capecitabine  in  combination  with  bevacizumab  was  superior  to  capecitabine  alone,  with  a clinically meaningful improvement in PFS (stratified HR 0.69, log-rank p=0.0002; median PFS 8.6  vs.  5.7  months,  a  2.9  month  improvement  in  the  median  PFS),  corresponding  to  a reduction  in  the  risk  of  progression  or  death  by  31%.  These  data  were  corroborated  by  a blinded independent review committee (HR 0.68; median PFS 9.8 vs. 6.2 months, a 3.6 month improvement in the median PFS).
-  Improvements  in  PFS  were  seen  across  all  prognostic  categories  and  patient  subgroups, including patients who had received anthracyclines and/or taxanes for early breast cancer.
-  Multiple sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the primary PFS analysis.
-  The clinical benefit was supported by a superior ORR for capecitabine + bevacizumab treated patients  compared  with  those  treated  with  capecitabine +  placebo  (35.4%  vs.  23.6%).  The incidence of PD as best OR, an indication of the ineffectiveness of treatment, was lower in the combination arm (14.8% vs. 27.3%).
-  OS numerically favoured the bevacizumab-containing arm, as measured by both the hazard ratio (HR 0.88; 95% CI [0.69 to 1.13]) and the medians (capecitabine + placebo: 22.8 months, capecitabine + bevacizumab: 25.7 months).
- o Overall more patients who received bevacizumab were alive at 1 year (1-year survival: 81.0%) than with chemotherapy alone (1-year survival: 74.8%).
- o There was no increase in treatment-related deaths or deaths overall in women treated with capecitabine + bevacizumab versus capecitabine + placebo.
- o Sensitivity analyses have shown that the 62% crossover of control arm patients in this study could have had the effect of appreciably diluting the magnitude of the OS benefit that might have been observed in the absence of crossover.

## Ground No 2

The MAH disagreed with the ground of refusal No 2 for the following reasons:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  In  contrast  to  the  capecitabine  cohort  in  the  first-line  Study  AVF3694g,  Study  AVF2119g enrolled a heterogeneous population of patients with more advanced chemotherapy-resistant or refractory disease in the first to third-line and later line setting.
-  The refractory nature of the population of patients enrolled in Study AVF2119g was reflected in the inadequate response to capecitabine alone, as shown by the low objective response rate.
-  Given the substantial differences in the patient populations enrolled in studies AVF2119g and AVF3694g, it is not considered appropriate to compare the efficacy results of the two trials.
-  It  is  more  appropriate  to  make  a  comparison  to  Study  AVF3693g  which  indicated  that  the combination  of  bevacizumab  and  capecitabine  is  efficacious  as  second-line  treatment  of patients with mBC.

## Ground No 3

The  MAH  stated  that  the  safety  profile  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  capecitabine  in  study AVF3694g was generally consistent with the well-established profile observed in the more than 90,000 women who have been treated with bevacizumab worldwide for mBC, and as described in the currently approved Avastin SmPC:

-  The  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  capecitabine  does  not  add  unexpected  toxicities  in  patients with previously untreated mBC.  The most common  adverse  events observed in the capecitabine  +  bevacizumab  arm  were  hypertension,  proteinuria,  and  sensory  neuropathy. (Note: palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), a common side effect associated with the use of capecitabine, was most likely reported as sensory neuropathy in this study).
-  The  incidence  of  hypertension  was,  as  expected,  higher  in  the  capecitabine  +  bevacizumab arm.  The  maximum  grade  of  hypertension  observed  in  this  study  was  Grade  3  and characterized  as  asymptomatic,  manageable  with  routine  clinical  intervention  and  allowed continuation of bevacizumab and capecitabine administration.
-  Severe  safety  events  known  to  be  associated  with  bevacizumab  were  either  not  observed (gastrointestinal  perforation),  or  occurred  at  a  low  incidence  and  at  a  rate  similar  to  the capecitabine  +  placebo  arm  (arterial  thromboembolic  events  (ATE):  2.0%  vs.  1.5%,  venous thromboembolic  events  (VTE):  5.0%  vs.  3.5%)  and  similar  to  the  known  safety  profile  of bevacizumab.
-  Adverse events that are common to cytotoxic chemotherapy, such as haematological toxicity or  alopecia  were  infrequently  or  not  observed  in  patients  who  were  randomized  to  the capecitabine cohort of AVF3694g.
-  The  incidence  of  adverse  events  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation  was  similar  in  both treatment arms, and the incidence of discontinuation due to hypertension or proteinuria was very low.
-  The overall number of deaths was lower in the bevacizumab-containing arm and there was no increase in treatment-related deaths with bevacizumab treatment.

In conclusion, the combination of bevacizumab and capecitabine was generally well tolerated as firstline  treatment  for  patients  with  mBC.  The  study  population  comprised  approximately  40%  of anthracycline and taxane adjuvant pre-treated patients; a patient population where treatment choice is driven  primarily  by  efficacy  considerations,  which  is  in  contrast  to  the  assertion  of  the  CHMP  that capecitabine  treatment  is  primarily  for  a  patient  population  for  whom  a  more  tolerable  regimen  is preferred.

## Ground No 4

The choice of chemotherapy to use in patients as first-line treatment for mBC is based upon multiple clinical,  biologic,  and  patient-specific  factors.  These  factors  include  disease,  hormone  and  HER2 receptor status, the patient's disease-free interval from adjuvant treatment, type of prior treatment and presence of residual toxicity from previous therapy, sites of disease, pace of disease progression, presence  or  absence  of  symptoms,  treatment  priority,  anticipated  tolerance  to  treatment,  and  comorbid conditions that would dictate choice of treatment and last but not least patient's preference.

Among the many chemotherapy agents available, capecitabine is an attractive option for patients given its ease of administration via the oral route, lack of alopecia, manageable and reversible toxicities, and infrequent  myelosuppression.  Because  of  its  proven  efficacy  and  safety  profile,  capecitabine  is considered  appropriate  in  particular  for  patients  who  have  received  both  anthracycline  and  taxane based chemotherapy for early breast cancer, patients with slowly growing progressive disease, those who  prefer  oral  chemotherapy  treatment,  patients  who  elect  to  avoid  alopecia,  those  who  cannot tolerate  myelosuppressive  treatment  or  are  intolerant  of  cumulative  toxicity  and  elderly  patients  or those who are less fit.

From  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  data  presented  above,  the  MAH  is  of  viewpoint  that  the  clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in PFS supported by an improvement of basically all efficacy parameters together with a well-characterized and manageable safety profile supports the positive  benefit-risk  balance  for  the  combination  of  bevacizumab  with  capecitabine  as  an  important treatment option for patients in the first-line mBC setting.

## Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination

The  CHMP  opinion  remained  negative  regarding  the previous  proposed  indication  for  first-line treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer  in  whom  other  chemotherapy  options  are  'not preferred'.

The CHMP considered that the indication should be more rigorously defined since preference alone is not informative in guiding patient selection and does not necessarily identify patients for whom other treatment options including taxanes and anthracyclines are not available. The CHMP maintained that in a population where patient characteristics allowed treatment options including taxanes and anthracyclines, the benefit-risk of bevacizumab plus capecitabine combination could not be considered positive.

However,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  there  is  a  population  in  whom  treatment  with  other chemotherapy  options  including  taxanes  or  anthracyclines  is  not  considered  appropriate.  The  CHMP considered that capecitabine was an acceptable treatment choice and comparator in the subgroup of patients who are not candidates for more aggressive chemotherapy including taxanes or anthracyclines. Such  patients  include  those  who  may  have  received  anthracyclines  and  taxanes  in  the  adjuvant treatment setting, who are unlikely to tolerate myelosuppressive treatment, or who are intolerant of cumulative toxicity, elderly patients, or patients with slow-growing disease. Based on this and the data provided, the CHMP agreed that it can be concluded that a clear effect in terms of PFS is seen with the addition of bevacizumab to capecitabine.

Therefore the indication was amended to exclude patients eligible for treatment including taxanes or anthracyclines,  as  follows:  '' Avastin  in  combination  with  capecitabine  is  indicated  for  first-line treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer  in  whom  treatment  with  other  chemotherapy options including taxanes or anthracyclines is not considered appropriate. Patients who have received

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## taxane and anthracycline-containing regimens in the adjuvant setting within the last 12 months should be excluded from treatment with Avastin in combination with capecitabine ''.

The CHMP discussed the clinical relevance of the 2.9 months difference observed in median PFS in this population in AVF3694g (Ribbon-1) trial. The CHMP concluded that this difference was still modest but that  the  clinical  relevance  of  this  effect  needs  to  be  assessed  in  the  context  of  the  benefit-risk evaluation  in  this  population  for  which  there  are  limited  alternative  treatment  options.  In  terms  of other clinically relevant endpoints, the CHMP acknowledged that a detrimental effect in terms of overall survival was unlikely.

The  single  pivotal  trial  AVF3694g  (Ribbon-1)  conducted  was  sufficiently  robust  to  allow  drawing meaningful  conclusions  in  the  revised  proposed  indication.  In  particular,  the  effect  observed  for bevacizumab+capecitabine was considered to be consistent across subgroups and robust to different assumptions explored in sensitivity analyses. The CHMP agreed that the lack of supportive data from study AVF2119g due to the more advanced population included (second and third-line treatment) was no longer considered as a major pitfall in view of the robustness of the pivotal trial and the clear effect seen in terms of PFS.

The overall incidence of reported AEs was higher in the combination arm (40.1%) compared to the placebo arm (26.9%). Particularly, the incidences of hypertension, peripheral sensory neuropathy and proteinuria  were  increased.  However, there were no major differences between treatment groups in terms  of  SAEs  or  deaths  unrelated  to  disease  progression.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  despite  the toxicity associated with bevacizumab in combination with capecitabine is significant, it is outweighed by  a  sufficient  clinical  relevance  in  terms  of  PFS  for  this  restricted  population  and  therefore  its acceptability has to be assessed in the context of the benefit-risk balance for this restricted population.

Patients with metastatic breast cancer in whom treatment with other chemotherapy options including taxanes  or  anthracyclines  is  not  considered  appropriate  have  limited  therapeutic  options.  In  this population,  the  modest  effect  observed  with  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  capecitabine  may  be considered of sufficient clinical relevance as it is expected to be associated with benefits in terms of symptom control.  Although  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  resulted  in  increased  toxicity,  this  was  not considered  a  major  concern  in  view  of  the  clinically  relevant  effect  in  this  population  with  limited alternative  treatment  options.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  in  the indication  of  patients  with metastatic  breast  cancer  in  whom  treatment  with  other  chemotherapy  options  including  taxanes  or anthracyclines  is  not  considered  appropriate  the  grounds  for  negative  opinion  no  longer  hold.  The CHMP concluded  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  capecitabine  as first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer,  in  whom  treatment  with  other chemotherapy options including taxanes or anthracyclines is not considered appropriate, is considered positive.

## Congestive heart failure (CHF) (see section 4.8)

Events  consistent  with  CHF  were  reported  in  clinical  trials.  The  symptoms  findings  ranged  from asymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction to symptomatic CHF, requiring treatment or hospitalisation. Caution should be exercised when  treating patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as pre-existing coronary artery disease, or congestive heart failure with Avastin. Most of  the  patients  who  experienced  CHF  had  metastatic  breast  cancer  and  had  received  previous treatment with anthracyclines, prior radiotherapy to the left chest wall or other risk factors for CHF, such as pre-existing coronary heart disease or concomitant cardiotoxic therapy were present. In  patients  in  AVF3694g  who  received  treatment  with  anthracyclines  and  who  had  not  received anthracyclines  before,  no  increased  incidence  of  all  grade  CHF  was  observed  in  the  anthracycline  + bevacizumab group compared to the treatment with anthracyclines only. CHF grade 3 or higher events were somewhat more frequent among patients receiving bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy than in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. This is consistent with results in patients in  other  studies  of  metastatic  breast  cancer  who  did  not  receive  concurrent  anthracycline  treatment (see section 4.8).

## Congestive heart failure (CHF)

In  clinical  trials  with  Avastin,  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF)  was  observed  in  all  cancer  indications studied  to  date,  but  occurred  predominantly  in  patients  with  metastatic  breast  cancer.  In  two  four phase III trials  (AVF2119g, and E2100, BO17708 and AVF3694g) in patients with metastatic breast cancer an increase of CHF Grade 3 or more higher was reported in up to 3.5% of patients treated with Avastin was seen in combination with chemotherapy compared with up to 0.9% in the control arms. For  patients in  study  AVF3694g  who  received  anthracyclines  concomitantly  with  bevacizumab,  the incidences of grade 3 or higher CHF for the respective bevacizumab and control arms were similar to those in the other studies in metastatic breast cancer: 2.9% in the anthracycline + bevacizumab arm and 0% in the anthracycline + placebo arm. In addition, in study AVF3694g the incidences of all grade CHF were similar between the anthracycline + Avastin (6.2%) and the anthracycline + placebo arms (6.0%).

Most patients of these who developed CHF during mBC trials showed improved symptoms and/or left ventricular function following appropriate medical therapy.

## AVF3694g

Study  AVF3694g  was  a  Phase  III,  multicentre,  randomised,  placebo-controlled  trial  designed  to evaluate the efficacy and  safety of Avastin  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  compared  to chemotherapy plus placebo as first-line treatment for patients with HER2-negative metastatic or locally recurrent breast cancer. Chemotherapy  was  chosen  at  the  investigator's  discretion  prior  to  randomization  in  a  2:1  ratio  to receive either chemotherapy plus GLYPH&lt;31&gt;Avastin or chemotherapy plusGLYPH&lt;31&gt; placebo. The choices of chemotherapy included capecitabine, taxane (protein-bound paclitaxel, docetaxel), and anthracyclinebased agents (doxorubicin/ cyclophosphamide, epirubicin/ cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil/ doxorubicin/ cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide) given every three weeks (q3w). Avastin or placebo was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg q3w. This study included a blinded treatment phase, an optional open-label post-progression phase, and a survival  follow-up  phase.  During  the  blinded  treatment  phase,  patients  received  chemotherapy  and study drug (Avastin or placebo) every 3 weeks until disease progression, treatment-limiting toxicity, or death. On documented disease progression, patients who entered the optional open-label phase could receive open-label Avastin together with a wide-range of second line therapies. Statistical  analyses  were  performed  independently  for  1)  patients  who  received  capecitabine  in combination with Avastin or placebo; 2) patients who received taxane-based or anthracycline-based chemotherapy in combination with Avastin or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was PFS by investigator  assessment.  In  addition,  the  primary  endpoint  was  also  assessed  by  an  independent review committee (IRC). The  results  of  this  study  from  the  final  protocol  defined  analyses  for  progression  free  survival  and response rates for the independently powered capecitabine cohort of Study AVF3694g are presented in Table 9. Results from an exploratory overall survival analysis which include an additional 7 months of follow-up  (approximately  46%  of  patients  had  died)  are  also  presented.  The  percentage  of  patients who  received  Avastin  in  the  open-label  phase  was  62.1%  in  the  capecitabine  +  placebo  arm  and 49.9% in the capecitabine + Avastin arm.
