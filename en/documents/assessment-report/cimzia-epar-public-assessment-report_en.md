## 2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that occurs in approximately 1% of the population. RA is more prevalent among women than men and usually  develops  in  the  fourth  or  fifth  decades  of  life.  RA  is  manifested  by  accumulation  and activation  of  several  cell  systems;  T-cells  with  release  of  T-cell  derived  cytokines;  B-cells  with subsequent  autoantibody  responses,  and  macrophage-  and  fibroblast-like  cells  which  produce  large amounts  of  proinflammatory  cytokines.  The  resulting  synovial  inflammation  underlies  the  cardinal manifestations  of  this  disease,  which  include  pain,  stiffness,  swelling,  and  tenderness  in  the  joints followed  by  cartilage  destruction,  bone  erosion,  and  subsequent  deformities,  resulting  in  impaired physical function. There may also be associated morbidity from nonarticular manifestations of RA, including fever, malaise, and pulmonary, ocular, and hematologic effects. Patients with RA experience a  shorter  life  expectancy  than  the  general  population,  and  the  increased  mortality  rates  in  RA  are associated with clinical disease activity. A large proportion of the excess mortality in persons with RA is related to cardiovascular disease.

Despite early disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and/or biological therapy, approximately  30-40%  of  patients  with  established  RA  fail  to  respond  adequately  either  to  nonbiologic  DMARDs and 50-60% of patients  fail  to  achieve  a  major  clinical  ACR  response  or  good EULAR response. Even among responders, the majority do not achieve remission. Therefore, there is a role for new biological therapies in the treatment of RA.

TNF α is  a  cytokine  with  multiple  biologic  actions,  including  protection  against  bacterial,  fungal, parasitic,  and  viral  infections,  modulation  of  cell  growth,  mediation  of  inflammatory  responses  and interaction  in  a  network  with  other  lymphokines  to  modulate  cells  involved  in  immune  response. TNF α has  been  implicated  in  autoimmune  and  inflammatory  diseases,  e.g.  in  the  pathogenesis  of rheumatoid arthritis where overproduction of TNF α causes synovial inflammation and proliferation in addition to degradation of articular cartilage and bone. Anti-TNF therapies are approved in the EU for the  treatment  of  e.g.  RA,  Crohn's  disease  (CD),  ulcerative  colitis,  ankylosing  spondylitis,  psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.

Certolizumab  pegol  (CDP870,  CZP),  the  drug  substance  of  Cimzia,  is  a  recombinant,  humanized, antibody Fab' fragment with specificity for human TNF α .  The Fab' fragment is manufactured in E. coli , purified, and conjugated via a maleimide group to polyethylene glycol (PEG) in order to extend its plasma half-life to that of the whole antibody. Certolizumab pegol is an inhibitor of TNF α .

Cimzia is a clear to opalescent, colourless to yellow sterile solution for injection containing 200 mg certolizumab pegol in one ml. The product is supplied in single-use, prefilled syringes containing 1 ml, i.e.  200 mg  certolizumab  pegol.  Excipients  are  sodium  acetate,  sodium  chloride  and  water  for injections; the pH of the solution is approximately 4.7.

The application for marketing authorization for Cimzia was a complete independent application for a new  active  substance  and  based  on  a  full  dossier.  The  assessment  has  taken  into  account  the recommendations provided in the relevant CHMP guideline within this area (Points to Consider on Clinical  Investigation  of  Medicinal  Products  other  than  NSAIDs  for  Treatment  of  Rheumatoid Arthritis; CPMP/EWP/556/95).

The indication initially claimed by the applicant and approved by the CHMP is:

'Cimzia, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for:

- the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response  to  disease-modifying  antirheumatic  drugs  including  methotrexate  has  been inadequate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cimzia,can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate.

Cimzia, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate.'

The recommended starting dose of Cimzia for adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 400 mg s.c. at weeks 0, 2 and 4, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg every 2 weeks.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

## Introduction

Certolizumab  pegol  (CDP870),  the  drug  substance  of  Cimzia  is  a  recombinant,  humanized  Fab' antibody  fragment  (CDP870  Fab')  covalently  bound  to  a  maleimido  terminated  bis-methoxypoly (ethylene  glycol)  modified  lysine,  PEG2MAL40K,  through  a  thioether  linkage.  The  linkage  of  the CDP870 Fab' to polyethylene glycol is introduced in order to extend its plasma half-life to that of the whole  antibody.  The  CDP870  Fab'  is  directed  against  TNF  (alpha)  and  neutralizes  the  biological activity  of  TNF α .  The  CDP870  Fab'  is  produced  in Escherichia  coli .  Following  purification  by standard  chromatographic  methods,  the  CDP870  Fab'  is  conjugated  to  PEG2MAL40K.  A  single molecule of PEG2MAL40K is covalently bound to each Fab' molecule. The resulting CDP870 Fab'PEG2MAL40K conjugate is further purified and formulated in acetate buffer at acidic pH to yield the Certolizumab pegol drug substance.

The development of CDP870 drug substance has encompassed various site, scale, and manufacturing process changes.

The drug product is  presented  as  a  liquid  formulation  containing  200  mg/ml  in  a  prefilled  syringe. Each prefilled syringe is intended for single use.

## PEG2MAL40K - Pegylation moiety

The  PEG2MAL40K  is  a  polymeric  substance  with  a  distribution  of  different  chain  lengths.  The PEG2MAL40K moiety comprises two 20 kDA PEG chains linked to a reactive maleimide group.

The manufacturing process has been adequately described and information on in-process controls is provided. The manufacturing process is considered sufficiently validated.

Control  of  materials  used  in  manufacture  has  been  adequately  described  and  specifications  for  all starting materials, solvents etc. are provided.

The  reference standard of PEG2MAL40K  has  been  adequately  characterised.  Impurities are satisfactorily described with respect to the origin of the impurity, fate of the impurity and analytical control.

The  specification  requirements  are  considered  adequate  and  the  related  methods  are  sufficiently described and validated.

The  batch  analysis  data  presented  meet  the  specifications  for  PEG2MAL40K  and  are  considered acceptable.

Sufficient stability data are submitted to justify the proposed shelf life. Stability studies are presented for the intermediate PEG2NHS40KP, which may be stored before further use in the manufacture of PEG2MAL40K. The proposed expiry date in the indicated package is considered acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The stability  studies on  PEG2MAL40K address three batches of each batch scale which have been stored  under  argon  and  air.  The  proposed  re-test  period  in  the  indicated  package  is  considered acceptable.

## Active Substance

## General information

The light chain of Certolizumab pegol is composed of 214 amino acid residues and the heavy chain is composed of 229 amino acid residues. The two chains are linked via a disulfide bond between the cysteine at position 214 on the light chain (the C-terminus) and the cysteine in position 221 on the heavy chain. The PEG2MAL40K moiety is a polydisperse mixture of an average molecular weight of 40,000 Da that is covalently bound to the CDP870 Fab' fragment through the C-terminus.

The  experimentally  determined  molecular  mass  of  CDP870  Fab'  is  approximately  47.8kDa.  The experimentally determined molecular mass of Certolizumab pegol is approximately 90.8 kDa, which is consistent with the addition of a single molecule of PEG2MAL40K per molecule of CDP870 Fab'.

By virtue  of  its  manufacture  in Escherichia coli ,  CDP870 Fab' is  not  glycosylated.  No  N-terminal heterogeneity  has  been  identified;  neither  heavy  nor  light  chains  appear  to  be  blocked  at  the  Nterminus. C-terminal heterogeneity of both the heavy and light chains of CDP870 Fab' is minimal due to the positioning of the cysteine residues required for interchain disulfide bond and for PEGylation.

- Manufacture

## Manufacturer

CDP870 Drug Substance is manufactured by Sandoz GmbH in Kundl, Austria.

## Genetic development

The generation and control of the expression plasmid is described in sufficient detail. CDP870 is a humanized  Fab'  version  of  the  murine  HTNF40  antibody,  which  binds  to  human  TNF α and  is  a potent neutralizer of TNF activity. Detailed flow charts of the construction of the expression plasmid are provided. Expression is under control of the tac promoter.

## Cell Banking

Cell banks of an E.coli strain were manufactured using media that are free from material of human and animal origin. The generation of the producer cell line, the master cell bank (MCB) and the master working cell banks (MWCB) is adequately described. In addition, data on the characterisation of the producer  cell  line  and  the  cell  banks  used  in  production  are  considered  satisfactory  in  general. Acceptable protocols for the preparation and control of new MWCBs are included in the dossier.

## Genetic stability

Testing  of  end-of-production  cells  (EOP)  and  post-production  cell  bank  (PPCB)  was  performed  to establish the genetic stability and robustness of the fermentation process. Analysis of copy numbers (copies/cell) from sub-cultured cells or directly from vials, plasmid retention, retention of expression construct, restriction digest and DNA sequence (post production cell bank) are sufficiently described.

Overall, acceptable information has been provided on genetics development, genetic stability and cell bank stability.

## Cell culture and purification

The cell culture and purification process are documented in detail and a flow chart has been submitted.

Briefly, the CDP870 Drug Substance is produced during specific manufacturing campaigns, in which the Fab' is extracted, purified, and PEGylated. Manufacture is divided into steps grouped into three main areas which reflect the major activities: fermentation, primary isolation, and purification/PEGylation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  conclusion,  the  drug  substance  manufacturing  process  is  described  in  great  detail,  including information  on  the  control  of  temperature,  the  acceptable  range  for  operational  controls,  the compositions of buffers and media used, as well as the identification of in-process control tests and the specification/action limits by which they are controlled. Acceptable in-process controls are in place throughout the CDP870 drug substance manufacturing process.

Conditions for storage of process intermediates have been defined and the maximum time of storage has been specified.

## Validation

The  drug  substance  manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately  validated  demonstrating  that  the purification process consistently produces drug substance of reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined specification and in-process tests.

The studies conducted for validation of the production process are in most respects both well designed and reported. For those parts that refer to the identification and control of critical steps supplementary validation  reports  have  been  provided,  giving  satisfactory  support  to  both,  the  in-process  control system applied and the proposed operation ranges.

## Manufacturing process development

The development of CDP870 Drug Substance has encompassed various site, scale, and manufacturing process changes. The majority of the process changes have been associated with the primary recovery and downstream processing stages in an effort to increase the recovery of Fab', to increase the purity of  the  final  CDP870  Drug  Substance,  and  to  accommodate  differences  in  various  Drug  Product formulations (e.g., protein concentration, final formulation buffer, pH).

There  are  in  total  nine  CDP870  Drug  Substance  manufacturing  processes  which  are  considered comparable with regard to consistency of manufacture and with regard to the quality and stability of CDP870 Drug Substance produced.

Detailed  information  on  each  of  the  nine  processes  in  way  of  manufacturing  process  description including  information  on  animal-derived  raw  materials;  analytical  methods  and  specifications; summary  of  process  batches;  stability  data  and  comparability  in  way  of  comparison  of  stability profiles,  release  testing  and  additional  analytical  characterisation  of  the  process  vs.  the  previous process is provided.

Process 9 was used for the production of CDP870 Drug Substance, 200 mg/mL (acetate buffer, pH 4.7) for Phase III clinical studies, ICH stability studies, and has been subject of the process validation data.

## Characterisation

An exhaustive characterisation of CDP870 Fab' and CDP870 drug substance has been conducted on material  representative  of  the  commercial  process (Process  9; acetate  buffer,  pH  4.7), revealing  the structure  of  CDP870  Fab'  and  drug  substance  as  well  as  product-related  substances,  product-  and process-related impurities. Supporting characterisation data from Process 8 (lactate buffer, pH 5.0) and from the characterization of reference standards were provided. The methods used are considered as state of the art.

The structural and functional characteristics of CDP870 drug substance have been investigated using a wide variety of analytical tools including amino acid analysis, N-terminal sequencing, MALDI-TOF mass  spectrometry,  enzymatic  and  chromatographic  methods,  physical  analyses,  and  binding  and neutralization assays. In addition, forced degradation studies have been performed on CDP870 Drug Substance.  Product  related  impurities  have  been  studied  by  a  range  of  methods  including  RPHPLC/Isoquant-reaction, Peptide Mapping, RP-HPLC, CX-HPLC, and SE-HPLC.

Comparability  studies  have  been  performed  between  materials  for  product  in  the  lyophilized  and liquid  formulation.  The  comparability  studies  included  both  drug  substance  and  drug  product,  and consisted of side-by-side comparison of release data, results from the extended characterisation and stability data. In these studies, no significant difference was detected between drug substance in the lactate and the acetate formulation. However, as could be expected from the change in formulation, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

amounts of acidic and basic species are increased in the liquid formulation. These were classified by the applicant as product-related substances.

## · Specification

## Specifications

The specifications are adequately set and justified based on 3 standard deviations around the mean of release data of all batches used in the phase III clinical trials. The stability data indicates that there is no change on long term storage for CDP870 Drug Substance and hence a separate end of shelf- life specification has not been applied. The proposed release specifications have either been tightened or are  the  same  as  those  applied  to  the  phase  III  clinical  trial  material.  The  release  specifications  are considered acceptable. Product-related substances and impurities as well as process-related impurities are adequately controlled.

## Analytical methods

All analytical methods for release testing of drug substance are adequately described. The use of the analytical methods in analyses of drug substance in the acetate formulation is generally satisfactorily validated.  Concerns  that  were  raised  on  the  control  in  performance  of  the  potency  assay,  and  the sensitivity of the CEX-HPLC analyses have been satisfactorily addressed.

## Reference standard

The reference material is adequately characterised. However, the current standard was derived from the previous process (lactate-formulation) and a new Primary Reference, sourced from a commercially released lot of CDP870 Drug Substance (acetate), will be created and qualified in accordance with the procedure presented in the dossier (see section 2.7).

## Batch data

Extensive  batch  analysis  data  from  more  than  30  batches  produced  in  process  8  and  9  have  been provided. The data show that the proposed manufacturing process is capable of consistently producing drug substance.

## Container closure system

The container closure system for CDP870 drug substance is sufficiently described.

- Stability

Adequate stability data were submitted to justify the proposed shelf life of the drug substance when stored  at  -70°C  ±10 ° C.  The  stability  of  the  drug  substance  has  been  extensively  investigated  on supportive and pivotal long-term stability batches. In general, results at all time points tested conform to the shelf-life specification and the data presented do not show a trend in degradation of the drug substance. The post approval stability protocol is acceptable.

## Medicinal Product

## Composition and container closure system

CDP870 Drug Product is presented as a Solution for Injection, in a graduated 1 mL glass Pre-Filled Syringe (PFS), containing 1 mL of 200 mg/ml drug substance.

The excipients used in the formulation of the drug product are of pharmacopoeial quality. There are no excipients of human/animal origin in the drug product.

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The liquid formulation development has been thoroughly described and the rationale for the selection of the formulation and container configuration has been adequately addressed and justified. During the pre-clinical  and  clinical  studies  several  changes  in  manufacturing  site  and  batch  size  have  been

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

introduced.  Besides  the  use  of  different  drug  substance  concentrations  and  fill  volumes,  the  major changes  in  development  refer  to  the  alternative  use  of  a  liquid  and  a  lyophilised  formulation.  The commercial process for production of the liquid formulation in pre-filled syringes was developed in 2007.  These  changes  are  considered  well  described  and  adequate  comparability  studies  have  been performed.

## · Manufacture of the Product

## Manufacturer

The  drug  product  is  manufactured  by  Vetter  Pharma-Fertigung  GmbH  &amp;  Co.  KG,  Langenargen, Germany.

## Manufacturing process

The drug product manufacturing process is described in sufficient detail including information on the control in operation, the compounding, filling and lyophilisation steps. Manufacture of drug product employs  a  straightforward  process  including  conventional  steps  for  compounding,  sterile  filtration, aseptic filling and stoppering. The critical steps are defined and controlled.

## Process validation

Process  Validation  consisted  of  three  consecutive  batches  covering  the  approximate  minimum  and maximum  batch  size.  The  validation  of  the  entire  process  was  achieved  through  the  consecutive execution  of  three  batches  according  to  the  established  master  batch  record  and  ancillary  process validation  studies  including:  manufacturing  support  validation,  equipment  validation  and  cleaning validation.

## · Product Specification

## Product Specification

The selected  parameters  to  control  the  drug  product  have  been  adequately  justified  and  the  release specifications are set reasonably tight.

## Analytical methods

All methods for release testing of the drug product have been adequately described and are validated. The proposed limits are considered acceptable.

## Batch data

Batch analysis data from eight batches of Cimzia in pre-filled syringes produced at the commercial manufacturing site confirm the consistency of the drug product manufacture.

## · Stability of the Product

The stability data submitted sufficiently justify the shelf life declared in the product information. The stability of the drug product has been extensively investigated on supportive and commercial batches and based on the available data the Company originally claimed a shelf life of 24 months for drug product  stored  at  +5  +  3°C.  In  response  to  the  concerns  raised  on  whether  all  future  batches  will remain within the approved specifications over the entire product lifetime, the applicant has reviewed the stability data and proposes a revised shelf life of 18 months which is considered acceptable.

The post approval stability protocol is acceptable. The applicant commits to place at least one batch of the drug product in long term stability study per year.

## · Adventitious Agents

The  non-viral  safety  of  Cimzia  is  considered  to  be  assured  based  on  the  precautions  taken  under manufacturing, the testing of raw materials and process steps.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The drug substance production substrate is bacterial in origin and is considered unlikely to be capable of supporting the propagation of adventitious viral contaminants.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

In general, the different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with  existing  guidelines.  The  documentation  provided  with  the  application  demonstrates  consistent batch-to-batch production of Cimzia achieving a consistent quality for the drug substance and the drug product.  The  fermentation,  purification  and  pegylation  of  the  drug  substance,  Certolizumab  pegol (CDP870),  are  adequately  controlled  and  validated.  The  drug  substance  has  been  extensively characterised  with  regard  to  its  physicochemical  and biological  characteristics  using  state-of  the-art methods. The manufacturing process of the drug product has been described and validated in sufficient detail. In addition, the viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents (including TSE) have been sufficiently assured. In general, appropriate drug substance and drug product specifications have been set.

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The  non-clinical  development  strategy  for  certolizumab  pegol  was  based  on  the  pharmacological activity/selectivity of the molecule and the intended (s.c.) clinical route of administration. Based on the species specificity of target binding, the cynomolgus monkey has been selected as the main species for  toxicity  testing.  The  non-clinical  programme  meets  the  requirements  of  relevant  with  EU/ICH guidelines.

In non-clinical studies material derived from  different manufacturing  processes  and  different formulations  (initial  liquid  formulation,  lyophilised  formulation)  have  been  used;  none  of  the  nonclinical studiesy wereas performed with a batch from the process intended for marketing (new liquid formulation). In a new comparability studies submitted for the RA indication, no difference was seen between the first and second generation (new clinical liquid formulation) manufacturing processes of certolizumab pegol when binding to TNF α and  competitive binding with human TNF receptor 1 to TNF α was evaluated. Also, in vivo (mouse model), no difference in neutralisation potency was seen between these materials.

The toxicology program included studies of single and repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, developmental toxicity, and local tolerance. Within each area, main studies were done in compliance with GLP, including toxicokinetic data.

## Pharmacology

- Primary pharmacodynamics

Certolizumab pegol binds soluble human TNF α (hTNF α ) with high affinity (KD ~90 pM). Binding to transmembrane hTNF α was also shown. Certolizumab pegol neutralised hTNF α in the L929 cell assay (IC90  4  ng/ml).  It  also  inhibited  lipopolysaccaride  (LPS)-induced  release  of  cytokines in  vitro (IC 50 0.1-0.2 ng/ml). Certolizumab pegol did not bind TNF α from rodents, rabbit, guinea pigs and dog, but it  inhibited  TNF α from  non-human  primates,  with  at  least  a  1000-fold  lower  activity  than  against hTNF α . The cynomolgus monkey was selected for toxicity testing and the IC90 (L929 cell assay or a monkey fibroblast assay) for TNF α in this species was 100 - 362 µg/ml. Data on interactions with the TNF α receptors (p55 and p75) are sparse, and preclude an estimation of actual potency.

The pharmacology of certolizumab pegol has been compared to other licensed anti-TNF α reagents, namely  the  whole  immunoglobulins  infliximab  and  adalimumab  as  well  as  the  Fc-fused  soluble receptor  etanercept.  BIAcore  determined  rank  order  of  binding  affinities  for  soluble  recombinant human  TNF α (rhuTNF α ) was: etanercept (33.2  pM),  certolizumab  pegol (86.4 -91.5  pM), adalimumab (158.3 pM) and infliximab (228.7 pM). All anti-TNF α reagents were potent neutralizers

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of  soluble  and  membrane  rhuTNF α .  Certolizumab  pegol,  infliximab  and  adalimumab  completely inhibited the LPS-driven production of TNF α and IL-1 β by the human monocytic cell line MM6 and primary monocytes in the in vitro system used, whereas etanercept only partially inhibited this effect.

Certolizumab pegol was studied in two in vivo models where normal mice or rabbits were challenged with hTNF α .  In  these  models, certolizumab pegol inhibited hTNF α induced effects. Effective doses ranged from 3-3000 µ g/kg. certolizumab pegol also protected against development of arthritis in one transgenic mouse, serving as a disease model for polyarthritis, at 10 and 30 mg/kg

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

## CDC and ADCC measurements

In  contrast  to  other  anti-TNF  agents,  certolizumab  pegol  lacks  an  Fc  fragment  and  is  therefore expected to also lack effector functions. TNF6.5 cells were used as the target cells and rabbit serum was  used  as  the  source  of  complement  for  the  assessment  of  complement  dependent  cytotoxicity (CDC).  Cytotoxicity  was  assessed  by  uptake  of  the  vital  stain,  PI  and  by  the  release  of  LDH. Antibody-dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  induced  by  the  anti-TNF α reagents  was determined  by  incubating  target  TNF6.5  cells  and  PBMC-derived  effector  cells  in  RPMI  1640  on plates with various concentrations of the anti-TNF α reagents. As expected, certolizumab pegol did not induce either complement or cell-mediated lysis of target cells bearing TNF α .

## Apoptosis induction

In  a  comparative in  vitro studies  performed by the applicant, certolizumab pegol did not cause any increase in cells exhibiting an apoptotic phenotype while for other anti-TNF agents a concentrationdependent  increase  was  observed.  Similar  observations  were  made  in  neutrophil  survival  and degranulation tests.

- Safety pharmacology programme

Two in vitro GLP safety pharmacology studies have been conducted:

In a standard in vitro human tissue cross reactivity study, 3 and 10 µ g/ml of certolizumab pegol did not result in any unexpected binding. A cynomolgus monkey cross reactivity study was not performed.

A  blood  compatibility  study  evaluated  the  compatibility  of  certolizumab  pegol  with  human  whole blood, plasma and serum. In vitro , certolizumab pegol did not cause haemolysis of whole blood from healthy donors, but dose-related erythrocyte clumping (from 0.33 mg/ml) and opalescence of plasma and serum (at 33 mg/ml). The NOEL for erythrocyte clumping (0.033 mg/ml) is below clinical plasma levels.

No in  vivo safety  pharmacology  studies  have  been  conducted  with  certolizumab  pegol,  however monitoring of potential undesirable pharmacological activity was incorporated in both the repeat dose toxicity  studies  and  single  dose  Phase  1  clinical  studies.  The  lack  of  formal  non-clinical  safety pharmacology studies are justified by the absence of any cross-reactivity of certolizumab pegol with human tissues and the lack of effect of certolizumab pegol on the safety pharmacology parameters assessed in repeat dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys and in the Phase 1 clinical studies.

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with certolizumab pegol. The  applicant  justified  the  lack  of  data  by  arguing  that  no  potential  pharmacodynamic  drug interactions at the p55 and p75 TNF receptor level are considered likely, as certolizumab pegol should not be used with other anti-TNF α agents.

## Pharmacokinetics

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Certolizumab pegol is pharmacologically active in cynomolgus monkeys. Therefore, pivotal pharmacokinetic  studies  were  conducted  in  this  species.  Additional  data  were  generated  early  in development in the rat, a species in which certolizumab pegol is not pharmacologically active

Analyses of certolizumab pegol and anti-certolizumab pegol antibodies were made by ELISAs. The presence of certolizumab pegol in plasma interferes with the antibody analyses, and vice versa, which reduces  the  reliability  of  the  pharmacokinetic  data  and  the  possibility  to  detect  antibodies  against certolizumab  pegol.  Analysis  of  the  PEG  moiety  was  performed  in  blood  and  urine  using  a  NMR assay. The method identified PEG covalently bound to the Fab' fragment as well as 40 kDa PEG (i.e. the isolated PEG component).

In  cynomolgus  monkeys,  certolizumab  pegol  appeared  to  have  roughly  linear  pharmacokinetics. Although  not  formally  studied,  bioavailability  after  s.c.  administration  was  estimated  to  be  nearly complete. Addition of 40 kDa PEG to the Fab' fragment increases the elimination half-life and AUC when compared to the Fab' fragment alone or the Fab' added a 25 kDa PEG chain. The T½ was 8.510.5  days  after  repeated  dosing.  The  presence  of  anti-CDP870  antibodies  appeared  to  result  in shortened T½ values. If antibodies were neutralising is unknown.

In  a  distribution  study,  presence  of  the  PEG  component  was  shown  in  all  analysed  tissues  (liver, spleen,  kidneys,  heart,  lungs,  brain  and  mesenteric  lymph  nodes)  following  administration  of certolizumab pegol and the rat equivalent cTNF3 PF to rats. The highest level of PEG was detected in the liver (7% of the dose administered). There was no indication of tissue uptake of PEG, associated with binding to membrane bound TNF alpha.

Due to the protein nature of the Fab' fragment, it is expected to undergo proteolysis and excretion via the urine. Limited data from SDS-PAGE analyses indicate that only 40 kDa material can be identified in the urine of rats. Thus, it appears that the Fab' is catabolised prior to excretion of the 2 x 20 kDa PEG  chains  linked  via  a  lysine  residue.  The  metabolic  fate  of  the  maleimide  linker  is  less  clear. Following administration of 400 mg/kg/week certolizumab pegol sc to rats for 12 weeks, the terminal T½ for PEG was 24 days. The cumulative excretion was 65% in urine, and the total recovery (urine + feces) was 83%. Analyses of tissues from rats given a single 100 mg/kg dose showed similar clearance from tissues and urine.

cTN3 PF, a chimeric mouse/hamster PEGylated Fab' fragment that binds rat TNF α which was used for testing of reproductive toxicity, showed negligible placental transfer and milk excretion in rats. It was  not  detected  in  plasma  of  nursing  pups.  cTN3 γ 1,  the  parental  complete  antibody  binding  rat TNF α , passed the placenta to some extent (15%), and was excreted in milk (24%).

## Toxicology

## Species specificity

The cynomolgus monkey was selected as the main species for toxicity testing. In vitro , certolizumab pegol was at least 3,500 to 33,000 times less potent against TNF α from cynomolgus than human (IC90 of  362  and  0.1  µg/ml  in  the  monkey  fibroblast  assay  or  IC 90 100,000  and  3  ng/ml  in  the  murine fibroblast assay, respectively). Furthermore, distribution / tissue cross reactivity data for certolizumab pegol in the cynomolgus are lacking. Thus, certolizumab pegol was considerably less potent in binding monkey TNF α than human, and the excess of the plasma levels above IC90 for TNF α is  10,000-fold higher in patients than in the monkey studies. These facts may question the relevance of this model to fully identify effects related to inhibition of TNF α . Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that plasma levels in monkeys were above the IC90 for monkey TNF α and the plasma concentrations obtained resulted in saturation of membrane TNF α binding as well as binding of soluble TNF α . Furthermore, the clinical safety profile is considered adequately well established from experience with other anti-TNF α agents, and therefore these limitations are accepted.

In  terms of the PEG-component, data in both the rat and monkey are of value. One concern of the CHMP related to  the  certolizumab  pegol  construct  and  the  question  whether  binding  to  membrane bound TNF α may lead to targeted exposure of certain cells to the PEG component and whether such

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

potential effects would have been adequately covered by the available non-clinical data. The Applicant provided  data  supporting  that  the  majority  of  cell  uptake  is  not  antigen  dependent  and  that certolizumab  pegol  saturated  membrane-bound  TNF α on  different  cell  types  from  human  and cynomolgus monkey in a similar manner and at concentrations below those achieved in the toxicity studies.

A list of pivotal toxicology studies conducted with certolizumab pegol or its analogue, cTN3 PF, is presented in Table 1.

- Single dose toxicity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cynomolgus monkeys were given a single i.v. infusion of 50, 100 or 400 mg certolizumab pegol/kg, and were observed for 28 days. There were no signs of overt toxicity or effects on general health of the animals. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 400 mg/kg..

The maximal exposure attained was approximately 200-fold higher than that observed at the maximal recommended  human  dose  (approximately  50 µ g/ml)  and  is  also  well  above  the  concentration  (10 µ g/ml) needed to neutralize the activity of cynomolgus monkey TNF α in vitro .

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

The pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies consisted of a 26-week repeat-dose toxicity study and a 52week immunotoxicity study, both performed in cynomolgus monkeys. The animals were administered 10 and 100 mg/kg/week s.c. certolizumab pegol and 50 and 100 mg/kg/week s.c. in the 26- and 52week study, respectively.

Decreases  in  platelets,  white  and  red  blood  cells  were  found  in  the  52-week  study.  Increases  in prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were observed in repeat i.v. dose studies conducted in monkeys and rats. APTT was also increased (30%) at both doses in the 52week  monkey  study.  The  Applicant  suggests  that  it  may  be  related  to  the  PEG  moiety,  based  on published  data.  In  an in  vitro study,  certolizumab  pegol  increased  APTT  in  monkey  plasma.  The lowest concentration tested (200 µg/ml) prolonged APTT and is 4-fold above the estimated clinical exposure.

In rats and monkeys histopathology revealed cellular vacuolation, present mainly in macrophages, in a number of organs (lymph nodes; injection sites, spleen; adrenal; uterine, cervix; choroid plexus of the brain, and in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus). These effects were partly reversible after 13 or 26  weeks  without  treatment.  There  were  no  other  morphological  changes  or  adverse  findings associated with the cell vacuolation in the tissues.

The presence of foamy macrophages in various organs is likely related to the PEG-component. In a set of in  vitro tests  with  this  PEG,  mouse  and  human  macrophage  viability,  and  some  other in  vitro parameters were generally not affected, but phagocytic ability was reduced for uptake of bacteria and fungi. The NOEL was 0.1 (Fab'PEG) and 1 mg/ml (PEG). Some inhibition of T-cell proliferation to toxoid challenge in a human cell system was seen (NOEL 1 mg/ml).

No effects on immune function were observed in the 52 weeks study. The reason why effects on the immune system similar to other anti-TNF agents were not seen with certolizumab pegol is unknown, but it may be suspected that there is a relation to the lower potency of certolizumab pegol for monkey than human TNF α .

Two low dose animals in the 52 weeks study had detectable antibodies, but the number of positive samples may be underestimated since the presence of certolizumab pegol in plasma interferes with antibody analyses.

- Genotoxicity

Certolizumab pegol displayed no genotoxic potential in a standard test battery. The PEG construct is not considered to pose genotoxic concern, and thus the data provided were considered sufficient.

- Carcinogenicity

No  conventional  carcinogenicity testing was  performed  with certolizumab pegol,  which  was acceptable  considering  the  nature  of  the  compound  and  the  lack  of  pharmacological  activity  and immunogenicity of certolizumab pegol in species normally used for such testing.

However, based on the current knowledge about TNF α in the context of malignancies/lymphoma, the concern related to long-term suppression of the immune function due to TNF α inhibition as well as

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

signals from clinical experience with the other anti-TNF α agents, the possible risk for the development of lymphomas or other malignancies in patients treated with TNF antagonists is reflected in the SPC and PL, and warrants post marketing surveillance.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Reproductive studies with certolizumab pegol have not been undertaken due to the lack of recognition of  rodent  TNF  and  immunogenicity  in  rats.  Instead,  the  homologous  agent  cTN3  PF,  which  is  a chimeric Fab' fragment conjugated to 40 kDa PEG, was tested in the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. The IC90 for cTN3 PF against rat TNF α was approximately 15 nM and KD was 6.7 nM. Expected pharmacological activity was shown in an arthritis model in the mouse at 100 mg/kg, while 10 and 30 mg/kg had minimal or lacked effects.

A standard package of reproductive toxicity studies in the rat was submitted. Doses used were 20/30 and 100 mg/kg twice weekly. In male rats, reduced sperm motility and a trend of reduced sperm count were observed at both doses. Testis weight was increased in rats at 100 mg/kg. There were no effects on  mating,  or  unexpected  macro/microscopic  findings.  In  female  rat  studies  covering  dosing throughout the complete reproductive cycle, there were no effects on fertility, reproductive function or developmental  effects  on  offspring.  Distribution  studies  have  demonstrated  that  placental  and  milk transfer of cTN3 PF is negligible.

In addition, reproductive/developmental toxicity data for a full antibody which inhibits rodent TNF, cTN3 γ 1, has been submitted. Administration of this compound resulted in some foetal exposure and exposure  of  offspring  via  milk.  Overall,  no  effects  on  female  fertility,  reproductive  function  or embryo-foetal and postnatal development were observed. As male fertility and sperm parameters were not studied, this is requested as a clinical follow up measure.

Although these data provide some support for lack of reproductive and developmental toxicity with certolizumab pegol, they are insufficient for recommendations on the use in women of child-bearing potential  and  in  pregnancy.  These  results  and  the  unknown  clinical  relevance  of  these  findings  are adequately  reflected in the Product  Information  (PI). A  clinical evaluation of the effect of certolizumab pegol treatment on male sperm quality has been agreed as a follow-up measure.

## · Toxicokinetic data

Toxicokinetic data from the 28 day cynomolgus monkey  i.v. study, indicated that plasma concentrations of certolizumab pegol increased from the first to the fourth dosing cycles. The half-life ranged from 3 to 9 days, as determined during the recovery phase. Mean plasma concentrations (end of  fourth  infusion)  in  this  study  for  the  50,  100  and  400  mg/kg  groups  were  1558,  2800  and 9825 µ g/mL, respectively.

- Local tolerance

Local tolerance in rats was studied after a single dose of 200 mg s.c. of certolizumab pegol as a liquid or lyophilized formulation. Rats were observed for 29 days. There were no overt signs of toxicity or effects on the general health of the animals. On Day 2, slight swelling and erythema at the injection site were common but were not seen on Day 8 post-injection. Mild subcutaneous oedema was noted at necropsy  on  Day  2  in  several  groups.  No  gross  findings  were  noted  at  8,  15,  and  29  days  postinjection.

No local toxicity was seen when comparing certolizumab pegol second generation formulation (new liquid clinical formulation) with certolizumab pegol first generation (manufactured using the original process) in rats. Data from the repeat dose toxicity studies in monkeys, where the formulation intended for marketing was used, also support acceptable local tolerance. The finding of foamy macrophages at the injection site should be noted.

## · Other toxicity studies

## Antigenicity

No  specific  antigenicity  studies  have  been  conducted  because  antigenicity  of  a  humanized  Fab'  in animals is not predictive of immunogenicity in man. Determinations of antibodies against certolizumab pegol have been performed in the general toxicity studies. The antibody incidence in the main monkey toxicity studies were 10-20%. It should be noted that the presence of CDP870 in the plasma  sample  interferes  with  the  antibody  analyses,  and  thus  data  are  uncertain.  Presence  of antibodies resulted in shortened t1/2. There were no apparent toxicological consequences of antibody formation.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

A program to assess the environmental risk of certolizumab pegol has been conducted.  In accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), an estimate of the crude predicted environmental concentrations  (PEC)  of  the  active  entity,  certolizumab  pegol,  in  the  aquatic  compartment was calculated. However, the nature of the product and subsequent metabolism indicates that such analysis is not appropriate for this product.

Certolizumab pegol is a humanised antibody Fab' fragment and as such can reasonable be expected to be subject to the same degradative pathways and to have the same environmental impact as naturally occurring  human  antibodies.  It  is  unlikely  that  any  pharmacologically  active  antibody  enters  the aquatic compartment. No adverse environmental impact is expected from excipients used in the finished product.

No other environmental concerns are apparent for certolizumab pegol drug product; certolizumab pegol is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients.

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

## Introduction

Certolizumab pegol, in combination with MTX, is intended for the treatment of moderate to severe, active RA in adult patients when the response to DMARDs, including MTX, has been inadequate.

The clinical programme for certolizumab pegol included three 24-week Phase 3 studies and one 52week Phase 3 study, and one Phase 2 dose-finding study. An overview of the clinical Phase 2 and Phase  3  programme  with  certolizumab  pegol  in  RA  is  given  in  (Table  2).  Long-term  data  were provided from a 104-week extension of this Phase 2 dose-ranging study and three open-label extension studies of the Phase 3 trials.

In the Phase 3studies CDP870-011, 014 and 027, a lyophilized formulation was used, while a liquid formulation,  the  proposed  commercial  form,  was  used  in  study  CDP870-050.  These  studies  were conducted  in  up  to  30  countries  across  various  geographic  regions  including  the  United  States, Western Europe, Central and Southern America, Russian, Baltic States and Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the community were carried out in accordance  with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC/

## Pharmacokinetics

The  clinical  pharmacokinetics  development  programs  of  certolizumab  pegol  (CZP)  includes  four healthy volunteer studies (CDP870-001, CDP870 003, PHA-024 and CDP870-038), and one study of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of certolizumab pegol in subjects with RA receiving methotrexate (MTX) (PHA-001).

The full pharmacokinetic profile of certolizumab pegol has only been characterised after single dose administration in healthy subjects. There are, however, a large number of sparse sampling data from the  pivotal  clinical  studies  that  have  been  used,  together  with  the  data  from  intensive  sampling schedule  in  the  healthy  volunteer  studies,  in  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis.  This  analysis contributes to the pharmacokinetic documentation, including estimations of pharmacokinetic parameters, evaluating special populations and interactions. The population PK model has been shown to have reasonable predictive properties and supports the current usage of the model.

A sandwich ELISA was used to determine the concentration of certolizumab pegol in plasma. This assay was validated for use in human plasma and this included a supplementary report on the stability of  certolizumab  pegol  in  human  plasma  at  -20°C  and  -70°C  for  up  to  2  years.  The  limit  of quantification (LOQ) was 4.1 ng/ml.

Anti-CZP  antibodies  were  determined  in  plasma  using  a  similar  validated  ELISA.  The  limit  of quantification  for  the  assay  is  0.06 µ g/ml.  Allowing  for  a  sample  dilution  of  1/10,  the  LOQ  for samples is 0.6 units/ml where one unit is equivalent to 1 µ g of the rabbit calibrator.

Residual certolizumab pegol in plasma samples will interfere in this assay. Data from Study CDP870004  (the  study  with  the  largest  amount  of  data  available  for  evaluation  at  the  end  of  Phase  2)  in subjects  with  RA  were  used  to  set  a  baseline  for  the  screening  ELISA  so  that  a  positive  antibody response  could  be  defined.  The  baseline  was  set  at  twice  the  mean  of  pre-infusion  values  from  all subjects  entering  CDP870-004.  Subject  plasma  samples  were  considered  positive  for  antibodies  to CZP if they showed a greater than two-fold increase over this baseline. This resulted in a definition of an  antibody  positive  subject  being  one  in  which  the  anti-CZP  antibody  concentration  exceeded  2.4 units/ml at any time point. This definition was retained for subsequent studies for consistency.

Non-compartmental methods were used to estimated the following PK parameters: Cmax, tmax, AUCt, AUCinf, z, t½, Vz, CL and MRT. Pharmacokinetic parameters were tabulated by treatment groups and with  descriptive  statistics.  The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  Cmax  and  AUC  were  dose  adjusted (Cmax\\_Dn)  and  AUC\\_Dn,  respectively)  to  a  dose  of  1  mg/kg  and  summarized  using  descriptive statistics.

## · Absorption

## Bioavailability

The bioavailabilty of certolizumab pegol was determined in study CDP870-003, a single ascending dose study in healthy male subjects comparing s.c. with i.v. dosing. An ascending dosage group design was employed at dosage levels of 20 mg, 60 mg and 200 mg administered subcutaneously compared with intravenous infusion of 1 mg/kg certolizumab pegol administered over 60 minutes. Subjects were assessed over an 8-week period following dosing. Following completion of the treatment described above,  an  additional,  open-label  treatment  group  of  6  subjects  was  added  to  the  study.  This  group received an s.c. injection of 20 mg certolizumab pegol, diluted to a total volume of 1.0 ml with saline to assess the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of a 20 mg/ml dose solution. Blood samples were collected  for  the  analysis  of  certolizumab  pegol  plasma  concentrations  pre-dose;  30,  60,  75  and  90 minutes post start of infusion (or s.c. injection for second part of the study); and at 2, 3.5, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 hours, and on Days 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 42 and 56 post dose.

The results of study CDP870-003 are presented in Table 3.

FAUC = bioavailability based upon AUC values (AUC sc/AUC iv), dose adjusted

The bioavailability of certolizumab pegol 200 mg/ml formulation was 81%, 88% and 76% following s.c.  administration  of  20  mg,  60  mg  and  200  mg,  respectively.  Following  subcutaneous  injection, certolizumab pegol is slowly absorbed and reaches maximum concentrations on average after about 27 days.

## Bioequivalence

Study  CDP870-038,  a  bioequivalence  study  with  parallel  group  design,  compared  the  lyophilized formulation  used  in  many  of  the  later-stage  clinical  studies  and  the  optimized  liquid  formulation intended for marketing. The parallel design was chosen due to the risk of antibody formation from one treatment  period  to  the  next.  Formal  bioequivalence  was  not  shown,  as  seen  in  Table  4  below. However, the difference in bioavailability seen was not large and is considered not to be of clinical significance.

## · Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was estimated to be 8.01 l in the population PK analysis for subjects with RA with an inter-subject variability of 30.9% CV.

## · Elimination

Elimination pathways and metabolism mediated interactions have not been studied since these areas generally are considered predictable for protein drugs. Only limited human data are currently available on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  PEG.  The  de-conjugated  PEG  component  is  rapidly  eliminated  from plasma and is to an unknown extent excreted renally.

In human pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers certolizumab pegol plasma clearance (CL/F; total  body  clearance  divided  by  fraction  of  the  dose  absorbed)  was  estimated  by  taking  the  ratio between the dose administered and the AUC extrapolated to infinity. In Study CDP870-001, during which  certolizumab  pegol  was  administered  i.v.,  mean  clearance  values  ranged  from  9.21  ml/h  to 14.38 ml/h. In Study CDP870-003, clearance was estimated to be 10.46 ml/h following i.v. dosing and ranged from 10.58 ml/h to 12.13 ml/h following s.c. dosing (Table 3).

The  population  PK  analysis  of  data  from  subjects  with  RA  resulted  in  an  estimated  clearance  of 21.04 ml/h (0.505 l/day) for a 71.5 kg anti-certolizumab pegol antibody negative patient in the final model for the overall population, with an inter-subject variability of 30.8% (CV) and an inter-occasion variability  of  22.0%.  Certolizumab  pegol  has  a  long  elimination  half-life  (t ½)  of  approximately  14 days.

The presence of antibodies to certolizumab pegol resulted in an approximately three-fold increase in clearance.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Certolizumab pegol exhibits roughly dose-linear pharmacokinetics. The average plasma concentrations  are  similar  over  24  weeks  suggesting  time-independent  pharmacokinetics.  For  the antibody positive patients a time dependent decrease in exposure was evident.

## · Special populations

Population pharmacokinetics was used to characterize the pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol in the RA patient population, including estimation of inter-subject variability in the main pharmacokinetic parameters and identification of important demographic and physiologic determinants  of  certolizumab  pegol.  The  data  set  used  for  population  PK  analyses  consisted  of  six studies (Studies CDP870-004, CDP870-011, CDP870-014, CDP870-027, CDP870-050 and PHA 001).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  population  analysis  did  not  indicate  a  strong  impact  of gender on  the  pharmacokinetics  of certolizumab pegol. Further, an effect of age was not identified in the population analysis in a material including  patients  up  to  83  years  of  age  (13%  above  65  years).  An  effect  of weight on  the pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol was identified in the population PK analysis; however, there was no indication of a lower efficacy in individuals with large body weights in the clinical sub-group analysis.

Certolizumab pegol has not been studied in children and is not proposed to be indicated for children.

The impact of race on the pharmacokinetics certolizumab pegol was not evaluable due to the small number  of  subjects  in  each  group  other  than  Caucasians.  However,  clinically  relevant  differences between various ethnicities are not expected. The difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between the Japanese and the Caucasian population was specifically studied in a bioavailability study, in which single  s.c.  doses  of  certolizumab  pegol  100,  400  and  800  mg  were  given  to  healthy  Japanese  and Caucasian subjects. Only a small difference was seen which was not considered clinically relevant.

The  effect  of  moderate  to  severe renal  or  hepatic  impairment has  not  been  studied  in  separate pharmacokinetic studies. Thus, the pharmacokinetics and safety of certolizumab pegol in patients with moderate to severe renal or hepatic impairment are not known. However, since certolizumab is not expected to be extensively eliminated through hepatic routes, the lack of information regarding hepatic impairment  is  acceptable.  Although  the  certolizumab  pegol  complex  is  too  large  to  be  eliminated through renal routes, the PEG fraction could possibly be renally excreted to a large extent. Therefore, the information is at present considered insufficient to provide dosing recommendation in moderate and severe renal impairment, which is stated in the SPC section 4.2.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

In  vitro cytochrome  P450  inhibition  studies  with  human  microsomes  were  not  performed  because proteins and immunoglobulin antibodies do not compete for the cytochrome P450 metabolism system. P-glycoprotein  mediated  transport  of  digoxin  and  vinblastine  were  investigated  in  both  Caco-2  and MDCK+PGY1 cell monolayer systems.  It  was  shown  that  neither  certolizumab  pegol  nor  its  nonpegylated Fab' fraction were inhibitors of p-glycoprotein mediated transport.

Formal drug-drug interaction studies in vivo have not been performed other than the potential for a PK drug-drug interaction between MTX and certolizumab pegol which was examined in subjects with RA (PHA-001).  In  this  study  a  small  effect  on  MTX  in  the  presence  of  certolizumab  pegol  was demonstrated that  is  not  considered  clinically  relevant.  Furthermore,  the  population  PK  analysis  in subjects with RA indicated that concomitant administration with MTX, corticosteroids, NSAIDs and analgesics had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of certolizumab pegol.

## Immunogenicity

The presence of antibodies to certolizumab pegol was assessed in all clinical studies except the MTX interaction study in subjects with RA (PHA-001).

In the Phase 3 placebo controlled studies of RA where subjects received 400 mg s.c. the incidence of subjects testing positive for antibodies was 22.5% in study CDP870-011, and considerably lower in studies CDP870-014, CDP870-027 and CDP870-050 where MTX was co-administered, namely 4.0% (400 mg q4w), 10.7% (200 mg q2w) and 8.5% (200 mg q2w), respectively. The fraction of patients developing antibodies had generally increased at the safety follow up. It is important to note that the detection  of  anti-CZP  antibodies  can  be  hampered  by  the  presence  of  certolizumab  pegol  in  the plasma, which may lead to false negative results and therefore to an underestimation of the incidence of  antibody  generation.  Further,  the  definition  of  an  anti-CZP  antibody  positive  subject  is  also dependent on the value used as cut-off in the definition. The applicant has presented a time-to-event model describing the incidence of antibody response during the 6- to 12- month observation period with predictions being in reasonable agreement with the observed data. The occurrence of antibodies has been shown to result in an increase in certolizumab pegol clearance of approximately three-fold. The markedly higher clearance in antibody positive subjects was indicated to result in reduced clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

efficacy and the predictions made on the basis of the exposure-response model also point in the same direction.

An ELISA analysis of human plasma samples positive for antibodies to infliximab did not suggest that anti-infliximab  antibodies  bound  certolizumab  pegol.  Human  plasma  samples  positive  for  antiCDP870 antibodies  did  not  cross  react  with  infliximab,  etanercept  or  adalimumab.  There  are  data available  to  confirm  that  antibodies  were  neutralising,  but  these  data  are  insufficient  to  assess  the possibility for cross-reactivity with other anti-TNF antibodies.

- Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No in vitro pharmacokinetic studies involving human biomaterials were conducted.

## Pharmacodynamics

- Mechanism of action

Certolizumab pegol has a high affinity for human TNF α and binds with a dissociation constant (KD) of  90pM. TNF α is  a  key  pro-inflammatory  cytokine  with  a  central  role  in  inflammatory  processes. Certolizumab  pegol  selectively  neutralizes  TNF α but  does  not  neutralize  lymphotoxin α (TNF β ). Certolizumab pegol was shown to neutralize membrane associated and soluble human TNF α in a dose dependent manner. Incubation of monocytes with Certolizumab pegol resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of LPS-induced TNF α and IL-1 β production in human monocytes.

Certolizumab pegol does not contain a fragment crystallizable (Fc) region, which is normally present in  a  complete  antibody,  and  therefore  does  not  fix  complement  or  cause  antibody-dependent  cellmediated cytotoxicity in vitro . It does not induce apoptosis in vitro in human peripheral blood-derived monocytes or lymphocytes, or neutrophil degranulation.

- Primary and Secondary pharmacology

There is only non-clinical support for certolizumab pegol being a selective anti-TNF agent. Specific PD markers were not assessed within the clinical trials.

## Clinical efficacy

- Dose response study

Study CDP870-004 was a double-blind, multiple dose, 2-week, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study to compare efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol and placebo in 326 subjects with a history of inadequate  response  or  intolerance  to  at  least  one  DMARD  and  active  RA  at  screening.  DMARD therapy was discontinued at least one month prior to study start; concomitant NSAID and ≤ 10  mg prednisone or equivalent/day were allowed. Patients received 50, 100, 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg s.c. q4w in two dose groups, panel 1 and panel 2.

The primary measure of efficacy was ACR20 Responder Rates at Week 12 (Table 5). A number of secondary efficacy measures were also included, e.g. ACR20 at all available visits except Week 12, ACR50, ACR70, subset of the ACR criterion, DAS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the stricter ACR50 and ACR70 criteria, statistically significant results were seen in the 400 mg dose group; for 200 mg ACR50 differed significantly as well. There was no clear difference between 400, 600 and 800 mg with respect to percentage of ACR50/70 responders.

Based on these data, the applicant selected 400 mg every fourth week (q4w) for two Phase 3 studies, CDP870-011 and 014. After completion of study 014, additional PK modeling suggested that more frequent dosing (200 mg q2w) would increase the Ctrough and potentially improve the clinical response. Therefore, subsequent Phase 3 studies tested 200 and 400 mg every second week (q2w).

- Main studies

The design of the four Phase 3 studies was largely similar; however, only two studies (CDP870-027 and  CDP870-050)  evaluated  certolizumab  pegol  in  its  proposed  posology  of  200  mg  q2w  in combination with oral methotrexate (MTX) and were therefore considered pivotal. A summary of the major design and methodological characteristics common across all four Phase 3 trials is given below.

## METHODS

## Study participants

The key inclusion criteria included:

- ≥ 18 years of age
- Active RA of at least 6 months duration as defined by:
- -≥ 9 tender joints; and
- -≥ 9 swollen joints; and
- -≥ 30  mm/hour ESR or CRP &gt;15 mg/l (studies 027 and 050); ≥ 45  minutes  of  morning stiffness or ≥ 28 mm/hour ESR or CRP &gt;10 mg/l (studies 011 and 014)
- Studies  027,  050  and  011:  Treatment  with  MTX  (with  or  without  folic  acid)  for  at  least  6 months prior to the baseline visit, with stable dose at least 2 months before baseline visit. The minimum MTX dose was 10 mg weekly (studies 027, 050) or 15 mg weekly (study 014).
- Study 014: Discontinue all DMARD at least 28 days or five half-lives, whatever longer, prior to first dose of study drug

The inclusion criteria in the add-on studies were largely similar to those used in previous studies with anti-TNF agents in support of a second line indication in RA, although monotherapy in subjects with inadequate response to DMARD has not been studied with all anti-TNFs.

Exclusion  criteria  included  identified  contraindications  for  anti-TNF  agents,  and  were  considered relevant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatments

In studies 027 and 050, placebo was compared with 200 mg or 400 mg certolizumab pegol every 2 weeks (q2w) as add-on therapy to oral MTX. Subjects randomized to the 200 mg q2w treatment group received three loading doses of 400 mg administered at Weeks 0, 2, and 4 in order to ensure rapid initial rise in plasma certolizumab pegol concentration. The study duration was 24 weeks (050) or 52 weeks (027), respectively.

The majority of patients included in the studies received MTX (in studies CDP870-014, -027, and 050), while in study CDP870-011 RA patients, being refractory or intolerant to at least one DMARD, were treated without concomitant DMARD therapy (i.e. certolizumab pegol monotherapy).

Early escape : In studies 027 and 050, patients who failed to achieve an ACR20 response at Week 12, confirmed at Week 14, were designated as treatment failures. After the Week 14 visit, these patients were withdrawn and offered the choice of entering an open-label extension study at Week 16.

For details about the dose regimens and treatments in each study refer to Table 2.

## Objectives

In all pivotal studies the primary study objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol either compared to placebo (alone) or together with MTX. Efficacy was assessed primarily by ACR improvement criteria. Safety was assessed in every study, also in comparison with certolizumab pegol  systemic  exposure.  In  one  study  (CDP870-027)  the  effects  of  certolizumab  pegol  on  the reduction  of  the  rate  of  progression  of  structural  joint  damage  as  measured  by  X-ray  were  also assessed..  In  all  studies,  PK  parameters  were  measured  in  selected  patients  either  to  assess bioequivalence of different formulations or to collect population PK data.

## Outcomes/endpoints

In  all  four  studies,  the  primary  endpoint  was  ACR20  response  at  Week  24,  addressing  signs  and symptoms of disease. Study 027 had a co-primary endpoint of change from baseline in van der Heijde -modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Week 52, for evaluation of structural damage.

Secondary  endpoints  included  ACR50/70  responses,  major  clinical  response,  subsets  of  the  ACR components,  HAQ-DI and SF-36 addressing  physical  function  and  disability,  as  well  as  endpoints addressing tiredness, productivity. Some additional efficacy measures such as DAS28, DAS remission were also studied.

## Further detail on main endpoints:

## Signs &amp; symptoms endpoints

- American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 response: the assessments were based on a ≥ 20/50/70% improvement from baseline in the number of both tender joints and swollen joints, and in 3 of the 5 core set measures:
- -Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain (measured by VAS)
- -Patient's Global Assessments of Disease Activity (measured by VAS)
- -Physician's Global Assessments of Disease Activity (measured by VAS)
- -physical function based on the HAQ-DI
- -C-reactive protein (CRP)
- Assessment of joint tenderness and swelling: A total of 68 joints were examined for tenderness, including  joints  in  the  upper  body,  upper  extremity,  and  lower  extremity.  An  assessment  for swelling  was  made  on  66  joints  of  the  68  joints  evaluated  for  tenderness;  the  hip  joints  were excluded. Swelling and tenderness were graded on a 4-point scale.

## Reduction of the rate of the progression of structural joint damage

Radiographs of the hands and feet were taken to assess disease progression. A single posterioanterior view  of  each  hand  and  a  single  dorsoplantar  image  of  each  foot  were  taken  prior  to  first  dose  of investigational product at Baseline and at Weeks 24 and 52/Withdrawal visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  degree  of  joint  damage  was  assessed  using  the  van  der  Heijde modified  Total  Sharp  Score (mTSS) .  This  methodology quantifies the extent of bone erosions and joint space narrowing for 44 and 42 joints, respectively, with higher scores representing greater damage. Each radiograph was read centrally and independently by 2 of 3 experienced readers who were blinded for treatment, visit, and patient identification. The mean score of the readers was used for analysis.

## Randomisation

Eligible patients were randomized through an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) to receive 1 of 2 dosing regimens of certolizumab pegol or placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio. The randomization code was generated by an independent group following instruction of the randomization procedures prepared by the Project Statistician. Randomization was centralized via IVRS and access information was supplied.

## Blinding

All sponsor, investigator sites and CRO staff involved with the study were blinded to the treatment code,  except  Sponsor  Clinical  Trials  Supplies  Coordinator  or  qualified  person,  Site  pharmacy  staff involved  in  investigational  product  storage  and  preparation,  unblinded  CRO  monitors  that  only monitored for the investigational  product accountability,  Sponsor  pharmacovigilance  staff  reporting SAEs to regulatory authorities, unblinded staff that performed ESR testing.

In addition, due to the difference in viscosity between the placebo and certolizumab pegol solutions, the injections were administered by an Investigator-delegated individual whose only other involvement in study conduct could be performing ESR testing. Blinding was also maintained by not disseminating PK sample or CRP results to sites during the study. Standard procedures for unblinding in case of a medical emergency were in place.

## Statistical methods

The  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  consisted  of  all  randomized  patients.  In  the  case  of  dosing administration  error,  analyses  on  the  ITT  population  were  conducted  according  to  randomized treatment. This was the primary efficacy population. The per-protocol (PP) populations were a subset of  the  ITT  population,  consisting  of  those  patients  who  had  no  major  protocol  deviations  affecting either primary efficacy variable or relating to the integrity of the study conduct, as confirmed during a pre-analysis review prior to unblinding of the data.

Post-baseline deviations did not necessarily lead to exclusion of a patient from PP analyses but may have led to exclusion of data. The date from which a patient was excluded was confirmed during the pre-analysis  meeting,  in  addition  to  the  classification  of  patients  to  patient  populations.  These  PP populations  were  used  for  sensitivity  analyses  on  the  primary  endpoints  only  and  for  summary statistics of the demographic characteristics at Baseline. The two PP populations were PP (signs and symptoms) and PP (structural damage).

The safety population consisted of all patients who received at least one injection of investigational product. In the case of dosing administration error, analyses on the Safety Population were conducted according to actual treatment received.

In  the  following,  the  design  and  results  of  the  two  pivotal  studies  (CDP870-027  and  -050)  are presented/described in more detail. Where appropriate, an overview of results from all four Phase 3 studies is given.

## Recruitment

The  earliest  Phase  3  study  started  in  2002  completed  in  2004,  the  latest  ones  in  2005.  One  was completed in January 2004; the others in July 2004, and September 2006. The extension studies are still ongoing.

## Conduct of the study

Minor amendments were made in some studies, either not affecting outcomes or statistical analysis or in order to make studies uniform.

One investigator in study 027 (also site in 028, 050 and 051) was banned from further participation following a routine GCP inspection by the national authority. Subsequently, 10 patients treated at this site discontinued treatment and the data from these patients were excluded from the analysis.

## Baseline data

The general demographic and disease characteristics of patients in Phase 3 studies (ITT population) are summarized in Table 6 below.

For the primary endpoint, ACR20 at Week 24, a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect on signs and symptoms was shown for both dose levels of certolizumab pegol in combination with MTX (see Table 8). Consistent results were demonstrated in alternative sensitivity analyses.

Also secondary endpoints addressing signs and symptoms, physical function and other, e.g. quality of life  related  measures,  showed  statistically  significant,  and  clinically  relevant  better  efficacy  with certolizumab pegol as add-on to MTX, compared with placebo + MTX.

In study 027, 52 week data were also obtained (Table 9). For both doses, the response rate dropped slightly (5-6%) for ACR20 at Week 52 vs. Week 24, while there was no difference for ACR50 and ACR70. Data from the open label extension of up to 2 years show some further reduction but overall, these data support maintained effect on signs and symptoms during the 2 years period.

## Structural damage

The results  of  the  primary  analyses  of  X-ray  data  in  study  027  are  given  in  Table  10.  Statistically significant and clinically promising results have been demonstrated up to 52 weeks. The findings have been found robust in appropriate sensitivity analyses, including a retrieved drop-out (RDO) analysis. All changes on active treatment, positive as well as negative, appear to be due to measurement error (Figure 1). Thus, the results are consistent with a complete inhibition of structural damage.

<!-- image -->

During the review process, the applicant submitted additional X-ray data from  study 028, the open label extension of study 027, obtained at two years. A number of descriptive analyses were presented. The results are indicative of a sustained inhibition of structural damage, but a number of deficiencies limit its value as conclusive evidence. With the separation into completers, withdrawers and switchers the possible comparisons are non-randomised, the possibility to switch already after 16 weeks leaves only  41  patients  with  one-year  data  on  placebo,  and  the  validity  of  the  linear  extrapolation  is  not immediately transparent.

To  further  substantiate  the  evidence  of  a  sustained  effect  on  progression  of  structural  damage  the applicant  presented  estimates  of  the  percentage  of  patients  with  no  progression  (mTSS ≤ 0).  In  an analysis with linear extrapolation for patients missing X-ray data at two years, 63% [95% CI: 59.1; 66.9] had no progression on certolizumab treatment. In an ITT analyses including all patients initially randomised to certolizumab and counting patients without a two-year X-ray examination as failures, the percentage of patients with no progression was 47% [43.4; 50.6]. This is not far from the expected percentage  in  case  of  complete  inhibition  of  structural  damage,  which  should  be  close  to  50%  (all changes due to measurement error and a low percentage with mTSS=0). In certolizumab patients with X-ray data at one and two years the percentage of no progression during the second year was 69% [65.2; 72.8].

Patients pre-maturely withdrawn from treatment during the first year of the pivotal study (027) were retrieved  for  an  X-ray  examination  at  52  weeks,  irrespective  of  treatment  after  the  withdrawal  (no treatment, switched to open label certolizumab treatment, active treatment outside the study). One year X-ray  data  were  obtained  for  80%,  84%  and  86%  of  the  patients  initially  randomised  to  placebo, certolizomab 200 mg or 400 mg, respectively. In a sensitivity, truly conservative RDO analysis (the majority of the placebo patients were treated with certolizumab from Week 16) of these one year data, the  difference  between  the  placebo  and  the  certolizumab  groups  remained  statistically  significant (placebo vs. 200 mg, p&lt;0.01, placebo vs. 400 mg. p&lt;0.05). This gives a reassurance that the evidence of  inhibition  of  structural  damage  for  certolizumab  have  been  obtained  in  a  progressing  study population.

Thus,  considering  the  results  of  the  conservative  analysis  at  one  year,  and  the  high  percentage  of patients with no progression at two years, and also considering the ethical concerns about long-term placebo treatment for the collection of controlled X-ray data, a sustained effect of certolizumab pegol on structural damage is judged to be acceptably documented.

- Additional secondary outcomes

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Major clinical response

Major clinical response could only be assessed in Study CDP870-027 as this was the only study with treatment duration of greater than 6 months. Major clinical response (i.e. continuous ACR70 response for 6 months) was achieved in 12.5% and 1.0% of the certolizumab 200 mg q2w and placebo treated subjects, respectively (p&lt;0.001).

## ACR components

ACR components significantly improved during certolizumab pegol treatment, as expected according to the results of ACR responses shown above.

## DAS28 and EULAR response rates

In each of the Phase 3 studies, the reduction from Baseline in DAS28 (ESR) was significantly greater (p&lt;0.001)  in  the  certolizumab  pegol  treatment  groups  compared  with  the  corresponding  placebo groups  at  all  weeks.  The  onset  of  DAS28  (ESR)  reduction  was  rapid  with  significant  differences between  the  active  and  control  groups,  as  early  as  measured  at  Week  1,  which  were  maintained through the end of the study.

In  Studies  CDP870-027  and  CDP870-050,  the  percent  of  subjects  with  a  good  EULAR  response (defined as a responder) at Weeks 24 and 52 was greater in both active groups as compared with their respective placebo groups.

## Health Outcome Measures

Physical function was assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), the  Physical  Component  Summary  (PCS)  and  the  Physical  Function  (PF)  domain  of  the  SF-36. Health-related  quality  of  life  was  assessed  by  the  SF-36  (PCS  and  Mental  Component  Summary [MCS] and all domains).

In the four Phase 3 studies, the decrease from Baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 24 ranged from -0.31 to -0.58  in  the  certolizumab  pegol  treated  groups  and  from  -0.07  to  -0.15  in  the  placebo  groups, respectively. In each Phase 3 study, the mean improvement from Baseline in the HAQ-DI at Week 24 in all studies and at Week 52 in CDP870-027 was significantly greater (p&lt;0.001) in all certolizumab pegol treatment groups as compared with their respective placebo groups. The proportion of subjects who achieved a minimal clinically important difference (defined as -0.22) ranged from 46% - 55% in the  certolizumab  pegol  treatment  groups  and  was  significantly  greater  than  placebo  (6% - 23%) (p&lt;0.001). In the four Phase 3 studies, the change from baseline in the SF-36 PCS at Week 24 ranged from 5.3 to 8.0 in the certolizumab pegol treated groups as compared with -0.2 to 2.9 in the placebo groups.  Clinically  meaningful  increases  ( ≥ 2.5)  in  the  PCS  were  significantly  greater  in  the certolizumab pegol treatment groups as compared with placebo (p&lt;0.001) in each of the Phase 3studies.

## Ancillary analyses

- Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

A number of subgroup analyses were undertaken in pooled data from studies 027 and 050. Pooling of these  two  studies  are  considered  appropriate,  since  these  studies  were  closely  similar.  For  most subgroups  there  were  no  marked  differences  in  ACR20  response  at  Week  24,  and  no  interaction warrants specific recommendations in relation to use and labelling.

## Antibody formation

The overall incidence of anti-CDP870 antibodies in the four Phase 3 studies was 7%. The incidence of antibody  was  lower  in  the  studies  with  background  MTX  (027,  050  and  014)  compared  to  the monotherapy study (011), which is in line what has been seen for other anti-TNF agents. The overall incidence  of  antibodies  was  consistently  higher  in  the  certolizumab  200  mg  plus  MTX  dose  group (8.5% to 10.7%) compared to the 400 mg plus MTX group (1.6% to 2.1%). However, there were no differences in ACR response rates among these two dose groups in studies 027 and 050. These data support  a  combination  with  MTX as  the  first  treatment  option,  as  the  applicant  has  applied  for.  In studies  027  and  050  (pooled  ACR20  data),  presence  of  antibodies  resulted  in  less  responders,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

particularly  in  the  200  mg  q2w  group  (16%  vs.  10%  for  400  mg  q2w).  In  the  group  positive  for antibodies, 43.5% (200 mg q2w) and 50% (400 mg q2w) were responders, vs. 60% in the antibody negative groups. In samples with neutralizing anti-CDP870 antibodies, no cross-reactivity was seen with  adalimumab,  etanercept  or  infliximab.  In  addition,  no  cross-reactivity  with  certolizumab  was shown in samples shown to be positive for infliximab antibodies.

- Clinical studies in special populations

The plasma concentrations, together with demographic information and antibody data, were used for performing population PK meta-analyses (refer to section on Pharmacokinetics above).

In study 014, for the ACR20 response rate at Week 24 there was a statistically significantly result in favour of certolizumab pegol 400 mg + MTX vs. placebo + MTX. However, the response rate (46%) and  observed  difference  (23%),  was  lower  than  observed  with  other  anti-TNF  agents  in  a  similar population,  and  thus  the  clinical  relevance  of  these  results  was  questioned.  Also  for  secondary endpoints, the data were not fully convincing. Due to these results, the applicant studied q2w dosing in the  subsequent  studies  027  and  050.  If  comparing  the  results  from  studies  027  and  050,  the  dose regimen  400  mg  q4w  appears  inferior  to  200  mg  and  400  mg  q2w  dosing  in  terms  of  efficacy; however,  no  direct  comparison  of  the  q2w  and  q4w  dosing  regimen  is  available.  The  alternative posology  of  400 mg  q4w  as  originally  proposed  by  the  applicant  was  therefore  not  accepted  for inclusion in the SPC.

In study 011, for ACR20 response a statistically significantly result was obtained with certolizumab pegol  monotherapy  vs.  placebo  in  a  population  who  previously  had  failed  DMARD  therapy.  The observed difference was 36%. Similar results were seen for secondary endpoints. Overall, this result is clinically relevant, and may support effect on signs and symptoms of monotherapy in this population. However, due to a  higher  response  rate  where  certolizumab  pegol  is  added  to  MTX,  and  a  higher degree  of  antibody  development  in  subjects  treated  with  monotherapy,  combination  with  MTX  has been proposed by the applicant as the first option. However, in patients who are intolerant to MTX, or when  continued  treatment  with  MTX  is  not  appropriate,  monotherapy  can  be  accepted.  This  is reflected in the therapeutic indications in the SPC. Add-on to other DMARDs has not been studied; this information has been added to the SPC.

## Self-administration

Self-administration was studied in the open label study CDP870-051, where some patients participated in a substudy. Self-administration was considered an acceptable option by the vast majority of those patients  and  is  with  adequate  labeling  statements,  an  acceptable  option. The  applicant  has  included instructions in the product information addressing self-administration, which are considered appropriate.

## Clinical safety

The clinical  safety  data  supporting  this  application  derives  from  four  adequate  and  well-controlled, double blind, international Phase 3 studies in adult patients with RA and their open-label extensions. Pooled data from Phase 2 studies and from Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects were also used.

## · Patient exposure

There were a total of 2,367 subjects with RA who have received at least one dose of certolizumab pegol; 640 subjects received a dose of 200 mg q2w and 513 who received a dose of 400 mg q4w. Most subjects received medication for up to 24 months; 145 received certolizumab pegol for &gt; 48 months. These numbers are sufficient to meet ICH recommendations.

In the placebo-controlled studies, subjects in the 'All CDP870 Doses group' had a more than 4-fold longer  duration  of  exposure  than  the  placebo  group  (957  vs.  225  pt-yrs).  The  exposure  in  the population of open-label plus placebo-controlled subjects was 4065 pt-yrs, compared with 957 pt-yrs for  the  placebo-controlled  studies.  Given  the  large  withdrawal  of  placebo  subjects  due  to  lack  of efficacy after 16 weeks of treatment in studies 027 and 050, only 50 out of 647 placebo subjects were exposed beyond 6 months, which limits the safety data base.

## · Adverse events

A common treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as any event occurring in ≥ 3% of subjects in any certolizumab pegol treatment group and at a rate greater than in the placebo group in at least 1 certolizumab pegol group. Table 13 is a summary of TEAEs by system organ class (SOC) and includes all SOCs, as well as high level terms (HLT) for which the incidence in any CZP treatment group was ≥ 3% or greater than in the placebo group.

There  were  a  greater  proportion  of  subjects  experiencing  both  TEAEs  and  serious  adverse  events (SAE) in the certolizumab group compared with the placebo group. Additionally, the proportions of subjects  experiencing  both  TEAEs  and  SAEs  in  open-label  studies  were  greater  than  in  placebocontrolled  studies.  The  most  common  TEAEs  and  SAEs  in  certolizumab  treated  patients  were infections and musculoskeletal disorders, as expected for the use of an anti-TNF drug in subjects with RA.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Serious adverse events (SAE)

The common SAE profile of certolizumab pegol is as expected for the use of an anti-TNF drug in patients with active RA. The most common SAEs were infections. In the placebo-controlled studies, the overall incidence rate of SAEs was greater in the active treatment group compared with placebo (10.7% vs. 6.6%). Furthermore, a greater percentage of patients in the certolizumab group of the All

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Studies population experienced SAEs compared with that group of the placebo-controlled trials (26% vs 10.7%). In an effort to take into account duration of exposure between groups, both event rates and incidence rates were calculated. For event rates in the 'All CDP870 doses', there was also an increase in the CDP870 group (28.7% vs 23.7%). A comparison of incidence rates between All CDP870 doses reveals no increase with longer term exposure (17.0 in 'All Studies' compared with 20.7 per pt-yrs in placebo-controlled  studies).  The  certolizumab  pegol  400  mg  every  4  weeks  treatment  group  had  a higher incidence rate of SAEs compared with the other active treatment groups. This is consistent with the data for TEAEs.

## Deaths

A total of 33 deaths were reported, 10 of which occurred in placebo-controlled trials (9 of which were receiving  certolizumab  pegol)  and  23  occurred  in  open-label  studies.  Fourteen  certolizumab  pegol treated patients experienced fatal cardiac events, three cardiopulmonary failure or cardiogenic shock, and  two  fatal  vascular  events,  including  cerebrovascular  accident  and  pulmonary  embolism.  Seven subjects experienced fatal infection events, four fatal malignancies and three died due to trauma. The majority of deaths were from cardiac and infectious causes, a pattern similar to that observed in other biologically-treated  RA  subject  populations.  Six  of  the  deaths  previously  labelled  as  'non-related', could well be related to certolizumab treatment. This conclusion is agreed.

## Infections

In  the  placebo-controlled  studies,  there  was  an  increase  in  risk  for  infection  in  subjects  receiving certolizumab pegol, compared with subjects receiving placebo. There was also an increase in risk for severe and serious infections, and a slight increase in risk for infection TEAEs leading to withdrawal, for subjects receiving certolizumab pegol as compared with those receiving placebo. The occurrence of the most frequent infections was similar in the placebo-controlled studies and the All Studies RA Population.  There  was  no  increase  in  incidence  of  infection  with  increased  certolizumab  pegol exposure.

In the placebo-controlled studies, the most frequently seen infections included upper respiratory tract infections,  nasopharyngitis,  urinary  tract  infections,  and  lower  respiratory  tract  and  lung  infections. There were more events of urinary tract infections, bacterial infections, and viral infections in subjects receiving  certolizumab  pegol  q2w,  vs.  certolizumab  pegol  q4w,  with  a  difference  of ≥ 3% in  most cases.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Tuberculosis:

In  the  All  Studies  RA  Population,  30  subjects  experienced  32  events  of  tuberculosis.  Fifteen  had pulmonary tuberculosis, 5 had tuberculosis, 5 disseminated tuberculosis, 1 peritoneal tuberculosis, 3 subjects had lymph node tuberculosis, and 2 subjects had tuberculous pleurisy. In the long-term, openlabel studies, only 2 subjects from low-incidence countries had tuberculosis compared with 27 subjects in  high-incidence  countries.  All  but  one  of  the  certolizumab  pegol  -treated  subjects  who  developed tuberculosis infections were receiving concomitant MTX and 10 of 30 were receiving corticosteroids. Most cases (26 of 30) occurred after 12 weeks of therapy. Furthermore, 23 of these cases occurred with the 400 mg q2w dose, five with 200 mg q2w and two with 400 mg q4w.

Following the clinical database cut-off date of 31-Aug-2007, up to the safety database late cut-off date of 29-Feb-2008, four additional cases of tuberculosis were reported, at least three all from countries with a high prevalence of latent tuberculosis and all were taking concomitant MTX.

It can be concluded that, as expected for an anti-TNF agent, certolizumab pegol is associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis, frequently with disseminated or extrapulmonary clinical presentation. The tuberculosis incidence rate observed with certolizumab pegol appears high, but it is noted that subjects enrolled in these studies were from countries with high tuberculosis incidence rates and often had  a  positive  PPD  tests  at  baseline.  The  applicant  has  also  provided  a  summary  on  available experience with use of prophylactic anti-TB treatment in patients with suspected latent TB treated with certolizumab pegol. Although these data are limited, they provide some reassurance regarding use of certolizumab  pegol  in  subjects  who  are  treated  for  suspected  latent  TB,  and  support  the  proposed recommendations in the SPC.

## Other infections

The current data also confirm that certolizumab pegol is associated with an increase in opportunistic infections, as well as with reactivation of viral infections, which has been described for the other antiTNF agents.

There is one hepatitis B case (no prior history of hepatitis). Several cases of herpes infections were identified  (84  in  63  subjects  [3.6%,  6.5/100  pt-yrs]]for  CDP870  and  9  cases  in  8  subjects  [1.2%, 3.3/100  pt-yrs]  for  placebo.  In  the  All  Studies  RA  Population,  there  were  five  opportunistic  fungal infections:  1  fungal  oesophagitis,  2  oesophageal  candidiasis,  1  geotrichosis,  and  1  Pneumocystis; where  two  (geotrichosis  and  Pneumocystis)  were  serious.  Two  subjects  treated  with  CDP870  and MTX  developed  Legionella pneumonia. One additional subject experienced an infection of nocardiosis. Through  the safety database late cut-off date of 29-Feb-2008, 1 new  case of histoplasmosis was reported.

## Malignancies

In  the  placebo-controlled  studies,  there  were  a  total  of  10  malignancies  identified  (excluding  non melanoma skin cancers), including 9 subjects receiving certolizumab pegol and one on placebo. Those included tongue neoplasm, lung cancer, B cell lymphoma, oesophageal carcinoma, hepatic neoplasm, uterine  cancer,  metastases  to  CNS,  colon  cancer,  testicular  cancer  and  bladder  cancer  (placebo). Additionally, 3 subjects had basocellular carcinoma of the skin (all serious). Four of these had brief exposure to certolizumab pegol (less than 50 days) and two had received only a single dose.

In the All Studies population, there were 24 cases of malignancies (23 subjects), all on certolizumab pegol  (2  lymphomas,  4  gastrointestinal,  2  breast,  6  genitourinary,  5  respiratory  tract,  1  each  of endocrine,  renal,  skin  and  occult  malignancies,  9  with  basocellular  carcinoma  of  the  skin).  One additional case was identified through cut-off date of 29-Feb-2008 (gastric cancer).

## Autoimmune disorders

In the placebo-controlled studies, 145 of 868 subjects (16.7%) in the All CDP870 Doses group and 43 of 357 subjects (12.0%) in the placebo group experienced a shift from negative to positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer at any time during the study. A shift to elevated anti-dsDNA titers occurred in 30 of 1369 subjects (2.2%) in the All CDP870 Doses group and 5 of 479 subjects (1.0%) in the placebo group. In the placebo controlled population, one subject on certolizumab pegol experienced an SAE of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lupus-like syndrome, and in the All Studies population, a total of 6 subjects experienced lupus-like events. These events are consistent with previous reports of events observed with other TNF-blocking agents, and are addressed in the SPC.

## Cardiovascular disorders

There was an increase in the percentage of subjects with hypertensive events in the certolizumab pegol group  vs.  placebo  (5.1  vs.  1.2%,  respectively).  However,  there  was  no  difference  between  the certolizumab  pegol  treatment  groups  and  placebo  in  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in  systolic  or diastolic  blood  pressure,  nor  the  shifts  of ≥ 5  mmHg  in  diastolic  blood  pressure.  In  the  placebocontrolled studies, 16 subjects (0.9%) in the All CDP870 Doses group experienced SAEs of Cardiac disorders, vs. 3 subjects (0.5%) on placebo.

Congestive  heart  failure  was  reported  in  10  patients.  Use  of  anti-TNF  agents  is  contraindicated  in subjects with moderate to severe heart failure. Certolizumab pegol use should also be contraindicated and relevant warnings should be included, in accordance with wording for other agents of this class.

During  the  review  process,  the  applicant  submitted  an  additional  in-depth  analysis  of  a  number  of cardiovascular events. These data do not raise additional concern and support information included in the SPC. Furthermore, CV events are also addressed in the RMP.

## Neurological events

The incidence of neurological adverse events was similar in certolizumab pegol -treated subjects and those receiving placebo. No cases of multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, or other demyelinating diseases occurred in the RA Population studies. However, demyelination is a known class effect for anti-TNF agents and a warning has been added to the SPC (4.3).

## Haematological disorders

In the placebo-controlled studies, a greater percentage of subjects receiving certolizumab pegol at any dose, compared with placebo, experienced haematological adverse events (9.0% vs. 5.4%). The most common  haematological  disorders  for  certolizumab  pegol  and  placebo  were  eosinophilia  (1.7%, 3.05/100 pt-yrs, and 0.5%, 1.23/100 pt-yrs, respectively), aPTT prolonged (1.4%, 2.42/100 pt-yrs and 0.3%, 0.82/100 pt-yrs, respectively), and anaemia (1.4%, 2.42/100 pt-yrs and 1.2%, 3.29/100 pt-yrs, respectively)

## Bleeding events

In  the  placebo-controlled  studies,  SAEs  related  to  bleeding  occurred  in  6  subjects  on  certolizumab pegol and one on placebo. In CDP870-treated subjects, serious bleeding events included haematoma, melaena (due to epistaxis), 2 cases of menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and bleeding nasal polyp.

In  the  open-label  studies,  an  additional  6  certolizumab  pegol  -treated  subject  experienced  serious bleeding  events.  These  included  haematuria,  4  metrorrhagia  and  post-procedural  haemorrhage. Through  the  late  cut-off  date  of  29-Feb-2008,  seven  additional  cases  were  reported:  haematuria, gastrointestinal  haemorrhage,  and  uterine  haemorrhage,  rectal  haemorrhage,  uterine  haemorrhage, purpura, and melaena.

Although  the  data  did  not  suggest  an  increased  incidence  in  'any  bleeding  event',  there  is  the suggestion that treated subjects are at greater risk for 'dysfunctional uterine bleeding'. The frequency for the placebo group was 0.5% (incidence rate of 1.23), compared with 0.9% (incidence rate of 1.61) for certolizumab pegol. Also, 3/6 (50%) SAEs in placebo-controlled studies and 4/6 (67%) in the 'all studies' population were due to this cause.

Available data do not reveal an association between specific coagulation abnormalities and general bleeding events. Based on a review of all cases of 'dysfunctional uterine bleeding' occurring in all studies,  it  can  be  concluded  that  in  the  RA  programme  there  was  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of 'dysfunctional uterine bleeding' during the placebo-controlled phase, and there were 3 SAE; all in the certolizumab  group.  'Uterine  bleeding  disorders'  is  added  in  section  4.8  of  the  SPC.  In  the  RMP, serious bleeding is included as a potential risk, which is considered sufficient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic events

There  was  a  low  incidence  of  hepatobiliary  events  during  the  placebo-controlled  studies.  The incidence rate did not increase during open-label treatment. The most common hepatic events were effects in liver function analyses and included increased alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltransferase (2.29, 1.65, and 1.35/100 pt-yrs, respectively). The incidence rate of these events in the placebo-controlled studies was 4.79, 3.45, and 2.32/100 pt-yrs, respectively,  in  the  All  CDP870  Doses  group.  Serious  adverse  events  were  more  common  in  the certolizumab pegol treatment group, however most were either cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. There was one case of autoimmune hepatitis. Overall, the hepatic events described in the study population do not constitute any alarming signal.

## Local injection reactions

The proportion  of subjects  experiencing  either  a  skin  and/or  subcutaneous  disorder,  including  local injection site reactions, was low. Interestingly, subjects who had developed antibodies to certolizumab pegol  had  a  lower  incidence  of  injection  site  reactions.  There  is  no  indication  of  severe/serious reactions linked to either the drug itself or to the development of antibodies against it.

## Hypersensitivity reactions

There was one clear case of serious hypersensitivity and one case of serum sickness. These data do not raise  concern:  however,  hypersensitivity  is  a  common  complication  with  anti-TNF  agents  and  an appropriate warning has been added to the SPC.

## Respiratory disorders

The incidence of non-infectious respiratory events was not markedly increased in certolizumab pegol treated subjects compared with placebo, and there was no evidence of an increase in these events over prolonged  periods  of  exposure.  There  were  three  certolizumab  pegol-treated  subjects  in  placebocontrolled studies who experienced lung infiltration. While associations to MTX cannot be excluded, cases of interstitial lung diseases/pneumonitis have been reported with other drugs of this class, and this is reflected in the SPC.

- Laboratory findings

In general, changes in haematology parameters appear to be consistent with those expected from lower disease  activity.  From  preclinical  data  there  were  reports  of  prolongation  of  aPTT  which  has  been discussed in this  application  as  an in  vitro phenomenon with several of the commercially available assay kits. Further, it can be concluded that certolizumab pegol does not appear to have a clinically meaningful deleterious effect upon liver function tests, renal function tests, albumin and total protein, glucose, total calcium or electrolytes.

- Safety in special populations

In  placebo  controlled  studies,  the  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  and  SAEs  appeared  with  higher frequencies  in  the  &gt;  65  years  age  group  (compared  to  the  18  to  64  years  age  group).  This  is  not unexpected, since certain events would be expected to be more common in a more elderly group, and a higher sensitivity in elderly for, e.g. infections is not unlikely. However, the number of subjects in this age group was small, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions. The applicant will collect additional data in the planned registries . Further, a warning statement has been added to the SPC.

The current experience with certolizumab pegol treatment during pregnancy is far too limited to draw any conclusions. The lack of adequate data on use of certolizumab pegol during pregnancy is stated in the SPC. Plans for pregnancy follow-up in the post marketing setting is part of the follow-up measures in the area of pharmacovigilance.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

When  looking  at  the  overall  infection  data,  there  was  no  clinically  meaningful  difference  in  the proportion of patients experiencing an infection between those receiving MTX and those who did not.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

The  adverse  events  most  often  leading  to  withdrawal  in  both  the  placebo-controlled  and  the  All Studies population were Infections and Infestations. In both populations, tuberculous infections were the most commonly occuring infection leading to withdrawal. The proportion of patients withdrawing because  of  an  infection  increased  from  1.8%  to  4.6%  over  time.  The  discontinuation  pattern  for certolizumab pegol treated patients does not raise concerns related to either efficacy or safety, and is not considered to have had a negative impact on the interpretation of the study results.

## · Post marketing experience

No post-marketing experience with certolizumab pegol has been available at the time of Marketing Authorization.

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the MA application is of the opinion that the following  risk  minimisation  activities  are  necessary  for  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the  medicinal product: see as detailed in section 2.3 of this CHMP Assessment Report.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

In general, the different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with  existing  guidelines.  The  documentation  provided  with  the  application  demonstrates  consistent batch-to-batch production of Cimzia achieving a consistent quality for the drug substance and the drug product.  The  fermentation,  purification  and  pegylation  of  the  drug  substance,  Certolizumab  pegol (CDP870),  are  adequately  controlled  and  validated.  The  drug  substance  has  been  extensively characterised  with  regard  to  its  physicochemical  and biological  characteristics  using  state-of  the-art methods. The manufacturing process of the drug product has been described and validated in sufficient detail. In addition, the viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents (including TSE) have been sufficiently assured. In general, appropriate drug substance and drug product specifications have been set.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

An  adequate  non-clinical  programme  has  been  conducted  for  certolizumab  pegol.  The  preclinical observations  did  not  raise  major  concerns  against  the  use  of  certolizumab  pegol  in  humans  at  the proposed clinical use.

Fertility  data  in  rats  using  the  homologous  agent  cTN3  PF  showed  that  sperm  motility  parameters tended to be lower in the treated groups and the motility was significantly decreased in the high-dose group (100 mg/kg). While the relevance of these findings for humans is unknown, an effect of antiTNF α therapies  on  sperm  morphology  and  motility  in  humans  cannot  be  ruled  out.  A  clinical evaluation of the effect  of  certolizumab  pegol  treatment  on  male  sperm  quality  was  requested  as  a follow-up measure.

## Efficacy

Four  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  Phase  3  clinical  studies  in  patients with active RA were submitted, and one additional Phase 2 study with subcutaneous administration. In two of the Phase 3, placebo was compared with 400 mg certolizumab pegol every 4 weeks (q4w), in one study as monotherapy (011) and in one as add-on to MTX. In the other two Phase 3 studies (027 und  050),  placebo  was  compared  with  200  mg  (started  by  3  loading  doses  of  400  mg)  or  400  mg certolizumab pegol every 2 weeks (q2w) as add-on therapy to MTX. The latter two Phase 3 studies were considered pivotal as they evaluated the dosing regimen applied for.

In  the  Phase  3  studies  011,  014  and  027,  a  lyophilized  formulation  was  used,  while  a  liquid formulation,  the  proposed  commercial  form,  was  used  in  study  050.  All  clinical  studies  were performed according to GCP principles.

The primary endpoint of ACR20 at Week 24 was met in all studies and the differences to the placebo control are statistically significant and clinically relevant. In study 027, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in mTSS at Week 52, compared to baseline. Cimzia patients  demonstrated  significantly less  radiographic progression  than patients  receiving  placebo.  In the placebo group, 52% of patients experienced no radiographic progression at Week 52 compared to 69% in the Cimzia 200 mg treatment group. Sustained inhibition of progression of structural damage was demonstrated in a subset of 449 of these patients who completed at least 2 years of treatment with Cimzia and had evaluable data at the 2-year timepoint.

The pivotal Phase 3 studies with certolizumab pegol demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in all secondary  endpoints  such  as  ACR50,  ACR70  responses,  DAS28  (ESR),  Improvement  in  Physical Function and Health-related Quality of Life measures.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  the  monotherapy  study  (011)  using  certolizumab  pegol  400  mg  q4w,  the  ACR20,  ACR50,  and ACR70 responses were clinically and significantly better than placebo, although the magnitude of the response was not as robust as in the combined therapy studies 027 and 050.

In the studies 027 and 050, certolizumab pegol 200 mg q2w or 400 mg q2w showed clinically and statistically  significant  better  results  compared  to  placebo  in  all  important  efficacy  measures.  There were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  between  the  200  mg  q2w  and  400  mg  q2w  groups  (with background MTX); therefore the lower effective dose is recommended.

There  were  slight  numerical  differences  in  PK  and  efficacy  between  the  optimized  liquid  and lyophilized formulations, but these differences are not considered of clinical relevance.

## Safety

In  summary,  there  were  a  total  of  2,367  subjects  with  RA  who  have  received  at  least  one  dose  of certolizumab pegol, 640 of which received a dose of 200 mg q 2wk and 513 who received a dose of 400mg q 4w. Most subjects received medication for up to 24  months; 145 received CZP for &gt; 48 months. These numbers are sufficient to meet ICH recommendations.

There were a greater proportion of subjects experiencing both TEAEs and SAEs in the certolizumab pegol group compared with the placebo group. Additionally, the proportions of subjects experiencing both TEAEs and SAEs in open-label studies were greater than that in placebo-controlled studies. The most common TEAEs and SAEs in certolizumab pegol treated patients were infections as expected for the use of an anti-TNF drug in subjects with RA and general or injection site disorders.

Of the  total  of  33  deaths  in  RA  studies,  10  occurred  in  placebo-controlled  trials  (9  of  which  were receiving certolizumab pegol) and 23 occurred in open-label studies. The majority of deaths were from cardiac and infectious causes.

From the available data it can be concluded that certolizumab pegol is associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis (TB), frequently with disseminated or extrapulmonary clinical presentation. The applicant  has  also  provided  a  summary  on  available  experience  with  use  of  prophylactic  anti-TB treatment in patients with suspected latent TB treated with certolizumab pegol. Although these data are limited, they provide some reassurance regarding use of certolizumab pegol in subjects who are treated for suspected latent TB, and support the recommendations in the SPC. The current data also confirm that certolizumab pegol is associated with an increase in opportunistic infections, as well as with reactivation of viral infections, which has been described for the other anti-TNF agents.

In  the  placebo-controlled studies, 9 of 10 subjects with malignancies were exposed to certolizumab pegol. In the open label studies, there were an additional 24 cases of malignancy. The uncertainties related to long-term use of TNF-alpha inhibitors and the potential risk for malignancy are well known concerns associated with use of anti-TNF agents. The potential risk for malignancy has to be weighed against the  potential  benefit  of  certolizumab  pegol  therapy  in the indications  applied  for. This  risk, together with appropriate precautions to take, are addressed in the product information, as well as in the  RMP.  Furthermore,  long-term  follow  up  of  subjects  in  the  studies  undertaken  as  well  as participation in ongoing patient registries in the rheumatoid arthritis population are subject of follow up measures (FUM).

Both congestive heart failure and hypertension have been documented to be associated with the use of agents of this class. Congestive heart failure occurred in 10 subjects. Hypertension was observed more frequently  in  subjects  receiving  certolizumab  pegol  compared  with  placebo,  although  there  was  no documented difference in the mean change from baseline blood pressure between the two groups.

The  use  of  certolizumab  pegol  may  be  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  'dysfunctional  uterine bleeding'. While the data do not reveal an increased incidence in 'any bleeding event' associated with the  use  of  certolizumab  pegol,  there  is  the  suggestion  that  treated  subjects  are  a  greater  risk  for 'dysfunctional uterine bleeding'. This type of bleeding event has been reported in clinical trials using

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

certolizumab pegol in other indications; however, it has not been reported with other agents of this class.

There were small numbers of subjects who developed auto-antibodies and who developed a lupus-like illness  or  rash.  Additionally,  3  subjects  experienced  lung  infiltration,  suggestive  of  interstitial  lung disease/pneumonitis. There were no cases of demyelinating disorders.

There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  tolerability  between  the  liquid  (formulation  for marketing)  and  lyophilized  formulations  were  observed.  Furthermore,  no  clinically  meaningful difference  in  safety  between  the  two  doses,  200  mg  and  400  mg  every  2  weeks,  and  no  clinically relevant  effects  of  certolizumab  pegol  on  clinical  laboratory  parameters,  vital  signs,  physical examinations, or body weight were observed

Overall, the profile of certolizumab pegol is similar to that of other TNF-alpha blockers and the SPC is in line with those of other anti-TNF agents with respect to sections 4.4 and 4.8. Furthermore, the RMP addresses the safety concerns noted above.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

## Risk-benefit assessment

## Benefits:

Studies 027 and 050 are pivotal since in those the posology applied for, 200 q2w, was studied. For the primary endpoint, ACR20 at Week 24, a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect on signs and  symptoms  was  shown  for  certolizumab  pegol  in  combination  with  MTX  (in  study  027:  14% placebo vs. 59%; study 050: 9% placebo vs. 57%). Also secondary endpoints addressing signs and symptoms,  physical  function  and  other,  e.g.  quality  of  life  related  measures,  showed  statistically significant and clinically relevant better efficacy with certolizumab pegol as add-on to MTX compared with  placebo  +  MTX.  The  sensitivity  analyses  have  not  dealt  with  the  withdrawals  due  to  lack  of response  in  a  conservative  way  but  any  potential  bias  would  probably  be  minor  relative  to  the compelling statistical significance and magnitude of the effect. The results compare well with what has been demonstrated for other anti-TNF compounds. However, a shortcoming with the dossier is the lack of directly comparative data with other anti-TNF agents, since certolizumab pegol is at least the fourth anti-TNF α agent to be approved for marketing.

In study 027, 52 week data on signs and symptoms as well as joint damage were also obtained. The response  rate  dropped  slightly  (5-6%)  for  ACR20  at  Week  52  vs.  Week  24,  while  there  was  no difference  for  ACR50  and  ACR70.  These  data  support  maintained  effect  on  signs  and  symptoms during the 52 week period, and additional open-label extension data support a similar picture up to 2 years treatment.

Studies 011 and 014 used a q4w dosing. In study 011, a statistically significant result for ACR20 was obtained  with  certolizumab  pegol  monotherapy  (45.5%)  vs.  placebo  (9.3%)  in  a  population  who previously  had  failed  DMARD  therapy.  Overall,  this  result  is  clinically  relevant  and  may  support effect on signs and symptoms of monotherapy in this population. However, due to a higher response rate  where  certolizumab  pegol  is  added  to  MTX  and  a  higher  degree  of  antibody  development  in subjects treated with monotherapy, combination with MTX has been proposed by the applicant as the first option, while monotherapy may be considered for subjects who cannot be treated with MTX. This is agreed and reflected in the SPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study 014, the ACR20 results at Week 24 were statistically significant in favour of certolizumab pegol 400 mg + MTX vs. placebo + MTX in a population who previously had failed DMARD therapy. However, the response rate (46%) and observed difference (23%) was lower than observed with other anti-TNF  agents  in  a  similar  population,  and  thus  the  clinical  relevance  of  these  results  was questioned. Also, for secondary endpoints the data were not fully convincing.

Comparing the results from study 014 with those from studies 027 and 050, the dose regimen 400 mg q4w appears inferior to 200 mg q2w dosing in terms of efficacy. In addition, data from 027 and 050 do not show any obvious increase in efficacy with 400 mg q2w compared with the 200 mg q2w dose regimen. The applicant proposes a loading dose of 400 mg at weeks 0, 2 and 4, which was used in the pivotal studies 027 and 050, followed by 200 mg q2w. Taken together, the proposed dose regimen is acceptable, although one could conclude that the dose selection is to some extent empirical. However, the option to use 400 mg q4w, which had been proposed as well, was not accepted for inclusion in section 4.2 of the SPC.

Statistically significant results have been demonstrated on structural joint damage up to 52 weeks. The findings have been found robust in appropriate sensitivity analyses. The results are consistent with a complete  inhibition  of  structural  damage.  Additional  x-ray  data  obtained  following  two  years  of treatment continue to support a sustained effect of certolizumab pegol on structural damage and thus, the proposed wording in the indication is accepted.

Long-term benefits are still uncertain, due to limited amount of data.

## Risks:

## Demonstrated risks

The safety profile of certolizumab pegol appears to be in line with the well known safety profile of anti-TNF  agents,  although  long-term  safety  data  are  currently  rather  limited.  Infections  including serious  and  opportunistic  cases  were  the  most  common  adverse  event/serious  adverse  event.  The tuberculosis  incidence  rate  observed  with  certolizumab  pegol  appears  high  (about  33  cases  in  the overall RA population), but it should be considered that subjects enrolled in these studies were from countries with high tuberculosis incidence rates and often had positive PPD tests at baseline.

## Potential risks

The  uncertainties  related  to  long-term  use  of  TNF-alpha  inhibitors  and  the  potential  risk  for malignancy are well known concerns associated with the use of TNF-alpha inhibitors. In the placebocontrolled parts of the studies, 9 of the 10 subjects with malignancies were exposed to certolizumab pegol, indicating an increased risk with the use of these agents even with shorter term exposure (up to 52  weeks).  However,  the  observational  time  period  (52  weeks)  is  too  short  to  draw  any  definite conclusions. Long-term follow up of patients, monitoring via registries, education programme, as well as adequate labelling are of importance.

Although not a strong signal, there was a slightly higher incidence of 'dysfunctional uterine bleeding' in the RA programme; which is addressed in the SPC and the RMP.

## Balance:

Certolizumab pegol, in combination with MTX, has in studies of up to 52 weeks duration in a RA population  who  previously  had  failed  DMARD  therapy,  shown  statistically  significant,  compelling and  clinically  relevant  results  on  signs  and  symptoms  of  disease.  The  magnitude  of  the  effect  and overall results compare well with what has been demonstrated for other anti-TNF compounds.

X-ray data on structural damage are statistically significant and clinically promising over 52 weeks of treatment.  Additional  x-ray  data  obtained  following  two  years  of  treatment  continue  to  support  a sustained effect of certolizumab pegol on structural damage, and thus, the proposed wording in the indication is accepted.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety profile is overall as expected for an anti-TNF agent, although long-term data are sparse. Infections and risk for malignancy are the main concerns in general. Adequate information in the SPC and  follow-up  measures  are  necessary  to  support  a  positive  benefit/risk  balance.  The  applicant  has provided further details on the planned registry follow up; which is acceptable.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

-  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.
-  the following additional risk minimisation activities were required:  were required: see as detailed in the Annex \"Conditions or Restrictions with regard to the Safe and Effective Use of the Medicinal Product to be implemented by the Member States'.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus decision that the risk-benefit balance of Cimzia in the following indication:

Cimzia, in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs including methotrexate has been inadequate.

Cimzia can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate.

Cimzia has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate.'

was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
