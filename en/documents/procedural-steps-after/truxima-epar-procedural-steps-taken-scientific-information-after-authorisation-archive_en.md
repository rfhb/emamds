The shelf life of the new vial (Truxima 100 mg concentrate solution for infusion) is 18 months. The new presentation is intended to be single-dose, partial use. RMP (version 6) has been updated consequentially. Additionally, correction was made in Annex II to amend the title of additional risk minimisation measures. The Truxima RMP was also updated (version 6) to harmonise safety concerns with the latest RMP for the reference product (MabThera RMP v14.0). |
