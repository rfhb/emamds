## 1. Introduction

On May 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Jinarc, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

This application contains the final clinical study report on the study 156-12-298 carried out as part of the tolvaptan paediatric investigation plan (EMEA-001231-PIP02).

Study 156-12-298 is a phase 3b, two-part, multicenter, one year randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial of the safety, pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and efficacy of tolvaptan followed by a twoyear  open-label  extension  in  children  and  adolescent  subjects  with  Autosomal  Dominant  Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD).

There are no regulatory consequences identified by the MAH.

The trial is among the requirements of the EU Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for tolvaptan and was the first trial of tolvaptan in a paediatric ADPKD population.

The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted over 3 years was to assess  the  effects  of  titrated  oral  tolvaptan  in  a  paediatric  and  adolescent  ADPKD  population.  The assessments included pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy (including total kidney volume [TKV]), and long-term safety (including growth and development) and tolerability.

Trial 156-12-298 was compliant with the key binding elements agreed upon in the PIP decision EMEA001231-PIP02-13-M08:

- Study 6, requested in the PIP, was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effects of titrated oral tolvaptan on renal size, pharmacokinetics and safety in children from 4 years to less than 18 years of age diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; followed by an open label extension phase to collect additional safety and efficacy data (156-12-298).

## Methods

## Study design

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The trial comprised 2 phases.

Phase A was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase to compare tolvaptan with placebo. The duration of treatment was 12 months. It was open to subjects between the ages of 4 and 17 years, inclusive. Subjects between the ages of 12 and 17 years were stratified by age and sex in the following cohorts:

- Female subjects ages 12 to 14 years, inclusive
- Female subjects ages 15 to 17 years, inclusive
- Male subjects ages 12 to 14 years, inclusive
- Male subjects ages 15 to 17 years, inclusive.

Additionally, subjects aged 4 to 11 years were eligible for participation following discussion with the medical monitor who met criteria for entry to be enrolled concurrently during the recruitment period for the target population.

Qualified subjects who completed Phase A were eligible to continue into Phase B. A qualified subject was defined as one who was willing to continue in the trial and who did not have any adverse events (AEs) that would require IMP discontinuation.

Phase B was an open-label phase during which subjects who had completed Phase A of the trial received treatment with tolvaptan for 24 months. The purpose of Phase B was to obtain safety and efficacy data for long-term use of tolvaptan.

## Study participants

The trial population included male and female subjects aged 12 to 17 years (inclusive), with a diagnosis of ADPKD as defined by the presence of family history and/or genetic criteria AND who had at least 10 renal cysts, each of which measured at least 0.5 cm confirmed upon MRI inspection. In accordance with the PIP requirements, the trial also allowed subjects aged 4 to 11 years who met criteria for entry to be enrolled concurrently during the recruitment period for the target population. Subjects who were MRInaive or under the age of 12 must have had at least 4 cysts (at least 1 cm in size) confirmed by ultrasound prior to MRI inspection.

## Inclusion criteria

*Must also meet Health Authority/Ethics Committee age restrictions on tablet use (if applicable).

## Treatments

Tolvaptan was provided as 7.5-, 15-, and 30-mg spray-dried, immediate-release tablets with matching placebo. Tolvaptan was administered as a split-dose, with the first dose taken upon awakening and the second dose taken approximately 8 hours later.

The current tolvaptan tablet formulation is limited to administration to those who can easily swallow a 6 or 8 mm tablet and who weigh ≥ 20 kg.

In Phase A of the trial, subjects were randomized to receive IMP defined as either active tolvaptan or matching placebo for 12 months. Starting doses were based on weight:

- ≥ 20 kg to &lt; 45 kg, 15/7.5 mg tolvaptan split-dose or matching placebo
- ≥ 45 kg to ≤ 75 kg, 30/15 mg tolvaptan split-dose or matching placebo
- &gt; 75 kg, 45/15 mg tolvaptan split-dose or matching placebo.

After 1 week, subjects who tolerated their initial dose up-titrated once from their starting dose:

- ≥ 20 kg to &lt; 45 kg, 30/15 mg tolvaptan split-dose or matching placebo

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- ≥ 45 kg to ≤ 75 kg, 45/15 mg tolvaptan split-dose or matching placebo
- &gt; 75 kg, 60/30 mg tolvaptan split-dose or matching placebo

Subjects may have down-titrated at any time during the trial; however, subjects were asked to stay on the highest tolerable dose (by weight group) if possible.

Qualified subjects who have completed Phase A on treatment and continue in Phase B will receive openlabel tolvaptan for up to 24 months. In order to preserve the blind in Phase A, subjects will be started at a dose based on their current body weight and after 1 week, they will be asked to up-titrate once from their starting dose. Subjects who wish to lower their dose secondary to tolerance will have their doses adjusted as necessary.

## CHMP comment

The study enrolled patients aged 12 to 17 years with a diagnosis of ADPKD. However, the trial also allowed subjects aged 4 to 11 years who met criteria for entry to be enrolled concurrently during the recruitment period for the target population according to the PIP requirements. Patients aged &lt; 12 years must have had at least 4 cysts (at least 1 cm in size) confirmed by ultrasound prior to MRI inspection and this is acceptable as MRI usually requires sedation in younger children. The MAH reports that the current tolvaptan tablet formulation is limited to administration to those who can easily swallow a 6 or 8 mm tablet and who weigh ≥ 20 kg. The study protocol foreseen a questionnaire to be administered during Phase A to all subjects immediately after dosing to assess palatability and the easily to swallow the tablets. Submitted data does not include palatability assessment and if tablets were easy to swallow; this information needs to be provided in case the MAH will apply for an extension of indication.

The study design with 12 months double-blind treatment duration could be considered sufficient to detect the potential benefit of tolvaptan over placebo in a pediatric population and is in accordance with the PIP requirement.

## Dosing rationale

Successful treatment of ADPKD appears to require early and constant inhibition of the vasopressin V2 receptor. Maintenance of tolvaptan concentrations for 24 hours produced decreased rates of growth in kidney size in animal models and therefore, subjects are encouraged to take the maximally tolerated dose. The clinical formulation of tolvaptan was optimized to increase bioavailability which necessitates split-dosing to maintain suppression of AVP action across 24 hours. A higher dose is used early in the day, with a lower dose approximately 8 to 9 hours later in order to produce a maximal inhibition on waking, with a gradual fall-off of effect during the night when frequent urination could lead to interruption of sleep. Adult treatment starts with a split-dose regimen of 45 mg in the morning and 15 mg in the afternoon. The child and adolescent subjects to be enrolled in this trial will have well preserved renal function  and,  therefore,  at  the  adult  dose  will  likely  respond  with  potent  diuresis  and  experience aquaretic-related AEs. The starting dose regimens in this trial are based on the adult starting dose, with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

adjustments for body weight. Subjects will be up-titrated to the equivalent of the starting dose used in adult trials at Week 1, and down-titration for tolerability will be allowed. In the pivotal trial for adult subjects with ADPKD (156-04-251), every subject started tolvaptan dosing with the 45/15mg dosing regimen regardless of their weight. When dose is expressed as mg/kg, as shown in Table 2.2-1, the maximum starting dose given to an adult subject was 1.11 mg/kg with the lowest dose being 0.34 mg/kg. This should provide sustained suppression while ameliorating excess aquaretic effects in those with high functioning kidneys. The weight ranges for pediatric subjects were selected so that the maximal starting dose for each weight range was no higher than 67% of the maximal adult dose. The up-titrated morning doses, expressed as mg/kg, are also presented for comparison to the adult trial.

Subjects who are unable to tolerate the initial starting dose regimen will be allowed to down-titrate to a dose as low as 7.5 mg once daily. This will allow for the collection of the most information on tolerability, safety, and potentially efficacy as the minimally effective dose of tolvaptan has not been determined. Animal  studies  indicated  a  dose  response  in  tolvaptan  efficacy  with  lower  doses  is  still  better  than placebo. Adults in the pivotal 156-04-251 trial were titrated up in order to maximize inhibition of AVP but efficacy was observed in subjects who down titrated to 45/15 mg and 60/30 mg regimens. In the phase  2  156-04-250  trial,  subjects  on  the  fixed  regimen  of  45/15  mg  showed  less  efficacy  when compared  to  subjects  on  60/30  mg;  however,  both  groups  showed  slower  increase  in  TKV  when compared to a matched control group.

## CHMP comment

As is already done in TEMPO study with adult dosing, participants received a higher dose early in the day,  followed  by  a  lower  dose  administered  approximately  8 -9  h  later,  in  order  to  obtain  maximal inhibition on waking and a gradual fall-off of effect during the night, when frequent urination would lead to interruption of sleep. The approach is acceptable.

## Objective(s)

The primary objective of the trial was to assess the long-term safety of treatment with tolvaptan in a pediatric and adolescent ADPKD population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The secondary objective of the trial was to assess the PD, PK, and efficacy of tolvaptan in children and adolescent subjects with ADPKD.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The coprimary endpoints were the change from baseline in spot urine osmolality (premorning dose) and specific gravity (premorning dose) after 1 week of daily dosing in Phase A.

The key secondary endpoint was the percent change from Phase A baseline in height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 12 months.

Other secondary endpoints were as follows:

- 24-hour fluid balance prior to Week 1.
- Change from baseline in renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] by Schwartz formula) at each clinic visit (Week 1, Month 1, Month 6, and Month 12 in Phase A).
- Change from baseline in renal function (eGFR by Schwartz formula) at each clinic visit (Week 1, Month 1, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, and Month 24 in Phase B).
- Percent change in htTKV as measured by MRI from Phase B baseline to Phase B Month 12.
- Percent change in htTKV as measured by MRI from Phase B baseline to Phase B Month 24.
- Pharmacodynamic endpoints of urine volume (including 24-hour fluid volume), fluid intake and fluid balance, sodium, creatinine, and free water clearance during dense PK sampling (after at least 1 month on the investigational medicinal product [IMP]).
- Proportions of each Tanner Stage by sex and age compared to normative populations at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months during the placebo-controlled phase (Phase A), and every 6 months during the open-label extension phase (Phase B).
- Description of changes from baseline percentiles for height and weight by sex and age at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months during the placebo-controlled phase (Phase A), and every 6 months during the open-label extension phase (Phase B).
- Safety variables (changes from baseline in creatinine, vital signs, laboratory values including liver function tests [LFTs], and rate of aquaretic adverse events [AEs]) in placebo and tolvaptan.

Exploratory endpoints include:

- Percent change in htTKV as measured by MRI from Phase A baseline to Phase B Month 24.
- Change from Phase A baseline in spot urine osmolality (premorning dose) and specific gravity (premorning dose) after 1 month (Phase A only).
- Time to discontinuation due to any reasons in Phase A and Phase B.
- Tolvaptan maximum (peak) plasma concentration (Cmax), minimum plasma concentration (Cmin), time to Cmax (tmax), and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC0-24h) following dense PK sampling.
- Tolvaptan metabolite concentrations from dense sampling.
- Generic pediatric Quality of Life (QoL) assessments.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Daytime and nighttime void collection.

For subjects under 12 years of age who have ultrasound assessments, the percent changes for htTKV will also be analyzed.

- Percent change in htTKV as measured by ultrasound from Phase A baseline to Phase A Month 12.
- Percent change in htTKV as measured by ultrasound from Phase A baseline to Phase B Month 24.
- Percent change in htTKV as measured by ultrasound from Phase B baseline to Phase B Month 24.
- Percent change in htTKV as measured by ultrasound from Phase B baseline to Phase B Month 12.

## CHMP comment

The choice of the co-primary endpoint is in line with the PIP requirements.

The co-primary endpoints are different to the primary endpoint used in the adult study (TEMPO) in which it was the rate of total kidney volume (TKV) change. As reported in the EPAR (EMA/154879/2015) of tolvaptan MAA in adult population, longitudinal data from the CRISP 2 study published in 2012 suggested a correlation between TKV and total cyst volume, and a correlation of height-corrected TKV and GFR, out to 8 years of follow-up. Measures of renal volume are linked to the progressive development of renal cysts in ADPKD, and correlate with renal function, therefore it is considered an important endpoint. From the other hand it is acknowledged that changes in TKV growth could be difficult to detect in pediatric subjects. However, the percent change from Phase A baseline in height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) was the key secondary endpoint in the current pediatric study and this is acceptable.

## Sample size

The target trial population will be at least 60 male and female subjects aged 12 to 17 years (inclusive), with a diagnosis of ADPKD as defined by the presence of family history and/or genetic criteria AND who have at least 10 renal cysts, each of which measures at least 0.5 cm confirmed upon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inspection.

In accordance with the PIP requirements, the trial will also allow subjects aged 4 to 11 years who meet criteria for entry to be enrolled concurrently during the recruitment period for the target population. It is expected that the trial may enroll approximately 100 subjects.

Subjects who are MRI-naive or under the age of 12 should have at least 4 cysts that are at least 1 cm in size confirmed by ultrasound prior to MRI inspection.

Treatment groups for the required population will be stratified by age and gender in the following age cohorts:

- Female subjects ages 12 to 14 years, inclusive
- Female subjects ages 15 to 17 years, inclusive
- Male subjects ages 12 to 14 years, inclusive
- Male subjects ages 15 to 17 years, inclusive

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

When &gt; 15 subjects are enrolled in an age cohort, new screening for that age cohort will be closed; subjects concurrently in screening for that age cohort may be enrolled if they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. When the last subject in the final age cohort for the required population has been achieved, enrollment in the trial will cease.

The trial is also open to children between the ages of 4 to 11 years (inclusive) with ADPKD, who meet the above criteria and who, in the opinion of the investigator, would benefit from treatment. Subjects, aged 4 to 11 years (inclusive), must have an ultrasound to assess renal cysts.

Qualified subjects who complete Phase A on study medication are eligible to participate in Phase B.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

The blind was not broken for any subjects in Phase A prior to the interim snapshot for the sponsor and prior to the final database lock for the trial sites.

Phase B was open-label and blinding procedures were not applicable; however, the trial sites were to remain blinded until completion of the trial or a safety need arose.

## Statistical Methods

In general, Phase A baseline measurements of safety variables are defined as their last measurements prior to the randomization for the safety population. Phase B baseline measurements of safety variables are defined as the last measurements prior to the first dose of IMP in Phase B. Safety analysis will be conducted  based  on  the  safety  population,  defined  in  Section  5.1.  Standard  safety  variables  to  be analyzed include AEs, change from baseline in creatinine, vital signs, laboratory values including liver function tests (LFTs), and rate of aquaretic AEs. In general, descriptive statistics will be provided for Phase A safety variables and Phase B safety variables as well. Subgroup analysis of key safety endpoints by age cutoff (&lt;12 years vs. ≥ 12 years) will be summarized.

Only descriptive statistics were provided.

No interim analysis was planned before all randomized subjects either completed the Month 12 visit or early terminated in Phase A (the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of this trial). A snapshot of the database  was  taken  after  all  subjects  in  Phase  A  completed  or  early  terminated;  these  data  were unblinded  (but  the  trial  sites  remained  blinded)  and  an  interim  CSR  was  written  to  provide  early information on safety.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 91 subjects were randomized and took at least 1 dose of IMP in Phase A of the trial. All 91 subjects were included in the safety and primary efficacy analyses for Phase

A. For the purposes of this trial:

- Subjects who were randomized and took IMP through the Month 12 visit in Phase A and completed some or all of the trial visit assessments were defined as Phase A on treatment completers.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Subjects who were randomized and discontinued IMP prior to the Month 12 visit in Phase A and completed some or all of the trial visit assessments were defined as Phase A off-treatment completers.
- Subjects who were randomized, took IMP, but did not complete the Phase A Month 12 visit or the Phase B Month 24 visit were defined as Trial non-completers.

A total of 84 (92.3%) subjects completed Phase A. The percentages of on-treatment completers were 91.7% in the tolvaptan group and 90.7% in the placebo group. There was 1 off-treatment completer (2.3%) in the placebo group and none in the tolvaptan group.

A total of 8 (8.8%) subjects discontinued the IMP prior to Month 12 in Phase A: 8.3% of the tolvaptan group and 9.3% of the placebo group.

A total of 81 subjects were enrolled into Phase B and took at least 1 dose of IMP. All 81 subjects were included in the safety analyses for Phase B. Of the 81 subjects, 69 subjects (85.2%) completed Phase B of the trial and 12 subjects (14.8%) discontinued from the trial. Six (7.4%) of the subjects completed Phase B of the trial off-treatment (i.e., these subjects discontinued IMP prior to the Phase B Month 24 visit  but  continued  with  trial  visit  assessments);  3  subjects  on  prior  tolvaptan  and  prior  placebo, respectively.

## CHMP comment

Demographic characteristics are well balanced between tolvaptan and placebo both in phase A and phase B. The most represented age group was 15 to17 years (37.5% and 37.2% in phase A and 40.5% and 35.9% in phase B) and almost all patients were white (95.8% and 97.7% in phase A and 100% and 97.4% in phase B). The overall mean age was 12.9 years (range: 5 - 17 years) and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 20.0 kg/m2 (range: 14.2 - 34.9 kg/m2).

Even if a diagnosis of ADPKD as defined by the presence of family history and/or genetic criteria (AND who had at least 10 renal cysts) was required by inclusion criteria, only a low number of subjects had a genetic testing done (29,2 % in tolvaptan group vs 30.2% in plb group), of which only 2 patients (14.3%) in the study group were ADPKD-1 positive. The majority of patients were aware of a positive family history before diagnosis (89.6% in tolva vs 90.7% in plb), however it is not clear if patients without a family history had a genetic diagnosis. This information should be included in case the MAH will apply for an extension of indication

Overall, the mean total kidney volume was higher in the placebo group (393.3 mL) than in tolva group (286.1 mL) suggesting a possible more advanced disease in this group of patients, even though the low number of patients (13 in plb group) makes difficult to draw firm conclusion.

## Number analysed

Three analysis sets were defined for the efficacy and safety analyses in this trial:

- The randomized analysis set consists of all subjects who were randomized in the trial.
- The full analysis set (FAS) for Phase A consists of all subjects who were randomized to a treatment group, received at least 1 dose of the IMP, and had both a Phase A baseline and at least 1 postbaseline efficacy evaluation. These subjects were analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were randomized. The FAS for Phase B consists of all subjects who enrolled to Phase B, received at least 1 dose of the IMP, and had both a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline efficacy evaluation in Phase B. The FAS, which is based on an intent-totreat principle, is the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses on the primary/key secondary endpoints and other secondary endpoints.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety analysis set consists of all subjects who were administered at least 1 dose of IMP. The safety dataset is being used for the safety analyses.

## Efficacy results

## Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints

The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the changes from baseline in spot urine osmolality and in specific gravity after 1 week of daily dosing in Phase A of the trial. The mean change from baseline in spot urine osmolality (premorning dose) after 1 week of daily dosing in Phase A was substantially greater in the tolvaptan group (-386 mOsm/kg, from 635 to 250 mOsm/kg) versus the placebo group (-93 mOsm/kg, from 646 to 553 mOsm/kg) (Table 2.5.4.6-1, below). These findings were consistent across age groups and for each sex.

The mean change from baseline in specific gravity (premorning dose) after 1 week of daily dosing in Phase A was greater in the tolvaptan group (-0.009, from 1.017 to 1.008) versus the placebo group (-0.002, from 1.017 to 1.015) (Table 2.5.4.6 2, below). The same trend was seen at 1 month. These findings were consistent across age groups and for each sex.

## CHMP comment

A greater change from baseline in spot urine osmolality as well as in specific gravity at 1 week, was observed in tolvaptan group than in placebo group and this is reassuring. Moreover, these changes are maintained up to 1 month from baseline. Results from the co-primary endpoints seem to suggest that tolvaptan is effective in reducing urine osmolality and in increasing the output of water, as could be expected from its mechanism of action (inhibition of V2 receptor). Therefore, these endpoints indicates that tolvaptan can inhibit the V2 receptor also in the pediatric population in a similar manner than in adults. However, even if recent studies seem to support the link between vasopressin V2R signalling and renal disease progression in ADPKD (Devuys O., 2016), these results need to be translated in a clinical effect, in particular in a reduction of clinical progression. Moreover, the study lack of a statistical analysis and therefore these results could be only considered as descriptive.

The mean change in spot urine osmolality from baseline across age groups was slightly lower in patients from 15-17 years (-378 mOsm/kg at week 1 and 295 at month 1) compared to patients from 12-14 years (-459 mOsm/kg at week 1 and -466 mOsm/kg at month 1), with a similar trend also for change from baseline in specific gravity. Moreover, a greater change of spot urine osmolality was observed in the placebo arm of patients aged 15-17, suggesting a minor effect of tolvaptan over placebo in this age group. Furthermore, no data results on co-primary endpoints have been provided in patients younger

## Key Secondary Endpoint

The mean percent change from baseline to 12 months in htTKV (as measured by MRI) for subjects 12 to 17 years old was smaller in the tolvaptan group (2.28%) versus the placebo group (6.11%) in Phase A (Table 2.5.4.7 1). One subject in the tolvaptan group was enrolled with a concomitant diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis and therefore had a notably larger kidney size when compared with the other subjects. When htTKV was assessed without the inclusion of this subject, the trend favoring tolvaptan remained intact: without this subject, the mean percent change from baseline to 12 months in htTKV (as measured by MRI) for subjects 12 to 17 years old was also smaller in the tolvaptan group (2.84%) versus the placebo group (6.11%).

When analyzed by subgroup, the mean percent change from baseline to 12 months in htTKV as measured by MRI was also consistently smaller in the tolvaptan group versus the placebo group for each age group and for each sex in Phase A (Table 2.5.4.7-2).

## CHMP comment

A smaller mean percent change from baseline to 12 months in htTKV (as measured by MRI) for subjects 12 to 17 years old was observed in the tolvaptan group (2.28%) versus the placebo group (6.11%) in Phase A. The results seem to be in line with those of the adult studies. A difference with placebo in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

change from baseline to 12 months in htTKV was constant by age groups, even though with more limited results in patients aged 15 to 17 Years.

Height- adjusted TKV (htTKV) on MRI is at present the most established imaging surrogate parameter for monitoring disease progression in adult with ADPKD and TKV was the one used as primary endpoint in TEMPO study supporting tolvaptan authorization in adult population. Despite the scarce knowledges relating to the htTKV value in pediatric population, it is reported in literature that the vast majority of children with ADPKD maintained normal kidney function despite progressive structural kidney disease, thus emphasizing the great importance of total kidney volume (TKV) as a measurable outcome of early disease progression and the primary focus of therapeutic intervention in the pediatric ADPKD population ( M. A. Cadnapaphornchai, 2017 ). Unfortunately, even if the difficulties in doing MRI mainly in younger and/or non-cooperative children who require sedation are acknowledged, it was noted that only data from 57 patients were provided, limiting the robustness of these results in support of the co-primary endpoints. However, data from ultrasound evaluation in 9 patients &lt; 12 years old have been provided, which seem to be no sufficiently supportive (see below among other secondary endpoints).

## Other Secondary Endpoints

The mean 24-hour fluid balance for all subjects prior to Week 1 in Phase A was 31 mL in the tolvaptan group versus 241 mL in the placebo group, and in Phase B was 138 mL in the prior tolvaptan group versus 207 mL for the prior placebo group prior to Week 1.

The mean change in renal function (eGFR by Schwartz formula) from baseline to 12 months in Phase A was -1.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the tolvaptan group versus -0.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the placebo group. To account for the known acute hemodynamic effects of tolvaptan, a supplemental analysis was done to determine the change in eGFR using Week 1 as a baseline in Phase A. In this analysis, the mean change in renal function (eGFR by Schwartz formula) from Week 1 to 12 months in Phase A was 2.6 versus  -3.2  mL/min/1.73  m2  in  the  tolvaptan  versus  placebo  groups,  respectively.  This  analysis indicates that, after accounting for hemodynamic effects, the placebo group experienced more loss of eGFR over 12 months than the tolvaptan group.

Age subgroup analyses of the mean change in renal function (eGFR by Schwartz formula) from baseline to 12 months in Phase A had similar results, except in the 15 to 17 year old subgroup, where the change was similar between treatment groups. For subjects 12 to 17 years old, the mean change in renal function from Week 1 to 12 months in Phase A was -0.1 versus -3. 5 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the tolvaptan versus placebo groups, respectively. The mean change in this time period was 1.5 vs. -1.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 for  males and -5.5 versus -0.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 for females in the tolvaptan and placebo groups, respectively.

In Phase B, the mean change from baseline to 24 months in renal function (eGFR by Schwartz formula) was greater in the prior placebo group versus the tolvaptan group (-10.3 versus -5.2 mL/min/1.73 m2), due to hemodynamic effects. In subgroup analyses of the same time period, mean renal function changes showed similar differences between treatment groups for each age group. The mean change in this time period for male subjects was also greater in the prior placebo group versus the prior tolvaptan group for both ma le and female subjects (-11.4 versus -6.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 in male subjects, and -9.4 versus -3.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 in female subjects, respectively).

The  mean  percent  change  from  Phase  A  baseline  to  24  months  in  Phase  B  in  htTKV (as measured by MRI) was consistently less in the prior tolvaptan group versus the prior placebo group in subjects 15 to 17 years old and in both females and males. The reverse was found in subjects 12 to 14 years old at 12 and 24 months: the mean change from baseline in htTKV was less in the prior placebo group versus the prior tolvaptan group.

In Phase B, the mean percent change in htTKV (measured by MRI) from Phase B baseline to 12 and 24 months was less  in  the  prior  placebo  group  (3.09%  and  7.35%,  respectively)  versus  the  prior tolvaptan group (7.68% and 13.55%, respectively). A similar result was seen in subgroup analyses for

each sex and age group, except for subjects 15 to 17 years old at 24 months, for whom the change was similar in both the prior placebo and prior tolvaptan groups.

No notable differences in Tanner Staging progression compared to normative populations were found between the two treatment groups at any time point in either Phase A or B, nor in the age and sex groups. The mean change in growth percentiles for height and weight from baseline to 12 months in Phase A was 1 in the tolvaptan group and -4 in the placebo group. In Phase B, the mean change in this endpoint was 3 in the prior tolvaptan group versus 4 in the prior placebo group at 12 months, and 0 in the prior tolvaptan group versus 5 in the prior placebo group at 24 months.

Health-related quality of life (HrQoL ) showed a sustained improvement with tolvaptan treatment across core domains and stable fatigue scores in Phase A, indicating a low level of disease and treatment burden as well as a high level of functioning. In Phase B, subjects in the prior placebo group generally improved  to  similar  levels  reported  by  subjects  in  the  prior  tolvaptan  group.  Both  groups  showed improved HrQoL scores compared to baseline during the treatment period.

## CHMP comment

A number of other secondary endpoints have been explored. Overall, they seem to be in line with coprimary and key secondary endpoints. The mean change in renal function ( eGFR by Schwartz formula) showed a difference between tolvaptan group and placebo when analyzed from week 1 to month 12 due to the hemodynamic effect. However, no difference between tolvaptan and placebo group in the mean change in renal function was observed in 15 to 17 years age group, while the change was more evident in females.

The mean percent change from Phase A baseline in htTKV as measured by ultrasound (for subjects &lt; 12 years old) at 12 months is slightly greater in the tolvaptan group (20.42%) than in the placebo group (16.27%) from baseline to month 12 in Phase A. Therefore change of htTKV measured by ultrasound seems to be not consistent with that of htTKV as measured by MRI in older patients arising further uncertainties on the evaluation of TKV in children mainly in younger. This aspect needs to be well justified at the time  of submission of data for the extension of indication. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data

Among the secondary endpoints there were PD endpoints such as urine volume (including 24-hour fluid volume), fluid intake and fluid balance, sodium, creatinine, and free water clearance during dense PK sampling (after at least 1 month on the investigational medicinal product [IMP]).

Other endpoints included tolvaptan PK parameters following dense PK sampling

The PK/PD analysis foreseen dense sampling in a subset of subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sampling

A subset of 20 subjects in the 12 to 17 year-old age group had dense PK and PD sampling conducted at selected  sites  after  at  least  1  month  of  IMP  treatment.  Samples  were  collected  predose  (within  15 minutes prior to the morning dose), 1, 2, 4, 8 (within 15 minutes prior to the afternoon dose), 12, and 24 hours post the morning dose. These subjects will be hospitalized the evening prior to the scheduled PK sampling (typically a Friday evening) and discharged after the 24 hour PK sample collection (typically Sunday morning).

For  dense  PK  sampling,  tolvaptan  concentrations  will  be  analyzed  by  noncompartmental  methods. Concentrations will be summarized with descriptive statistics by total daily dose of tolvaptan and time point. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized with descriptive statistics by total daily dose of tolvaptan. No subjects or data were excluded from the dense PK/PD analysis.

The DM-4103 metabolite has a half-life of approximately 180 hours and, consequently, is a good marker of long-term compliance with dosing.

## Bioanalytical report

Plasma samples were analyzed for tolvaptan (OPC-41061) and its metabolites, DM-4103 and DM-4107, using a validated  high-performance liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS/MS). Tolvaptan, metabolites, and the internal standard OPC-41100 were extracted from human plasma containing sodium heparin as an anticoagulant using solid phase extraction. The method was validated for concentrations ranging from 5.00 to 1000 ng/mL for tolvaptan, 12.5 to 12500 ng/mL for DM-4103, and 12.5 to 2500 ng/mL for DM-4107.

*All samples (except for sample #27 for incurred sample re-analysis) were analyzed within the determined storage stability period for 1025 days at a nominal temperature of -70°C.

A total of 276 samples were analyzed for OPC-41061 and DM-4107. A total of 275 samples were analyzed for DM-4103.

## Individual Subject Tolvaptan Plasma Concentrations Following Tolvaptan Split-dose Regimens in Subjects With ADPKD, 12 to 17 Years Old

<!-- image -->

Note: Lower limit of quantitation of tolvaptan is 5.00 ng/mL.

The TDD split-dose regimens were as follows: 22.5 mg (15/7.5), 37.5 mg (22.5/15), 45 mg (30/15), and 60 mg (45/15). Source: CSR 156-12-298 PKT-2.1 through PKT-2.4.

The same plot with overlay of mean tolvaptan concentrations following tolvaptan administered as a TDD of 60 mg to healthy adult subjects is presented in PKF-1, Panel A.

A composite plot of the concentration-time curves normalized to a 1 mg/kg TDD for each subject and overlaid with mean healthy subject concentrations normalized to a 1 mg/kg TDD is presented in PKF-1, Panel B.

Note: Overlaid on Panel A are mean tolvaptan plasma concentrations following a 45 mg/15 mg split-dose regimen given to 18 healthy adult subjects (CSR 156-07-262, PKT-2). Panel B presents the same concentrations nonmalized to a 1 mg/kg dose for each subject or the mean of adult subjects in 156-07-262 trial; for the adult data, the dose was 60 mg and the mean body weight of all subjects was 75 kg (CSR 15607-262, PKT-1).

Souce: PKT-1, PKT-2.1 to PKT-2.4

Intersubject variability of tolvaptan plasma concentrations was large even after normalization of doses to a 1 mg/kg TDD.

DM-4103 has a long half-life, approximately 180 hours, making DM-4103 concentrations a good marker of compliance because concentrations accumulate, up to 30 μg/mL in adults dosed with tolvaptan 120 mg  daily.  Steady-state  concentrations  following  60  mg  daily  are  rarely below  1  μg/mL.  Therefore, subjects with consistent concentrations below this level yet reporting daily dosing at 60 mg/day or higher would be considered noncompliant with their  reported  dosing.  If  expected  concentrations  were  500 ng/mL, as might be observed following a 37.5-mg daily dose, subjects with concentrations near or less than  the  LLOQ  (12.5  ng/mL)  would  have  discontinued  IMP  about  5  weeks  previously.  DM-4103 concentrations at Week 1 and Month 1 were consistent with reported dosing for all subjects with an evaluable sample. At Month 6, 1 of 42 subjects (2.4%) with a PK sample was not compliant with reported dosing. At Month 12, 5 additional subjects (for a total of 6 out of 40 subjects [15%]) had DM-4103 concentrations ranging from 0 to &lt; 140 ng/mL (PKT-4), indicating noncompliance with reported dosing and limited to no dosing within the previous weeks.

## Pharmacodynamics Results

The pharmacodynamic analysis includes:

- Urine osmolality and specific gravity
- 24-hour fluid balance
- Serum sodium, creatinine, and osmolality
- Urine volume and urine sodium, creatinine, and osmolality
- Fluid intake
- Palatability and acceptability of tolvaptan formulation

Fluid intake and urine output were higher in the tolvaptan group, which is not surprising given tolvaptan's aquaretic effects. Subjects appeared to maintain a neutral fluid balance, as fluid balance was close to zero over 24 hours.

In addition to increasing urine output, tolvaptan administration produced decreases in urine osmolality and increases in free water clearance, indicating target engagement at the V2 receptor for the 24-hour dosing interval in all subjects, despite the range of doses being taken.

Serum sodium and osmolality concentrations fluctuated during the day, predose and 24-hour postdose concentrations were similar.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After a review of the data, PK/PD correlations were not explored. Subjects participating in the dense PK/PD sampling took tolvaptan daily doses ranging from 22.5 mg to 60 mg. Even after normalizing concentrations to a 1 mg/kg dose, concentrations were highly variable (PKF-1, Panel B), but all tolvaptan doses reduced urine osmolality to the same extent during the 24-hour sampling period. Intersubject variability in urine output following tolvaptan dosing was high with 24-hour urine volumes ranging from 4245 to 13550 mL, with no obvious dose-response relationship.

## MAH's conclusions

For subjects participating in the dense PK/PD sampling:

- Intersubject variability of tolvaptan plasma concentrations was large even after normalization of doses.
- Tolvaptan administration produced increases in free water clearance and urine output with decreases in urine osmolality, indicating target engagement at the V2 receptor.
- Subjects appeared to be maintaining their fluid balance, as fluid balance for 24 hours was close to zero and serum sodium and osmolality were similar at predose and 24 hours postdose.
- As expected, excretion of sodium and sodium clearance was not changed by tolvaptan administration.
- PK/PD correlations were not performed, as visual inspection of intersubject variability in PD responses indicated no obvious dose response.

## CHMP comment

The study samples were analysed for determination of tolvaptan, DM-4103 and DM-4107 using HPLCMS/MS according to a mentioned validation report dated 2015; however, this validation report is not included  in  the  current  dossier.  All  samples  were  analysed  in  the  LTS  range  and  were  within  the established calibration range. Twenty subjects of 12-17 years of age (12 in treatment arm and 8 in placebo arm) were included in a subset of patient with dense PK/PD sampling conducted after 1 month of treatment at predose, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours post the morning dose. No subjects below 12 years of age had dense PK sampling.

The doses administered to these 12 patients at 1 month after the start of treatment were 22.5 mg (15/7.5 mg, N=1), 37.5 mg (22.5/15 mg, N=3), 45 mg (30/15 mg, N=3) and 60 mg (45/15 mg, N=5).

According to the selected tolvaptan dose based on weight, subjects ≥ 45 kg to ≤ 75 kg were administered with a starting dose of 30/15 mg tolvaptan; if tolerated, the starting dose was followed by, after 1 week, a dose of 45/15 mg. Six subjects (out of 12 treated with tolvaptan) weighting between 55 kg and 71.2 kg, at 1 month of treatment, had a down-titration at the starting dose (2 subjects remained on 45 mg) or less than the starting dose (e.g. one subject weighing approximately 70 kg, should have taken a final dose of 60 mg, whereas they took 22.5 mg). The reasons why a high percentage of patients downgraded to a lower dose of that foreseen after 1 month are not clear since overall seems to suggest it could be inadequate (safety concerns?). In case the MAH will apply for an extension of indication clarification is expected.

The PK analysis showed that the median Tmax was reached after 2 hours for all morning doses except for 22.5 mg dose that however was administered to only one subject. The Tmax after the afternoon doses, according to the provided figure, seems to be delayed (about 4 h). The median Cmax seems not increase with increasing dose, the median AUC0-24h although similar between doses, showed a very high variability, presumably due to the low number of patients. The metabolites DM-4103 and DM-4107 were also determined in samples. DM-4103 was used to check the compliance to the treatment, with 6

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

out of 40 subjects (of which 2 in dense PK sampling) non-compliant. The MAH provides individual plasma concentrations during dense PK/PD sampling period in paediatrics overlaid with mean tolvaptan plasma concentrations in healthy adults following a 45 mg/15 mg split-dose regimen, normalised by dose. It is noted that in paediatric patients dosed with 45 mg (30/15 mg, N=3) and 60 mg (45/15 mg, N=5) after one month of treatment, showed Cmax values higher than in adults after the morning dose. Therefore, an adequate definition and a comprehensive discussion of the selected dose, including the starting one, is expected in case the MAH will apply for an extension of indication.

In subjects with dense PD sampling, urine osmolality and specific gravity, 24-hours fluid balance, serum sodium, creatinine and osmolality, urine volume and urine sodium, were determined.

The urine osmolality decrease in all dose groups, urine volume and free water clearance increase in all groups, 24-hours fluid balance remain unchanged, sodium excretion and clearance did not change; no clear  trend  between  dose  groups  is  observed  for  serum  sodium,  creatinine  and  osmolality  and  the creatinine clearance. These results have no clear relationship with administered doses and can only confirm the aquaretic effect of tolvaptan due to its mechanism of action.

Among the PD analysis, the protocol foreseen the palatability and acceptability of tolvaptan formulation; however, no data is provided.

## Safety results

## Extent of Exposure

All 91 randomized subjects in Phase A received at least 1 dose of IMP and were included in the safety analyses. Exposure up to 361 to 390 days was achieved in 33 of 48 subjects (68.8%) in the tolvaptan group and 29 of 43 subjects (67.4%) in the placebo group. The average daily dose during that time was 40.4 mg in the tolvaptan group and 52.6 mg in the placebo group.

For subjects 12 to 17 years old, 12 subjects were on a modal TDD of 45 mg tolvaptan while 13 subjects were on a modal TDD of 37.5 or 60 mg tolvaptan at 12 months. For subjects &lt; 12 years old, 4 subjects were on a modal TDD of 22.5 mg tolvaptan and 4 subjects were on a modal TDD of 15 mg tolvaptan at 12 months.

All 81 enrolled subjects in Phase B received at least 1 dose of IMP and were included in the safety analyses. Exposure up to 691 to 720 days was achieved in 21 of 42 subjects (50.0%) in the prior tolvaptan group and 19 of 39 subjects (48.7%) in the prior placebo group. The average daily dose during that time was 37.5 mg in the prior tolvaptan group and 38.7 mg in the prior placebo group.

## CHMP comment

More than half of patients achieved a 1 year of exposure both in tolvaptan and placebo group. The average daily dose was different among age groups, and this is expected. However, it was noted that modal TDD was different among patients within the same age group, with the majority of patient of 12 to 17 years as well as &lt; 12 years taking 45 mg of modal TDD in tolvaptan group. However, the number of patients taking different TDD seem to be balanced within the group. In phase B almost 50% of patients achieved up to 720 days of exposure and the average daily dose remained 37.5 mg in the prior tolvaptan group.

See comment above regarding the dose.

Overall, a total of 613 TEAEs were reported for 77 of 81 subjects (95.1%) during Phase B of the trial (CT-2.8.1.1). The incidence of TEAEs was lower in the prior tolvaptan group (38 subjects [90.5%]) than in the prior placebo group (39 subjects [100.0%]) (Table 12.2.1-2). Serious TEAEs were reported in 7 subjects in the prior tolvaptan group and 8 subjects in the placebo group, while discontinuations due to AEs were reported in 3 subjects in the prior placebo group only. There were no deaths reported in this trial.

The incidence of aquaretic TEAEs (Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  [MedDRA]  preferred terms of dry mouth, thirst, polydipsia, nocturia, pollakiuria, and polyuria) in Phase A was higher in the tolvaptan group (31 of 48 subjects [64.6%]) than in the placebo group (7 of 43 subjects [16.3%]) (Table 12.2.2.1-2). The most frequently reported aquaretic TEAEs in the tolvaptan group were polyuria (27.1% tolvaptan versus 4.7% placebo) and pollakiuria (18.8% tolvaptan versus 0.0% placebo).

The incidence  of dehydration-related TEAEs (including  all  preferred  terms  under  the  dehydration standardised  MedDRA queries [SMQ] that were reported in this trial)  in  Phase  A  was  higher  in  the tolvaptan group (17 of 48 subjects [35.4%]) than in the placebo group (6 of 43 subjects [14.0%]) (Table 12.2.2.1-3). The most frequently reported dehydration-related TEAEs in the tolvaptan group were thirst (14.6% tolvaptan versus 4.7% placebo) and orthostatic hypotension (10.4% tolvaptan versus 0.0% placebo).

## Related Treatment-emergent Adverse Events

The most frequently reported TEAEs (occurring in at least 10% of subjects in the tolvaptan group and at a higher incidence than the placebo group) assessed by the investigator as related to the IMP in Phase A were as follows:

- Polyuria (27.1% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo)
- Pollakiuria (18.8% tolvaptan versus 0.0% placebo)
- Blood creatinine increased (16.7% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo)
- Nocturia (14.6% tolvaptan versus 7.0% placebo)
- Thirst (12.5% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo)
- Headache (10.4% tolvaptan versus 4.7% placebo)
- Polydipsia (10.4% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo)

The most frequently reported TEAE (occurring in at least 10% of subjects overall) assessed by the investigator as related to the IMP in Phase B were as follows:

- Blood creatinine increased (14.3% prior tolvaptan versus 12.8% prior placebo)
- Headache (4.8% prior tolvaptan versus 17.9% prior placebo)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Polyuria (4.8% prior tolvaptan versus 33.3% prior placebo)

## CHMP comment

A similar rate of patients with TEAE were reported in tolvaptan and placebo group in phase A (91.7% and 97.7%, respectively). They were all no serious TEAEs, except for 1 patient in tolvaptan group and 6 patients in placebo group who experienced serious TEAEs. Discontinuations due to AEs were reported in 1 subject in each treatment group, while no deaths were reported in this study.

In  phase  B  of  the  trial  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  lower  in  the  prior  tolvaptan  group  (38  subjects [90.5%]) than in the prior placebo group (39 subjects [100.0%]), as well as serious TEAEs (16.7% vs 20.5%).

The most frequently reported TEAEs which occurred more frequently in at least 10% of subjects in the tolvaptan group than in the placebo group in Phase A were: polyuria (27.1% tolvaptan versus 4.7% placebo), Blood creatinine increased (18.8% vs 4.7%), pollakiuria (18.8% vs 0.0%), cough (14.6% vs 11.6%), nocturia (14.6%  vs  7.0%), thirst (14.6%  vs  4.7%),  abdominal  pain  (12.5%  vs  7.0%), constipation (10.4% vs 2.3%), orthostatic hypotension (10.4% vs 0.0% placebo), polydipsia (10.4% vs 2.3%), abdominal pain upper (10.4% vs 9.3%). The incidence of aquaretic TEAEs and dehydrationrelated TEAEs was higher in the tolvaptan group than in the placebo group (64.4% vs 16.3% and 35.4% vs 14%). These AEs are expected due to the mechanism of action of the drug and to the known safety profile in adult patients and are reflected in the SmPC, however they are considered of concern in a pediatric population, mainly in younger patients, more sensitive to acquaretic AEs. Moreover, most of these AEs are also the more frequently TEAEs related to study drug. However, it was noted that in phase B of the trial they are reduced in tolvaptan group ad increased in placebo group, maybe due to titration in the early stage.

This trial had a small number of subjects and no formal subgroup analyses were performed for the TEAEs in the trial.

## Deaths and other serious adverse events

No deaths occurred during the trial

In Phase A of the trial there was 1 subject in the tolvaptan group who had a serious TEAE of viral pericarditis which the investigator assessed as moderate severity and not related to tolvaptan. The subject was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of chest pain, dizziness, and suspected endocarditis. No corrective treatments were administered, and the event resolved after 8 days.

There were 6 subjects in the placebo group who had serious TEAEs: 1 subject had a hand fracture and ulna  fracture,  1  subject  had  hematuria  and  renal  pain,  1  subject  had  an  intentional  overdose  and intentional self-injury, and 1 subject each had petit mal epilepsy, pelvic pain, and hypertensive crisis. None of the serious TEAEs reported in both treatment groups were assessed by the investigator as related to the IMP.

In Phase B of the trial there were 7 subjects in the prior tolvaptan group who had serious TEAEs (see table below).

The event of ulcerative colitis was assessed by the investigator as severe and not related to tolvaptan. The subject was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and increased frequency of blood in the stool.  As  a  result  of  this  event,  dosing  of  tolvaptan  was  interrupted.  Corrective  treatments  included methylprednisone and the event resolved after 7 days.

One serious TEAE of ALT increased in 1 subject and serious TEAEs of ALT and AST increased in 1 subject were all assessed by the investigator as related to the IMP

## CHMP comment

Overall, the frequency of serious TEAEs was lower in the tolvaptan group both in Phase A and B. Serious adverse events were reported in 1 patient in phase A in tolvaptan group (viral pericarditis) which was considerate moderate in intensity and not related by the investigator and in 7 patients in phase B in prior tolvaptan group of which the event of ulcerative colitis was reported as not related by the investigator. One serious TEAE of ALT increased in 1 subject and serious TEAEs of ALT and AST increased in 1 subject were all assessed by the investigator as related to the IMP.

. No death was reported in this trial.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## AEs leading to discontinuation

One subject in the tolvaptan group discontinued IMP due to pollakiuria and 1 subject in the placebo group discontinued IMP due to dizziness, both in Phase A. Both events were assessed by the investigator as moderate severity and as related to the IMP.

Three subjects in Phase B discontinued IMP due to eating disorder, polyuria, and liver function test increased. All events were assessed by the investigator as moderate severity and the event of polyuria was assessed as related to the IMP.

## AEs of special interest (AESI)

There were no adverse events of special interest (AESI) reported during the trial.

For  the  5  hepatic  standardised  MedDRA  queries  (SMQs;  cholestasis  and  jaundice  of  hepatic  origin; hepatic failure, fibrosis and cirrhosis, and other liver damage-related conditions; noninfectious hepatitis; liver-related investigations, signs, and symptoms;  and liver-related coagulation and bleeding disturbances), in Phase A there was 1 TEAE of increased blood bilirubin in the placebo group. In Phase B in the prior tolvaptan group there were 5 subjects with TEAEs: 3 TEAEs of increased ALT, 1 TEAE of increased AST, and 1 TEAE of increased hepatic enzymes; in the prior placebo group there were 6 subjects with TEAEs: 3 TEAEs of increased AST, 2 TEAEs of increased LFT, and 1 TEAE each of increased ALT, increased blood bilirubin, and increased hepatic enzyme, respectively. Six subjects spontaneously recovered without intervention, in 4 subjects treatment was interrupted, and in 1 subject treatment was withdrawn (withdrawal was not related to hepatic AEs).

## Pregnancy

There were no pregnancies reported during the trial

## Laboratory Values

Changes from baseline were observed for various serum chemistry and hematology parameters; however, none of the changes were considered to be clinically meaningful.

Any  shifts  from  the  normal  limits  at  baseline  to  outside  of  the  reference  limits  (low  or  high)  at postbaseline  evaluations  for  clinical  laboratory  parameters  were  not  considered  to  be  clinically meaningful.

Changes from baseline were observed for erythrocytes and leukocytes in urinalysis however, none of the changes were considered to be clinically meaningful.

There were no cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in either phase of the trial.

There were no subjects who experienced elevated transaminases and no potentially clinically significant (PCS) elevations in hepatic laboratory data were reported during Phase A of the trial. Four subjects experienced PCS elevations in hepatic laboratory data during Phase B of the trial, including 3 serious AEs (1 prior tolvaptan subject and 2 prior placebo subjects) and 1 AE leading to discontinuation (prior placebo  subject).  The  4  PCS  elevations  in  hepatic  laboratory  data  were  reviewed  independently  by hepatic adjudication committee and considered unlikely related to tolvaptan.

In Phase A , PCS increases in creatinine occurred in 4 subjects in the tolvaptan group and in no subjects in the placebo group. In addition, the following PCS laboratory test results were reported: 2 placebo

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects had a decrease in neutrophils, 1 placebo subject had a decrease in glucose, and 1 tolvaptan subject had an increase in potassium.

In Phase B , PCS increases in creatinine occurred in 3 subjects in the prior tolvaptan group and in 3 subjects in the prior placebo group. In addition, the following PCS laboratory test results were reported: 3 subjects (2 prior tolvaptan and 1 prior placebo) had a decrease in neutrophils, 1 prior tolvaptan subject had  an  increase  in  triglycerides  and  3  prior  placebo  subjects  each  had  an  increase  in  sodium  and potassium and a decrease in glucose.

## Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety

Changes  from  baseline  were  observed  for  vital  sign  parameters  throughout  the  trial;  however,  the changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful, with the exception of the TEAEs noted below.

The incidence of PCS vital signs was similar between the treatment groups. For both phases the most frequently reported finding was diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≤ 80 mmHg and decrease from baseline ≥ 15 mmHg, which in Phase A occurred in 6 of 48 subjects (12.5%) in the tolvaptan group and 8 of 43 subjects (18.6%) in the placebo group, and in Phase B occurred in 7 of 42 subjects (16.7%) in the prior tolvaptan group and 5 of 39 subjects (12.8%) in the prior placebo group.

The following TEAEs related to vital signs were reported during Phase A of the trial (with a system organ class of investigations or vascular disorders):

- Orthostatic hypotension (10.4% tolvaptan versus 0.0% placebo)
- Hypertension (8.3% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo)
- Hypotension (4.2% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo)
- Weight decreased (4.2% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo)
- Peripheral coldness (2.1% tolvaptan versus 0.0% placebo)
- Hypertensive crisis (0.0% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo)

The following TEAEs related to vital signs were reported during Phase B of the trial (with a system organ class of investigations or vascular disorders):

- Hypertension (9.5% prior tolvaptan versus 5.1% prior placebo)
- Orthostatic hypotension (7.1% prior tolvaptan versus 7.7% prior placebo)
- Hypotension (4.8% prior tolvaptan versus 7.7% prior placebo)
- Body temperature increased (2.4% prior tolvaptan versus 0.0% prior placebo)
- Heart rate decreased (2.4% prior tolvaptan versus 0.0% prior placebo)
- Heart rate increased (2.4% prior tolvaptan versus 2.6% prior placebo)
- Weight decreased (2.4% prior tolvaptan versus 12.8% prior placebo)
- Peripheral coldness (0.0% prior tolvaptan versus 2.6% prior placebo)

## CHMP comment

Overall, changes of laboratory values were reported as no clinically meaningful by the MAH. The 4 PCS elevations in hepatic laboratory occurred both in prior tolvaptan (1 serious AE) and in prior placebo

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects, were considered unlikely related to tolvaptan by hepatic adjudication committee. However, due to the known hepatic toxicity of tolvaptan coming from adult's studies , the correlation with study drug cannot be completely excluded also in the pediatric population and it is considered of concern. No cases of DILI meeting Hy's Law laboratory cr iteria occurred.

An imbalance in PCS increase of creatinine was reported in favour of placebo group in phase A of the trial (4 subjects vs 0, respectively). In phase B of the trial it was reported in 3 subjects both in tolvaptan and in placebo group. I addition, blood creatinine increase was also reported as one of the most common related-TEAEs (16.7% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo in phase A and 14.3% prior tolvaptan versus 12.8% prior placebo in phase B). In the MAH's opinion, it can be considered a known, reversible, and expected effect secondary to the hemodinamic effect of the drug.

Moreover, 3 subjects (2 prior tolvaptan and 1 prior placebo) had a decrease in neutrophils, 1 prior tolvaptan subject had an increase in triglycerides, and 3 prior placebo subjects each had an increase in sodium and potassium and a decrease in glucose.

A number of TEAEs related to vital signs were reported in phase A and were more frequent in tolvaptan group than in placebo group (Orthostatic hypotension, Hypertension, Hypotension, Weight decreased and Peripheral coldness). Most of them could be related to dehydration. A diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≤ 80 mmHg and decrease from baseline ≥ 15 mmHg was the most frequently reported finding which occurred in both treatment groups and in a higher rate in subjects in the prior tolvaptan group (16.7%) than in prior placebo group (12.8%).

## 2.2.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

For this Article 46 procedure, the MAH submitted the final report for study 156-12-298 , a Phase 3b, Two-part,  Multicenter,  One  Year  Randomized,  Double-blind,  Placebo-controlled  Trial  of  the  Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Tolvaptan followed by a Two Year Open-label Extension in Child.

## Study design

The trial comprised 2 phases: Phase A: 12 months, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase to compare tolvaptan with placebo. It was open to subjects between the ages of 4 and 17 years, inclusive. Additionally,  in  accordance  with  the  PIP  requirements  subjects  aged  4  to  11  years  were  eligible  for participation following discussion with the medical monitor who met criteria for entry to be enrolled concurrently during the recruitment period for the target population. Qualified subjects who completed Phase A were eligible to continue into Phase B, an open-label phase during which subjects who had completed Phase A of the trial received treatment with tolvaptan for 24 months in order to obtain safety and efficacy data for long-term use of tolvaptan in children and adolescent subjects with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD).

The study design with 12 months double-blind treatment duration could be considered sufficient to detect the potential benefit of tolvaptan over placebo in a pediatric population and is in accordance with the PIP requirement. However, it is of note that only descriptive statistics were provided and therefore no firm conclusion can be drawn on efficacy of tolvaptan in pediatric population.

The diagnosis of ADPKD was defined by the presence of family history and/or genetic criteria AND who had at least 10 renal cysts, each of which measured at least 0.5 cm confirmed upon MRI inspection. Subjects who were MRI-naive or under the age of 12 must have had at least 4 cysts (at least 1 cm in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

size) confirmed by ultrasound prior to MRI inspection and this could be considered acceptable as MRI usually requires sedation in younger children.

As is already done in TEMPO study with adult dosing, participants received a higher dose early in the day,  followed  by  a  lower  dose  administered  approximately  8 -9  h  later,  in  order  to  obtain  maximal inhibition on waking and a gradual fall-off of effect during the night, when frequent urination would lead to  interruption  of  sleep  and  this  is  acceptable.  The  study  protocol  foreseen  a  questionnaire  to  be administered during Phase A to all subjects immediately after dosing to assess palatability and the easily to swallow the tablets. Unfortunately, no data is provided on this topic, although, in case the MAH will apply for an extension of indication, it could be important to know if there were patients who did not managed to take tablets as well as if tablets has been crushed prior the administration.

## Endpoints

The coprimary endpoints were the change from baseline in spot urine osmolality (premorning dose) and specific gravity (premorning dose) after 1 week of daily dosing in Phase A.

The key secondary endpoint was the percent change from Phase A baseline in height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 12 months.

A number of other secondary and exploratory endpoints were used.

The choice of the co-primary endpoint is in line with the PIP requirements, but different to the primary endpoint used in the adult study (TEMPO) in which it was the rate of total kidney volume (TKV) change, which is considered an important endpoint considering that measures of renal volume seem to be linked to the progressive development of renal cysts in ADPKD, and correlate with renal function. From the other hand it is acknowledged that changes in TKV growth could be difficult to detect in pediatric subjects. However, the percent change from Phase A baseline in height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) was the key secondary endpoint in the current pediatric study which could be considered as supportive.

Demographic  characteristics  were  well  balanced  between  tolvaptan  and  placebo.  A  low  number  of subjects had a genetic testing done (29,2 % in tolvaptan group vs 30.2% in plb group), of which only 2 patients (14.3%) in the study group were ADPKD-1 positive. The majority of patients were aware of a positive family history before diagnosis (89.6% in tolva vs 90.7% in plb). However, it is not clear if patients without a family history had a genetic diagnosis.

Overall, the mean total kidney volume was higher in the placebo group (393.3 mL) than in tolvaptan group (286.1 mL) suggesting a possible more advanced disease in this group of patients that could be a bias, even though the low number of patients (13 in plb group) limits any firm conclusion.

## Efficacy

A greater change from baseline in spot urine osmolality as well as in specific gravity at 1 week was observed in tolvaptan group than in placebo group and was maintained up to 1 month from baseline and this is reassuring. Results from the co-primary endpoints suggest that tolvaptan is effective in reducing urine osmolality and in increasing the output of water, as could be expected from its mechanism of action (inhibition of V2 receptor). Therefore, these endpoints indicates that tolvaptan can inhibit the V2 receptor also in the pediatric population in a similar manner than in adults. However, even if recent studies seem to support the link between vasopressin V2R signaling and renal disease progression in ADPKD (Devuys O., 2016), these results need to be translated in a clinical effect, in particular in a reduction of clinical progression. Moreover, the study lack of a statistical analysis and therefore these results could be only considered as descriptive. Moreover, a greater change of spot urine osmolality was observed in the placebo arm of patients aged 15-17, suggesting a minor effect of tolvaptan over placebo in this age group. A possible reason of such imbalance in results of co-primary endpoints in patients younger than

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

12 years should be provided or otherwise this lack should be justified  in case the MAH will apply for an extension of indication.

A smaller mean percent change from baseline to 12 months in htTKV (as measured by MRI) for subjects 12 to 17 years old was observed in the tolvaptan group (2.28%) versus the placebo group (6.11%) in Phase A. The results seem to be in line with those of the adult studies.

Height- adjusted TKV (htTKV) on MRI is at present the most established imaging surrogate parameter for monitoring disease progression in adult with ADPKD and TKV was the one used as primary endpoint in TEMPO study supporting tolvaptan authorization in adult population. Despite the scarce knowledges relating to the htTKV value in pediatric population, it is reported in literature that the vast majority of children with ADPKD maintained normal kidney function despite progressive structural kidney disease, thus emphasizing the great importance of total kidney volume (TKV) as a measurable outcome of early disease progression and the primary focus of therapeutic intervention in the pediatric ADPKD population (M. A. Cadnapaphornchai, 2017).

Even if difficulties in doing MRI mainly in younger and/or non-cooperative children who require sedation are acknowledged, only data from 57 patients were provided, limiting the robustness of these results in support of the co-primary endpoints. Data from ultrasound evaluation in 9 patients &lt; 12 years old have been provided, which seem to be no sufficiently supportive.

A number of other secondary endpoints have been explored. Overall, they seem to be in line with coprimary and key secondary endpoints. The mean change in renal function (eGFR by Schwartz formula) showed a difference between tolvaptan group and placebo when analyzed from week 1 to month 12 due to the hemodynamic effect. However, no difference between tolvaptan and placebo group in the mean change in renal function was observed in 15 to 17 years age group, while the change was more evident in females.

Among the secondary endpoints there were PD endpoints such as urine volume (including 24-hour fluid volume), fluid intake and fluid balance, sodium, creatinine, and free water clearance during dense PK sampling (after at least 1 month).

Other endpoints included tolvaptan PK parameters following dense PK sampling

A high percentage of patients downgraded to a lower dose of that foreseen after 1 month this could suggest occurrence of safety concerns or in any case raises doubts on the adequateness of the starting dose. The reasons that lead to downgrade the dose should be provided in case the MAH will apply for an extension of indication.

Moreover, in paediatric patients dosed with 45 mg (30/15 mg, N=3) and 60 mg (45/15 mg, N=5) after one month of treatment, showed Cmax values higher than in adults after the morning dose. Therefore, an adequate definition and a comprehensive discussion of the selected dose, including the starting one, is expected in case the MAH will apply for an extension of indication.

## Safety

Overall, the safety profile of tolvaptan seems to be in line with that observed in adults (with the exception of  cough)  and  associated  with  its  aquaretic  properties.  The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  in  the tolvaptan group than in the placebo group in phase A were: polyuria (27.1% tolvaptan versus 4.7% placebo), Blood creatinine increased (18.8% vs 4.7%), pollakiuria (18.8% vs 0.0%), cough (14.6% vs 11.6%),  nocturia  (14.6%  vs  7.0%),  thirst  (14.6%  vs  4.7%),  abdominal  pain  (12.5%  vs  7.0%), constipation (10.4% vs 2.3%), orthostatic hypotension (10.4% vs 0.0% placebo), polydipsia (10.4% vs 2.3%), abdominal pain upper (10.4% vs 9.3%). The incidence of aquaretic TEAEs and dehydration-

related TEAEs was higher in the tolvaptan group than in the placebo group (64.4% vs 16.3% and 35.4% vs 14%). These AEs are expected due to the mechanism of action of the drug and to the known safety profile in adult patients and are reflected in the SmPC, however they are considered of concern in a pediatric population, mainly in younger patients, more sensitive to acquaretic AEs.

The frequency of serious TEAEs was lower in the tolvaptan group both in Phase A and B. Serious adverse events  were  reported  in  1  patient  in  phase  A  in  tolvaptan  group (viral  pericarditis) which  was considered moderate in intensity and not related by the investigator and in 7 patients in phase B in prior tolvaptan group of which the event of ulcerative colitis was reported as not related by the investigator. However, no information on seriousness and relationship with study drug were reported about the other serious adverse events in phase B. No death was reported in this trial.

In phase A, only one subject in the tolvaptan group discontinued IMP due to pollakiuria and the event was assessed by the investigator as moderate in severity and as related to the IMP. Three subjects in Phase B discontinued IMP due to eating disorder, polyuria, and liver function test increased. All events were assessed by the investigator as moderate severity and the event of polyuria was assessed as related to the IMP.

Changes of laboratory values were reported as no clinically meaningful by the MAH. No cases of DILI meeting Hy's Law laboratory criteria occurred. 4 PCS elevations in hepatic laboratory occurred both in prior tolvaptan (1 serious AE) and in prior placebo subjects, were considered unlikely related to tolvaptan by hepatic adjudication committee. One serious TEAE of ALT increased in 1 subject and serious TEAEs of ALT and AST increased in 1 subject were all assessed by the investigator as related to the IM. Therefore, considering the known hepatic toxicity of tolvaptan coming from adult's studies, the correlation with study drug cannot be excluded also in the pediatric population and it is considered of concern in such population.

An imbalance in PCS increase of creatinine was reported in favour of placebo group in phase A of the trial (4 subjects vs 0, respectively). In phase B of the trial it was reported in 3 subjects both in tolvaptan and in placebo group. In addition, blood creatinine increase was also reported as one of the most common related-TEAEs (16.7% tolvaptan versus 2.3% placebo in phase A and 14.3% prior tolvaptan versus 12.8% prior placebo in phase B). In the MAH's opinion, it can be considered a known, reversible, and expected  effect  secondary  to  the  haemodynamic  effect  of  the  drug.  Moreover,  3  subjects  (2  prior tolvaptan and 1 prior placebo) had a decrease in neutrophils, 1 prior tolvaptan subject had an increase in  triglycerides,  and  3  prior  placebo  subjects  each  had  an  increase  in  sodium  and  potassium  and  a decrease in glucose.

A number of TEAEs related to vital signs were reported in phase A and were more frequent in tolvaptan group than in placebo group (Orthostatic hypotension, Hypertension, Hypotension, Weight decreased and Peripheral coldness). Most of them, such as orthostatic hypotension, could be related to dehydration and may be secondary to inadequate fluid intake to replace fluid loss. However, these effects could be less  tolerated  in  children  and  also  more  harmful.  A  diastolic  blood  pressure (DBP)  ≤  80  m mHg and decrease from baseline ≥ 15 mmHg was the most frequently reported finding which occurred in both treatment groups and in a higher rate in subjects in the prior tolvaptan group (16.7%) than in prior placebo group (12.8%).

The MAH proposes no adjustments of the SmPC.

## 3. CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation

Study results indicate that tolvaptan is able to inhibit the V2 receptor also in the paediatric population in a similar manner than in adult one with potential beneficial effects. However, the limited sample size, the lack of a formal statistical analysis limit the robustness of the conclusion. Importantly, study results do not allow an adequate definition of the dose, this is expected to be addressed in case the MAH will decide to submit these data in the context of a variation. The safety profile seems to be similar to that of the adults (with few new signals like cough) and characterized mostly by aquaretic properties and their  relative  effects,  such  as  orthostatic  hypotension,  which  may  be  less  tolerated  by  a  paediatric population and also more harmful. Moreover, hepatic toxicity is also of concern in a paediatric population.
