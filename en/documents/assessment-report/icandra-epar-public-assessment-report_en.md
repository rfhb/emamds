## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.

Therefore,  consent  from  the  MAH  of  the  Eucreas  application,  which  had  been  submitted  as  a  full application under Art 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, has been given allowing access to Module  2  to  Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any  subsequent  postmarketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. The application for Vildagliptin/metformin hydrochloride Novartis  consists only of Module 1 information.

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Vildagliptin/metformin hydrochloride Novartis medicinal  product  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  profile  of  Eucreas. Information on the scientific discussions can be found in the Eucreas CHMP assessment report and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).

Vildagliptin  belongs  to  a  new  class  of  oral  anti-diabetic  drugs  and  is  a  selective  and  reversible inhibitor  of  dipeptidyl  peptidase  4  (DPP-4),  the  enzyme  which  inactivates  the  incretin  hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), hormones which significantly contribute to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.

Metformin  is  an  established  first  line  treatment  for  type  2  diabetes  mellitus,  acting  primarily  to enhance hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity.

Vildagliptin and metformin is intended for use in patients with T2DM as fixed combination tablets.

The approved indication is:

'Vildagliptin/metformin  hydrochloride  Novartis    is  indicated  in  the  treatment  of  type  2  diabetes mellitus patients who are unable to achieve sufficient glycaemic control at their maximally tolerated dose  of  oral  metformin  alone  or  who  are  already  treated  with  the  combination  of  vildagliptin  and metformin as separate tablets.'

The tablets are available in 2 strengths: vildagliptin 50 mg and metformin 850 mg, and vildagliptin 50 mg and metformin 1000 mg. In all cases, the recommended daily dose is 100 mg vildagliptin, allowing a daily dose of 1700 to 2000 mg metformin.

## 2.2 Quality aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Eucreas application, the quality data in support of the Vildagliptin/metformin hydrochloride Novartis  application are identical to the up-to-date quality data  of  the  Eucreas  dossier  which  have  been  assessed  and  approved  (including  all  post-marketing procedures).

## 2.3 Non-clinical aspects

Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Eucreas  application,  the  non-clinical  data  in support of the Vildagliptin/metformin hydrochloride Novartis  application are identical to the up-todate non-clinical data of the Eucreas dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.4 Clinical aspects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Since this application is an informed consent of the Eucreas application, the clinical data in support of the Vildagliptin/metformin hydrochloride Novartis  application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data  of  the  Eucreas  dossier,  which  have  been  assessed  and  approved  (including  all  post-marketing procedures).

## 2.5 Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The CHMP did not require the MAA to submit a risk management plan because the reference product Eucreas  does  not  have  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  beyond  providing  guidance  in  the prescribing information.

## 2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

Since this application is an informed consent of the Eucreas application, the CHMP considered that the risk-benefit balance of Vildagliptin/metformin hydrochloride Novartis  was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indication:

'Vildagliptin/metformin  hydrochloride  Novartis    is  indicated  in  the  treatment  of  type  2  diabetes mellitus patients who are unable to achieve sufficient glycaemic control at their maximally tolerated dose  of  oral  metformin  alone  or  who  are  already  treated  with  the  combination  of  vildagliptin  and metformin as separate tablets.'
