## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa) is intended for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) of Gaucher disease (GD), which  is  a  rare  genetic  disorder  characterised  by  a  functional  deficiency  of β -glucocerebrosidase activity.    This  enzyme  is  naturally  active  in  lysosomes  and  catalyses  the  hydrolysis  of  the  glycolipid glucocerebroside into ceramide and glucose in subjects not affected by GD. There are no alternative degradative pathways when the activity of β -glucocerebrosidase is deficient. Tissue macrophages are the predominant cell type that accumulates excessive glucocerebroside under these enzyme deficient conditions and accumulation of excessive glucocerebrosides in lysosomal compartments of monocyte/macrophage-derived  cells  gives  rise  to  the  characteristic  Gaucher  cells:  macrophages engorged  with  lipids  with  a  crumpled-tissue-paper  appearance  and  displaced  nuclei.    Formation  of Gaucher  cells  causes  enlargement  of  the  liver  and  spleen,  which  may  be  massive  and  result  in abdominal  protuberance.    Hepatocellular  function  is  usually  well  preserved,  although  transaminases may  be  slightly  elevated.    Splenomegaly  is  associated  with  hypersplenism  and  pancytopenia,  with anaemia and thrombocytopenia being most significant.  Bone involvement is caused by accumulation in marrow  macrophages,  a  decrease  in  osteoblast  activity  and  bone  mineralisation,  and  a  relative increase in bone resorption.  The resultant osteopoenia predisposes to vertebral compression and other pathological fractures.  Pulmonary involvement is uncommon but manifests as interstitial lung disease or  pulmonary  hypertension  when  it  occurs.    During  childhood,  retarded  growth  and  delayed developmental maturation are common.

Historically, GD has been classified into three subtypes:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Type 1 (non-neuropathic)

Type 2 (acute neuropathic)

## Type 3 (sub-acute neuropathic)

However,  the  manifestation  of  symptoms  varies  significantly  among  patients  and,  often,  a  clear classification into these subtypes is difficult.  In the recent classification adopted by treating physicians the  GD  population is  classified  according  to  the  absence  (non-neuropathic  GD  [NNGD])  or  presence (neuropathic GD [NGD]) of complex neurological symptoms.  The latter group is further subdivided into 'acute'  or  'chronic'  neuropathic  disease.  Acute  neuropathic  disease  ('acute  NGD')  appears  in newborns  ( ≤ 1  year)  with  a  very  severe  neurological  presentation  that  results  in  the  death  of  the patient  within  the  first  2  years  of  age.    In  chronic  neuropathic  disease  ('chronic  NGD'),  the neurological  symptoms  develop  later  and  progress  at  a  variable  rate  to  a  disease  with  neurological symptoms of varied severity. Under the previous classification system NNGD patients were Type 1 GD patients, acute NGD patients were Type 2 GD patients and chronic NGD patients were Type 3 along with  any  other  patients  with  neurological  symptoms  that  did  not  belong  to  the  'acute'  subgroup. NNGD accounts for 94% of GD cases.  Acute NGD (about 1% of GD cases) includes patients with onset usually at one year of age with progressive bulbar involvement (stridor, squint, swallowing difficulty). The chronic NGD (about 5% of GD cases) again includes a heterogeneous group of patients.  Certain patients have moderate systemic involvement associated with ophthalmoplegia as the only neurological  symptom.    Variable  neurological  signs  are  seen  in  more  severe  forms:  supranuclear horizontal ophthalmoplegia, progressive myoclonic epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, spasticity and dementia.

Currently, patients are treated with palliative therapy, which includes splenectomy, blood transfusions, and orthopaedic procedures, and bone marrow transplantation. Furthermore, the following medicinal products are authorised in the EU for the treatment of GD:

Cerezyme  (imiglucerase)  is  not  an  orphan  medicinal  product  and  is  indicated  for  long-term  ERT indicated for Type 1 and 3 GD.

Vpriv (velaglucerase alfa) is an orphan medicinal product and is indicated for long-term ERT in patients with type 1 GD.

Zavesca  (miglustat)  is  an  orphan  medicinal  product  and  is  a  substrate  reduction  therapy  (SRT),  a glucosylceramide  synthase  inhibitor,  which  is  approved  as  second-line  therapy  when  ERT  is  not  a therapeutic option for patients with type 1 GD.

Taliglucerase  alfa  is  a  recombinant  glucocerebrosidase  similar  to  the  human  lysosomal  glycoprotein enzyme β -glucocerebrosidase ( β -D-glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine glucohydrolase).  The active substance is purified from genetically modified carrot cells grown in pre-sterilised disposable bioreactors.

The  mechanism of action  is  based  on  the  ability  of  taliglucerase  alfa  to  be  specifically  taken  up  by macrophages, the target cells in Gaucher disease.  Following intravenous infusion, taliglucerase alfa is expected to target and penetrate macrophages through the mannose receptor and is delivered to the lysosome where it catalyses the hydrolysis of accumulated glucocerebrosides to glucose and ceramide.

The clinical development programme for taliglucerase alfa for the treatment of systemic symptoms in adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of GD consists of one Phase 1 trial in healthy subjects and three  Phase  3  safety  and  efficacy  clinical  studies  in  patients  with  GD,  including  1  single  pivotal completed study and 2 supportive ongoing studies. A Phase 2 study was not included in the clinical programme with taliglucerase alfa as it is a drug belonging to a class with a known pharmacological principle and a demonstrated mechanism of action, for which extensive dosing regimen experience is already available. An extension study was also initiated to collect long term data following treatment

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with  taliglucerase  alfa.  Further  to  the  above  clinical  protocols,  compassionate  use  programmes including an Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) study and named-patient compassionate use were also ongoing at the time of submission.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

Taliglucerase  alfa  is  a  recombinant  glucocerebrosidase  similar  to  the  human  lysosomal  glycoprotein enzyme β -glucocerebrosidase  ( β -D-glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine  glucohydrolase).  The  applicant  has developed  a  plant  cell-culture  based  expression  system,  using  carrot  cells  as  a  host  cell  for  the expression  of  the  active  substance.  The  expression  construct  has  been  designed  with  the  aim  of specific  expression  in  the  vacuole  of  the  carrot  cell,  generating  taliglucerase  alfa  with  the  desired glycosylation  profile  uptake  into  macrophages.  The  plant  post-translational  machinery  produces proteins  with  mannose  terminated  glycans  in  the  endomembrane  system  (plant  secretory  system). The  ability  to  target  proteins  and  to  retain  them  in  this  compartment,  allows  the  production  of mannose-terminated glycoproteins. The protein is targeted into the plant secretory system by fusing a leader sequence and a vacuolar targeting signal to accumulate the protein in the vacuole. Taliglucerase alfa is a 506 amino acid enzyme, of which 497 amino acids encode for human glucocerebrosidase. This sequence  differs  from  the  glucocerebrosidase  sequence  by  the  addition  of  amino  acids  at  the  Nterminal and C-terminal of the protein, which are introduced by the plant expression cassette.

Taliglucerase alfa is a glycosylated protein with approximately 7% of its molecular mass contributed by glycans.  The  amino  acid  sequence  contains  5  potential  N-linked  glycosylation  sites  but  only  4  are occupied by glycan chains (N21, N61, N148, and N272). Glycan analysis showed that all of the glycan structures  have  terminal  mannose  residues.  These  mannose-terminated  glycans  are  specifically recognised by mannose receptors on macrophages, the cells that accumulate lipid in Gaucher disease.

Elelyso is the invented name for taliglucerase alfa. Elelyso is a powder for solution for infusion supplied as  sterile,  non-pyrogenic,  and  white  to  off-white  lyophilised  powder  in  a  glass  vial  with  a  rubber stopper and aluminium cap.

Each vial contains 200 units of taliglucerase alfa, with 6% overfill and the excipients Sodium citrate (buffering agent), citric acid (to adjust the buffer pH to 6.0), mannitol (tonicity-adjusting agent), and polysorbate 80 (stabilizer).. After reconstitution with water for injection, taliglucerase alfa is diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride solution and administered by intravenous infusion, over 1 - 2 hours.

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

Taliglucerase  alfa  (TGA)  is  a  recombinant  glucocerebrosidase  analogue  of  the  human  lysosomal glycoprotein enzyme β -glucocerebrosidase that catalyses the hydrolysis of glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide. The glycosylated protein is produced in genetically modified carrot cells.

Taliglucerase  alfa  has  4  sites  with  N-linked  glycan  structures  with  terminal  mannose  residues, important for internalization into the lysosomes of macrophages. Taliglucerase alfa is a 506 amino acid enzyme, of which 497 amino acids encode for human glucocerebrosidase. Two of the additional amino acids  are  due  to  a  signal  peptide;  the  seven  others  are  involved  in  targeting  TGA  to  the  vacuole. Molecular mass is approximately 60,800Da to which glycans contribute ca. 7%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Manufacture

Taliglucerase  alfa  is  purified  from  genetically  modified  carrot  cells.  The  production  process  is  a  two stage process:

-  The  upstream  phase  includes  expansion  of  the  recombinant  carrot  cells  and  expression  of taliglucerase alfa;

The  downstream  purification  process  involves  extraction,  clarification  and  purification  of  the taliglucerase alfa protein.  The purification process employs the standard techniques for protein purification by chromatography on multiple columns. This yields an active substance in aqueous solution, which is frozen prior to conversion to the finished product.

The active substance material is then filtered using a 0.2 μ m filter and filled into bottles with HDPE screw  closures,  pre-sterilized  with  gamma  irradiation.  Prior  to  final  formulation,  the  bulk  active substance  may  be  stored  frozen  for  up  to  24  months  at  -20  ±  5°C.  Taliglucerase  alfa  AS  will  be shipped at not more than -15°C.

## MCB &amp; WCB

Establishment of the production cell line has been described in detail, including plasmid construction, transformation of the carrot cells and selection of producer clone. The origin of the carrot cell line was a  carrot  cultivar  tuber  grown  for  human  consumption.  The  cell  line  was  further  used  for  plant transformation with the vector containing the taliglucerase alfa expression cassette.

A  description  of  the  cell  bank  used  and  the  results  of  its  testing,  including  specific  virological  tests genomic sequence analysis and genetic stability was provided.  The consistency of this 'fingerprint' has  been  confirmed  during  the  production  of  the  Master  Cell  Bank  and  Working  Cell  Bank,  and  in determination of the Limit of in-vitro Cell Age (LIVCA) for the manufacturing process.

The  MCB  for  taliglucerase  alfa  production  (10205MGCD)  was  prepared  and  cryopreserved  (348 cryovials  stored  in  liquid  nitrogen).  Cryopreservation  methods  for  plant  cell  cultures  are  not  well known;  therefore  a  specific  viable  method  was  developed.  Fifty  vials  were  thawed  and  tested  for viability,  sterility  and  protein  expression.  MCB  vials  were  also  tested  for  plant  specific  carrot  viruses and  found  negative.  In  addition,  stability  of  protein  coding  sequence  during  culture  to  the  end  of production was established.

## Manufacturing Process Controls

The overall process control strategy has been re-defined following the major concern raised in the List of Questions, with an improved description of the manufacturing process and the associated controls. Furthermore,  several  acceptance  criteria  were  tightened  following  requests  made  throughout  the procedure.

A  clear  overview  of  critical  parameters  was  presented,  following  clarification  of  the  terminology (acceptance criteria/ranges). The CPPs/KPPs/IPCs themselves are well defined and for most parameters the corrective actions if limits are exceeded is clearly described.  In particular, the large number  of  parameters  aimed  at  preventing  microbiological  contamination  (for  which  the  corrective action is 'rejection of batch') is noted, although the initial proposed bioburden limits were considered to be  set  too  high.  The  bioburden  control  strategy  for  the  entire  manufacturing  process  was  not conclusive with regard to the presented definitions of 'acceptance criterion' and 'acceptance range'. . According to the applicant, exceeding the acceptance range may result in rejection of the batch. An acceptance  range  exceeding  an  acceptance  criterion  is  not  acceptable  and  the  applicant  has

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subsequently tightened many of the IPC limits and provided clarification that the rejection limits are based on the values for Normal Operating Range (NOR).  The documentation was further updated to define the specifications rather than using confusing terminology such as NOR and Proven Acceptable Ranges  (PAR).    Following  the  applicant's  review  discussions  and  experience  of  operation  of  the commercial  process,  it  was  noted  that  divergence  of  the  PARs  and  NORs  occurred  in  only  a  few instances.    Reduction  in  the  upstream  bioburden  levels  which  could  result  in  batch  rejection  make certain PARs invalid.  The applicant therefore removed the PAR column in tables and renaming NOR column 'Acceptance Criterion', with corrective actions referring directly to the acceptance criteria.  Two Critical Process Parameters have been identified during the purification process whose variability has an impact on the Critical Quality Attributes of taliglucerase alfa. The CPPs  are, therefore, controlled within appropriate ranges to ensure that the process produces the desired active substance quality.

## Manufacturing process validation

Process validation was performed at the commercial manufacturing site for the taliglucerase alfa active substance process, Protalix (Carmiel, Israel), according to process validation protocols. The purpose of the process validation studies was to demonstrate process control, reproducibility and acceptability of the taliglucerase alfa process.

Process validation studies were performed on the cell culture, harvesting and purification operations of three consecutive taliglucerase alfa active substance batches at commercial size

A  significant  increase  in  bioburden  occurred  in  some  validation  batches  after  harvest  as  a  result  of incomplete  cleaning  and  sanitisation  of  equipment.  Corrective  actions  were  implemented  and  in  11 additional harvest batches, bioburden levels were low. The sanitary performance of the taliglucerase alfa  process  has  been  demonstrated  and  revised  bioburden  IPC  limits  are  presented.  Improved procedures for bioburden control and further tightening of the IPC (rejection) limits for bioburden were given, to provide assurance that the bioburden levels are sufficiently controlled.

The  pool  hold  times  of  intermediates  were  validated.  In  general,  the  purification  process  appears satisfactory, with removal of process-related and product-related impurities.

The applicant has supplied the information for retrospective and prospective resin re-use evaluation. A shipping validation report  has been provided.

## Characterisation

## Elucidation of structure

The  structure  of  taliglucerase  alfa  AS  was  evaluated  by  extensive  testing  performed  on  the  three validation  batches  including  the  commercial  reference  standard  manufactured  by  the  commercial manufacturing  process.  The  structure  had  been  evaluated  using  X-ray  crystallography,  amino  acid sequencing, peptide mapping, disulfide bond and free sulfhydryl content analysis. Glycan structure is important for the uptake of taliglucerase alfa by macrophages and characterisation of glycan structure and mannose content was also detailed in this section.

However, the characterisation section was considered incomplete at the time of the List of Questions and an extensive amount of new information was submitted in response to this concern. Orthogonal methods  have  been  introduced  and  new  or  revised  analytical  methods  have  been  developed  and applied  to  further  elucidate  the  protein  structure  and  oxidation,  deamination  and  similar  productrelated  variants  of  taliglucerase  alfa  (TGA).  Improved  analytical  assays  which  can  better  detect  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

quantify  product-related  variants,  including  those  formed  by  degradation,  have  been  applied.  The biological activity was evaluated by enzymatic activity using a synthetic substrate and determination of Michaelis-Menten kinetics for taliglucerase alfa using the same substrate.

The relevance of the mannan inhibition assay for inhibition of specific uptake of taliglucerase alfa by macrophages  was  questioned  as  a  routine  assay.  The  applicant  has  developed  and  validated  an appropriate  revised  potency  assay,  macrophage  uptake  assay  which  will  be  performed  at  active substance and finished product at release and stability. Information from individual batches has been provided  for  the  provisional  specification,  which  is  rather  wide,  and  the  CHMP  recommended  the applicant to evaluate technical improvements to the  cellular uptake assay to reduce the variability of this method. A revised specification range will be introduced after evaluation of release testing of at least 30  DS batches made by the commercial process and 15 DP batches produced from DS made by the  commercial  process,  in  addition  to  the  relevant  stability  batches  that  have  been  tested  at  that time.

## Impurities

The purity of the active substance is estimated by a combination of methods. The choice of analytical procedures  is  focused  on  the  separation  of  the  taliglucerase  alfa  product  from  product  related substances (variants and impurities) and from process related impurities. Assays, including electrophoresis, RP-HPLC, capillary IEF, and Size Exclusion Chromatography are performed to assure the  purity  of  taliglucerase  alfa  and  characterize  the  product-related  impurities.  Process-related Impurities such as Host Cell Protein and Host Cell DNA are controlled at release, while clearance of other potential process-related impurities has been demonstrated.

## Comparison with Cerezyme

A comparison of taliglucerase with imiglucerase (Cerezyme) has been submitted. The submission of these data is deemed to be in line with ICH Q6B recommendations on characterisation.

Taliglucerase is a recombinant analogue of the human enzyme. No international reference standard is available; a direct comparison with the human enzyme is technically challenging but a comparison with the commercially available recombinant cerebroglucerases: imiglucerase (Cerezyme) and velaglucerase (Vpriv) which have been compared previously with the human enzyme, is deemed sufficiently relevant.

Supportive comparison studies with Cerezyme were provided which showed similarity between these two molecules.

## Specification

The  active  substance  specification  has  been  amended  according  to  the  various  requests  during  the evaluation of the marketing authorisation application.

Release specification for the active substance includes control for appearance (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), identification (peptide map) (SDS-PAGE - Western blot analysis), purity (RP-HPLC) (host cell protein by  ELISA)  (automated  electrophoresis)  (Capillary  Isoelectric  Focusing)  (SE-HPLC),  taliglucerase  alfa content (RP-HPLC), specific activity (enzymatic activity and taliglucerase alfa assessment determination  by  RP-HPLC  absorption  at  280nm),  enzymatic  kinetics  (Michaelis-Menten  kinetics), cellular  uptake  (cell  based  assay),  glycan  structure  analysis  (NP-HPLC  combined  with  glycosidase digestion), mannose content (mass spectrometry), total aerobic count (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), residual DNA and free sulfhydryl content (Ellman's reaction for thiol determination).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  information  provided  in  the  assay  validation  section  in  the  dossier  was  inadequate,  with  only summary  tables  that  were  not  fully  explained.  Details  of  the  assay  validation  of  the  HCP  assay, endotoxins, macrophage cellular uptake and kinetics by Michaelis-Menten was subsequently provided by the applicant. The macrophage uptake assay has replaced the cellular uptake inhibition assay and details of this new assay have been provided. All compendial and non-compendial analytical methods have been validated according to ICH guidance Q2 (R1) where appropriate.

Batch analysis data from 128 batches manufactured at industrial scale with the proposed manufacturing process were presented to support the proposed specification.

## Reference standard

The  reference  standard  is  prepared  from  the  active  substance  batches.  A  reference  standard replacement protocol, including a protocol for determination of stability of the reference standard, has been  submitted.    Each  new  reference  standard  is  qualified  for  use  by  testing  against  release specification and additional characterisation tests.

No international reference material is available. Therefore, the reference standard is prepared from the active  substance  batches.  A  reference  standard  replacement  protocol,  including  a  protocol  for determination of stability of the reference standard, has been submitted.  Each new reference standard is  qualified  for  use  by  testing  against release specification and additional characterisation tests. This protocol  is  deemed  acceptable.  The  replacement  of  a  reference  standard  will  be  the  subject  of  a variation.

## Stability

Stability data for three batches manufactured from the proposed commercial process is limited (up to 12 months available at -20 ± 5°C (long term) and 3 month at 5 ± 3°C(short term)),  the applicant has provided data from five primary batches stored at -20°C ± 5°C for up to 36 months. This is considered supportive of the proposed shelf life of 24 months at -20°C ± 5°C, since comparability is demonstrated between the primary batches and the proposed commercial scale active substance.

In accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the rapporteur and EMA.

## Comparability exercise for Active Substance

During manufacturing development, a number of changes were made to the cell culture part of the upstream process; No significant changes were made to the downstream processing

The applicant did not provide the relevant data required within the manufacturing process development section  in  the  initial  dossier  to  support  their  argument  that  the  changes  made  during  process development did not impact the quality of the active substance. Furthermore, not all batches used in the (pre)clinical studies were released using the same battery of analytical methods.

To respond to this major objection, the applicant provided new comparability data and re-analysis of existing  data  to  support  the  manufacturing  changes  between  product  used  in  the  phase  III  pivotal trials and the proposed commercial product. The taliglucerase alfa activity appeared to be comparable

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

after  the  change.  This  suggests  that  improved  expression  levels  and  consistency  of  glycosylation following  manufacturing  changes  do  not  have  an  impact  on  the  enzyme  kinetic  parameters  of taliglucerase  alfa.  The  active  substance  batches  appeared  comparable  before  and  after  the  changes were  introduced,  except  for  differences  in  the  quantitative  glycan  profile.  The  glycan  data  shows  a clear shift to a more homogeneous glycan distribution However, the glycan distributions, both before and after  the  process  changes,  contain  the  desired  terminal  mannose  which  is  required  for  optimal uptake into the target cells by the mannose receptor.

A  difference  was  noted  in  the  uptake  inhibition  after  the  changes  and,  according  to  the  expected mechanism of action for taliglucerase alfa, this change in uptake inhibition is likely to be related to the glycan differences. There were also differences in the new macrophage cellular uptake assay therefore it  is  recommended that further work is performed to reduce the variability observed in this potency assay.  The clinical relevance of the observed differences in the glycan patterns pre-and post-change leading  to  differences  in  the  new  macrophage  cellular  uptake  assay  have  been  discussed  and  these should not impact clinical performance.

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

The  finished  product,  taliglucerase  alfa  powder  for  solution  for  infusion,  is  supplied  as  sterile,  nonpyrogenic,  white  to  off-white  lyophilised  powder  in  a  Type  I  glass  vial  with  a  rubber  stopper  and aluminium cap, with the following detailed composition:

2For adjustment to pH=6. The amount depends on the pH of the solution

The finished product is provided in 13.5 mL Type I glass vials, closed with rubber stoppers and secured with snap-cap aluminium seals. The nominal content of each vial is 200 units of taliglucerase alfa; a 12 units  overfill  (6%)  is  included  to  provide  sufficient  volume  upon  reconstitution.  After  reconstitution, taliglucerase alfa is diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride solution and administered by intravenous infusion, over 1 - 2 hours.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmaceutical Development

The finished product formulation is qualitatively the same  as  the commercially available ßGlucocerebrosidase (imiglucerase; (Cerezyme), Genzyme Corporation). The reason for using a similar formulation was to utilize existing safety data and precedence of a marketed product, which reduces the development risk.

There are no differences in the composition of taliglucerase alfa finished product formulation used over the course of clinical studies or for commercial use. The FP manufacturing principles were unchanged throughout the clinical development of the product. However, some changes have been made to the manufacturing process during development. These include:

- 1) The scale up of the formulation and lyophilisation process,
- 2) The optimization of the lyophilisation process, and
- 3) Difference in manufacturers

The  lyophilisation  cycle  was  optimised  and  transferred  from  Teva  to  Wasserburger  Arzneimittelwerk GmbH (WA). The batch size was scaled up at this manufacturing facility.  Media fill validation for this site has now been provided.

## Comparability Exercise for Finished Medicinal Drug Product

The initial comparability section provided to support the manufacturing changes between taliglucerase alfa product used in the phase III pivotal trials and the proposed commercial product was inadequate; it was not clear whether finished product using taliglucerase alfa active substance manufactured using the commercial manufacturing process had been used for any of the Phase III studies. The applicant provided new comparability data and re-analysis of existing data to support the manufacturing changes between  product  used  in  the  phase  III  pivotal  trials  and  the  proposed  commercial  product.  The applicant  also  provided  details  of  finished  product  batches  using  taliglucerase  alfa  active  substance manufactured using the commercial process which have been used in Phase III studies so far. The final comparability section is adequate and comparability of taliglucerase alfa product used in the phase III pivotal  trial  (manufactured  at  Teva)  with  the  proposed  commercial  product  (manufactured  at Wasserburger Arzneimittel) is considered demonstrated.

## Manufacture of the product

The finished product is manufactured at Wasserburger Arzneimittelwerk GmbH (W.A.), Germany.

The main manufacturing process steps of taliglucerase alfa Drug Product consist of thawing of Drug Substance, formulation, sterile filtration, filling into vials, partial stoppering, lyophilisation and capping. The  drug  product  manufacturing  process  is  operated  in  GMP  environments.    With  the  initial documentation,  the  Applicant  did  not  sufficiently  demonstrate  that  the  drug  product  manufacturing process  was  under  control,  and  was  able  to  ensure  product  quality  and  batch-to-batch  consistency. Additional data was provided at D120 and D180 and the description of the different processing steps in the manufacturing of taliglucerase alfa Drug Product, the duration and temperature of the steps is now well  documented.    All  the  operating  equipment  and  machines  are  prequalified.  The  manufacturing process is controlled in every preparation step.  The in-process controls, parameters and qualified hold times are defined and the critical controls are identified.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Validation  studies  include  filter  validation,  holding  time  validation,  validation  of  compounding,  filling and lyophilisation confirming the suitability of the drug product manufacturing process at this site.

The  shipping  has  been  qualified  for  three  batches  from  Germany  to  Israel  and  further  studies  are planned.

## Product specification

Release specification for the finished product include control for appearance/colour (visual inspection), water  content  (Ph.  Eur.),  Reconstitution  time,  pH  after  reconstitution  (Ph.  Eur.),  appearance  after reconstitution (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter after reconstitution (Ph. Eur.), Osmolality after reconstitution (Ph. Eur.), identification I (peptide map) (SDS-Page - Western blot analysis), content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), Purity (RP-HPLC) (Capillary isoelectric focusing) (Automatic electrophoresis) (SEHPLC), taliglucerase alfa content (RP-HPLC), Potency (enzymatic activity), Enzyme kinetic (cell based assay), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur.).

Analytical methods have been adequately validated and the specification limits are supported by data from seventeen batches representative of the commercial process. However, quality control for release of  FP  was  not  considered  fully  qualified  since  the  transfer  of  non-compendial  analytical  assays  for release and stability assay for Elelyso to the quality control testing site, Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, Grange Castle, Ireland was still ongoing and this was raised as a major objection. The applicant has provided acceptable data for the transfer of eight release and stability assays. For the cellular uptake assay  limited data  in relation to the transfer of this assay  to the facility at Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, Grange Castle was provided, however this was deemed acceptable,

The justifications of the proposed commercial specifications for taliglucerase alfa finished product as provided by the applicant are largely acceptable. Some specifications have been tightened following requests by CHMP and some need reviewing once more batches have been manufactured and tested.

## Stability of the product

Taliglucerase alfa finished product powder for solution for injection is stable when stored at 5 ± 3°C for the shelf life of 24 months. The applicant provided the results of the primary stability studies after 24 months storage, including data for eleven batches of which three were full scale validation batches. Only up to 9 month of stability data was available at long term condition (5 ± 3°C) for the full scale batches but the stability data of the primary stability batches (up to 36 months) were considered to be supportive to the proposed shelf-life.

Storage or temperature excursions of taliglucerase alfa Drug Product to -20°C, as suggested by the applicant,  is  acceptable  and  supported  by  appropriate  data.  Since  the  Applicant  has  not  performed cycling studies of repeat freeze-thaw of the finished product, the labelling will include the precaution of 'Do not freeze'.

Based on the evaluation  of  two  batches  of  pooled  reconstituted  finished  product  diluted  with  saline solution in infusion bags, reconstituted taliglucerase alfa finished product diluted into infusion bags is considered stable for at least 18 hours at 2-8°C.

The  post-approval  stability  protocol  and  the  stability  commitment  have  been  provided  and  are considered  satisfactory.  In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines,  any  confirmed  out-of-specification result of significant negative trend should be reported to the rapporteur and EMA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Adventitious agents

Taliglucerase alfa is produced by a proprietary innovative technology where transformed carrot plant root  cells,  cultured  in  suspension  in  a  closed  bioreactor  system,  express  the  protein.  The  plant  cell culture system is free of mammalian derived components which are not required for efficient plant cell growth and protein production. The carrot plant cells cultures are naturally and biologically protected from  being  infected  by  human  or  mammalian  viruses  or  other  pathogen  due  to  host-pathogen specificity.  Furthermore,  plant  viruses  cannot  be  propagated  in  plant  cells  cultured  in  suspension. Finally, plant viruses pose no risk to humans

Based on this rationale and on the current scientific knowledge, the carrot cell culture line used for the production of taliglucerase alfa cannot be a host for viruses.

No raw materials of animal origin are used during the manufacturing process of both taliglucerase alfa drug  substance  and  drug  product.  There  are  two  components  of  biological  origin  that  are  use indirectly; one at the early stage of the MCB establishment, the other, issued from a non-TSE relevant species is used to manufacture a component of the production medium.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  applicant  has  provided  satisfactory  responses  to  all  the  major  objections.  A  more  detailed discussion  of  the  complex  semi-continuous  process  used  for  manufacture  of  taliglucerase  alfa  at commercial scale has clarified a number of questions which were initially raised regarding the active substance  manufacturing  process.  Clarification  regarding  the  active  substance  batch  concept  and fermenter 'production trains' has enabled a better understanding of how the manufacturing facility is utilised.

Improvement  in  bioburden  control,  with  addition  or  tightening  of  in-process  controls,  has  provided further assurance of process control.  However, many of the issues raised in this regard have arisen because  of  unclear  classification  of  the  process  controls;  these  were  resolved  by  adapting  the documentation.

Improved and optimised assays have been introduced, with appropriate validation data.  These include an optimised RP-HPLC assay for purity and concentration determination of taliglucerase alfa, imaging cIEF for charged species and introduction of a macrophage uptake assay (to replace the cellular uptake inhibition assay). Further batches of active substance and/or finished product will need to be evaluated using these assays before the final specifications can be set; this is reflected in the recommendations. The  validation  activities  at  the  finished  product  manufacturing  site  Wasserburger  Arzneimittelwerk (WA) have been completed and the validation report confirms that this is acceptable.

The status of the site responsible for quality control testing (release and stability) and batch release, Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, Grange Castle, Ireland, has been resolved.  The applicant has provided acceptable  data  for  the  transfer  of  eight  release  and  stability  assays.  For  the  cellular  uptake  assay limited data in relation to the transfer of this assay to the facility at Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, Grange  Castle  was  provided,  however  this  was  deemed  acceptable,  A  revised  specification  range should  be  introduced  after  release  testing  with  the  improved  assay  of  at  least  30  batches  of  drug substance and 15 batches of the finished product manufactured using the commercial process.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.2.5 Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  based  on  the  information  provided  on manufacturing, testing and storage of both the active substance and the finished product. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way.  Data  has  been  presented  to  give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

From a Quality point of view, the application for Elelyso is approvable.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The  originally  proposed  indication  for  Elelyso  is  the  long-term  enzyme  replacement  therapy  for  the treatment of the systemic symptoms in patients with GD. The active substance, taliglucerase alfa, is a glycosylated  protein  produced  in  genetically  modified  carrot  cells  by  recombinant  DNA  technology. Taliglucerase  alfa  is  a  recombinant  glucocerebrosidase,  structurally  similar  to  the  human  lysosomal glycoprotein  enzyme β -glucocerebrosidase.  The  mechanism  of  action  is  based  on  its  ability  to  be specifically taken up by the macrophages, the target cells in GD. Whilst recognising the stand alone nature of this  application,  it  was  also  noted  during  the  nonclinical  development  of  taliglucerase  alfa that it was considered that taliglucerase alfa and the existing therapy imiglucerase (Cerezyme) belong to the same pharmacological group. Key elements of the development were demonstration of the same mechanism  of  action  (based  on  receptor-targeting)  of  taliglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase,  and assessing the safety of taliglucerase alfa in a series of appropriate toxicity studies sufficient to support the dossier.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

The active substance, taliglucerase alfa, is a 506 amino acid enzyme, of which 497 amino acids encode for human glucocerebrosidase. Additional amino acids were added to the native human glucocerebrosidase  sequence  to  permit  the  efficient  expression  of  active  enzyme  in  carrot  root  cell cultures. Approximately 7% of its molecular mass is contributed by glycans. Glycan analysis showed that all of the glycan structures have terminal mannose residues. These mannose-terminated glycans are  specifically  recognised  by  endocytic  carbohydrate  receptors  on  macrophages,  the  cells  that accumulate  lipid in Gaucher  disease. Taliglucerase alfa differs from  imiglucerase in that the oligosaccharide chains have naturally exposed terminal mannose sugars. In comparison, imiglucerase requires post-purification enzymatic remodelling in vitro with different glycosidases in order to expose the terminal mannose residues required for cellular uptake by macrophages.

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

A summary of investigations to evaluate primary pharmacodynamics of taliglucerase alfa is presented in the table below.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies included in  vitro studies  of  enzyme  kinetic  parameters as well as macrophage uptake and inhibition of uptake for taliglucerase alfa.  For reference, the applicant also included imiglucerase using mouse and human macrophages. The maintenance of enzymatic activity following uptake by macrophages was confirmed, as well as the role of mannose receptors in mediating the uptake. These in vitro data confirm that taliglucerase alfa exhibits a specific interaction with the Man/GlcNAc  receptor  present  on  enlarged  macrophages  (Gaucher  cells).  Furthermore,  although  not directly relevant to this stand alone dossier, it was noted that taliglucerase alfa exhibits similar enzyme kinetics to imiglucerase as also shown by the results in the table below.

'Strain not specified.

Taliglucerase alfa displayed a Vmax of 0.47 μ mol C6-NBD-Cer formed/min/mg and a Km of 20.7 μ M. For imiglucerase,  Vmax  was  0.43 μ mol  C6-NBD-Cer  formed/min/mg  and  Km  was  15.2 μ M. Taliglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase  were  both  taken  up  by  murine  thioglycolate-elicited  peritoneal macrophages when incubated for 90 minutes at 37  C at concentrations up to 6.4 units/ml. Uptake of taliglucerase alfa tended to be higher than the uptake of imiglucerase at higher concentrations. Both products  maintained  their  enzymatic  activity.  Uptake  of  taliglucerase  alfa  and  imiglucerase  was progressively inhibited by the addition of increasing concentrations of yeast mannan (2-8 mg/ml) to the incubation medium, demonstrating that uptake is mediated by mannose (Man/GlcNac) receptors.

These in vitro data confirm that taliglucerase alfa exhibits a specific interaction with the Man/GlcNAc receptor  present  on  enlarged  macrophages.  Furthermore,  taliglucerase  alfa  exhibits  similar  enzyme kinetics to imiglucerase.

To assess the relevance of the nonclinical species used in the toxicology testing, an in  vitro uptake assay was conducted using the rat alveolar macrophage cell line NR8383, and primary macrophages from rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys. In this assay, concentrations ranging from 1 to 4 U/ml were evaluated.  Concentration-dependent  uptake  of  taliglucerase  alfa  was  observed  in  rat,  rabbit,  and cynomolgus monkey macrophages. When mannan was added to the incubation mixture (taliglucerase concentration of 1 U/ml), inhibition of uptake was observed. These data confirm that the species used in  the  nonclinical  toxicology  programme  (mice,  rats,  monkeys,  and  rabbits)  were  relevant  and, therefore,  the  safety  data  can  be  considered  relevant  for  assessing  potential  adverse  effects  in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

humans. However, the used in vitro concentrations are above the human serum concentrations (Cmax 5 μ g.ml ~ 0.13U/ml) and the CHMP has therefore requested information on the uptake and activity of taliglucerase alfa at clinically relevant concentrations. an additional in vitro experiment was conducted upon  request  of  the  Committee,  results  of  which  indicate  that  taliglucerase  alfa  is  taken  up  and remains  active  in  the  target  cells,  macrophages  derived  from  Gaucher  disease  patients,  in  the  test system conditions. There are some limitations in the design of the experiment that prevent to draw conclusions  on  the  uptake  at  clinically  relevant  concentrations  in  GD  cells in  vivo (i.e.  selection  of concentration at 17  g/mL, low sample number). Notwithstanding these limitations, the results of this experiment are in line  with  the  data  by  Shaaltiel et  al .  with  regards  to  the  uptake  in  macrophages derived  from  patients  with  Gaucher's  disease  and  support  the  primary  pharmacodynamic  effect  of taliglucerase alfa.

With  respect  to in  vivo primary  pharmacodynamic  studies,  these  were  not  conducted.  This  was appropriately justified by the applicant, taking into account knowledge known about the effect of other members of the class and because the pharmacology and the receptor-targeting of taliglucerase alfa was considered to be adequately addressed by the described in vitro studies, and because the efficacy of taliglucerase alfa in ERT in Gaucher disease has been shown. Thus, sufficient information has been provided along with the justifications to accept this from a stand-alone application viewpoint.

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies were not conducted because the uptake is receptor mediated on specific  target  cells  and  the  activity  of  taliglucerase  alfa  as  an  enzyme  is  specific;  no  secondary pharmacodynamic effects are therefore anticipated. This justification is accepted by the CHMP.

## Safety pharmacology programme

Specific  secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  not  deemed  necessary  since  the  activity  of taliglucerase  alfa  as  an  enzyme  is  specific  and  its  mechanism  of  action  is  the  same  as  for  other approved  ERT  for  GD,  which  has  not  provided  cause  for  concern  regarding  potential  effects  on  the central  nervous  system,  cardiovascular  system  or  respiratory  system.  Furthermore,  information  on potential effects of taliglucerase alfa on the mentioned organ systems was obtained from single and/or repeat-dose toxicity studies and no adverse effects related to taliglucerase alfa were recorded in the GLP-compliant toxicity studies.

Overall, behavioural observations such as unsteadiness, tremors, agitated behaviour, gasping respiration  and/or  excessive  chewing  due  to  excipients  were  reported  in  preliminary  animal  studies. The  behavioural  findings  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  were  considered  to  be  due  to  the  high  level  of ethanol (18% (v/v)) in the pilot formulation. In marmosets, the findings were considered to be related to the high levels of excipients in the formulation (at least four-fold those in the clinical formulation). This was supported by the observation that when the study was repeated with dosing for 7 consecutive days at the same dose with excipient levels equivalent to the clinical formulation, no clinical signs were observed.

Electrocardiograms were collected pre-dose and towards the end of the dosing period in the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in marmoset monkeys and in the 4- and the 39-week repeat dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. No effect was noted on RR, PR, QT (QTc) intervals, and QRS duration, or on heart rate. The No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) for adverse effects on the central nervous system, the respiratory system, and the cardiovascular system were equivalent to the highest dose level tested in monkeys:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 55 mg/kg/day in the 4-week study in marmoset monkeys, associated with an AUC0-100 min of 102858 μ g.min/ml (males and females combined)
- 27.8 mg/kg/day in the 4-week study in cynomolgus monkeys, associated with an AUCall of 123000 μ g.min/ml (males and females combined)
- 27.8 mg/kg/dose in the 39-week study in cynomolgus monkeys, associated with an AUCall of 107000 μ g.min/ml (males and females combined)

These  values  of  NOAEL  represent  a  5-fold  multiple  of  the  proposed  maximum  human  administered dose of 66 mg/m2 (equivalent to 60 U/kg).

The  CHMP  agreed  that  including  the  safety  pharmacology  assessment  as  part  of  the  toxicology programme  is  acceptable  in  this  case.  Information  of  potential  effects  on  central  nervous  system, cardiovascular and respiratory parameters was collected in the single and repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted  within  the  toxicology  programme  for  taliglucerase  alfa.  According  to  the  results  of  these studies, intravenous administration of taliglucerase alfa does not adversely affect the cardiovascular, respiratory or central nervous system in marmosets or cynomolgus monkeys.

## Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were not conducted. In the context of enzyme replacement therapy  and  given  the  specificity  of  taliglucerase  alfa  as  an  enzyme,  pharmacodynamic  drug interactions are unlikely to occur. This justification is accepted by the Committee.

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

The  pharmacokinetics  programme  for  taliglucerase  alfa  consisted  of  toxicokinetic  monitoring  in  the repeat-dose  i.v.  toxicity  studies  in  marmoset  and  cynomolgus  monkeys  including  a  39-week  study mimicking  the  clinical  treatment  regimen  (i.e.  dosing  every  two  weeks).  No  additional  or  dedicated pharmacokinetic studies were conducted.

Assays for taliglucerase alfa in monkey plasma and for antibodies in monkey serum were developed and  validated  or  qualified  prior  to  study  initiation.  Stability  of  taliglucerase  alfa  after  several freeze/thaw cycles was sufficiently evaluated. There was no impact of the long-term frozen on stability.

The systemic bioavailability of taliglucerase alfa following i.v. infusion is immediate and the distribution is  receptor-driven  by  mannose  receptor  uptake  in  key  target  organs.  Toxicokinetic  measurements indicate that Cmax and AUC increase with increasing dose in a more than proportional manner, both after the first dose and after the repeated infusion. Exposure tended to be lower at week 39, but not at week  9,  compared  to  exposure  at  day  1.  Clearance  tended  to  be  marginally  higher  at  week  39. However, at lower dose only, a decrease in clearance is observable with an increase of dose.

The initial approach to rely on biodistribution data of similar proteins was not considered sufficient by the CHMP. Glycosylation may affect the kinetics and the biodistribution of proteins. An experiment to compare the bio-delivery to vertebrae between taliglucerase alfa and velaglucerase alfa in mice was performed by the applicant. The results of this study suggested higher distribution of taliglucerase alfa than velaglucerase in vertebrae of mice. However, sufficient justification of the extent of biojustification data on taliglucerase alfa was provided and further distribution preclinical studies are not required, since if differences were identified in animals, the lack of a clear understanding of the mechanism underlying the differences would make translation of such observations to human difficult.

Overall, the balance of evidence indicates that the mannose receptor is the most important receptor responsible for the active distribution and clearance of taliglucerase. However, from the available data

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

it  is  not  possible  to  preclude  the  role  of  another  uptake  receptor  in  the  distribution  of taliglucerase. Considering  that  an  evaluation  of  the  potential  uptake  of  taliglucerase  by  other  receptors  or  of  the tissue distribution of taliglucerase was not provided, it cannot be assumed that the distribution is the same as for imiglucerase. In particular, differences in tissue distribution and trans-placental transfer cannot be ruled out between taliglucerase, velaglucerase, and imiglucerase, either mannose-driven or by  another  putative  receptor.  It  is  not  considered  appropriate  to  directly  extrapolate  data  from approved  products  to  bridge  the  gaps  in  the  preclinical  programme  of  taliglucerase  alfa.    As  a consequence, the CHMP required the statement of the lack of pre- and post-natal development studies to be included in the SmPC (Latest version of the Product Information as submitted by the applicant but not adopted by the CHMP).

Metabolism and excretion studies were deemed unnecessary due to the anticipated breakdown of the enzyme to small peptides and amino acids. Justifications for the absence of stand-alone distribution, metabolism,  excretion  and  pharmacokinetic  drug  interaction  studies  are  acceptable  to  the  CHMP. However,  notwithstanding  that  the  justification  for  the  lack  of  excretion  studies  is  acceptable;  the statement that the clearance mechanisms are well known cannot be concurred. The results from the toxicokinetic  measurements  in  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  suggest  that  the  clearance  of taliglucerase alfa is saturable and, to some extent, inducible after long term treatment.

Pharmacokinetic  drug  interaction  studies  were  not  conducted.  Taliglucerase  alfa  is  a  protein  and pharmacokinetic  interactions  with  co-administered  drugs  subject  to  cytochrome  P450-dependent metabolism are unlikely to occur.

a : total number of animals used during the study.

In a GLP-compliant study, a single i.v. bolus injection of taliglucerase alfa to male and female (CD-1) mice at dose levels of 1.8, 9 or 18 mg/kg did not result in mortality or test article-related clinical signs. No  effect  was  noted  on  body  weight.  Gross  necropsy  revealed  no  noteworthy  findings  (study MET/003/AIT).  The  lack  of  systemic  toxicity  at  18  mg/kg  was  confirmed  in  a  second  (non-GLP compliant) study in mice, with evaluations extended to clinical pathology and histopathology of liver, kidney and  spleen (study 0071). In a preliminary GLP-compliant escalating-dose  study  HAO 003/043412,  a  male  and  a  female  cynomolgus  monkey  received  1-hour  intravenous  infusions  of taliglucerase alfa at dose levels of 1.8, 9, and 18 mg/kg, with a 3-day interval between doses. Adverse signs (unsteady behaviour, excessive chewing, teeth grinding) were noted at 9 and 18 mg/kg. These

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

were  considered  due  to  the  high  concentration  of  ethanol  (18%  (v/v))  in  the  formulation  and  the associated high volume used to achieve the 9 and 18 mg/kg doses. At 1.8 mg/kg (no clinical signs), the dose volume was 0.95 ml/kg whereas at 9 and 18 mg/kg (adverse clinical signs) dose volumes of 4.74  and  9.47  ml/kg,  respectively,  were  administered.  There  were  no  other  noteworthy  findings  in study HAO 003/043412.

## Repeat dose toxicity

Repeated dose toxicity studies were performed in marmoset and cynomolgus monkeys, and included three pivotal GLP compliant studies. Prior to initiating the pivotal repeat-dose studies, two pilot studies were conducted in marmosets. In the 14-day study (HAO 005/040174), adverse clinical signs such as unsteadiness, loss of muscle tone, gasping respiration and agitated behaviour were observed. These observations were explained by the high concentration of excipients in the formulation (at least fourfold higher than in the clinical formulation). Similar effects were not noted in the 7-day follow-up study (HAO  008/050005),  which  used  a  formulation  with  excipient  levels  equivalent  to  the  clinical formulation. The concentration of placebo constituents of the vials (i.e. mannitol, sodium citrate and polysorbate 80) were reduced by 80% compared to those used in study HAO 005/040174. There were no adverse signs seen during or after the administration, no effects on bodyweight, food consumption, haematology and blood chemistry parameters, and no findings at necropsy.

In the 4-week studies, taliglucerase alfa was administered on a daily basis, whereas in the 39-week study dosing mimicked the clinical regimen (once every two weeks) and took into account the longterm indication. Treatment of marmoset monkeys for 29 consecutive days at doses of 0, 11, and 55 mg/kg/day  administered via a  20-minute  infusion  lead  to  a  decrease  in  body  weight  and  food consumption, which were attributed to the stress of the dosing procedure since they occurred in all groups including the controls. Increased spleen weight (males at 55 mg/kg/day and females at both doses) was also observed but without corresponding histopathological changes in the spleen and this was not considered to be a toxicologically significant finding.

There  were  no  test  article-related  changes  in  ophthalmology,  electrocardiography,  haematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis parameters. The NOAEL was determined to be 55 mg/kg/day which was associated with a Day 29 AUC0-100min of 102858 μ g.min/ml (males and females combined). In the 4week cynomolgus monkey study 1171-002, animals were dosed for 28 consecutive days at 0, 5.6, and 27.8 mg/kg/day via a 1-hour infusion. The findings included thyroid changes at the high dose, which were  not  considered  to  be  toxicologically  significant  due  to  low  incidence  and  lack  of  statistical significance.  The  NOAEL  was  27.8  mg/kg/day  and  was  associated  with  a  Day  28  AUC all of  123000 μ g.min/ml (values calculated from 0 to 1440 minutes; males and females combined).

When cynomolgus monkeys (n = 4/sex/group) were treated once every two weeks for 39 weeks (0, 5.6, and 27.8 mg/kg/day administered via a  1-hour infusion) the only test article related effect was anti-drug antibody formation. The NOAEL for this study was 27.8 mg/kg/dose which was associated with  a  Week  39  AUC all of  107000 μ g.min/ml  (values  calculated  from  0  to  360  minutes;  males  and females combined). The NOAELs from the pivotal GLP-compliant repeat-dose study correspond to a 5fold multiple of the proposed maximum human dose of 66 mg/m2 (equivalent to 60 U/kg).

Anti-taliglucerase alfa antibody formation was observed on Day 29 (HAO 004/052480) in the majority of marmoset monkeys at 11 mg/kg/day; values ranged from approximately 100 to 350 ng/ml in all animals. No antibodies were detected in marmoset monkeys treated with 55 mg/kg/day. Twenty-eight days of consecutive dosing in cynomolgus monkeys did not produce antibodies in any animal. Following 39-weeks of dosing every two weeks, antibodies were detected in a total of 13 samples: one low-dose female (months 6 and 9), two low-dose males (months 1, 3, 6, and 9 for one male and months 1, 6, and 9 for the other) and two high-dose males (month 9 for one male and months 3, 6, and 9 for the other).  None  of  the  antibodies  detected  in  any  of  these  studies  was  neutralising.  The  pattern  of antibody response observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies indicates that taliglucerase alfa has a low  potential  for  immunogenicity  in  non-human  primates.  There  was  no  consistency  in  the  dose, gender, and time responses to treatment.

The  CHMP  noted  that  numerous  different  batches  of  the  product  were  used  in  the  toxicity  studies; sometimes  several  different  lots  were  used  within  the  same  study.  It  is  unclear  how  the  different batches  reflect  different  processes  of  manufacturing  and/or  different  contents  in  impurities.  The Committee requested detailed information on the batches used in the toxicology studies, with clear reference to the process of manufacturing and impurity profile, in order to re-discuss whether some adverse effects are attributable to the excipients or potential process-related impurities. The requested data along with the information on the manufacturing and process related impurities (residual DNA and host  cell  proteins)  were  provided.  Since  multiple  drug  substance  batches  have  been  used  to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

manufacture a single drug product batch, a range was given where appropriate. Notably, in the two studies  where  the  highest  levels  of  residual  DNA  were  measured  (28-day  and  39-week  monkey studies) no adverse effects were reported, including clinical pathology and histopathology. In the same studies, host cell proteins were 0.02-0.03% in the drug substance batches tested. Therefore, the levels of  the  process  impurities  that  can  be  regarded  as  toxicologically  qualified  are  &lt;0.02%  for  host  cell proteins and &lt;3.33 ppm for residual DNA, which are well above the specifications in the commercial formulation. One of the batches (K-39065) of material administered in the embryo-fetal studies to both rats  and  rabbits  was  also  used  in  the  clinical  study  PB-06-001.  The  process  impurities  were  not measured in this batch. Only rats exhibited adverse clinical signs (swelling in the paws, limbs and/or face) whereas no clinical signs occurred in rabbits. This batch, as well as an additional batch for the high  dose,  were  also  administered  to  rabbits  in  the  embryo-foetal  study  and  to  rats  in  the  fertility study with clinical signs only occurring in rats. The fact that the same adverse reactions occurred at much  lower  levels  of  process  impurities  than  in  other  toxicity  studies  suggests  that  they  were  not attributable  neither  to  host  proteins  (0.003%)  or  residual  DNA  (&lt;0.01  ppm),  or  otherwise  the hypersensitivity would be species specific for rat. The CHMP considered the issue resolved.

## Genotoxicity

Genotoxicity studies were not conducted for taliglucerase alfa. Since taliglucerase alfa is a protein, a direct interaction with DNA or chromosomes is not to be expected. In line with the ICH S6 Guideline, genotoxicity studies were not considered necessary and this is agreed by the CHMP.

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted. The pharmacological mechanism of action of taliglucerase alfa  is  highly  targeted,  being  mediated  by  mannose  receptors  present  on  macrophages  and  is  not associated with a risk for carcinogenicity. Histopathological evaluations in the 39-week toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys did not reveal any (pre-)neoplastic changes. The clinical history of ERT in GD has not suggested any indication for a cause for concern. The weight-of-evidence therefore supports a lack of carcinogenic risk. In line with the ICH S6 Guideline and its addendum ICH S6 (R1), carcinogenicity studies were not considered necessary. This is acceptable to the CHMP.

## Reproduction Toxicity

To assess the potential reproductive and developmental effects of taliglucerase alfa, a rat fertility and early embryonic development study was conducted along with embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits. All studies were GLP-compliant and their overview is presented in the table below.

## Study 1171-004

Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats received taliglucerase alfa at dose levels of 11 or 55 mg/kg by slow bolus injection in  the  tail  vein  once  every  3  or  4  days.  Controls  were  given  vehicle  (mannitol, sodium  citrate,  polysorbate  80  NF  in  water  for  injection).  Males  were  treated  for  4  weeks  prior  to mating, throughout the mating period and post-mating until sacrifice on Day 51. Females were treated for 2 weeks prior to mating, throughout the mating period and on Gestation Days 0, 3 and 7. Females were  euthanised  on  Gestation  Day  13.  Taliglucerase  alfa  did  not  affect  fertility  or  reproductive performance  indices,  copulatory  interval,  gestation  day  13  uterine  implantation  data  or  sperm analyses. There were no test article-related effects on parental body weights or body weight gain. The only observation was swollen limbs/paws and/or swollen face or muzzle at 55 mg/kg/dose, during the 30-90 minute post-dose examination. This finding was observed as early as after the first treatment and  resolved  before  the  next  dose.  The  mechanism  or  reason  for  dose-dependency  of  this  type  of response is not clear. The NOAEL was determined to be 55 mg/kg/dose for reproductive toxicity and 11 mg/kg/dose for parental toxicity.

## Study 1171-005

Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received taliglucerase alfa by slow bolus injection on Gestation Days 6, 9, 12, 15, and 17 at dose levels of11 and 55 mg/kg; Caesarean section was performed on Gestation Day 20. One control female died while being restrained for dosing on Gestation Day 9 and one highdose female died following dosing on Gestation Day 15. Clinical findings seen in the high-dose female on  gestation  day  15  included  decreased  activity,  difficulty  in  breathing,  prostration,  and  pale appearance. Although no gross findings were noted at necropsy, a relationship with treatment could not be excluded for this animal. Other maternal effects were limited to clinical signs primarily occurring on  treatment  days  at55  mg/kg/dose.  These  observations  were  similar  to  those  noted  in  the fertility/early  embryonic  development  study  1171-004.  Taliglucerase  alfa  did  not  affect  uterine implantation data, foetal body  weights, foetal sex ratios, and external, visceral, or skeletal malformations or variations. The NOAEL was at least 55 mg/kg/dose for developmental toxicity and 11 mg/kg/dose for maternal toxicity in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rabbit Study 1171-003

Pregnant New Zealand white rabbits (n = 23 time-mated/group) were given taliglucerase alfa by slow bolus injection on Gestation Days 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 at dose levels of 5.6 and 27.8 mg/kg; Caesarian section was performed on Gestation Day 29. No test article-related maternal effects were recorded. Taliglucerase alfa did not affect uterine implantation data, foetal body weights, foetal sex ratios, and external, visceral, or skeletal malformations or variations. The NOAEL was at least 27.8 mg/kg/dose for both developmental and maternal toxicity in pregnant New Zealand white rabbits. The statistically significant change seen in these data in comparison to controls was an increase in additional sternebral ossification centres. This skeletal variation is seen commonly in this laboratory and although not seen in the concurrent controls, the maximum litter incidence from recent historical control data is In the absence of any other statistically significant changes in skeletal variations in the group from controls, the increase in this one variation, although statistically significant, was not considered toxicologically meaningful. The CHMP agreed with this conclusion and although these data suggest that treatment might  affect  the  formation  of  ossification  centres,  there  are  no  other  observations  which  could  be related to this apparent increase in ossification centres. The clinical relevance of this observation thus seems limited.

## Discussion on Reproduction Toxicity

The  CHMP noted that  maternal  adverse  effects  observed  in  the  reproductive  toxicity  studies  in  rats suggest  a  histaminergic-type  reaction  shortly  after  dosing.  Since  the  composition  of  excipients  (i.e. mannitol,  citrates,  and  polysorbate  80  NF)  in  the  high  dose  vials  appear  to  be  the  same  as  in  the placebo vials, according to the original study reports(study 1171-005 and 1171-004), and the placebo treated  animals  did  not  show  the  same  signs,  drug-related  hypersensitivity  reactions  cannot  be excluded. Several different batches of test article have been used within a single study. Due to the lack of lack of measurements of the process impurities in some of development batches, no conclusions can be drawn on the causality of these adverse reactions. However, one of the batches used for the high dose and for which the process impurities are known, was administered to rabbits in the embryo-foetal study and rats in the fertility study as mentioned in section on repeat dose toxicity. The fact that this batch did cause the same adverse reactions while having much lower levels of process impurities than in other toxicity studies suggests that either they were not attributable to Since neither toxicokinetics nor anti-drug antibodies have been measured in the reproductive toxicity studies, their results should be interpreted with caution. Higher titres of anti-drug antibodies would be expected to be elicited in rats  than  in  humans.  Hence,  the  exposure  of  the  embryo-foetus  to  taliglucerase  could  have  been impaired due to neutralising antibodies. Published information on the outcomes of alglucerase and/or imiglucerase  therapy  on  breastfeeding  mothers  and/or  their  breastfed  infants  is  sparse.  Enzyme ingested  by  infants via breast  milk  is  likely  to  be  degraded  in  the  digestive  system  and,  therefore, unlikely to reach the newborn's systemic circulation.

Overall,  the  Committee  considers  that  there  is  insufficient  information  to  recommend  the  use  of taliglucerase during pregnancy and lactation. The proposed recommendations under section 4.6 of the SmPC reflect the necessary cautious approach (Latest version of the Product Information as submitted by the applicant but not adopted by the CHMP). Whilst this is a stand alone application, one might question whether there was relevant information from other members of the product class that might provide an indication of the human risk. In this context, it should be taken into account that structural differences between imiglucerase, velaglucerase, and taliglucerase, have an impact in their respective serum half-life and differences in tissue distribution and trans-placental transfer cannot be ruled out between taliglucerase, velaglucerase, and imiglucerase. Considering that the half-life of taliglucerase in humans  is  about  2  to  5-fold  higher  than  the  values  published  for  the  other  two  products  used  as Gaucher  disease  treatments,  it  seems  likely  that  taliglucerase  has  more  time  than  imiglucerace  or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

velaglucerase  to  interact  with  the  mannose  receptor  present  in  the  human  placenta.  Although reference  is  made  to  velaglucerase,  the  CHMP  considers  that  results  of  the  pre-  and  post-natal development studies with velaglucerase are not directly extrapolable to taliglucerase and hence, the SmPC states that pre- and post-natal studies have not been conducted with taliglucerase.

## Toxicokinetic data

The pharmacokinetics programme for taliglucerase alfa included toxicokinetic monitoring in the repeatdose i.v. toxicity studies in marmoset and cynomolgus monkeys including a 39-week study mimicking the  clinical  treatment  regimen  (i.e.  dosing  every  two  weeks).  The  results  from  the  toxicokinetic measurements in these  studies  suggest  that  the  clearance  of  taliglucerase  alfa  is  saturable  and,  to some extent, inducible after long term treatment.

## Local Tolerance

No separate local tolerance studies have been performed. Local effects were assessed in the repeatdose  studies.  Local,  injection  site  changes  were  noted  in  the  repeat-dose  studies  in  marmoset  and cynomolgus monkey. These changes were related to the IV infusion technique and not to taliglucerase alfa  since  they  occurred  at  the  same  incidence  and  severity  in  the  vehicle  control  and  drug-treated animals.  In  marmosets  (daily  dosing  for  14  and  29  days)  scabbing,  reddening,  and  bruising  at  the injection site were observed. For cynomolgus monkeys, local effects were limited to red discoloration of the  injection  site  in  the  4-week  study  and  no  visible  injection  site  changes  in  the  39-week  study. Microscopic  changes  at  the  injection  site  were  similar  in  both  species  and  primarily  included haemorrhage and inflammation. These data indicate no additional effects of taliglucerase alfa on the injection site.

## Other toxicity studies

There  was  no  evidence  of  immunotoxicity  in  the  repeat-dose  studies  conducted  in  cynomolgus monkeys. The mannose receptor is crucial in eliciting the innate immune response to pathogens, and it is  up-regulated  during  infections.  The  lack  of  increase  in  incidence  of  infections  in  the  pre-clinical studies  suggests  that  the  immune  system  was  not  impaired  by  the  temporary  occupancy  of  the receptor by taliglucerase. Since the dosing interval for taliglucerase alfa is two weeks and the half-life (30 mins) is shorter than the doubling time of most bacteria and fungi, the temporary occupancy of the macrophage  mannose  receptor  is  short.  There  has  also  been  no  increased  incidence  of  infections during the clinical use of taliglucerase alfa.

No signs of dependence or withdrawal have been reported in the toxicology studies. Dependence is not expected to be an issue for this type of product. The lack of metabolites studies is justified given the protein nature of the product.

The process impurities regarded as toxicologically qualified, based in the profile of the test article used in long term toxicity studies, are well above the specifications in the commercial formulation

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

No environmental risk assessment has been conducted with taliglucerase alfa. The CHMP acknowledged that the lack of ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment is justified given the protein nature of the product.

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The nonclinical pharmacology programme consisted of a series of in vitro studies to evaluate primary pharmacodynamics of taliglucerase alfa. In their development programme, the applicant compared the activity  of  taliglucerase  alfa  with  imiglucerase  in  some  of  these  studies.  In  addition,  the  uptake  of taliglucerase alfa by rat, rabbit, human and monkey macrophages was evaluated. These in vitro data confirm that taliglucerase alfa exhibits a specific interaction with the Man/GlcNAc receptor present in Gaucher cells. Furthermore, whilst not strictly relevant to this stand alone application, taliglucerase alfa exhibits  similar  enzyme  kinetics  to  imiglucerase.  Despite  no in  vivo pharmacodynamic  studies  have been  conducted,  there is sufficient non-clinical and  clinical evidence to support the primary pharmacodynamic effect of taliglucerase alfa as ERT in GD. Secondary pharmacodynamic studies were not conducted because the uptake of taliglucerase alfa is receptor mediated on specific target cells and its activity as an enzyme is specific. Potential adverse effects on CNS, respiratory and cardiovascular systems were evaluated by monitoring of clinical signs and recording of ECG in single and/or repeatdose  toxicity  studies.  No  indication  of  drug-related  adverse  effects  on  these  organ  systems  was observed.  Pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  not  conducted;  given  the  specificity  of taliglucerase alfa as an enzyme, these are unlikely to occur.

The  pharmacokinetics  programme  for  taliglucerase  alfa  consisted  of  toxicokinetic  monitoring  in  the repeat-dose  i.v.  toxicity  studies  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  including  a  39-week  study  mimicking  the clinical  treatment  regimen.  No  additional  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  been  conducted.  The  lack  of formal  distribution  studies  was  adequately  justified  by  the  applicant.  The  differences  in  tissue distribution  and  trans-placental  transfer  cannot  be  entirely  ruled.  Metabolism  and  excretion  were deemed not necessary due to the anticipated breakdown of the enzyme to small peptides and amino acids.  Thus,  justifications  for  the  absence  of  stand-alone  distribution,  metabolism,  excretion  and pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies are acceptable. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were not conducted since taliglucerase alfa is a protein and interactions with co-administered drugs subject to  cytochrome  P450-dependent  metabolism  are  unlikely  to  occur.  The  lack  of  information  on  tissue distribution and trans-placental transfer is reflected in the statement on the lack of pre- and post-natal development  studies  in  the  SmPC  (Latest  version  of  the  Product  Information  as  submitted  by  the applicant but not adopted by the CHMP).

A programme of single dose, repeat-dose, fertility and embryo-foetal development toxicity studies was performed to evaluate the safety of taliglucerase alfa. The single dose toxicity testing did not reveal noteworthy findings. In the repeat dose studies, the treatment Findings in the cynomolgus monkeys study  included  thyroid  changes  at  the  high  dose,  which  were  not  considered  to  be  toxicologically significant  due  to  low  incidence  and  lack  of  statistical  significance.  Similarly  to  the  study  conducted with marmoset  monkeys,  there  were  no  significant  effects  on  body  weight,  ophthalmoscopic observations, ECG parameters, clinical pathology parameters, or antibody analyses. When cynomolgus monkeys were treated once every two weeks for 39 weeks the only test article related effect was antidrug antibody formation. None of the antibodies detected in any of these studies was neutralising and the  observed  pattern  of  antibody  response  indicates  that  taliglucerase  alfa  has  a  low  potential  for immunogenicity.  Since  neither  toxicokinetics  nor  anti-drug  antibodies  have  been  measured  in  the reproductive  toxicity  studies,  their  results  are  interpreted  with  caution.  Higher  titres  of  anti-drug antibodies  would  be  expected  to  be  elicited  in  rats  than  in  humans.  Hence,  the  exposure  of  the embryo-foetus  to  taliglucerase  could  have  been  impaired  due  to  neutralising  antibodies.  Published information  on  the  outcomes  of  alglucerase  and/or  imiglucerase  therapy  on  breast  feeding  mothers and/or their  breast  fed  infants  is  sparse.  Enzyme  ingested  by  infants via breast  milk  is  likely  to  be degraded in the digestive system and, therefore, unlikely to reach the newborn's systemic circulation. There  is  not  sufficient  information  to  recommend  the  use  of  taliglucerase  during  pregnancy  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

lactation  and  appropriate  statement  is  included  in  the  SmPC.  The  lack  of  pre-  and  post-natal development studies was also included in the SmPC.

Studies on genotoxicity toxicity, carcinogenicity, peri/post-natal development, and in juvenile animals, were not conducted. The justifications based on scientific and regulatory guidelines, or on information available in the literature were accepted by the CHMP. There was no evidence of immunotoxicity in the repeat-dose studies conducted in marmosets and cynomolgus monkeys. Furthermore, dependence is not expected to be an issue for this type of product. The lack of metabolites studies and the lack of environmental risk assessment are justified given the protein nature of the product.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

Overall,  the  non-clinical  programme  for  taliglucerase  alfa  is  limited,  but  sufficient  to  support  this marketing authorisation application because appropriate justifications have been provided for the lack of  specific  studies.  Appropriate  studies  of  mechanism  of  action  (based  on  receptor-targeting)  and potency were conducted, and the program focussed on assessing the safety of taliglucerase alfa in a series of adequate non-comparative toxicity studies. Overall, recognising the stand alone nature of this application,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  extent  of  the  preclinical  information  together  with  the justifications  for  absence  of  certain  studies  is  acceptable.  The  results  from  studies  conducted  with velaglucerase  and  imiglucerase,  where  reported,  were  deemed  only  supportive,  and  not  necessarily directly extrapolable to taliglucerase alfa.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

The clinical development programme for taliglucerase alfa for the treatment of systemic symptoms in adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of GD consisted of one Phase 1 trial in healthy subjects (P01-2005)  and  three  Phase  3  safety  and  efficacy  clinical  studies  in  patients  with  GD,  including  one single pivotal completed study and two supportive ongoing studies. No Phase 2 study was included in the  clinical  programme  with  taliglucerase  alfa  as  it  belongs  to  a  class  of  drugs  with  a  known pharmacological principle and a demonstrated mechanism of action.

The pivotal Phase 3 study PB-06-001, was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind trial. The aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of two parallel dose groups (30 and 60 U/kg) in untreated adult patients with GD with taliglucerase alfa given by i.v. infusion every two weeks for 9 months. The dose comparison (30 and 60 U/kg) was conducted as a post-hoc analysis, stemming from PB-06-001 and up to 9 and 12 months of treatment in the frame of PB-06-003.

Study  PB-06-002  was  a  multicentre,  open-label,  switch-over  Phase  3  trial  to  assess  the  safety  and efficacy  of  taliglucerase  alfa  in  up  to  30  patients  with  GD  treated  with  imiglucerase.  The  study  was amended to include up to 30 patients as a result of the shortage of imiglucerase supply. Following recommendations from the Paediatric  Committee (PDCO)  on  9  April  2010,  the  protocol  was  further amended  to  include  at  least  5  patients  aged  2-18  years  within  the  total  of  30  patients.  Patients received  i.v.  infusion  of  taliglucerase  alfa  every  two  weeks  at  the  same  dose  as  their  previous imiglucerase  dose  in  the  past  6  months  or  to  the  dose  prior  to  the  shortage  of  imiglucerase.  The duration of the study was 9 months.

An extension study (Study PB-06-003) was initiated to collect long term data following treatment with taliglucerase alfa. Patients who completed 9 months of treatment in Protocols PB-06-001 and PB-06002 could be enrolled in PB-06-003. Patients extended from PB-06-001 to PB-06-003 remained blinded

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in  order  to  evaluate  clinical  outcomes  for  at  least  2  years,  where  it  is  expected  that  most  of  the patients will achieve disease stability.

Further to the above clinical protocols, compassionate use programmes including an Expanded Access Protocol (EAP) study, PB-06-004, and named-patient compassionate use were also ongoing. Creation of these programmes was triggered by the shortage of imiglucerase supply in mid-2009. The PB-06004 treatment protocol provides expanded access to patients whose imiglucerase dose was reduced or discontinued due to the supply disturbance. It was initiated in the USA and Israel in November 2009 and  is  ongoing.  Safety  data  collected  from  these  programmes  contribute  to  the  assessment  of  the safety profile of taliglucerase alfa.

Furthermore, a historical analysis of the data on imiglucerase and alglucerase was conducted in order to  put  the  efficacy  of  taliglucerase  alfa  into  context,  taking  into  account  data  obtained  with taliglucerase alfa with the publicly available data regarding the efficacy of imiglucerase and alglucerase in  the  treatment  of  GD.  No  comparison  was  made  to  the  orphan  medicinal  product  velaglucerase licensed in August 2010.

No  CHMP  scientific  advice  was  sought  with  respect  to  the  clinical  development  programme  of taliglucerase alfa. National scientific advice was sought after completion of the pivotal trial from several EU Member States. Key issues concerned the lack of a control group in the pivotal study, the strength of the statistical evidence, and the size of the safety database.

Safety data from supportive studies were included in the safety database. A post-hoc analysis on doseeffect  response  for  the  pivotal  study  PB-06-001  and  extension  study  PB-06-003  were  performed  to strengthen the statistical evidence. In addition, post-hoc secondary efficacy analyses were performed in  anaemic  and  hepatomegalic  patients  for  the  pivotal  study  PB-06-001  and  post-hoc  responder analyses were performed for the extension study PB-06-003.

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

Results of two clinical studies contributed to the information on pharmacokinetics: PB-06-01 (patients with  Gaucher  disease)  and  P-01-2005  (healthy  subjects).  During  development  of  the  product,  no changes in the formulation occurred and the drug product manufacturing process principles remained constant using conventional drug compounding, aseptic filling, and lyophilisation procedures. The tobe-marketed formulation of taliglucerase alfa was used in the Phase 1 and 3 clinical studies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Absorption

Taliglucerase alfa will be administered intravenously.

## Distribution

Taliglucerase alfa  pharmacokinetics is characterised by a very rapid clearance from plasma which is expectedly  caused  by  uptake  into  phagocytic  cells.  Hence  the  plasma  pharmacokinetics  reflects distribution  to  phagocytes,  and  not  the  concentration  at  the  active  site  within  the  cells.  The  mean volume of distribution of taliglucerase alfa in Gaucher disease patients was about 17 l at a dose of 30 U/kg  and  about  13  l  at  a  dose  of  60  U/kg.  Organ  distribution  studies  were  not  performed  for taliglucerase  alfa.  As  indicated  before,  cellular  uptake  of  taliglucerase  alfa  is  mediated  by  mannose receptors  and  its  distribution  to  and  subsequent  uptake  by  tissues/target  cells  is  receptor-driven. Taliglucerase  alfa  is  not  expected  to  cross  the  natural  blood  brain  barrier.  Plasma  protein  binding studies  are  considered  not  applicable  for  taliglucerase  alfa,  since  the  substance  is  not  expected  to significantly interact with plasma proteins.

## Elimination

Following infusion completion, taliglucerase alfa plasma concentrations fell rapidly with a mean t1/2 of 25 minutes. Clearance was about 30 l/h at a dose of 30 U/kg and lower at the dose level of 60 U/kg (about 20 l/h). The rapid clearance of taliglucerase alfa from plasma is consistent with the uptake of taliglucerase  alfa  into  macrophages via mannose  receptors.  Taliglucerase  alfa  is  a  protein,  which  is considered to be degraded into small proteins and single amino acids by well known mechanisms. As such, metabolite studies or further elimination studies were not performed.

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Taliglucerase alfa appears to exhibit dose proportional pharmacokinetics in the dose range investigated in  healthy  subjects,  however,  the  results  from  the  PK  evaluation  in  the  pivotal  study  demonstrates substantially more than proportional increase in the AUC with the higher dose. At the 60 U/kg dose, clearance was clearly lower compared at the 30 U/kg dose. Clearance was almost identical for both doses at both, week 1 and week 38. However, values were lower for the higher dose at both time points.  This  could  perhaps  suggest  saturation  of  the  uptake  in  phagocytes,  as  observed  also  in  the nonclinical studies. However,  taliglucerase appears  to exhibit approximately dose proportional pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 15 - 60 U/Kg. There does not seem to be any significant time dependency in the pharmacokinetics. Taliglucerase alfa is not expected to accumulate.

## Special populations

Data in special populations were not provided. The lack of data from patients with impaired renal or hepatic function is considered acceptable, considering that taliglucerase alfa is a protein. This is also the case for race, gender and weight. Taken into account the pharmacokinetic profile of taliglucerase alfa with rapid uptake into phagocytes and plasma concentrations that will not reflect the concentration at  the  effect  site,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  taliglucerase  alfa  will  not  be  useful  to  predict  potential efficacy and safety differences in special populations, and the lack of data in these groups is therefore acceptable  to  the  CHMP.  Furthermore,  taliglucerase  alfa  is  not  indicated  in  paediatric  population. However, since there are data in study PB-06-001 on gender, the CHMP requested a comparison of the results in  male  and  female  subjects in order to evaluate whether  there is a difference in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pharmacokinetics. In response, analyses of pharmacokinetic data based on gender were provided but no significant effect was observed.

Anti-taliglucerase antibodies: None of the healthy subjects in study P-01-2005 was positive for antitaliglucerase  alfa  antibodies.  In  study  PB-06-001,  including  Gaucher  disease  patients,  2  out  of  32 subjects  developed  IgG  antibodies  to  taliglucerase  alfa  during  9  months  of  treatment.  Neutralising antibody tests were negative for both patients and no hypersensitive reaction was observed. For both subjects,  pharmacokinetic  data  were  available.  Development  of  anti-taliglucerase  antibodies  did  not appear to have an adverse influence on pharmacokinetics, as the obtained pharmacokinetics values in these subjects were within the range of values observed in the studies. Nevertheless, the number of patients  with  developed  antibodies  was  low  and  pharmacokinetics  is  variable,  which  precludes  a definitive conclusion.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

No interaction studies have been conducted with taliglucerase alfa, which is acceptable for an enzyme intended to be used in enzyme replacement therapy.

## Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No studies using human biomaterials were submitted.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

Taliglucerase  alfa  is  a  recombinant  human  glucocerebrosidase  intended  as  long-term  ERT  for  the treatment  of  Gaucher  disease  and  its  pharmacotherapeutic  rationale  is  the  supplementation  or replacement  of the deficient  beta-glucocerebrosidase  in  lysosomes.  The  pharmacodynamics  of taliglucerase alfa has been evaluated in vitro in the nonclinical studies. Pharmacodynamic endpoints like platelet count and Hgb, as well as spleen and liver organ volumes can not be applied in studies with healthy volunteers, but are considered clinically relevant efficacy endpoints in phase III clinical trials.  No  specific  clinical  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  conducted  in  healthy  volunteers. Available  preclinical  data  as  well  as  experience  with  alglucerase  and  imiglucerase  are  considered  to provide an adequate rational for the clinical development of taliglucerase alfa.

## Mechanism of action

Taliglucerase alfa is a plant cell expressed recombinant human glucocerebrosidase, naturally containing exposed  tri-mannose  residues,  which  is  produced  in  transformed  carrot  cells.  This  is  achieved  by targeting taliglucerase  alfa  to  specific  subcellular  organelles  using  a  plant-specific  C-terminal  sorting signal. This targeting to the vacuoles takes advantage of the fact that the terminal residues in complex N-glycans  in  vacuolar  glycoproteins  are  removed  resulting  in  paucimannosidic  type  N-glycans  that constitute a consensus 'vacuole-type' glycan, with naturally exposed mannose on all glycan structures. This  high  mannose  form  allows  it  to  be  effectively  taken  up  by  the  phagocytic  cells via mannose receptors. Preclinical studies established the mechanism of action, which is the similar to the currently authorised product imiglucerase.

## Primary and Secondary pharmacology

The clinical programme with taliglucerase alfa was based on the fact that ERT is a class of drug with a known  pharmacological  principle  and  a  demonstrated  mechanism  of  action,  for  which  extensive experience is available regarding the  required  dosing  regimen.  The  pharmacodynamic  effects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

demonstrated in vitro were substantiated by the efficacy results obtained during the pivotal PB-06-001 clinical trial. No pharmacodynamic studies were carried out on either patients or healthy subjects. Due to the well known mechanism of action, the demonstrated pharmacological similarity to imiglucerase and the lack of surrogate parameters in healthy volunteers, this approach is acceptable.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The pharmacokinetic data obtained from studies PB-06-01 and P-01-2005 showed that the clearance and half-life appeared to vary between the healthy subjects and Gaucher patients studies, which may be due to the comparatively smaller sample size of the former. In addition, the infusion rates were different in some patients between the two studies, and therefore exposures were different between GD patients and healthy subjects, but the range of values at both the 30 and 60U/kg was wide with overlap  of  values  between  the  two  populations.  The  values  of  half-life,  clearance  and  volume  of distribution  are  consistent  with  the  uptake  of  the  substance  into  phagocytes.  The  lack  of  additional evaluation of elimination for taliglucerase is acceptable as this is an endogenous enzyme and would be expected to be degraded similarly. Pharmacokinetics in special populations, impaired renal or hepatic function,  race,  weight  and  elderly  have  not  been  investigated  which  is  considered  acceptable.  No specific  drug-interaction  studies  have  been  performed,  but  these  are  not  expected.  No  apparent pharmacokinetic differences between male and female patients were identified.

Similar  to  other  ERT,  taliglucerase  alfa  appears  to  induce  antibodies  in  patients  treated.  However, these seem to be overall low, since none of the healthy subjects were antibody positive in the phase I study and only 2 patients developed IgG antibodies in the pivotal trial but did not show neutralising activity. Nevertheless, this issue will be address via adequate surveillance of antibody formation.

Due  to its mechanism  of action and the lack of simple surrogate markers of effect, the pharmacodynamics of  taliglucerase  alpha  can  be  evaluated  in  long-term  efficacy  studies.  Given  the specificity of the enzyme, no secondary pharmacodynamic effects are expected and the lack of data is thus acceptable. This also accounts for drug-drug interactions and neither in vitro interaction studies nor in vivo clinical drug interaction studies were conducted, which is acceptable to the CHMP.

## 2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The CHMP considered the pharmacokinetics of taliglucerase to be adequately assessed. There does not seem  to  be  any  significant  time  dependency  in  the  pharmacokinetics.  Pharmacokinetics  in  special populations, in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, the effects of race, weight and age, and the specific drug-interaction studies were not performed, since significant effect is not expected for an  enzyme.  Similarly,  no  formal  clinical  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  conducted  in  healthy volunteers. The clinical  pharmacology development programme for taliglucerase alfa was considered adequate to support the marketing authorisation application.

## 2.5. Clinical efficacy

## 2.5.1. Dose response studies

No formal dose-response studies were performed, but two dose groups (30 U/kg and 60 U/kg) were included in the phase III pivotal efficacy and safety trial PB-06-001. Furthermore, dose selection was based on results from preclinical studies, clinical and laboratory assessments of safety and tolerability, as well as clinical activity. The phase I study showed linear kinetics and no safety issues for doses of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

15 U/kg, 30 U/kg and 60 U/kg and the chosen dose was 60 U/kg (1.8 mg/kg), which is approximately 5 fold less than the animal NOAEL in animals adjusted to body surface area. The pharmacological basis for  the  dose  selection  relied  on  the  principle  that  both  imiglucerase  and  taliglucerase  alfa  are mechanistically  similar  and  are  intended  for  the  same  therapeutic  indication  according  to  dose escalation design. The higher dose (60 U/kg) was also chosen based on the safety and efficacy results obtained for imiglucerase.  Consequently, no dose finding phase I or II studies were performed. The approach for dose selection is considered acceptable, given the similarities between taliglucerase alfa and imiglucerase and the extensive clinical experience with imiglucerase for more than 10 years.

## 2.5.2. Main studies

Study PB-06-001: A Phase III, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Trial to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Two Parallel Dose Groups of Plant Cell Expressed Recombinant Human Glucocerebrosidase (prGCD) in Patients With Gaucher Disease

Study PB-06-001 is considered pivotal for  the  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  evaluation  of  taliglucerase alfa. Thus, the main parts of the clinical efficacy chapter refer to the conduct and results of this pivotal study and data from other, supportive, studies are quoted as appropriate.

## Methods

## Study Participants

The patient population in study PB-06-001 included male and female subjects, 18 years or older. The diagnosis of GD was based on a leukocyte glucocerebrosidase activity level ≤ 3 nmol/mg.hr, which was ≤ 30 % of the mean activity of the reference range. The patients were required  to have splenomegaly at  least  eight  times  the  expected  normal  volume  [measured  volume  divided  by  estimated  normal volume (0.2% of body weight)] as determined by MRI volumetric analysis and to have thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet counts &lt;120,000 per mm3) with or without anaemia (defined by haemoglobin at least 1 g/dl below normal range according to sex and age).

The  main  exclusion  criteria  included  patients  who  had  received  ERT  in  the  past  or  if  they  had  not received  ERT  more  than  12  months  before  entry  they  were  required  to  have  a  negative  antiglucocerebrosidase antibody test at screening. Patients who had received substrate reduction therapy (SRT) in the past 12 months were also excluded. Other main exclusion criteria were the presence of HIV  and/or,  HBsAg,  and/or  hepatitis  C  infections;  history  of  allergy  to  carrots;  substrate  reduction therapy  (SRT)  in  the  past  12  months;  a  positive  anti-glucocerebrosidase  antibody  test;  previous anaphylactoid reaction to Cerezyme or Ceredase.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered by the CHMP as appropriate for this type of study.

## Treatments

Patients in study PB-06-001 received i.v. infusion of taliglucerase alfa every two weeks. The individual dose for each patient was prepared according to patient's weight and the randomised treatment group (30 units/kg or 60 units/kg body weight) and for practical reasons the dose, in terms of total units, was rounded up to avoid the use of partial vials. Each dose was prepared by an unblinded pharmacist at  each  site.  A  dose  adjustment  check  was  performed  every  three  months;  if  a  patient's  weight changed,  the  dose  was  adjusted  according  to  the  new  weight.  Human  taliglucerase  alfa  vials  were stored lyophilized at 2-8 C.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For initial infusions in all patients, human taliglucerase alfa was administered at a rate of 1.2 mL/min. If the rate of infusion was well tolerated, it could be increased up to 2.25 mL/min to deliver the 135 mL volume over one hour for all subsequent dosing. During the study, infusion rate was changed to occur over a 2-hour period to minimize the potential for increased risk of infusion reactions due to faster infusion rates.

## Objectives

The primary objective of study PB-06-001 was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of taliglucerase alfa in untreated patients with significant signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease assessing the following parameters:

-  - Percentage change in spleen volume from baseline to month 9 equals zero
-  - Percentage change in spleen volume from baseline to month 9 is not equal to zero

Another  objective  included  the  determination  of  changes  in  secondary  parameters  (liver  volume, haemoglobin,  platelet  counts,  and  biomarkers).  Exploratory  analyses  were  performed  to  assess  the effect  of  taliglucerase  on  bone.  Evaluation  of  safety  of  taliglucerase  alfa  treatment  in  patients  with Gaucher disease was also undertaken. In addition, the pharmacokinetic profile in patients with Gaucher disease was determined, as discussed in section 2.4.2.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The choice of the following study endpoints was considered appropriate by the CHMP:

Primary Efficacy Endpoints: The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change from baseline of spleen volume after nine months of treatment with taliglucerase alfa.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: The major secondary efficacy endpoints were the change from baseline of: haemoglobin, percentage change of liver volume, platelet counts.

The  other secondary outcome  measures  were:  biomarkers:  chitotriosidase or  pulmonary  and activation-regulated chemokine (PARC/CCL18), proportion of patients with greater than 10% reduction in spleen volume at 9 months.

Tertiary endpoints: QCSI: a long-term follow-up of a small subpopulation of patients, change in bone mineral density measured with DEXA.

Safety: Safety measurements included adverse events, clinical laboratory evaluation, electrocardiogram  and  echocardiogram,  pulmonary  function  tests,  anti  human  taliglucerase  alfa antibodies and hypersensitivity reactions. Adverse events were recorded at each visit. Complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry and urinalysis were performed at Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 and then at every other  visit  (once  a  month)  for  9  months.  Anti-human  taliglucerase  alfa  antibody  was  determined  at every visit for the first 5 visits, and following that every other visit.

## Sample size

With  12  patients  in  each  treatment  group  (taliglucerase  alfa  30  units/kg  and  taliglucerase  alfa  60 units/kg), there was greater than 95% power to detect a change of 20% or more using a one-sample t-test  (alpha=0.025,  2-sided  test  to  allow  for  each  group  to  be  tested  separately)  to  evaluate  the primary outcome of percentage change in spleen volume after nine months. This calculation was based on the assumption that the standard deviation for the percentage change in spleen volume was 12%. Based on previous research, a normal spleen volume is expected to be approximately 0.12 L, and the patients  in  this  protocol  were  expected  to  have  spleen  volumes  8  times  this  size.  Thus,  a  20%

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

reduction in spleen volume was anticipated to be equal to 0.192 L change in the mean spleen volume. To account for dropouts, 15 patients will be enrolled for each treatment group in order to ensure that at least 12 will have final measurements.

## Randomisation

A unique screening number was assigned to all patients who signed the informed consent in study PB06-001. After successful completion of the screening period, but prior to dosing, the eligible patient was randomised centrally and assigned a unique randomisation number, which included the site and patient number. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups in equal ratios, by site, using a computer generated randomisation code.

## Blinding (masking)

The  investigators,  patients,  clinical  research  organisations,  central  MRI  reader,  laboratory  staff,  and sponsor were blinded to the identity of the treatment in study PB-06-001.  Blinded interim safety data were reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee. Knowledge of the randomisation code was limited to the persons responsible for the creation of the randomisation code and implementation into  the  eCRF,  preparation  of  the  study  medication  (site  pharmacist),  and  unblinded  monitors  and personnel responsible for product accountability. Unblinded study personnel did not have access to the clinical  data  and  were  not  involved  in  the  management  of  the  study.  The  medication  code  could  be broken only in the event of an adverse event that the investigator felt could not be adequately treated without knowing the identity of the study drug. The blinding method was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## Statistical methods

Three study populations were defined in the analyses in study PB-06-001:

-  Intent-to-Treat (ITT): Patients who received at least one dose of medication and had at least the screening/baseline MRI evaluation.
-  Per Protocol (PP) population: All ITT patients who completed 9 months of treatment and had no major protocol violations.
-  Safety Population: Patients who received at least one dose of study medication

Efficacy evaluation: The primary efficacy analysis was based on two one-sample t-tests (one for each treatment group) to determine if the percentage change in spleen volume is different than zero using the  ITT  population.  The  analysis  was  also  performed  using  the  PP  population.  The  primary  efficacy analysis  on  the  ITT  population  was  performed  using  the  missing  data  strategies  to  handle  potential missing data. A multiple imputation approach was performed using all available observed data and the primary efficacy analysis was performed using the imputed data sets. Results were combined from the 100  imputation  models  to  provide  overall  efficacy  results.  In  addition,  sensitivity  analysis  was performed using  different  missing  data  techniques.  A  mixed  effects  model  including  dose  and  time, with subject as a random effect, was fit to examine whether there was a difference between treatment groups. For each of the secondary endpoints, a one-sample t-test (% change in liver volume, mean change in haemoglobin and platelet count) was examined for each dose using the step-down approach. Hierarchical order was spleen volume followed by haemoglobin, liver volume and platelet count.  Mean change from baseline was tested for each dose group at an alpha level of 0.025. Potential differences between treatment groups were analysed using a mixed effects model.

Safety  evaluation: All  adverse  events  occurring  after  randomisation  or  which  were  present  prior  to randomisation but worsened after treatment were classified by MedDRA System Organ Class/preferred

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

term  stating  number  of  adverse  events,  percentage  of  patients  reporting  adverse  events  and  the number of serious adverse events. No statistical testing was performed.

Post-hoc analyses: Post-hoc analyses were performed to explore the secondary endpoints in subgroups of patients with anaemia or hepatomegaly, and to evaluate a possible dose effect, which studied using an ANCOVA model including dose group and the baseline value as continuous covariate. The reasoning behind this post-hoc analysis was to standardise statistical analytical methods for study PB-06-001 and PB-06-003 to facilitate side by side comparisons of efficacy results obtained at both 9 and 12 months after the start of treatment. Post-hoc analyses were performed for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. No adjustments for multiplicity were made. All secondary endpoints were analysed using observed data only.

The CHMP noted that the statistical analysis plan (SAP) was drawn up after inclusion of the last patient and  near  the  end  of  the  study  period.  It  contains  several  deviations  from  the  statistical  section. Justification of the changes to the statistical analysis plan was not provided. These included a less strict alternative  hypothesis  for  the  primary  endpoint  and  the  secondary  analysis  using  a  step-down approach with platelet count being the last in hierarchical order planned after study end both point towards demonstrating efficacy. A major concern was therefore raised on the validity of these changes. In  response,  the  applicant  sufficiently  justified  the  reasons  for  change  in  the  SAP,  providing  some reassurance that the changes were not data driven. The step-down approach and the hierarchical order testing is appropriate, and although it would appear unusual to test platelet count as the last in order, based on the original analysis, the p-value was the lowest for platelet count and the endpoints would also have been met using the original SAP.

## Results

## Participant flow

Forty  four  patients  were  screened  for  eligibility  in  study  PB-006-01  and  11  were  excluded,  mainly because  inclusion  criteria  were  not  met.  Thirty  three  patients  were  randomized  and  32  received  at least one dose of taliglucerase alfa. Three patients discontinued treatment, two due to adverse events and one due to pregnancy. One patient had an adverse event and received only a partial dose of study medication; this patient was excluded form the ITT population (ITT population; n=15 with 30 U/kg and n=16 with 60 U/kg). Two patients did not complete 9 months of treatment and twenty nine patients completed all 20 study visits (PP population; n=14 received 30 U/kg and n=15 received 60 U/kg).

## Recruitment

Study PB-006-01 was conducted in the UK, Spain, Italy, Israel, South Africa, Canada, Serbia, Mexico, USA and Chile. The first patient was recruited in August 2007, the last patient in November 2008. The study ended in September 2009.

## Conduct of the study

Following the start of the study PB-006-01, two amendments to the study protocol (version 4) were issued. Minor, country specific changes were issued during the first amendment. All country specific amendments were ultimately included in both versions of the protocol. Version 5 was not available for 8 sites. At these 8 sites, protocol version 6 was an amendment to version 4. Protocol 6 was available shortly after version 5. these were concluded not to affect the outcome of the clinical study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Protocol deviations/violations: A total of 24 patients had protocol deviations; one patient with a major protocol violation (positive urine pregnancy test) and discontinued from the study after Visit 10. The majority of the deviations were visits outside of scheduled window or study procedures. Although the Committee noted that the number of patients with protocol deviations is relatively high, the majority of deviations is not considered to impact the outcomes of the study as they primarily relate to the time window of performance and do not affect primary or major secondary outcomes. Patients not meeting inclusion criteria for platelet counts were evenly distributed among dose groups and are not likely to affect the comparison between dose groups.

## Baseline data

The following table summarises the overall demographic characteristics for the ITT population in the pivotal study. Both treatment groups had comparable demographic profiles. The results are similar to those observed in the safety and PP population. Fourteen patients had homozygous and 17 patients had  heterozygous  mutations;  the  distribution  of  mutations  was  evenly  distributed  between  dose groups.

The time from diagnosis to first treatment ranged from 1 to 44 years for taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg and less than 1 year to 33 years for taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg. Two patients in the taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg dose group had a history of ERT (imiglucerase) whereas in the taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg dose group  one  patient  had  a  history  of  ERT  (alglucerase)  and  one  patient  of  SRT  (miglustat).  Medical history, baseline vital sign measurements, and physical examinations appeared comparable between dosing arms. Electrocardiograms, echocardiography and pulmonary function test results for the safety population at the screening visit were comparable. The most commonly used concomitant medications were analgesics, antibacterials and antihistamines for systemic use. Almost all patients included in the study  had  non-neuronopathic  disease,  which  has  been  noted  by  the  CHMP  and  was  subsequently reflected in the approved indication.

## Numbers analysed

In total, 44 patients were screened, 33 were enrolled, 32 were evaluated for safety and 31 for efficacy in  the  pivotal  study  PB-006-01.  One  patient  was  randomised  to  the  60  units/kg  group  but  did  not

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

receive  any  dose  of  study  medication.  One  patient  was  excluded  from  the  ITT  population  who  was randomised to the 30 units/kg group as they only received a partial dose of study medication.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoint

The  primary  efficacy  analysis  in  study  PB-06-001  demonstrated  that  taliglucerase  alfa  treatment significantly reduced spleen volume from screening to the Month 9 time point as summarised in the table below, and at the Month 6 time point (taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg, 22.21%; taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg, 29.94%; p&lt; 0.0001) in patients with GD.

The differences between the two readers in spleen volume measurements were negligible; the majority of  the  readings  showed  less  than  1%  difference.    There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference observed  in  the  mean  spleen  volume  between  the  two  dose  groups  at  Months  6  and  9  (p=0.060). These  results  were  consistent  for  both  ITT  and  PP  analyses  populations  regardless  of  whether  the average combined imputation, or individual imputation model (1 to 100), or independent reader (1 and 2), or last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used. The CHMP noted that the data did show efficacy of taliglucerase alfa and the dose response effect supports assay sensitivity.

## Secondary endpoints

## Haemoglobin

The mean haemoglobin values at baseline were at the lower limit of the normal range (taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg, 12.2 g/dl; taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg, 11.4 g/dl) and returned to normal values at the end of the study, i.e. at 9 months (taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg, 14.0 g/dl; taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg, 13.6 g/dl).  As  shown  in  the  table  below,  a  significant  increase  in  mean  haemoglobin  level  was  observed between the baseline and the end of the study for both doses. Increase in mean haemoglobin level was also observed at 6 months for both doses.

Elelyso CHMP assessment report

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There  was  no  significant  difference  observed  in  mean  haemoglobin  values  between  the  two  dose groups at Months 6 and 9. Similar results were observed in the PP population analysis. Eight patients in the 60 U/kg dose group and two patients in the 30 U/kg dose group were anaemic at inclusion time (haemoglobin level &lt; 11 g/dl for women and &lt; 12 g/dl for men).  In order to assess the effect of taliglucerase alfa in the clinically relevant group of anaemic patients, a post hoc subgroup analysis was carried out, on all 10 anaemic patients together, irrespective of dose group. Change in haemoglobin levels of patients defined as anaemic demonstrated an increase of 2.3 g/dl at 6 months and of 3.2 g/dl at 9 months for both dose groups combined.

## Liver Volume

Significant  reduction  in  liver  volume  from  screening  to  Month  6  was  observed  in  both  dose  groups (taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg, 7.56%, p= 0.0020); taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg, 7.51%, p= 0.0022). This was further reduced in both taliglucerase alfa dose groups at the end of the study (taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg, 10.48%, taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg, 11.11%). There was no significant difference observed in mean liver volume between the two dose groups at Months 6 and 9. These results are also consistent with the PP population analyses results. The % change in liver volume was analysed through a posthoc analysis in  the  clinically  relevant  subgroup  of  hepatomegalic  patients.  Patients  who  entered  the study with hepatomegaly (11 patients in the 30 U/kg dose group and 7 patients in the 60 U/kg dose group)  defined  as  &gt;  1.5  times  expected  liver  volume  (calculated  as  2.5%  of  body  weight) demonstrated  a  more  significant  decrease  in  liver  volume  at  6  months  and  9  months  (10.2%  and 13.9%, respectively) for both doses together.

## Platelet count

A significant increase in platelet count from baseline was observed in the 60 U/kg dose group at Month 9. Clinically relevant improvement (not statistically significant since the patients did not meet the prespecified alpha level of 0.025) in platelet count was also observed for the taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg dose group at Month 9 improvement as early as 6 months of treatment in both dose group. Significant increases in mean platelet count from baseline were also observed in taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg treated patients  compared to  taliglucerase  alfa  30  U/kg  treated  patients  at  Months  6  and  9.  Similar  results were noted for the PP population.

CHMP  commented  that  although  the  data  show  efficacy  of  the  highest  dose  group,  a  concern  was raised with respect to the clinical efficacy of the lowest dose group, as discussed in section 2.5.3.

## Plasma Chitotriosidase

Disease severity or response to taliglucerase alfa was also monitored by measurement of chitotriosidase levels prior to the dose administration and at Visits 7, 14 and 20. All patients achieved clinically relevant decreases in chitotriosidase levels at the end of the study, reflective of the severity

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of the disease state. The  mean  level  of  chitotriosidase decreased  in  the ITT population  by approximately 50% from baseline to the end of study.

## Reduction in spleen volume by &gt;10%

The proportion of patients reaching ≥ 10% reduction in spleen volume was set as one of the secondary endpoints.  Spleen  volume  reduction ≥ 10%  from  the  screening  visit  was  observed  in  100%  of taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg treated patients and in 93.8% of taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg treated patients at Month 6. At the end of study, all patients in both dose groups (100%) had at least a 10% reduction in spleen volume.  These results are also consistent with analyses performed on PP population. When using LOCF method, one taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg treated patient did not achieve a 10% reduction in spleen volume at the end of study.

## Tertiary endpoints

Lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip DEXA scans at the screening visit and the end of study were presented by T score, Z score and bone mineral density (BMD). The majority of mean values of these measurements were within the normal range. Patients treated with taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg tended to have lower mean scores in DEXA at the screening visit than the patients treated with 30 U/kg. A trend in improvement of the mean change of T and Z score for lumbar spine and femoral neck was observed after 9 months treatment in both study groups.

## Changes in bone marrow fat fraction

Change  in  the  bone  marrow  fat  fraction  measured  by  quantitative  QCSI  was  assessed  as  an exploratory endpoint. The QCSI is a modification of the Dixon technique that quantifies the fat content in  bone  marrow  with  high  reproducibility  and  sensitivity.  The  amount  of  fat  in  the  bone  marrow  is represented as a fat fraction, which is decreased in patients with GD condition. A value for fat fraction of ≤ 0.23  is  an  indication  of  bone  complications  or  'bone  at  risk'.  The  optional  lumbar  spine  QCSI assessment was performed at the screening visit and at the end of study. Ten patients (taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg, n=5; taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg, n=5) had QCSI performed at the screening visit and 9 patients had QCSI performed at the end of the study. One reading in the taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg treatment group was not evaluable due to technical issues; therefore, only 8 patients (taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg, 4; taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg, 4) had QCSI performed at the end of study. The PB-06-001 study compared QCSI measurements from baseline to the 9 Month visit. The baseline data revealed that eight out of ten patients at baseline presented a fat fraction of ≤ 0.23, and that only two patients had a fat fraction &gt; 0.23. All eight patients who had a measurement at  9 month, showed increases in the  fat  fraction  with  a  value  of ≥ 0.02  at  the  end  of  study.  Of  these,  7  patients  showed  a  fraction increase ≥ 0.03, which was considered a true response to the ERT. Four of the eight patients had an increase  of  fat  fraction ≥ 0.10,  which  was  considered  a  high  response.  Overall,  an  increase  in  fatfraction  was observed in all patients using the QCSI technique within 9 months of taliglucerase alfa treatment.  An  improvement  in  \"bone  at  risk\"  (fat  fraction ≤ 0.23)  was  seen  in  the  trial  patient population such that at baseline only 25% (2/8) of the patients had a fat fraction &gt; 0.23 and after 9 month of  treatment  this  number  increased  to  75%  (6/8)  of  the  patients  with  a  fat  fraction  &gt;0.23. Taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg treated patients showed greater fat-fraction increases than the taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg treated patients.

## Ancillary analyses

## Dose separation post hoc analysis for taliglucerase alfa protocols PB-06-001 and PB-06-003

Since dose separation analyses were performed in studies PB-06-001 and PB-06-003 using different statistical methods, post-hoc analyses were performed to re-analyse the data using statistical methods consistent for both the 9 month time point of study PB-06-001 and the 3 month time point of study PB-06-003  (which  is  month  12  relative  to  the  start  of  study  PB-06-001).  The  objectives  of  these

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analyses were to compare efficacy responses between the 30 U/kg and 60 U/kg doses of taliglucerase alfa after 9 and 12 months of treatment.

For the primary efficacy analysis performed on the ITT population both dosage groups demonstrated a significant  reduction  in  spleen  volume  from  baseline  to  the  Month  9  and  Month  12  visits.  The taliglucerase  alfa  60  U/kg  dose  group  showed  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  mean  spleen volume reduction at Month 9 and Month 12 compared to the 30 U/kg dose. Results are consistent with the analyses performed showing statistical differences between doses using raw mean values, LOCF or OBS methods for missing data. When evaluating the secondary efficacy, a significant reduction in liver volume from Baseline  to  Month  9  and  Month  12  was  observed  in  both  dose  groups  when  data  are adjusted  with  baseline  measures.  There  was  no  significant  difference  in  the  mean  liver  volume reduction  between  the  two  dose  groups  at  Months  9  and  12.  The  results  are  consistent  with  the analyses performed using the raw mean values. Increases in mean platelet counts from baseline were observed at Month 9 and 12 in data adjusted with baseline measures. Increases in mean platelet count from baseline were observed in taliglucerase alfa 60 U/kg treated patients compared to taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg treated patients at Months 9 and 12. There was a statistically significant mean difference between  the  taliglucerase  alfa  60  U/kg  and Month  9  and  Month  12  in  data  adjusted  with baseline measures.  The  results  are  consistent  with  the  analyses  performed  using  the  raw  mean  values.  An increase in mean haemoglobin level from baseline was observed in both dose groups at Month 9 and 12 when data are adjusted with baseline measures. There was no significant difference observed in the increased  mean  haemoglobin  values  between  the  two  dose  groups  at  Months  9  and  12.  Disease severity  or  response  to  treatment  was  also  monitored  by  measurement  of  chitotriosidase.  Clinically relevant decrease in chitotriosidase level from baseline was observed in both dose groups at Month 9 when data are adjusted with baseline measures. There was no significant difference observed in the decreased  mean  chitotriosidase  values  between  the  two  dose  groups  at  Months  9.  The  results  are consistent with the analyses performed using the raw mean values.

## Evaluation of efficacy of taliglucerase alfa respective to historical data

A summary of efficacy data from the literature involving a selection of 14 publications obtained with Ceredase  and  Cerezyme  and  the  therapeutic  goals  to  be  achieved  with  ERT  was  analysed  as established by a group of experts in treating GD on the basis of their experience, specifically focusing on  articles  for  which  parameters  were  as  close  as  possible  to  the  clinical  study  population  and endpoints included in the pivotal study PB-06-001 with taliglucerase alfa, as  both it and Cerezyme have  comparable  mechanism  of  action.  Both,  the  Range  of  Means  (the  minimum  and  maximum summary mean values) and the total range (the minimum and maximum individual-patient values) were  extracted  from  the  14  papers  selected.  The  spleen  volumes  at  baseline  in  study  PB-06-001 ranged between 8 to 54 MN. In the reviewed papers presented in the historical analysis, nearly all patients had enlarged spleens over 5 MN with a baseline Range of Means between 10 MN and 28.5 MN. The  Total  Range  for  baseline  values  in  the  historical  review  was  3.5-62  MN  indicating  patient heterogeneity within studies. Thus, the populations in Study PB-06-001 and the historical review have comparable  baseline  values.  In  all  published  studies  for  alglucerase  and  imiglucerase,  reduction  in mean spleen volume was observed. The Range of Means of percentage change from baseline deduced from the historical data after approximately 1 year of ERT with alglucerase and imiglucerase is -17.4% to - 38%. The results obtained after 9 months treatment with taliglucerase alfa therefore correspond with the mean and ranges estimated from the literature for 12 months therapy. This also accounts for liver response.

Furthermore,  all  studies  with  ERT  have  demonstrated  improvement  in  haemoglobin  levels  in  both, anaemic  and  non-anaemic  patients,  with  a  range  of  means  of  10  to  24%  increase  in  haemoglobin levels  after  up  to  12  months  of  therapy.  Expressed  as  percent  change  from  baseline,  14.6%  and 22.2%,  haemoglobin  increase  was  observed  after  9  months  of  treatment  with  30  and  60  U/kg  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

taliglucerase alfa, respectively, and within the range of that reported in literature. With respect to the effect on platelets, the comparison of the results of the 9 months study PB-06-001 with the historical review results suggests a comparable effect with taliglucerase alfa.

The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  historical  data  presented  had  several  limitations  related  to,  amongst others, the differences in standards of care over time and the large variation in baseline characteristics and efficacy results, complicating a comparison of the benefit-risk of taliglucerase alfa to standard ERT. Further responder analyses were therefore requested, as discussed in section 2.5.3.

## Evaluation of efficacy of taliglucerase alfa respective to therapeutic goals

The therapeutic goals were defined by a group of Gaucher disease experts for ERT of a duration of at least 12 months and are not dose specific, thus included patients treated with a variety of doses and dosing schedules. The objectives of the analyses linked to therapeutic goals provided in the historical analysis were to assess the success of treatment with taliglucerase alfa in meeting these therapeutic goals for GD based on efficacy outcomes obtained after 12 months of treatment with taliglucerase alfa in the extension study PB-06-003. There were 65.4% (60 U/kg, 78.6%; 30 U/kg, 50.0%) taliglucerase alfa  treated  patients  who  achieved  the  therapeutic  goal  spleen  volume ≤ 8  MN  at  month  12.  There were 69.2% (60 U/kg, 92.9%; 30 U/kg, 41.7%) of taliglucerase alfa treated patients who achieved the therapeutic goal ≥ 30% reduction in spleen volume from baseline. With regards to the liver volume, there were 92.3% (60 U/kg, 92.9%; 30 U/kg, 91.7%) taliglucerase alfa treated patients who achieved the therapeutic goal liver volume ≤ 1.5 MN at month 12. There were 19.2% (60 U/kg, 21.4%; 30 U/kg, 16.7%) of taliglucerase alfa treated patients who achieved the therapeutic goal ≥ 20% reduction in liver volume from baseline. There were 92.3% (60 U/kg, 85.7%; 30 U/kg, 100.0%) taliglucerase alfa treated patients who achieved the therapeutic goal haemoglobin count ≥ 12 g/dl for male subjects ≥ 12 years old and ≥ 11  g/dl  for  others  at  month 12. The therapeutic goal for thrombocytopenia was defined to achieve a sufficient increase in platelets to prevent spontaneous bleeding; for splenectomised patients: to achieve normalisation of platelet counts; and for patients with an intact spleen: to achieve an increase of at least 1.5 fold in the first year of treatment. At month 12, here were 42.3% (60 U/kg, 64.3%; 30 U/kg, 16.7%) taliglucerase alfa treated patients who achieved the therapeutic goal for platelet counts ( ≥ 50% increase from the baseline value from study PB-06-001) at month 12 from baseline.

Responder analysis for both spleen volume and platelet count may support a clinical relevant efficacy of  the  highest  dose,  but  the  CHMP  believes  that  analyses  are  considered  exploratory  only.  Further responder analysis was therefore requested, as discussed in section 2.5.3.

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

The clinical programme with taliglucerase alfa included treatment of patients naïve to ERT for 9 months duration in the pivotal trial PB-06-001 and long term follow up in the PB-06-003. In addition, PB-06002 has analysed the effect of switch from Cerezyme for duration of 9 months followed by long term follow up with patients eligible for PB-06-003.

## Study PB-06-002

Study PB-06-002 was a Phase 3, multicentre, open-label, switchover study aiming to assess the safety and efficacy of switching treatment from Cerezyme to taliglucerase alfa in 30 patients with GD who have been receiving Cerezyme for at least 2 years at a stable maintenance regimen (dose unchanged) for at least the last 6 months. Stability of patients' GD disease was ensured. Haemoglobin and platelet count were measured every 2 weeks for a total of 6 measurements. Patients with stable disease were then  switched  from  imiglucerase  to  taliglucerase  alfa,  performed  every  2  weeks  for  a  total  of  20 infusions at a rate of approximately 1.3 ml/min. The starting dose of taliglucerase alfa was equivalent to  each  patient's  imiglucerase  dose  in  the  past  6  months  or  to  the  dose  prior  to  the  shortage  of imiglucerase. The total duration of treatment is 9 months. The dosage was increased to 60 U/kg if the patient  experienced  GD  deterioration.  The  control  for  this  study  was  the  patient's  historical  clinical status while on Cerezyme therapy. The main efficacy criterion was the maintenance of patient's clinical

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

status over the treatment period after switching from Cerezyme. The efficacy was determined by the evaluation of the clinical deterioration of platelet counts, haemoglobin, spleen volume, liver volume. Other  endpoints  for  efficacy  included  biomarkers  chitotriosidase  and  PARC/CCL18.  At  the  time  of database  freeze  in  2010,  40  patients  were  screened,  28  were  eligible  for  enrolment,  25  patients received  taliglucerase  alfa,  and  one  patient  voluntarily  withdrew  from  the  study  before  treatment. Sixteen (16) patients completed the study. Fifteen patients were included in the efficacy analysis. At the database freeze, the mean dose of taliglucerase alfa was 28.1 U/kg. An efficacy endpoint of this study was the enlargement of the liver or spleen from Baseline to Month 9 or sustained reductions in haemoglobin or platelet counts. The mean spleen volume decreased by 5.1%. One patient showed a greater  than  20%  increase  in  spleen  volume  from  baseline  at  9  months  without  clinically  relevant deterioration  in  other  efficacy  endpoints.  The  mean  liver  volume  decreased  by  a  mean  reduction  of 1.4% and when compared to normal liver volume, it remained the same between Baseline and Month 9. Haemoglobin was normally measured at 9 visits. Haemoglobin at Baseline, Month 3, Month 6 and Month 9 are summarised in the table below. Haemoglobin appears to remain stable after switching from Cerezyme to taliglucerase alfa.

Platelet count was measured at the local laboratory for the various visits. Platelet counts at Baseline, Month 3, Month 6 and Month 9 are summarised in the table below. Platelet count appears to remain stable after switching to taliglucerase alfa from Cerezyme .

The biomarkers chitotriosidase and CCL18 were measured every three months during the study. Four patients  showed  greater  than  50%  decreases  in  chitotriosidase  level  at  the  end  of  9  months  of treatment with taliglucerase  alfa.  The  mean  chitotriosidase  level  data  support  the  stability  of  GD  in these patients after switching from Cerezyme to taliglucerase alfa. A &gt;10% mean decrease in mean chitotriosidase level from Baseline was observed at Months 3, 6 and 9 and a 10% mean decrease in mean CCL18 level from Baseline was observed at Month 9.

## Study PB-06-003

The  study  PB-06-003  was  a  multicentre  extension  trial  amended  to  extend  the  assessment  of  the safety and efficacy of taliglucerase alfa in patients with GD completing 9 months treatment in protocols PB-06-001  or  PB-06-002.  The  duration  of  the  treatment  was  of  64  -  128  weeks.  Patients  who completed protocol PB-06-001 and PB-06-002 received taliglucerase alfa as per the dosing schedule in the  respective  study.  The  efficacy  parameters  remained  the  same  as  those  defined  in  PB-06-001 and/or PB-06-002.  Safety monitoring including analysis of adverse events, clinical laboratory evaluation, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests, anti-human taliglucerase alfa  antibodies  and  hypersensitivity  reactions.  At  the  time  of  safety  database  lock  in  June  2010,  31 patients from 12 study sites (26 patients from study PB-06-001 and 5 patients from study PB-06-002) were  enrolled  treated  in  this  extension  study.  Spleen  volume  was  measured  at  Day  1,  which corresponds  to  the  final  visit  (Month  9)  of  the  predecessor  trial,  and  at  Month  3  of  treatment,

representing a total of 12 months of blinded treatment with taliglucerase alfa for patients derived from PB-06-001.  In  PB-06-003  study,  12  patients  treated  with  30  U/kg  taliglucerase  alfa  had  a  28.9% reduction  in  spleen  volume  and  14  patients  treated  with  60  U/kg  had  a  43.5%  reduction  after  12 months  of  treatment.  The  difference  between  the  two  doses  in  the  effect  on  spleen  volume  was statistically  significant.  Liver  volume  was  measured  at  Day  1,  which  corresponds  to  the  final  visit (Month 9) of the preceding trial, and at Month 3 of treatment, representing a total of 12 months of treatment with taliglucerase alfa for patients derived from study PB-06-001. In PB-06-003 study, 12 patients treated with 30 U/kg taliglucerase alfa had a 15.9% reduction in liver volume and 14 patients treated with 60 U/kg had a 13.2% reduction. There was no difference between the two doses in the effect on liver volume. Haemoglobin was measured every three months in this study. In study PB-06003,  12  patients  treated  with  30  units/kg  taliglucerase  alfa  had  a  1.7  g/dl  increase  in  haemoglobin level and 14 patients treated with 60 units/kg had a 2.2 g/dl increase. The effect at Month 3 appears also to be sustained at Month 6. Platelet counts are measured every three months. In the patients who continued treatment in PB-06-003, 12 patients treated with 30 U/kg taliglucerase alfa had a 15,425.0 per mm 3  increase in platelets and 14 patients treated with 60 U/kg had a 53,814.3 per mm 3 increase. Thus,  the  60  U/kg  dose  of  taliglucerase  alfa  improved  platelet  counts  to  a  statistically  significantly greater effect than the 30 U/kg dose after 12 months of treatment. The effect at Month 3 appears also to be sustained at Month 6. The QCSI was used to measure bone marrow fat fraction content as an exploratory  endpoint,  as  in  Study  PB-06-001.  The  optional  lumbar  spine  QCSI  assessment  was performed at Months 3 and 15 of PB-06- 003 corresponding to 12 and 24 months of total treatment. Overall, an increase in fat-fraction ≥ 0.02 from baseline was observed in all 8 patients but one within 9 months  of  taliglucerase  treatment.  An  improvement  in  \"bone  at  risk\"  was  seen  in  the  trial  patient population;  after  9  and  12  months  of  treatment,  75%  (6/8)  of  the  patients  showed  a  fat  fraction &gt;0.23.  Taliglucerase  alfa  60  U/kg  treated  patients  showed  greater  fat  fraction  increases  than  the taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg treated patients.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The evaluation of the clinical efficacy of taliglucerase alfa included the conduct of the single pivotal trial PB-06-001, which was a dose controlled study. Study PB-06-002 was a switchover trial for patients previously  on  imiglucerase,  and  has  used  historical  control  data.  The  extension  study  PB-06-003 included patients from both trials. With respect to the dose selection in the pivotal trial, justifications were provided for not selecting a placebo controlled pivotal study design but choosing instead a single pivotal study with a dose control design instead of an active comparator. , The current approach to define  the  dose  for  the  pivotal  trial  with  taliglucerase  alfa  was  based  on  the  extrapolation  from  the extensive experience with imiglucerase ERT over the years, where 60 U/kg is widely accepted as the high dose to be effective and 30 U/kg is a distinctly lower dose. Additionally, after more than 10 years of experience with imiglucerase, the most effective dosing regimen of ERT was still a subject of debate between the Gaucher's experts and, no consensus on treatment optimal doses and their effectiveness was reached, except that 60 U/kg is considered a high but efficacious dose. Thus, the CHMP considered that for medical reasons and in the interest of the patients, the strategy to compare clinically relevant different  doses  of  taliglucerase  alfa  -  30  and  60  U/kg  -  could  be  considered  adequate.  The  dose selection was based on experience with Cerezyme and on the currently available national guidelines for the management of GD. Clinical experts in the GD field were consulted and agreed that further clarity of the optimal treatment dose would be most useful in clinical practice.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

In the pivotal study PB-06- 001, with respect to the primary endpoint, the mean changes from baseline in  spleen volume were significantly decreased in both dose groups at both 6 and 9 months and the predefined primary endpoint was met at both time points. Changes were greater in the 60U/Kg dose comparatively,  however,  the  difference  between  doses  was  not  significantly  different  at  both  time points (p=0.060). The results appeared to be statistically robust, being consistent with both the ITT and PP analyses populations.

For the secondary endpoints, haemoglobin and liver volume showed significant changes in both dose groups at both 6 and 9 months however, the difference between doses was not significantly different at  both  time  points.  In  contrast  to  the  other  secondary  endpoints  there  was  a  significant  difference between the changes from baseline between both dose groups at 9 months in favour of the higher dose with respect to the platelet count. Although platelet counts were increased with the lower dose the results were not statistically significant. Results of the post-hoc analysis suggested that changes were maximal in the subgroup of patients who had anaemia and hepatomegaly in both dose groups. Effects on plasma chitotriosidase values also showed a consistent decline in both dose groups which was  more  pronounced  in  the  higher  dose  group.  All  patients  achieved  a  10%  reduction  in  spleen volume at the end of the study.

With  respect  to  the  bone  changes  there  seemed  to  be  a  notable  difference  in  the  mean  Z  scores between the two dose groups at baseline, with patients in the 60U/Kg dose group having much lower Z scores. It is not entirely clear why the lower dose group has shown increased changes compared to the 60U/Kg dose from baseline, unlike the secondary endpoints with anaemic and hepatomegaly patients showing the largest improvements from baseline. Nevertheless, after treatment fore nine months the mean  Z  score  for  the  higher  dose  group  appears  to  show  marginal  changes  from  baseline  which nevertheless brings it within the normal range. Although absolute numbers are small, an increase in fat-fraction ≥ 0.03 from baseline was observed in all but 1 patient using the QCSI technique within 9 months. However, at baseline, only 2/8 of the patients had a fat fraction &gt; 0.23 which increased to 6/8 after 9 months. Nevertheless, this proportion did not seem to have increased after 12 months. Thus, only 4 patients reached the threshold of &gt;0.23, below which they would be considered to be as 'bone at  risk'  group.  As  with  other  clinical  endpoints,  taliglucerase  alfa  60  U/kg  treated  patients  showed greater fat-fraction increases than the taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg treated patients.

The results of the switchover trial PB-06-002 appeared to be consistent with those from the pivotal study. Overall, patients who were stable on their imiglucerase dose showed no signs of deterioration with respect to spleen and liver volumes, haemoglobin and platelet counts, after switching to the same dose of taliglucerase at the end of nine months. As far as the duration of efficacy is concerned, the results from the extension study demonstrate that effect duration with respect to all efficacy endpoints is maintained at month 3 of the extension study. However, similar to the trend seen with the pivotal study, there was a significant difference between the high and low doses with respect to the spleen volume at 12 months from baseline. This appeared to be due to the fact that values for spleen volumes at 9 and 12 months were approximately similar for the lower dose, whereas the higher dose showed a further reduction in the spleen volume at 12 months. There is therefore, some evidence of efficacy by the separation of doses in case of the absence of a placebo comparator with the implication that the higher dose would have been superior to placebo. No difference between doses was observed for the changes in liver volume where both doses showed further decreases.  Haemoglobin values also showed a sustained rise both at month 3 and month 6 of the extension study. As observed in the pivotal study, the 60 U/kg dose of taliglucerase alfa improved platelet counts to a statistically significantly greater effect than the 30 U/kg dose after 12 months of treatment. However, firm conclusions on long term

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

efficacy cannot be drawn at this point in time. In this respect, the study did not show clear separation of doses with respect to all endpoints.

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Clinical data from the pivotal trial PB-06-001 show the efficacy of the highest dose of taliglucerase alfa (60 U/kg) in treatment-naïve adult patients with non-neuronopatic GD based on spleen volume and platelet count for the population included in the study. taliglucerase alfa is indicated in the treatment of Gaucher disease type 1 only.

The  CHMP  did  not  consider  a  specific  measure  necessary  to  address  issues  related  to  efficacy,  but clinical efficacy data will be collected from the registry that is included as an additional pharmacovigilance activity in the RMP and discussed in section 2.6.2.

## 2.6. Clinical safety

The  overall  safety  data  for  taliglucerase  alfa  is  based  on  a  completed  Phase  1  study  in  6  healthy subjects (P-01-2005), a completed pivotal Phase 3 study in 32 patients (safety population) naïve to enzyme replacement therapy (PB-06-001) and two ongoing studies: a study in patients switched from imiglucerase to taliglucerase alfa (PB-06-002) and an extension study (PB-06-003) enrolling patients who completed PB-06-001 and PB-06-002. In addition, an Expanded Access Programme (EAP) in the United States and Israel (study PB-06-004) and named-patient basis compassionate use programmes in  several  countries,  e.g.  UK,  France,  Germany,  the  Netherlands,  Switzerland,  Australia,  Israel  and Brazil,  were  ongoing  at  the  time  of  MAA  submission.  It  is  of  note  that  these  programmes  were triggered  by  the  shortage  of  Cerezyme,  which  occurred  in  2009.  A  formal  safety  review  of  data generated  during  clinical  trials  was  conducted  with  a  cut-off  date  of  June  30,  2010  for  all  studies except PB-06-002, which has an August 15, 2010 cut-off date. The data include 89 subjects (6 healthy volunteers and 83 Gaucher patients under clinical trials). Although details of patients in compassionate programs are not available, the treating physicians are requested to report serious adverse events. None  were  reported  to  the  date  of  the  safety  summary  report.  The  overall  safety  population  is summarised in the table below.

## Patient exposure

Thirty-three patients were randomised to 30 U/kg (16 patients) or 60 U/kg (17 patients) in the pivotal study, PB-06-001. One patient withdrew from the study before being treated. Thirty two (32) patients (30 U/kg, 16; 60 U/kg: 16) were administered study medication at least once during the study. One patient received only one single partial dose [4.5 ml (60 U/kg dose group)] and withdrew due to a hypersensitivity reaction. A second patient developed hypersensitivity and withdrew at Week 22. One patient  became  pregnant  and  withdrew  at  Week  18.  Thus,  29  patients  completed  the  9  months  of treatment. In the switch-over study, PB-06-002, 25 patients have received treatment as of August 15,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

2010. Sixteen patients have completed the study to date. No patients were withdrawn prematurely. As of June 30, 2010, 31 patients were enrolled in the extension study (PB-06-003) (from study PB-06001,  26  patients;  from  Study  PB-06-002,  5  patients),  9  of  whom  (from  study  PB-06-001)  have completed total treatment duration of 24 months. Patients enrolled in PB-06-004 were treated with the same taliglucerase alfa dose as the imiglucerase dose received before reduction or discontinuation due to imiglucerase shortage. The overall summary of the patient exposure data as submitted initially is presented in the table below.

Considering the information on patient exposure, the Committee expressed their concerns about the low  number  of  patients  exposed  to  taliglucerase  alfa  and  the  lack  of  sufficient  long-term  data.  The CHMP concluded that the profile emerging form the overall safety database is not different from that based on the initially submitted information and corresponds with the safety profile known from other ERTs  in  Gaucher  disease.  Given  the  relative  small  population  studied  to  date  and  the  life-long treatment, the CHMP agreed to a commitment to continue following the patients for safety purposes. Accordingly, the major objection was considered resolved with a pharmacovigilance activity included in the Risk Management Plan for Elelyso.

## Adverse events

In the pivotal study PB-06-001, 23 out 32 patients who received taliglucerase alfa also experienced 137 AEs (30 U/kg, 65; 60 U/kg, 72) as summarised in the table below. Eight of these patients (30 U/kg, 3; 60 U/kg, 5) experienced 28 events (30 U/kg, 12; 60 U/kg, 16) which were considered by the investigator as treatment-related. All AEs were mild or moderate in intensity and the majority of the events resolved without sequelae by the end of the infusion. Four patients experienced 6 AEs that were ongoing until the end of study that did not impact their continuing study drug treatment. These events were  definitely  not  treatment  related  and  include  hypertension,  arthralgia,  swelling,  varicose  veins, hyperuricemia  and  hypertriglyceridemia.  No  deaths  or  SAEs  occurred  during  the  study.  The  safety profile was comparable between the two dose groups. The most commonly experienced AE for both dose groups was headache, pharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection; all AEs resolved without sequelae by the end of the study.

AE:adverse event; N: number of patients

*A severe adverse event was marked as serious at the time of data cut-off for this analysis, but has since been corrected.

It is of note, the AEs do not appear to be more likely in patients switching from imiglucerase (PB-06002  and  PB-06-004)  than  occurred  in  patients  who  were  naïve  to  ERT.  The  analysis  of  the  overall population up to 33 months does not reveal unexpected safety findings.

Overall Analysis of Adverse Events: Overall, 83 taliglucerase alfa treated patients experienced 526 AEs. Among those AEs, 134 events were considered by the investigator at least possibly treatment related. Almost all AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. An overview of the experienced events is given in the table below.

All  events: The  most  common  treatment-emergent  AEs  (occurring  in  more  than  5%  patients) independently  of  their  relation  to  treatment,  for  all  studies  combined    include  headache  (20.5%), arthralgia  (16.9%),  fatigue  (12.0%),  nasopharyngitis  (12.0%),  back  pain  (9.6%),  upper  respiratory infection  (9.6%),  influenza  (8.4%),  infusion  related  reaction  (7.2%),  nausea  (7.2%),  pharyngitis (7.2%),  pharyngolaryngeal  pain  (7.2%),  cough  (6.0%),  erythema  (6.0%),  pain  (6.0%),  pruritus (6.0%), pyrexia (6.0%), urinary tract infection (6.0%).

Related events: Common treatment-related AEs included infusion related reaction (6.0%), headache (6.0%),  hypersensitivity  (4.8%),  fatigue  (4.8%),  pruritus  (4.8%),  and  erythema  (3.6%)  were  the most frequent events associated with taliglucerase alfa infusions.

During the evaluation of the adverse event's profile of Elelyso, the Committee expressed their concern regarding  the  assignment  of  the  causality  of  AEs.  In  response  to  this  concern,  verification  and  a plausible explanation for the assignment of the relationship to the study drug was provided and the CHMP  considered  the  response  satisfactory.  Furthermore,  the  lack  of  safety  data  during  the stabilisation period in study PB-006-002 was also explained. The main reason for this was the very low number of patients treated during stabilisation period. The remaining patients were off treatment with imiglucerase.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

Four serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in the clinical trials, but none was considered by the investigator as treatment related (please refer to the table below). No deaths were reported during the studies.

Immunological  events: No  infusion  related  reactions  were  observed  in  study  P-01-2005  in  healthy volunteers. The most frequent events were headache, infusion related reaction, nausea, hypersensitivity, and flushing. The most frequently reported events assessed by the investigator as at least possibly related to the study drug were headache, infusion related reaction and hypersensitivity. The  majority  of  the  events  were  mild  in  severity  and  none  were  severe.  Two  patients  experienced hypersensitivity reactions. Thirty-eight patients reported 111 AEs during or after 98 infusions; most of the AEs were considered by the investigator at least possibly related to taliglucerase alfa. The most common  AEs  reported  as  related  to  the  infusions  were  headache,  asthenia  or  fatigue,  dizziness, infusion related reaction, and pruritus.

Anti-human taliglucerase alfa antibodies : No anti-human taliglucerase alfa antibodies were detected in the 6 healthy volunteers in study P-01-2005. When evaluating data from the Gaucher disease patients, the bio-analytical plans for analysis of antibody response to taliglucerase alfa treatment in each study indicate  that  the  analysis  and  reporting  of  the  results  is  based  on  completed  patients  (completed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dosing per protocol or prematurely withdrawn). Therefore, antibody analysis has not been performed for patients who are still being treated in a study and will be done at study completion. In PB-06-001, 32 patients were tested for immunogenicity to taliglucerase alfa  and one patient in each dose group (taliglucerase  alfa  30  U/kg,  10-001;  taliglucerase  alfa  60  U/kg,  12-024)  demonstrated  positive  IgG antibody titers to human taliglucerase alfa. Neutralising antibody test results were negative for both patients. One patient experienced five AEs at various visits (vomiting, flushing, influenza, lymphadenopathy, and hypertension) during the study but did not develop a hypersensitivity reaction during the study. The patient completed the study and had a positive IgG antibody response at the end of  study.  This  patient  was  further  enrolled  to  the  extension  study  PB-06-003  and  developed  a  fixed drug  eruption  starting  after  62  weeks.  Fixed  drug  eruptions  are  delayed  hypersensitivity  reactions mediated  by  T  cells  and  there  may  not  be  an  association  with  antibody  development.  A  different patient  did  not  develop  a  hypersensitivity  reaction  but  experienced  two  AEs  at  two  different  visits (glucosuria and influenza) during the study. The patient completed the study and had a positive IgG antibody response at the end of study. This patient was also enrolled to the extension study PB-06-003 and is tolerating the infusions well.

During  the evaluation procedure  the Committee  raised  questions  on  the  general safety  and immunological events, especially those occurring in study PB-06-001. Data on patients treated with dose 60 IU/kg were also to be submitted separately from the remaining patient group and a discussion on  the  possible  differences  between  taliglucerase  alfa  and  other  treatments  was  to  be  provided. Following  the  receipt  of  the  responses  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  frequency  of  antibody development  is  not  different  from  that  mentioned  for  imiglucerase.  The  antibody  formation  for velaglucerase  appears  to  be  somewhat  lower,  however  due  to  different  analyzing  methods  this information  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  For  taliglucerase  alfa,  the  presence  of  a  positive antibody  status  appeared  to  have  no  effect  on  efficacy  or  safety  outcomes.  Results  published  for velaglucerase  and  imiglucerase  lead  to  the  same  conclusion.  The  clinical  relevance  of  the  antibody formation will receive special attention in the long term follow-up and this was included in the RMP. Furthermore, the role of different plant glycan structures was discussed. There is currently a lack of strong evidence to suggest the association between plant glycan structures and immunogenicity and the potential immunogenicity of plant glycans has yet to be conclusively established. The established immunogenicity  testing  programme  will  continue  along  with  the  evaluation  of  the  anti-taliglucerase antibodies generated in patients to determine specificity for the plant-derived glycans on taliglucerase alfa.  In  the  post-marketing  setting,  the  routine  pharmacovigilance  and  risk  minimisation  activities (including Targeted Medical Event review, Periodic Safety Update Reports and suitable labelling) will be adequate  to  monitor  and  ensure  patient  safety  concerning  adverse  effects  related  to  unusual immunogenicity. The proposed measures to address the above concerns are reasonable and agreed by the CHMP.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Drug interactions are not expected with taliglucerase alfa due to the nature of the substance and were not assessed. This information is adequately reflected in Section 4.5 of taliglucerase alfa SmPC (Latest version of the Product Information as submitted by the applicant but not adopted by the CHMP).

## Laboratory findings

Laboratory haematology and biochemistry: The majority of the laboratory haematology and biochemistry parameters remained at normal levels from screening or improved to normal levels by the end of study. One taliglucerase 60 units/kg treated patient had elevated ALT, which was 3 times above the higher limit of normal (40 IU/L), however this patient returned to 52 IU/L at Visit 20. No

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

significant decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate was seen at the end of study (taliglucerase 30 units/kg, 11.9 mm/hr; taliglucerase  60 units/kg, 15.3 mm/hr).

Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Echocardiography: ECG results for the safety population were measured at baseline, visits 7, 14 and 20. There were no clinically significant changes from baseline observed at these  visits.  Nine  patients  had  abnormal  echocardiography  results  at  the  screening  visit.  Six  were evaluated as normal by the end of the study and 3 patients remained abnormal at the end of study.

Pulmonary Function Test : There were no apparent mean value changes from screening to the end of study in all PFT parameters tested.

Bone Disease: No  patients  experienced bone pain or fractures during the study. Evaluation of DEXA showed stable to slightly improved bone density and QCSI showed improvement in bone marrow fat fraction.

Vital  Signs: Vital  sign  parameters  were  monitored  at  each  infusion  visit  for  210  minutes,  every  15 minutes  during  the  infusion  up  to  the  first  2  hr  time  period,  with  continued  monitoring  for  three additional  30  minute  periods.  No  adverse  events  were  reported  associated  with  patients'  vital  sign measurements. Changes in vital signs during taliglucerase were not analyzed, but no adverse events were reported for significant changes not related to hypersensitivity reactions.

Patients  switched  from  imiglucerase: The  majority  of  the  laboratory  haematology  and  biochemistry parameters remained at normal levels from screening through the end of study. 7 patients reported normal liver function at baseline and liver function tests above normal (2 with ALT, 1 with AST, 4 with bilirubin levels) during treatment. Two patients in the pivotal study reported liver function values more that 3 times ULN. The Committee has therefore requested that a thorough discussion of these events is  provided.    In  response,  a  plausible  explanation  for  the  increase  in  hepatic  enzymes  in  the  small number of patients was given, however, there does not seem to be a discernible cause in others. While it is accepted that minor elevations can occur in some GD patients without concomitant morbidity, it would  be  prudent  to  keep  hepatic  enzymes  under  review  initially  until  more  data  is  available. Therefore,  monitoring  of  liver  enzymes  is  included  in  the  RMP  and  elevated  liver  enzymes  will  be evaluated as a specific safety concern.

## Safety in special populations

Because of the small number of patients in each population group, the subgroup analyses were not performed.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Overall, two patients (taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg and 60 U/kg) discontinued from study PB-06-001 due to  a  hypersensitivity  reaction.  In  the  same  study  PB-06-001,  one  patient  was  discontinued  due  to pregnancy. The CHMP  requested further details with respect to the withdrawals and study discontinuation and based on the response provided, this issue does not raise any significant concerns.

## Post marketing experience

There is no post marketing experience with taliglucerase alfa since at the time of the evaluation this product has not been marketed in the EU.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

In  the  pivotal  study  PB-06-001,  the  absence  of  a  comparator  arm  makes  the  comprehensive assessment of the safety profile of taliglucerase somewhat complicated. Nevertheless, there does not seem to be a clear cut dose relationship with the adverse events, except for few events, which include headache. In this respect it is notable that for infusion reactions the occurrence of headache in the same patient has had a differing causality assigned. The incidence of antibodies presence appears to be  remarkably  low  in  comparison  with  other  enzyme  replacement  therapies  since  only  two  patients were  found  to  be  IgG  positive  with  no  neutralising  activity.  Although  two  cases  of  hypersensitivity occurred, one was in a patient who had a pre-dose IgE antibody and also later reacted to imiglucerase. While both patients who suffered hypersensitivity episodes were withdrawn from the study, no patients were withdrawn due to any other adverse events.  The CHMP considered it reassuring that there were no SAEs or deaths in the pivotal study.  Overall, there do not seem to be unexpected findings from the data submitted.

In the switchover study the number of infusion reactions considered related to treatment appeared to be increased in the group of patients who had transitioned from imiglucerase treatment. Nevertheless, the  Committee  noted  that  these  tended  to  be  mild.  Other  common  adverse  event  included nasopharyngitis.  Three  SAEs  were  reported;  neither  of  them  was  considered  related  to  the  study medication, and there were no deaths or premature withdrawals from the study. However, it was not entirely  clear  if  safety  data  was  collected  during  the  stabilisation  period  in  the  switch  study.  In response  to  the  Committee's  concern,  plausible  explanation  for  the  lack  of  safety  data  during  the stabilisation  period  in  study  PB-006-002  was  provided;  namely  that  there  were  very  few  patients treated during stabilisation and the remaining patients were off treatment with imiglucerase.

The incidence of patients who were positive for antibodies appears to be comparatively low since only one patient was positive for IgG but showed no neutralising activity. Overall, there were no unexpected findings from the study. It is notable that in the patients who were extended from study PB-06-002, there  were  no  further  adverse  events,  although  the  patient  numbers  are  small  and  preclude  firm conclusions. There were no clear-cut differences in the dose groups in patients whose treatment was extended from the pivotal trial. Although there was one SAE of immune thrombocytopenia, this was not  considered  related  to  study  medication.  As  with  other  studies  there  were  no  premature  study withdrawals.

For taliglucerase alfa, the presence of a positive antibody status appeared to have no effect on efficacy or  safety  outcomes.  The  clinical  relevance  of  the  antibody  formation  will  be  an  issue  of  special attention  in  the  long  term  follow-up  and  has  been  included  in  the  RMP.    The  information  currently available in the SmPC refers to the fact that the persistence of cross-reactivity cannot be excluded. Neither, however, can the cross-reactivity be demonstrated. The proposal to warn against a possible cross-reactivity is agreed to be the appropriate approach. Further routine pharmacovigilance and risk minimisation activities are also in place. Long term safety will be monitored through the maintenance of a registry, which is agreed by the CHMP as an additional pharmacovigilance activity in the RMP.

Indirect comparison using publicly available data for currently available ERT suggest that the frequency of antibody formation is comparable or somewhat higher with taliglucerase alfa. However, comparisons are hampered by different analysing methods between studies.

In  the  expanded  access  as  well  as  in  the  compassionate  use  programme,  there  have  been  no unexpected findings. No SAEs or deaths have been reported and there were no withdrawals due to adverse events.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  general,  laboratory  parameters  were  unremarkable;  the  majority  of  the  laboratory  haematology, biochemistry,  vital  signs  or  other  parameters  remained  at  normal  levels.    A  few  patients  showed increases in the ALT levels, though less than considered clinically significant. The patient numbers are small  and  there  appeared  to  be  a  dose  relationship.  In  this  respect  two  healthy  volunteers  showed slight  elevation  in  bilirubin  levels  during  the  study.  It  is  notable  that  no  patients  were  prematurely withdrawn due to these adverse events, other than the two who showed hypersensitivity.  In other patients treatment was continued despite hypersensitivity under cover of pre-medication.

Infusion  reactions  did  not  appear  to  raise  significant  issues  and  were  easily  managed  without treatment having to be discontinued in the majority of patients.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the SmPC (Latest version of the Product Information as submitted by the applicant but not adopted by the CHMP).

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

The overall safety results indicate that taliglucerase was generally well tolerated with minor side effects that were self-limited and resolved with no treatment. No serious adverse events were attributable to the product administered intravenously once every 2 weeks at doses up to 60 mg/kg. Although at the time  of  the  MAA  submission  the  safety  database  seem  somewhat  small  and  the  CHMP  raised  an objection in this regard, further submitted safety information in form of the interim follow up data from studies  PB-06-001  and  PB-06-002  suggest  that  the  emerging  safety  profile  for  taliglucerase  alfa corresponds  with  that  known  for  other  ERTs  in  the  treatment  of  Gaucher  disease.  Nevertheless, considering the limited size of the studied population to date and the proposed life-long treatment for taliglucerase  alfa,  the  CHMP  recommended  on  a  commitment  to  continue  the  follow  up  of  patients. Accordingly, the CHMP considers an appropriate measure to be put in place and obliged the applicant to  set  up  a  registry  to  obtain  information  regarding  long  term  efficacy  and  safety,  formation  of antibodies, their impact on efficacy and safety of taliglucerase treatment, cross-reactivity with other ERT's  and  the  dose  dependence  of  the  adverse  events  as  well  as  hepatic  enzymes.  The  follow-up should be at least five years. This is added as an additional pharmacovigilance activity in the RMP of Elelyso. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of the antibody formation will receive special attention in the long term follow-up and this was included in the RMP as a pharmacovigilance activity.

## Beneficial effects

Taliglucerase alfa is a recombinant version of an endogenous enzyme which is deficient in patients with Gaucher's  disease.  Accordingly,  the  mechanism  of  action  and  pharmacodynamic  effects  are  well known. There is abundant evidence on dosage used in clinical practice with comparable ERTs.

In the pivotal study the mean changes from baseline in spleen volume were statistically significantly decreased in both dose groups at both 6 and 9 months and the predefined primary endpoint was met. Overall, changes were greater in the 60 U/Kg dose than in the 30 U/kg group. The results appeared to be  robust  and  consistent  with  the  ITT  and  PP  analyses  populations.  For  the  secondary  endpoints, haemoglobin and liver volume showed significant changes in both dose groups at both 6 and 9 months, although  the  difference  between  doses  was  not  significantly  different.  In  contrast,  there  was  a significant  difference  between  the  changes  from  baseline  between  both  dose  groups  at  9  months  in favour of the higher dose with respect to the platelet count. Although platelet counts were increased with  the  lower  dose,  the  results  were  not  statistically  significant.  The  preliminary  results  from  the extension study provide assurance that after one year of treatment, there is limited evidence of dose separation.  The  switch  study  provided  supportive  evidence  that  there  is  no  significant  clinical deterioration in patients who were switched from imiglucerase. The findings for the biomarkers were consistent with the results for the primary and secondary points. Using historical data, the results for the  main  parameters  assessed  for  taliglucerase  alfa  in  study  PB-06-001  and  supplemented  by  the additional  3  months  data  from  study  PB-06-003  appear  to  be  within  the  ranges  established  in  the historical  data  reviewed.  This  would  suggest  approximately  comparable  efficacy  of  taliglucerase  alfa compared to alglucerase/imiglucerase.

Results of the studies were reviewed by a panel of Gaucher experts. It was estimated that 81% of patients with splenomegaly and 96% of patients with hepatomegaly achieved therapeutic goals after 12 months of treatment. Although patients included those with splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia, as per inclusion criteria, only 58% had hepatomegaly and 32% anaemia at baseline, with over 90% reaching  treatment  goals.  As  observed  in  the  clinical  studies,  the  60  U/Kg  dose  showed  a  greater effective  response  in  spleen  volume  and  platelet  count  than  that  observed  in  patients  treated  with taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The demonstration of efficacy of taliglucerase alfa relies on one single pivotal study including a limited number of 31 treatment-naïve patients. This pivotal study was performed without a comparator arm, but included a high and low dose control. This could potentially limit the evaluation of the magnitude of effect  in  the  light  of  currently  available  ERT.  A  comparison  of  the  dose  groups  was  not  planned. Nevertheless,  if  there  is  obvious  separation  between  the  doses,  this  would  indicate  that  the  higher dose is clinically superior to the lower dose, thus indirectly implying that it would have been superior to placebo. Indeed, the results of the requested reanalyses showed clear evidence of superiority of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

high dose over the low dose at 9 and 12 months for the outcome related to spleen volume. In addition, a better response was seen for the higher dose than the lower dose in terms of effect on platelets. Nevertheless,  the  lower  dose  allows  for  adjustments  to  be  made  on  an  individual  basis  based  on achievement and maintenance of therapeutic goals for patients with stable disease.

The use of historical  data  provides  some  supportive  evidence.  It  is  noted  that  the  period  when  the studies  were  conducted  may  be  different  with  implications  for  the  response  to  treatment  due  to  a difference  in  the  standard  of  care  as  well  differences  in  the  exclusion  and  inclusion  criteria. Nevertheless, further historical comparison with recent data on velaglucerase using similar responder rates provided satisfactory reassurance that the results with taliglucerase are comparable to those of velaglucerase, which in some part addresses the lack of active comparator.

The  limited  number  of  patients  with  type  3  Gaucher  disease  in  the  pivotal  and  switchover  studies resulted a recommendation for the use of taliglucerase in the treatment of type 1 of Gaucher disease only. The beneficial effects in patients with acute or chronic neuropathic disease are not known yet. Additional long-term follow up data will provide reassurance on the long-term efficacy in patients with stable disease.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

In the results of the pivotal study PB-006-01, there does not seem to be a clear dose relationship with the adverse events, except for few events which include headache. The incidence of antibodies appears to be around 50% and only 3 patients were found to have neutralising activity. Although two cases of hypersensitivity occurred, one was in a patient who had a pre-dose IgE antibody and also later reacted to  imiglucerase  as  well.  While  both  patients  who  suffered  hypersensitivity  episodes  were  withdrawn from the study, no patients were withdrawn due to any other adverse events.  It is reassuring to note that  there  were  no  SAEs  or  deaths  in  the  pivotal  study.    Overall,  there  did  not  appear  to  be  any unexpected findings from the data submitted.

In the switchover study the number of infusion reactions which were considered related to treatment appeared to be increased for patients who had transitioned from imiglucerase , however these tended to  be  mild.  Although  there  were  3  SAEs,  these  were  considered  unrelated  to  study  medication  and there were no deaths or premature withdrawals from the study. Overall, there were no unexpected findings from the study.

In  the  extension  study,  there  was  one  SAE  of  immune  thrombocytopenia,  this  was  not  considered related to study medication. Similarly, no unexpected findings were identified in the expanded access or the compassionate use program. No SAEs or deaths have been reported and as with other studies there were no withdrawals from the study due to adverse events.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The  lack  of  a  comparator  for  the  pivotal  study  limits  the  assessment  of  safety  which  is  further compounded by the small number of patients and the small size of the safety database, due to the rarity of the disease. The overall safety and immunogenicity data for studies PB-06-001 and PB-06-002 confirm that the safety profile of taliglucerase appears to be similar to that observed with other ERTs. It cannot be concluded if the low incidence of antibodies observed relates to the rather high assay cutoff  point.  Additionally,  the  immunogenicity  data  indicated  that  there  was  no  impact  on  efficacy  and safety.  Results  submitted  indicate  no  difference  in  immunology  compared  to  imiglucerase  and velaglucerase.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The overall safety data are reassuring and allow a positive benefit-risk outcome. The immunogenicity of taliglucerase alfa will be closely monitored via post-authorisation measure stated in the RMP.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Changes  in  the  spleen  and  liver  volume  as  well  as  haemoglobin  and  platelet  counts  including biomarkers  are  considered  to  be  relevant  and  sensitive  clinical  favourable  effects.  Hypersensitivity, infusion reactions and immunogenicity are important unfavourable effects which can impact negatively on efficacy and safety with implications for compliance both in the short term and long term.

## Benefit-risk balance

Clinically  relevant  changes  in  the  spleen  and  liver  volumes  as  well  as  haemoglobin,  platelets  and biomarkers were demonstrated which were statistically significant, sustained and consistent in all the studies. Changes appear to be comparable to historical data with velaglucerase.

Overall  safety  results  indicate  that  taliglucerase  was  generally  well  tolerated  with  minor  side  effects usually resolved without the need for a major treatment. The most commonly observed symptoms of infusion-related  reactions  were  headache,  pruritus,  and  hypersensitivity.  These  can  be  usually managed by slowing  the  infusion  rate  or  stopping  and  resuming  treatment  with  decreased  infusion rate. If a severe allergic reaction occurs, immediate discontinuation of the taliglucerase alfa infusion is recommended.

There  were  no  unexpected  effects  and  no  serious  adverse  events  were  attributable  to  the  product administered intravenously once every 2 weeks at doses up to 60 mg/kg. There were no deaths. The safety profile of taliglucerase alfa appears acceptable and overall comparable to that of standard ERT. The incidence of infusion related reactions appears somewhat lower. Accordingly, the benefits observed outweigh the risks involved with taliglucerase alfa and therefore, the benefit /risk balance is considered positive.

The  conclusion  on  the  positive  risk-benefit  balance  of  Elelyso  by  the  CHMP  is  subject  to  following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (Draft Summary of Product Characteristics, section  4.2  in  the  latest  version  of  the  Product  Information  as  submitted  by  the  applicant  but  not adopted by the CHMP).

## Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation

## Risk Management System and PSUR cycle

The  MAH  must  ensure  that  the  system  of  pharmacovigilance,  presented  in  Module  1.8.1  of  the marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.

The  MAH  shall  perform  the  pharmacovigilance  activities  detailed  in  the  Pharmacovigilance  Plan,  as agreed in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP.

As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted:

- When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities
- Within  60  days  of  an  important  (pharmacovigilance  or  risk  minimisation)  milestone being reached
- at the request of the EMA

The PSUR cycle for the product will follow the standard requirements until otherwise agreed by the CHMP.

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

Not applicable.

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States.

Not applicable.

However, the CHMP considered Elelyso to be similar to Vpriv for the same therapeutic indication and concluded that none of the derogations regarding orphan market exclusivity, as provided for by the Regulation  (EC)  No.  141/2000  apply  and  thus,  recommended  refusal  of  granting  the  marketing authorisation for Elelyso.

The grounds for refusal can be found here.

## Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

The lack of a comparator arm in the pivotal study was compensated by the use of a dose control. No formal  analysis  of  dose  separation  was  planned.  A  post  hoc  dose  separation  analysis  of  the  pivotal study  as  well  as  the  extension  study  showed  that  after  9  and  12  months  of  treatment  with taliglucerase  alfa,  a  60  U/kg  dose  resulted  in  a  statistically  better  response  than  30  U/kg  dose  for spleen volume and platelet count, but not however, for liver volume, haemoglobin, or chitotriosidase activity. Inconsistent results were obtained for the lowest dose of taliglucerase alfa 30 U/kg and the efficacy of this dose as starting dose was not acequated. Initiation of less effective treatment in this chronic progressive disease may have serious implications for the patient in the long-term. Therefore the 60 U/kg dose is the recommended starting dose and the 30 U/kg dose can only be considered for those patients who have achieved and maintained the therapeutic goals while treated with 60 U/kg. This is in line with the dose recommendations for velaglucerase. Infusion reactions did not appear to raise significant issues and were easily managed without treatment having to be discontinued in the majority  of  patients.  The  incidence  of  immunogenicity  appeared  to  be  remarkably  low.  The  safety profile of taliglucerase seems acceptable but evaluation of the safety population is limited by the low number of patients exposed to taliglucerase alfa and the lack of sufficient long-term data, which will be provided via fulfilment of the agreed pharmacovigilance activities.

## 4. Recommendations

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Elelyso is not similar to Zavesca within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200, but it is similar to Vpriv.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Derogations from market exclusivity

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that the following derogations from market exclusivity claimed by the applicant do not apply:

- for the derogation laid down in Article 8(3)(b) of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 that the marketing authorisation holder for Vpriv is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the medicinal product and
- for the derogation laid down in 8(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 that that the medicinal product, although similar to Vpriv, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000) for the same therapeutic indication.

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Eleyso

## - indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy for adults with a confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 Gaucher disease -

is  favourable.  However,  the  CHMP  considers  Elelyso  to  be  similar  to  Vpriv  for  the  same  therapeutic indication and considers that none of the derogations regarding orphan market exclusivity, as provided for  by  the  Regulation  (EC)  No.  141/2000,  apply.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  recommends  the  refusal  of granting the Marketing Authorisation for Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa).

The grounds for refusal can be found here.

Furthermore,  the  CHMP,  in  light  of  the  negative  recommendation,  was  of  the  opinion  that  it  is  not appropriate to conclude on the new active substance status at this time.
