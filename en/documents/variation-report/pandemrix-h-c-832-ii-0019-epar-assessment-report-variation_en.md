## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1. Introduction

Pandemrix was granted Marketing Authorisations in the EU in May 2008, with use being restricted to subjects aged 18-60 years in section 4.2 of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) due to lack of data  outside  of  this  age  range.  The  granting  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  was  based  on  a mock-up vaccine derived from A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) like strain (NIBRG-14).

Following  the  declaration  of  the  pandemic  by  the  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO),  the  MAH applied for a strain change to include the pandemic H1N1v strain.

The  currently  approved  vaccine  contains  split  influenza  virus  with  a  haemagglutinin  content equivalent to 3.75 micrograms derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain (X-179A). The virus is propagated in eggs and the approved vaccine is manufactured in Dresden. The  vaccine  also  contains  the  marketing  authorisation  holder's  (MAH)  proprietary  adjuvant  AS03, which is composed of squalene, DL-alpha-tocopherol and polysorbate 80. The MAH applied to update sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for Pandemrix H1N1 to reflect newly available results from a clinical study in adults 18-60 years of age (D-PAN-H1N1-007, called 'H1N1-007' in this report). In  submitting  the above  mentioned data from study H1N1-007 the MAH also fulfilled the Specific Obligation to provide an abridged report for: post dose 1 data from study H1N1-007 (adults 18-60 yrsimmunogenicity data+ solicited and unsolicited symptoms, SAEs). 1.2 Clinical aspects H1N1-007 This is an ongoing study in 130 Belgian adults aged 18-60 years who have been randomised (1:1) with stratification by age (18-40, 41 to 50 and 51 to 60 years; 2:1:1) to receive: · Group  A:  (N=64)  two  doses  21  days  apart  of  haemagglutinin  HA  (3.75  µg)  adjuvanted  with AS03= Pandemrix H1N1v as approved · Group B: (N=66) two doses 21 days apart of HA 15 µg (derived from the same H1N1v strain) without adjuvant. The MAH provided for this variation a synoptic report of preliminary post-dose 1 immunogenicity results  based  on  non-cleaned  data  from  the  total  enrolled  cohort.  Subsequent  analyses  will  be performed  after  data  will  become  available  for  Day  42,  Day  182  and  Day  364  as  part  of  specific obligations  (SO)  committed  by  the  MAH  in  the  Letter  of  Undertaking  for  the  pandemic  strain variation (PU-017). 1.2.1 Study design Medicinal product no longer authorised

## The primary objective of the study is:

To demonstrate that two doses of vaccine containing 3.75 µg HA derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like strain with ASO3 (Pandemrix (H1N1)) results in an HI immune response to vaccinehomologous virus that meets or exceeds the CHMP criteria applied to seasonal influenza vaccines. Secondary: objectives are:

- To assess whether vaccination with Pandemrix (H1N1) results in an HI immune response to the vaccine-homologous virus that meets or exceeds CHMP guidance targets for pandemic vaccine seroconversion rate (SCR), seroprotection rate (SPR), and geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) 21 days  after  the  first  and  the  second  dose  of  H1N1  vaccine  in  adults  18  to  60  years  of  age  and within each age stratum (18 to 40 years and 41 to 60 years and within the 41-50 and 51-60 years substrata).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To assess the immune response of the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like antigen containing 15 µg of HA in terms of vaccine-homologous virus HI response 21 days after each dose of H1N1 vaccine in adults 18 to 60 years of age and within each age stratum (18 to 40 years and 41-60 years and within the 41-50 and 51-60 years substrata).
- To describe (based on point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) immunogenicity to vaccine-homologous A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like antigen (both groups) in terms of HI at Day 0, 21, 42, 182 and 364 in adults 18-60 years of age and in each age stratum (18 to 40 years, 41-60 years and within the 41-50 and 51-60 years substrata)
- To  describe  (based  on  point  estimates  and  95%  CIs)  immunogenicity  to  A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like  antigen  (both  groups)  at  Day  0,  21,  42,  182  and  364  based  on  neutralizing antibodies in adults 18-60 years of age and in each of the age strata (18-40 years, 41-60 years and within the 41-50 and 51-60 years substrata).

· To describe the safety of the vaccine regimens in terms of solicited adverse events (AEs) 7 days post-vaccination, unsolicited AEs 21 days post-dose 1 and 63 days post-dose 2, AEs of specific interest  (AESIs)  for  the  entire  study  period,  and  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  for  the  entire study period in both treatment groups. The study is observer-blinded i.e. vaccine recipients and those responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint are unaware of which vaccine is being administered. Blood samples for evaluation of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody immune response are drawn prior to vaccination (\"day 0\") and at days 21, 42, 182 and 364 after the first vaccination. HI  antibody  titres  are  measured  based  on  the  method  described  by  the  World  Health  Organization Collaborating Centre for Influenza, Centres for Disease Control, Atlanta, USA (1991) and modified according to Stephenson et al. 2004 . All HI assays are performed in duplicate in the same run. Assay variability is controlled by the use of control  sera  included  in  each  run.  The  results  obtained  for  the  controls  have  to  meet  acceptance criteria. If the acceptance criteria are not fulfilled the assay run has to be repeated. Subjects with titres below  the  detection  limit  (1:10)  are  considered  seronegative.  A  titre ≥ 1:40  is  considered  as seroprotective. Descriptive analyses of the immune response in terms of HI antibodies are performed for each age group 18-40 years and 41-60 years as well as for the sub-strata of 41-50 years and 51-60 years. The Total Vaccinated Cohort includes all vaccinated subjects for whom safety data are available. For the total analysis of immunogenicity, this includes vaccinated subjects of the immunogenicity subset for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures are available. The  'according-to-protocol'  (ATP)  cohort  for  analysis  of  immunogenicity  includes  all  evaluable subjects  (i.e.,  those  meeting  all  eligibility  criteria,  complying  with  the  procedures  defined  in  the protocol, with no elimination criteria during the study) from the ATP cohort for safety for whom 2 doses are received and assay results are available for the blood sample taken 21 days after the second vaccine dose (i.e. at D42).

The  analysis  of  immunogenicity  presented  in  this  variation  procedure  was  performed  on  the  total enrolled cohort in order to provide preliminary post dose 1 results based on non-cleaned data.

## 1.2.2 Results

HI responses were better in the younger age cohort (18-40 years) compared to the older cohort (41-60 years) although the difference is apparent only in terms of the geometric mean titres (GMTs). There was also a suggestion from the overall data that this effect of age was more marked in the group that received unadjuvanted vaccine compared to the AS03-adjuvanted group.

The amplitude of the HI immune responses observed at Day 21 with ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine was at least as high as with the non-adjuvanted vaccine formulation containing the higher antigen dose. HI responses  were  numerically  better  in  the  AS03-adjuvanted  vaccine  group  in  the  older  age  cohort whereas there was not a difference in the younger subjects. For example, GMTs in the 18-40 years group were 561 in the AS03 group and 640 in the unadjuvanted group (and in each case much higher in  those  seropositive  at  baseline)  whereas  GMTs  in  those  aged  51-60  years  were  190.5  and  98  in respective groups, again with higher values in those already seropositive at baseline.

The supplementary tables below provide a further breakdown by age 18-40, 41-50 and 51-60 years including baseline serostatus. At D0, 37.7% of the 130 subjects were already seropositive (titre ≥ 1:10) for HI antibodies against A/California/7/2009(H1N1) even though  subjects were excluded from the study if they had clinically or  virologically  confirmed  influenza  within  6  months  of  D0.  The  seropositivity  rates  against A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) did not show a consistent trend to increase with age. Table 4: Seropositive rates against A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) per age strata at D0 In addition, before vaccination the overall seroprotection rates were up to 24% in the vaccine/age subgroups but there was no consistent trend to higher rates with increasing age.

At D21 the overall data showed that GMTs were higher in those who had been seropositive at baseline and supplementary tables showed that this observation applied in each of the age cohorts 18-40, 41-50 and 51-60 years. However, these differences in GMTs did not have any appreciable effect on the SPRs according to baseline status in any age group among subjects that received the adjuvanted vaccine.

The seroconversion rates (and the seroconversion factors (SCFs)) were slightly affected according to baseline status as would be expected. The overall rates are shown below. Table 6: Seroconversion rate (SCR) at PI (D21) (Total Enrolled cohort) In addition the data for the oldest cohort (aged 51-60 years) according to baseline status are shown below since this group had the lowest GMTs. These data demonstrate that the lower GMTs did not impact on satisfaction of CHMP criteria, which were exceeded in both vaccine groups regardless of baseline serostatus.

Table 10: SPRs (Total Enrolled cohort, aged 51-60 years)

Of  the  130  enrolled  subjects,  49.2%  reported  having  received  at  least  one  seasonal  influenza vaccination  in  the  previous  three  seasons.  Analysis  of  the  Day  21  HI  antibody  results  showed  no substantial impact of prior seasonal vaccination on the HI GMTs with baseline values between 8.0 and 11.5 and post-vaccination between 235.2 and 514.6. In addition, the SCRs, SCFs and SPRs did not seem to be affected within each vaccine group by previous seasonal vaccination and they all met the CHMP criteria regardless of vaccination history. This analysis was also shown in supplementary tables for  the  age  strata  and  the  same  conclusions  applied  to  HI  responses  according  to  pre-vaccination history.

More subjects reported solicited local symptoms with the ASO3 adjuvanted vaccine formulation. In particular,  pain  at  the  injection  site  (90.3%  adjuvanted  versus  37.1%  unadjuvanted)  was  the predominant solicited local symptom in each vaccine group but was much more common with AS03. Swelling and  redness were  only reported with the  adjuvanted  formulation  (6.5%  and  1.6% respectively). Most reports of pain were Grade 1 on a scale of 1-3. There was only one report of grade 3 pain (after ASO3 adjuvanted vaccine) and no grade 3 redness or swelling was reported. Most local symptoms lasted 1-3 days.

Fatigue and muscle aches were the predominant solicited general symptoms in each vaccine group, followed by headache and joint pain. Higher incidences were noted with ASO3 vaccine for muscle aches (33.9% versus 11.3%), headache (27.4%% versus 17.7%) and joint pain (11.3% versus 6.5%). Fever (any above 380C) was not reported in any subject in either vaccine group. Grade 3 solicited general  symptoms  were  infrequently  reported  (maximum  one  report  per  symptom  type)  in  both vaccine groups.

Table 17:  Global Summary of unsolicited signs and symptoms reported within the 21-day (Days 0-20) post-vaccination period (Total Enrolled cohort)

The incidence of unsolicited AEs after the first vaccine dose in the ASO3 adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine group  and  in  the  non-adjuvanted  vaccine  group  was  comparable  (35.9%  and  34.8%,  respectively). Overall, unsolicited AEs reported after the first vaccination up Day 21 showed no particular signal or clinical pattern in any vaccine group. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Upper respiratory tract infection, headache, rhinitis, oropharyngeal pain and diarrhoea were the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs in the ASO3 adjuvanted group and the non-adjuvanted group.

Two cases of lymphadenopathy were reported in the ASO3 adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine group versus zero in the non-adjuvanted study vaccine group.

The incidence of unsolicited AEs assessed as causally related to the vaccination by the investigator was relatively low and comparable in the two study groups (8%).

Table 19: Percentage of subjects with grade 3 unsolicited AEs classified by MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred Term, within the 21-day post-vaccination period at post Dose 1 in study H1N1-007 (Total Enrolled cohort)

Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) No  deaths  were  reported  up  to  Day  21.  One  SAE,  a  case  of  migraine  was  reported,  which  was considered  not  related  to  vaccination.  None  of  the  AEs  or  SAE  led  to  study  withdrawal  through Day 21. Concomitant medication The  incidence  of  any  concomitant  medication  received  after  the  first  dose  in  the  AS03  adjuvanted vaccine group was within the same range as the incidence in the non-adjuvanted higher antigen dose group (35.9% and 30.3% of subjects, respectively). The incidence of any antipyretic medication in the adjuvanted and the non-adjuvanted vaccine group was 28.1% and 21.2%. 'Prophylactic' antipyretic medication was received by four subjects (6.3%) in the ASO3 adjuvanted H1N1 group and one subject (1.5%) in the non-adjuvanted higher antigen dose group. It is not clear why this was taken before a first dose. As already reported there were no subjects with a fever of 38 0 C or above in this study. Since the majority did not take antipyretics before or after vaccination it seems unlikely that there would have been a substantial rate of fever even if no subject took an antipyretic.

## 1.3 Conclusion and benefit-risk assessment

The CHMP considered that the new data from study H1N1- 007 related to use of Pandemrix are in keeping with the results of study H1N1- 021 in which the vaccine used contained a slightly higher amount of  HA  and  was  included  as  preliminary  data  in  the  SPC  for  Pandemrix  at  the  time  of  the granting  of  the  pandemic  strain  variation  (PU-017).  Based  on  the  data  from  study  H1N1-007  the current SPC advice regarding the possibility of using a single dose in adults aged from 18-60 years is supported.  The  changes  to  the  SPC  to  remove  the  references  to  data  with  the  investigational formulation with a higher HA content from 4.2 and to replace the data in 5.1 from study H1N1-021 with those from H1N1-007 are supported.

In reaching this conclusion the CHMP took into account that the baseline serostatus of the subjects in study H1N1-007 was generally comparable with that observed in the subjects in study H1N1-021 (post day  21  results  assessed  within  the  pandemic  strain  variation  PU-017)  and  that,  although  there  was some difference in HI GMTs according to baseline serostatus, especially in the older subjects, there was no impact on satisfaction of the CHMP criteria. The CHMP also took into account that the safety profile described with Pandemrix in study H1N1-007 is  entirely  in  keeping  with  that  described  in  H1N1-021 submitted earlier and also with the data for H5N1/AS03 vaccine, supporting the previous conclusions that the presence of the adjuvant is more influential than the HA content in terms of the reactogenicity profile. Nevertheless, the CHMP reiterated that it remains possible that there could be advantages for a second dose.  Even  if  the  immediate  HI  response  to  Pandemrix  is  highly  satisfactory  across  the  entire  age range 18-60 years there could be advantages for a second dose in terms of antibody persistence and also in terms of antibody against drifted variants. Indeed, the existing H5N1 data would suggest that this might be the case. Therefore the NA data and the post-dose 2 HI and NA data are considered to be important even though all the current data support leaving the advice in the SPC as it stands. Submission of the further data from this study is included in the Specific Obligations agreed during the assessment of the pandemic strain variation PU-017 and will be dealt with in sequential assessment reports. The CHMP further concluded that the changes to the instructions for mixing and administration of the vaccine in the SPC and PL and the amendment  to the Labelling (outer packaging)  in line with these changes are acceptable and provide more clarity especially in view of administration of a half dose of the vaccine. 1.4 Changes to the Product Information The  detailed  changes  can  be  found  in  the  final  approved  highlighted  SPC/Annex  II/  Labelling/PL attached to this report.

Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to the Product Information were requested and subsequently implemented by the MAH.

## SPC section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

The table that presented the immune response to Pandemrix (H1N1) in adults aged 18-60 years from study H1N1-007 was updated to present the Seroprotection rate, Seroconversion rate and Seroconversion factor also for the subjects seronegative at baseline as follows:

1 seroprotection rate: proportion of subjects with haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre ≥ 1:40; 2 seroconversion rate: proportion of subjects who were either seronegative at pre-vaccination and have a protective post-vaccination titre of ≥ 1:40, or who were seropositive at pre-vaccination and have a 4-fold increase in titre; 3 seroconversion factor: ratio of the post-vaccination geometric mean titre (GMT) and the pre-vaccination GMT. Section 6.5 'Nature and contents of container' In this section, the reference to '10 x 0.25 ml doses' was deleted to provide more clarity. Section 6.6 'Special precautions for disposal and other handling' The sub-section on Instructions for mixing and administration of the vaccine was revised in view of the recommendation to allow the reconstituted vial to reach room temperature before use and to give better guidance when  a half dose of the vaccine (0.25 ml) is given. In addition, the recommendation to use one needle for withdrawal and one needle for injection was removed to accommodate different national recommendations on the use of multidose vials. The PL and the Labelling of the outer packaging were revised in line with the changes in SPC sections 6.5 and 6.6. In addition, Annex II was revised to reflect that the specific obligation regarding post-dose 1 data from Study H1N1-007 is now fulfilled and to reflect the current status of the Specific Obligations. II. CONCLUSION -On 22 October 2009 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet.
