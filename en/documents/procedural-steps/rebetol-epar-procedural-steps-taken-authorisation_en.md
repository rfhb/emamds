## BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE

- A  hearing  was  held  at  the  CPMP  meeting  on  26  January  1999  to  address  the  remaining outstanding issues.

1. Submission of the dossier The  applicant  SP  Europe,  Belgium submitted  on  29  May  1998  an  application  for  Marketing Authorisation to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) for Rebetol, through the centralised procedure. On 26-27 May 1998, the CPMP agreed that this medicinal product was  referred  to  Part  A  of  the  Annex  to  Council  Regulation  No.  (EC)  2309/93  of  22  July  1993. Subsequently  further  to  comments  from  the  European  Commission,  a  revised  application  was submitted.  The  list  B  status  of  the  product,  which  was  the  subject  of  the  revised  application,  was confirmed by the CPMP at its meeting on 17-19 November 1998. The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CPMP were as follows: Rapporteur: Dr. Eric Abadie Co-Rapporteur: Dr. David Jefferys Licensing status: The product was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on 3 June 1998. 2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product · The  procedure  started  on  26  June  1998.  The  initial  application  for  Rebetol  related  to  a convenience pack combining ribavirin capsules and interferon alfa-2b solution for injection. · During its meeting on 15-17 September 1998, the CPMP agreed that a GMP inspection of the manufacturing sites was not necessary. · The Rapporteur's first assessment report was circulated to all CPMP Members on 14 September 1998. · The  Co-Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on 2 September 1998. · During  its  meeting  on  20-22  October  1998,  the  CPMP  adopted  the  consolidated  list  of questions to be sent to the company. The consolidated list of questions was sent to the company on 22 October 1998. · The  company  provided  answers  on  2  November  1998.  The  answers were considered insufficient,  as  the  European  Commission  had  notified  the  EMEA  that  it  considered  a convenience pack as non-acceptable for the grant of a marketing authorisation in the European Union. Therefore, a revised package of responses, including an application for ribavirin only, was requested by the CPMP at its meeting on 17-19 November 1998. The CPMP confirmed List B status as medicinal product presented for an entirely new indication which, in the opinion of the EMEA, is of significant therapeutic interest. · Full responses, including the adjustments to application package, were received by the EMEA on 10 December 1998. · The Rapporteur and the Co-Rapporteur circulated the joint assessment report on the company's responses to the list of questions to all CPMP Members on 5 January 1999. This report included a list of outstanding clinical issues to be addressed by the company in an oral explanation at the CPMP meeting on 26-28 January 1999. Medicinal product no longer authorised
