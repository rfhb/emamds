## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Darunavir, administered twice daily (b.i.d.) in combination with low-dose ritonavir (rtv) and with other ARV agents, is currently indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced adults and treatment-experienced paediatric subjects aged ≥ 3 years and ≥ 15 kg body weight.

Darunavir, administered once daily (q.d.) in combination with low-dose rtv and with other ARV agents, is currently indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and paediatric subjects from the age of 12 years and at least 40 kg who are either treatment-naive or treatment-experienced with no darunavir resistance-associated mutations (RAMs)*, who have plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 100,000 copies/ml, and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 10 6 /l.

With this type II variation, the MAH requests an extension of the indication to:

Darunavir administered q.d. in combination with low-dose rtv and with other ARV agents, in paediatric

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects aged 3 to &lt;12 years and weighing ≥ 15 kg who are 1) treatment-naive or 2) treatment experienced with no DRV RAMs, plasma HIV-I RNA &lt;100,000 copies/ml, and CD4+ cell count &gt;100x10 6  cells/l.

Similar to the development of DRV/rtv in adults, the paediatric clinical development program focused first on treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children, and progressed from older to younger children: a weight based DRV/rtv twice daily (b.i.d.) regimen has been investigated in trial TMC114-C212 in treatment-experienced paediatric patients from 6 to &lt; 18 years of age, followed by trial TMC114-TiDP29-C228 in treatment-experienced paediatric patients from 3 to &lt; 6 years of age. In addition, after at least 32 weeks of treatment with the twice daily regimen, the pharmacokinetics of a DRV/rtv once daily (q.d.) regimen was evaluated in a subset of TMC114-C228 patients after a 2 week once daily treatment period. Finally, the use of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily in treatment-naïve adolescents between 12 to &lt; 18 years of age has been investigated in TMC114-TiDP29-C230.

The registration of the darunavir oral suspension in 2012 allows for dosing in the young age groups (EMEA/H/C/707/X/041/G).

In the present application, the proposed extension of the q.d. indication to subjects aged 3 to &lt;12 years who are a) treatment-naïve or b) treatment-experienced with no DRV RAMs, plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;100,000 copies/mL, and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100x106 cells/L, is supported by data from:

the 2-week qd substudy of Phase 2 study TMC114-C228 in treatment-experienced subjects aged 3 to &lt;6years, along with results from model-based pharmacokinetic simulations;

extrapolation of efficacy data from adults treated with DRV/rtv qd (Phase 3 study TMC114-C211 in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults and study TMC114-TiDP31-C229 in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults with no DRV RAMs), and data from pediatric subjects aged 12 to &lt;18 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg treated with DRV/rtv qd (study TMC114-TiDP29-C230);

safety data from pediatric clinical studies and Compassionate Use (CU) and other programs up to a cut-off date of 31 October 2013.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

During the assessment procedure, the MAH was requested to address preclinical safety margins and in vitro affinity to off target receptors.  It was re-itererated by the MAH that for the original submission of DRV for treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults, all preclinical safety margins were calculated assuming a DRV Cmax of 10,000 ng/mL. As such, those previously established preclinical margins for DRV could apply to this pediatric population as well.  No further preclinical data are available for DRV on in vitro affinity to off-target receptors.

In the absence of clinical safety signals and PK/PD (safety) relationships for DRV, it is considered that the proposed dosing regimens for the pediatric population are justified.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity /environmental risk assessment

For type II variations, the evaluation of the environmental impact should be made if there is an increase in the environmental exposure e.g. a new indication may result in a significant increase in the extent of the use (Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the current total Prezista sale volume, the naïve indication in children aged 3 to &lt; 12 years of age is not expected to increase on the total environmental exposure. Hence, the MAH didn't submit an updated Environmental Risk Assessment with this application.

The justification by the MAH is considered acceptable by the CHMP. The CHMP agrees with the MAH that no increase in the environmental exposure is expected.

## 2.3.2. Clinical pharmacology

A total of 10 HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects were treated with study medication in the once daily sub-study TMC114-C228.

Treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects from 3 to &lt;6 years of age who participated in study TMC114-C228, and who had a confirmed viral load &lt;50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml after 24 weeks of treatment, could participate in the once-daily sub-study of this study. These subjects had their weight-based DRV/rtv twice-daily dosing regimen in the main study switched for 2 weeks to a target dose of DRV/rtv 40/7 mg/kg once daily for subjects weighing 10 to &lt;15 kg and a dose of 600/100 mg once daily for subjects weighing ≥ 15 kg; their optimized background regimen (OBR) of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs from the main study was continued. After completion of the rich PK sampling of DRV and rtv in plasma at Week 2 of the once-daily sub-study, all subjects reverted back to their DRV/rtv twice-daily dosing regimen in the main study.

The population PK model for DRV, consisting of adult and paediatric (TMC114-C212, TMC114-C228, TMC125-C206, TMC125-C216) PK data, was updated with the results of the once-daily sub-study of TMC114-C228 and study TMC114-C230 (a study in treatment-naive paediatric subjects aged from 12 to &lt;18 years). This model was then used to simulate dosing regimens to recommend a weight-based once-daily dose of DRV in combination with rtv for paediatric subjects from 3 to &lt;12 years of age and weighing ≥15 kg. The objective of this model-based simulation was to achieve PK exposures (AUC24h) and plasma trough concentrations (C0h) in the HIV-1 infected paediatric population that were similar to those observed when DRV/rtv is administered at a dose of 800/100 mg once daily in HIV-1 infected adults (treatment-naive and treatment-experienced with no DRV RAMs). A target exposure (AUC24h) of 89.7 µh.h/ml was used, which represents the geometric mean DRV AUC24h observed in treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adults (study TMC114-C211). Darunavir AUC24h and C0h, when DRV is administered as DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily, is similar between treatment-naive HIV-1 infected adults and HIV-1 infected adults who are treatment-experienced with no DRV RAMs.

The DRV doses selected for use in the sub-study were based on simulations of DRV exposures using a previously developed population PK model for DRV updated to accommodate data from HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects from 3 to &lt;18 years of age treated with a twice-daily regimen. Simulations for the expected DRV exposure according to the 5th, 50th (ie, median), and 95th percentile of α 1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) in paediatric subjects from 3 to &lt;6 years of age and weighing from 10 to &lt;20 kg were performed for 3 different dosing strategies (see figure 1). The objective of this simulation was to determine a convenient

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dose of DRV that would target the arithmetic mean exposure of DRV in adults when treated with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily (ie, 93.0 μg.h/ml) while minimizing the risk of under-dosing.

Figure l: Plots of Expected DRV Exposures (When Coadministered With rtv) in HIV-l Infected Subjects From 3 to &lt;6 Years of Age (Study TMC114-C228 Substudy)

<!-- image -->

The expected DRV exposure is given for the 5th, 50h (ie, median), and 95th percentile of AAG concentrations (red lines), and compared with 80%, 100%, and 130% of the target exposure in adults (93.0 μg.h/mL, blue lines). Source: Module 5.3.3.5/TMC114-C230-CPOP-W24-Err/Figure 0.5

The expected DRV exposure in dosing regimens A and C was considered insufficient, particularly for paediatric subjects with AAG below the median and with lower body weight. Dosing regimen B was implemented for the once-daily sub-study of TMC114-C228, i.e., 40 mg/kg once daily for subjects weighing less than 15 kg and 600 mg once daily for subjects weighing at least 15 kg (both co-administered with rtv), because this dosing strategy best fit the set objectives. This dosing strategy was endorsed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board for the study.

The mean plasma concentration-time curve for DRV obtained in the sub-study is shown in figure 2. The maximum mean plasma concentrations were reached at 3 hours after intake of DRV/rtv.

The PK parameters for DRV are summarized in table 1. Based on the coefficient of variation (CV), the inter-individual variabilities of the minimum plasma concentration (Cmin), the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and AUC24h were 59%, 27%, and 38%, respectively.

When compared with historical data for DRV administered as DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults (sub-study of TMC114-C211), the Cmin, Cmax, and AUC24h values for DRV in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects from 3 to &lt;6 years of age were 1.33-, 1.81-, and 1.62-fold higher, respectively, than in the adults (table 1).

The PK parameters for rtv are summarized in table 2. Based on the CV, the inter-individual variabilities of Cmin, Cmax, and AUC24h were 47%, 62%, and 47%, respectively.

When compared with historical data for rtv administered as DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults (sub-study of TMC114-C211), rtv Cmin, Cmax, and AUC24h values in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects from 3 to &lt;6 years of age were 1.31-, 3.45-, and 3.40-fold higher, respectively, than in the adults (table 2).

As indicated, the population pharmacokinetic model is updated after inclusion of the data after once daily intake in the TMC114-C228 sub-study and in the TMC114-C230 trial, which was implemented by pooling the richly sampled data from the children aged 3 to &lt;6 years in TMC114-C228 and from the children aged 12 to &lt;18 years in TMC114-C230 together with the data that were used for the previous model adjustment accounting for DRV/rtv b.i.d. intake in children aged 3 to &lt;18 years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The dataset for the TMC114-C228 q.d. sub-study consisted of 10 individuals, with 59 observations after two weeks of treatment. The dataset for TMC114-C230 consisted of 12 individuals, with 71 observations after two weeks of treatment. The overall dataset for the parameter estimation, including the data from the ARIEL, DELPHI and DUET studies, consisted of 659 observations from 102 subjects (72 children and 30 adults).

The pharmacokinetic parameter values for darunavir were estimated in NONMEM using the paediatric population PK model, i.e. a two-compartment model with a first-order absorption (parameterized as KA and fixed to the previously obtained value). The distribution compartment was parameterized in terms of apparent volume (V3/F) and apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F). Both V3/F and Q/F values were fixed. Equation 1 is used to describe the apparent clearance of darunavir as was determined previously.

Equation 1:

<!-- image -->

Where CL/Fi is the apparent oral clearance of an individual, CLint/F the population estimate of apparent intrinsic clearance, KAFF is the population estimate for the affinity of darunavir to alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and was fixed to its previously obtained value, θ is the influence of the individual weight (WTi) on apparent clearance and ηi is the individual random effect. Frel is the population estimate of the relative bioavailability correction for the commercial tablet formulation (Frel=1.18, fixed value) compared to the previously used clinical trial tablet formulation as determined in the original model in adults.

For V2/F, the model was adjusted as follows:

The parameter estimates obtained from the model update are shown in table 4. Only slight changes in the parameter estimates are observed for CL/F and V2/F, compared to the model developed for children from 3 to ≤ 18 years old after b.i.d administration. The influence of body weight on CL/F and V2/F was unchanged. The major impact of the model adjustment was the increase of V3/F and Q/F. Due to the once daily dosing, more information was gathered on these parameters, allowing their estimation. IIV on V2/F and V3/F on the other hand were too small to be properly estimated compared to the previous model. The goodness-of-fit plots for the adjusted model showed that the bias in the individual prediction versus the observation is minimal.

The fact that the mean exposure is on the upper side of the target may be explained by two individuals having a high exposure. These two subjects exhibited high AAG values and low body weight, as illustrated in figure 3, therefore, low clearances and high exposures were expected.

The results of the population PK analysis of DRV at Week 2 of the sub-study were consistent with the non-compartmental PK analysis.

The arithmetic mean AUC24h for DRV was 120 μg.h/mL, which was 1.29-fold higher than the arithmetic mean of the target adult exposure in study TMC114-C211 (93.0 μg.h/ml). The geometric mean AUC24h for DRV was 115 μg.h/ml, which was 1.28-fold higher than the geometric mean of the target DRV exposure in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults in study TMC114-C211 (89.7 μg.h/ml).

Simulated dosing regimens were investigated for their ability to achieve DRV exposures that were close to the target adult exposure while minimizing the pill burden and permitting a switch from the DRV oral suspension to a DRV tablet formulation at the earliest opportunity. While clinical studies were conducted with DRV/rtv once-daily treatment in children from 3 to &lt;6 years of age (10 to 20 kg) and from 12 to &lt;18 years of age (40 to 65 kg), the adjusted population PK model was used to bridge data to cover also children 6 to &lt;12 years of age (20 to 40 kg) for DRV/rtv once-daily dosing.

Because AAG concentrations were shown to be important determinants for DRV exposure in the population PK analysis, simulations were performed using the 5th, 50th (i.e., median) and 95th percentile of AAG concentrations observed in TMC114-C228 and TMC114-C230. Based on the typical value of the clearance parameter obtained in the updated popPK analysis (see table 4), the expected DRV exposures (AUC24h) for different dosing regimens were simulated over a weight range of 10 to 65 kg.

The investigated weight range was divided into 5 weight bands: 10 to 15 kg, 15 to 20 kg, 20 to 30 kg, 30 to 40 kg, and ≥ 40 kg. For each of these weight bands, various dosing regimens were simulated, taking the available DRV tablet strengths (75-, 400-, and 600-mg tablets) and the DRV oral suspension (100-mg/ml suspension) into consideration. The following once-daily regimens were explored for DRV:

- 30, 35, and 40 mg/kg for the 10 to 15 kg weight band
- 30 and 35 mg/kg, and 600 mg for the 15 to 20 kg weight band
- 600 and 675 mg for the 20 to 30 kg weight band
- 675 and 800 mg for the 30 to 40 kg weight band
- 800 mg for the ≥ 40 kg weight band

The simulations assumed the presence of rtv (7 mg/kg or 100 mg q.d.).

Red curve = 35 mg/kg once daily in subjects weighing 10 to 15 kg. Green curve = 600 mg once daily in subjects weighing 15 to 30 kg. Yellow curve = 675 mg once daily in subjects weighing 30 to 40 kg.

The expected exposure is given for the 5th, 50th (ie, median), and 95th percentile of AAG concentrations, and compared with 80%, 100%, and 130% of the target exposure in adults (89.7 μg.h/ml, blue lines).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The mean exposure of DRV achieved with the dosing regimens shown in figure 9 is expected to be within 80% to 130% of the target DRV exposure in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults in study TMC114-C211 when AAG concentration is average. This regimen limits the risk of overexposure without compromising efficacy, as the lower range of exposure (AUC and C0h) is within observed adult ranges. There is a greater chance of achieving a higher DRV exposure in children with higher AAG concentrations. However, no association was observed between the exposure of DRV and the development of AEs or laboratory abnormalities in DRV studies conducted to date.

Based on DRV exposure, these proposed dosing regimens could be considered for treatment naïve

HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects as well as treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects without DRV RAMs because DRV exposure is comparable to that observed in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults and treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults with no DRV RAMs when treated with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily (table 7).

## 2.3.3. Discussion

A population pharmacokinetic model for darunavir in adults was already available. This model was adjusted as follows:

- adjustment to accommodate the difference in exposure after administration of the clinical trial and the commercial tablet formulation.
- -adjustment to accommodate the data from children between the ages of 3 to &lt;18 years old treated b.i.d. This model was based on richly sampled plasma concentration profiles obtained in studies TMC114-C228, TMC114-C212, TMC125-C206 and TMC125-C216 (studies submitted with the original marketing authorisation application).
- update of the model by inclusion of the data obtained after once daily intake (TMC114-C228 sub-study and in the TMC114-C230 trial), which was implemented by pooling the richly sampled data from the children aged 3 to &lt;6 years in TMC114-C228 and from the children aged 12 to &lt;18 years in TMC114-C230 together with the data that were used for the previous model adjustment accounting for DRV/rtv b.i.d. intake in children aged 3 to &lt;18 years.
- This model was then used to simulate once-daily dosing regimens in HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects from 3 to &lt;12 years of age and weighing ≥ 15 kg that would achieve similar levels of darunavir exposure to those observed in HIV-1 infected adults.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Individual darunavir pharmacokinetic parameters for subjects involved in the TMC114-C228 q.d. sub-study were derived during the population pharmacokinetic analysis as described before. Simulation records were added to the dataset to obtain an estimation of the through darunavir plasma concentrations.

The goodness-of-fit plots from the adjusted model, containing only the data from the TMC114-C228 q.d. sub-study subjects, indicate that the model predictions appear to be accurate, with no detectable bias present for individual predictions.

The results of the population PK analysis of DRV at Week 2 of the sub-study were consistent with the non-compartmental PK analysis.

Simulated dosing regimens were investigated for their ability to achieve DRV exposures that were close to the target adult exposure while minimizing the pill burden and permitting a switch from the DRV oral suspension to a DRV tablet formulation at the earliest opportunity. While clinical studies were conducted with DRV/rtv once-daily treatment in children from 3 to &lt;6 years of age (10 to 20 kg) and from 12 to &lt;18 years of age (40 to 65 kg), the adjusted population PK model was used to bridge data to cover also children 6 to &lt;12 years of age (20 to 40 kg) for DRV/rtv once-daily dosing, which is considered acceptable.

Different dosing regimens were simulated over a weight range of 10 to 65 kg. For children with a weight of 10 to &lt;15 kg, a regimen of 35 mg/kg resulted in a similar exposure compared to adult. This also account for a DRV q.d. regimen of 600 mg in children of 15 to &lt; 30 kg, although for the 15 - 20 kg exposure was at the higher end, it is considered not to be a safety problem and it offers the opportunity of the use of the tablet formulation instead of the suspension for the whole group.

A DRV q.d. regimen of 675 mg is expected to provide comparable exposure to adult in the 30 to &lt;40 kg group. From 40 kg and above, the adult DRV/rtv regimen (800/100 mg q.d.) can be used from 40 kg onward and leads to similar DRV exposure compared to adult.

Nonetheless, exposures seen for both darunavir and ritonavir in the phase II study (TMC114- 228) in 3- 6 years old seem high and are higher than that seen in any adult studies involving chronic dosing.  This is particularly true of the Cmax values for both components, with mean values of 10.6 and 2.4 µg/ml for darunavir and ritonavir respectively.  Although safety events in this study appear acceptable it is considered that the data being in only 10 individuals are too limited to allow a thorough assessment of safety.  Further data to support safety with exposures with these Cmax values is required.  In addition a mechanistic PKPD discussion of the importance of Cmax for safety based on all data should be provided.

In addition to this, although the population PK model seems well developed and validated, it seems to be less accurate for prediction of higher plasma concentrations regarding Cmax (see diagnostic plots). A similar divergence is seen for the plots for the study in the 3-6 year olds.  This is often the case for these models where Cmax is less well defined due to sparse sampling. In general it appears that the model will under predict the Cmax. Further diagnostic plots are therefore required to show the accuracy of prediction of the plasma concentration profiles in the children for which PK data are available.  However it is accepted that if sufficient data are provided from previous studies to support safety at the exposures seen in the clinical study for 3 - 6 year olds then the model is probably judged sufficient to bridge to simulate similar exposures in the other age categories.

Based on DRV exposure, these proposed dosing regimens could be considered for treatment naïve HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects as well as treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects without DRV RAMs because DRV exposure is comparable to that observed in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults and treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults with no DRV RAMs when treated with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily.

Based upon these data, the SmPC proposes the following dose regimens:

ART naïve paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kilograms).

ART experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kilograms) PREZISTA twice daily taken with ritonavir taken with food is usually recommended.

A once daily dose regimen of PREZISTA taken with ritonavir taken with food may be used in patients with prior exposure to antiretroviral medicinal products but without darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV 1 RNA &lt; 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count  100 cells x 10 6 /l.

With regard to the recommended doses, in the POPPK model weight is a covariate with an exponent of 0.502 (i.e., somewhat lower than the value of 0.75 normally expected), although it is accepted that AAG is also a covariate in the model which can also influence the relationship.  The relationship with weight would suggest lower doses in each of the age categories would achieve the target drug exposure as defined in the adult population (see table below for comparison of MAH's proposal and assessor's calculation of dose required in children by scaling the adult dose with body weight with the exponent 0.502.

In the TMC114-C228 once daily substudy, a darunavir/low-dose ritonavir (DRV/rtv) dosing regimen of 40/7 mg/kg once daily was evaluated for subjects &lt;15 kg, and a dosing regimen of 600/100 mg once daily for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects ≥15 kg. Table 10 displays the individual maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values observed with their DRV/rtv allocated treatment. Table 11 presents summary statistics of Cmax per DRV/rtv dosing regimen.

It is acknowledged that the DRV/rtv 40/7 mg once daily dose in pediatric subjects weighing less than 15 kg could lead to higher Cmax values than those typically observed in adults, as also shown in Table 15. Simulations indicated that a DRV/rtv 35/7 mg/kg once daily dose regimen would be more appropriate for the pediatric subpopulation of 10 to &lt;15kg. However, this specific pediatric population (&lt;15 kg) is not subject of this application.

For children ≥15 to &lt;30 kg, a DRV/rtv 600/100 mg once daily dosing regimen is proposed, as also evaluated in the once daily substudy of TMC114-C228. All children dosed with 600/100 mg once daily in TMC114-C228 weighed between 16 and 21 kg. As such, it is not unexpected that the observed individual and mean C-max for this particular subset of subjects are on the higher end of those anticipated for the full pediatric cohort of ≥15 to &lt;30 kg. However, the observed Cmax values were still within the range of those observed in other studies for children and adults .

Furthermore, the anticipated DRV exposures with the proposed once daily dosing regimen were also compared with the approved twice daily dosing regimen for this pediatric population.  This comparison showed that the range of anticipated exposures, including Cmax, is similar for the once daily and twice daily regimens. It is acknowledged that there may be some bias in the estimation of Cmax with the population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model (which has been further validated), but this bias is anticipated to be minimal, and similar for both the once daily and twice daily dosing regimens.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

The proposed dosing regimens could be considered for treatment naïve HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects as well as treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects without DRV RAMs as the population pharmacokinetic analysis indicate that DRV exposure is comparable to that observed in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults and treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults with no DRV RAMs when treated with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily. However, in the PK substudy higher Cmax levels were observed, which may trigger safety concerns. Moreover, although the population pharmacokinetic model predicted a comparable exposure, there was uncertainty with regard to the prediction of Cmax and the recommended dose. This aspect was however further clarified by the MAH during the variation procedure.    The MAH presented additional data indicating that although with the limitations of the model, Cmax values were within the range of once daily dosing. As shown in PK figures, the predicted 95th percentile are comparable for recommended once and the approved twice daily dosing regimens.

## 2.4. Clinical Efficacy

## 2.4.1. Main study

## Once Daily Substudy of TMC114-C228 in Treatment-experienced Pediatric Subjects Aged 3 to &lt;6 Years

Study TMC114-C228 has been submitted and assessed within procedure X-41-G. The present 2-week pharmacokinetic substudy of TMC114-C228 was performed between Weeks 32 and 40 to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of DRV/rtv q.d. dosing. Dosing recommendations for the DRV/rtv q.d. substudy were based on the updated pharmacokinetic model of DRV with the rich pharmacokinetic data obtained at Week 2 with the b.i.d. dosing regimen of DRV/rtv in the main study TMC114-C228.

Ten treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children aged 3 to &lt;6 years and weighing between 10 and &lt;20 kg were treated with DRV/rtv qd for 2 weeks. Seven subjects received DRV/rtv 600/96 mg qd, and 3 subjects were to receive DRV/rtv 560/92 mg (40/7 mg/kg) qd. However, due to the accuracy constraints of the rtv pipette, the actual rtv dose for the latter 3 subjects was also 96 mg qd.

The main objective of the q.d. dosing TMC114-C228 substudy was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of DRV/rtv at steady-state after q.d. dosing in HIV-1 infected children, aged from 3 to &lt; 6 years at screening and weighing between 10 and &lt; 20 kg at screening, with a confirmed undetectable plasma viral load (&lt; 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) at Week 32. See section 2.3 on details. The secondary objective was to evaluate the short-term safety and tolerability. AEs were monitored, as part of the main study, on an ongoing basis from signing the ICF onwards until the last study-related visit.

No formal sample size calculation was performed.  There was no randomisation. The study was open label.

All subjects participating in the substudy remained undetectable (&lt; 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) after 2 weeks of DRV/rtv q.d. dosing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

This small 2-week pharmacokinetic substudy of TMC114-C228 was intended to collect data on pharmacokinetics. There is very limited data on efficacy, all 10 subjects maintained undetectable plasma viral load (&lt; 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL).  However, efficacy of the once daily dose regimen in treatment naïve children can be extrapolated from adults.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

In line with the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), based on the identification of suitable dose regimens and the expectation that PK/PD relationships are the same in children as in adults, an extrapolation of efficacy data obtained in adults to children may be accepted.

As DRV exposure in treatment naïve HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects as well as treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects without DRV RAMs was found to be comparable to that observed in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults and treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults with no DRV RAMs when treated with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily, efficacy of 800/100 mg once daily DRV/rtv can be assumed.

## 2.5. Clinical Safety aspects

## 2.5.1. Studies

## Once Daily Substudy of TMC114-C228 in Treatment-experienced Pediatric Subjects Aged 3 to &lt;6 Years

The secondary objective of this substudy was to evaluate the short-term safety and tolerability. AEs were monitored, as part of the main study, on an ongoing basis from signing the ICF onwards until the last study-related visit.

Four AEs occurred in 2 subjects: cough and rhinorrhea in 1 subject, and ear pain and oropharyngeal pain in 1 subject. Each of these AEs were grade 1 in severity, and none were considered by the investigator related to DRV. There were no grade 2 to 4 AEs, no serious adverse events (SAEs), no deaths, and no AEs led to discontinuation. There were no AEs related to physical of neurologic examinations, weight, or laboratory assessment.

The safety results of the qd substudy of TMC114-C228 are in line with those of the main part of the study. There were no new clinically relevant safety findings compared with the known safety profile of DRV/rtv in HIV-1 infected adults and in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects aged 6 to &lt;18 years.

## Safety in Other Clinical Studies and Programs

In total 180 HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects &lt;18 years of age have been treated with DRV/rtv in the ongoing CU program (or exceptionally EAPs or PAA programs) up to the cut-off date of 31 October 2013. Sixty-six of these subjects were &lt;12 years of age. Each of the 180 treated subjects had limited treatment options due to virologic failure or intolerance to multiple ARV regimens. Between 1 August 2012 and 31 October 2013, 2 new SAEs were reported in 1 subject &lt;12 years of age. Both SAEs (viral load increased and diarrhea) were considered by the reporting physician as at least possibly related to DRV/rtv.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Nine new SAEs were reported in 6 subjects &lt;18 years of age and treated with DRV/rtv in the ongoing continued-access study TMC114-C232. Two of these SAEs (pneumonia and asthma) occurred in 1 subject who was &lt;12 years of age. Follow-up information was received for 6 pediatric subjects with 10 SAEs that started prior to 1 August 2012. Seven of these SAEs (appendicitis, tuberculosis, intestinal obstruction, asthma, pneumonia, road traffic accident, and femur fraction) occurred in 4 subjects &lt;12 years of age. All events (new and follow-up cases) were assessed as not related to DRV/rtv by the investigator.

None of the SAEs reported between 1 August 2012 and 31 October 2013 had a fatal outcome. No new ADRs were identified and no new safety concerns emerged from these data that would affect the benefit/risk assessment for the use of DRV/rtv in HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects.

## 2.5.2. Discussion on clinical safety

There were no new clinically relevant safety findings compared with the known safety profile of DRV/rtv in HIV-1 infected adults and in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects aged 6 to &lt;18 years.

## 2.5.3. Conclusions on the clinical safety

There were no new clinically relevant safety findings compared with the known safety profile of DRV/rtv in HIV-1 infected adults and in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects aged 6 to &lt;18 years.

*Category 1 are imposed activities considered key to the benefit risk of the product. Category 2 are specific obligations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Category 3 are required additional PhV activity (to address specific safety concerns or to measure effectiveness of risk minimisation measures)

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.

The proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.

The PRAC also considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

## 2.7. Changes to the Product Information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1 (75/150/300/600 mg tablets), 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPCs of Prezista have been updated.   The package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed:

## (Prezista 75 mg Tables SmPC shown as example)

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

PREZISTA, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection.

PREZISTA 75 mg tablets may be used to provide suitable dose regimens (see section 4.2):

- For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in antiretroviral treatment (ART)-experienced adult patients, including those that have been highly pre-treated.
- For the treatment of HIV-1 infection in paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 15 kg body weight.

In deciding to initiate treatment with PREZISTA co-administered with low dose ritonavir, careful consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of mutations associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and treatment history should guide the use of PREZISTA.

## Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration (oral suspension)

…

## ART-naïve paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg)

The weight-based dose of PREZISTA and ritonavir in paediatric patients is provided in the table below.

## ART-experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kg)

PREZISTA twice daily taken with ritonavir taken with food is usually recommended.

A once daily dose regimen of PREZISTA taken with ritonavir taken with food may be used in patients with prior exposure to antiretroviral medicinal products but without darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count

≥ 100 cells x 10 6 /l.

* DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V

The weight-based dose of PREZISTA and ritonavir in paediatric patients is provided in the table below. The recommended dose of PREZISTA with low dose ritonavir should not exceed the recommended adult dose (600/100 mg twice daily or 800/100 mg once daily).

For ART-experienced paediatric patients HIV genotypic testing is recommended. However, when HIV genotypic testing is not feasible, the PREZISTA/ritonavir once daily dosing regimen is recommended in HIV protease inhibitor-naïve paediatric patients and the twice daily dosing regimen is recommended in HIV protease inhibitor-experienced patients.

## Paediatric patients

PREZISTA/ritonavir should not be used in children with a body weight of less than 15 kg as the dose for this population has not been established in a sufficient number of patients (see section 5.1). PREZISTA/ritonavir should not be used in children below 3 years of age because of safety concerns (see sections 4.4 and 5.3).

Darunavir exposures in treatment-naïve adolescents 12 to 17 years weighing at least 40 kg receiving PREZISTA 800 mg once daily have been determined and were found to be within the therapeutic range as has been established in adults receiving PREZISTA 800 mg once daily. As a consequence, since PREZISTA once daily has also been registered for use in treatment-experienced adults without darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 10 6 /l, the same indication of PREZISTA once daily applies to treatment-experienced children 3 to 17 years weighing at least 15 kg.

## ART-experienced patients - once daily dosing

PREZISTA used in combination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir once daily in ART-experienced patients should not be used in patients with one or more darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs) or HIV-1 RNA ≥  100,000 copies/ml or CD4+ cell count &lt; 100 cells x 10 6 /l (see section 4.2). Combinations with optimised background regimen (OBRs) other than ≥ 2 NRTIs have not been studied in this population. Limited data are available in patients with HIV-1 clades other than B (see section 5.1).

The pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken once daily in 10 treatment experienced paediatric patients, aged 3 to &lt; 6 years and weighing at least 14 kg to &lt; 20 kg, showed that weight based dosages resulted in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that achieved in adults receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily (see section 4.2). In addition, pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation of darunavir exposures in paediatric patients across the ages of 3 to &lt; 18 years confirmed the darunavir exposures as observed in the clinical studies and allowed the identification of weight based PREZISTA/ritonavir once daily dosing regimens for paediatric patients weighing at least 15 kg that are

## 3. Overall conclusion

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

In line with the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), based on the identification of suitable dose regimens and the expectation that PK/PD relationships are the same in children as in adults, the extrapolation of efficacy data obtained in adults to children may be accepted.  The efficacy of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg qd in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults was established in Phase 3 study TMC114-C211 and in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults with no DRV RAMs in the Phase 3 study TMC114-C229. The use of the DRV/rtv qd regimen in paediatric subjects aged 12 to &lt;18 years and weighing ≥40 kg was established in study TMC114-TiDP29-C230 (assessed II/54).

As DRV exposure in treatment naïve HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects as well as treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects without DRV RAMs was found to be comparable to that observed in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults and treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults with no DRV RAMs when treated with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily, efficacy of 800/100 mg once daily DRV/rtv can be assumed.

In a small 2-week pharmacokinetic substudy of TMC114-C228 ten treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children aged 3 to &lt;6 years and weighing between 10 and &lt;20 kg were treated with DRV/rtv qd for 2 weeks. Seven subjects received DRV/rtv 600/96 mg qd, and 3 subjects received DRV/rtv 560/96 mg (40/7 mg/kg) qd. All subjects maintained undetectable plasma viral load ( &lt; 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) after 2 weeks.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The only data on efficacy for the present extension of indication stems from the substudy of TMC114-C228 in treatment experienced children. This is very limited data.  However, efficacy of the once daily dose regimen in treatment naïve children can be extrapolated from adults when exposure is comparable. However, in the PK substudy higher Cmax levels were observed, which may trigger safety concerns. Moreover, although the population pharmacokinetic model predicted a comparable exposure, there could be uncertainty with regard to the prediction of Cmax and the recommended dose. This  has been further clarified though, with no indication that higher exposures (i.e. ≥ 10,000 to &lt;15,000 ng/mL, or ≥ 15,000 ng/mL) would result in an increase in AEs, increased toxicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

There were no new clinically relevant safety findings compared with the known safety profile of DRV/rtv in HIV-1 infected adults and in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects aged 6 to &lt;18 years.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Larger studies are required to assess the long-term effects of DRV on lipid and growth parameters. The on-going PASS study 'Pharmacovigilance study on the safety and use of DRV in HIV infected children and adolescents in Europe' will provide this information. Annual reports from the on-going PASS study are being submitted to the CHMP. In addition, the MAH will initiate a study to compare of the data on growth from children treated with darunavir and other ART products. A study protocol has been submitted by the MAH in March 2014 and is currently under assessment (EMEA/H/C/000707/MEA069).

## Benefit-risk balance

As stated in the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), provided that reliable pharmacokinetic data support robust dose recommendations, an extrapolation of efficacy data obtained in adults to children may be accepted.

Exposures with the once daily dose of 600/100 mg DRV/rtv as recommended for treatment-naïve children weighing ≥15kg and &lt;30kg are similar to the once daily regimen of 800/100 mg DRV/rtv in adults and comparable to exposures with twice daily dosing as recommended in paediatric and adult patients. As such, safety and efficacy can be extrapolated. There seems no indication that higher exposures (i.e. ≥ 10,000 to &lt;15,000 ng/mL, or ≥ 15,000 ng/mL) would result in an increase in AEs, increased toxicity.

The safety data in the claimed paediatric indication do not give rise to any new clinically relevant findings compared with the known DRV/rtv safety profile in HIV-1 infected adults.  Lipid abnormalities and growth impairment were identified as potential risks related to the use of darunavir in treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescents and adequate measures have been put in place to monitor those.
