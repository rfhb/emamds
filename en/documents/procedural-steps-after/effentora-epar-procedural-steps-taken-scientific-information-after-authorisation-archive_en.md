| WS/1273/G | This was an application for a group of variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order to add a warning on the interaction of fentanyl with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants including alcohol following an internal cumulative review. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Update of sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC in order to add a warning on Hyperalgesia following an internal cumulative review. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The wording proposals related to hyperalgesia are in line with the most recent CHMP opinion on PSUSA/00001369/201704. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce editorial and format changes in the SmPC and PL as well as to introduce information in the PL for serotonin syndrome, anaphylaxis and dose review for patients over 65 years in line with the SmPC. C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance | 31/05/2018   | 06/06/2019 | SmPC and PL | Section 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC have been updated in order to introduce a warning on the risks of concomitant administration with benzodiazepines or related drugs which may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Additional recommendations are included to recommend that patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation in case of concomitant use of Effentora with benzodiazepines or related drugs. In addition, SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4 have been updated in order to indicate that in absence of adequate pain control, the possibility of hyperalgesia, tolerance and progression of underlying disease should be considered and to warn that in case of insufficient pain control in response to an increased dose of fentanyl, the possibility of opioid- induced hyperalgesia should be considered. A fentanyl dose reduction or discontinuation of fentanyl treatment or treatment review may be indicated. The wording proposals related to hyperalgesia are in line with the most recent CHMP opinion on PSUSA/00001369/201704 from February 2018 and were implemented as part of procedure PSUSA/00001369/201704. The PL has been updated accordingly.

This Pharmacovigilance System has already been assessed by the EMA for other products of the Teva group. This change also implies that Dr Wendy Huisman is the new Qualified Person for Pharmacovigilance in the European Economic Area for Effentora.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| II/0014  | Update of the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. Further to the availability of a revised Company Core Datasheet (CCDS) for Fentanyl Buccal Tablets, the MAH has updated the section 4.4 of the SmPC on the risk of respiratory depression with additional information concerning improper patient selection and/or improper dosing. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 20/10/2011   | 22/11/2011   | SmPC and PL              | Following the availability of a revised Company Core Datasheet (CCDS) the Product Information (section 4.4 of the SmPC and section 4 of the PL) for Effentora has been updated to reflect the fact that use of the product for conditions other than breakthrough pain in adults and/or improper dosing have resulted in clinically significant respiratory depression and fatalities. Editorial changes were made throughout the SmPC. Updated SmPC and PL are as follows: SmPC 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use Patients and their carers must be instructed that Effentora contains an active substance in an amount that can be fatal, especially to a child. Therefore they must keep all tablets out of the reach and sight of children. [...] Respiratory depression |

Improper patient selection (e.g., use in patients without maintenance opioid therapy) and/or improper dosing have resulted in fatal outcome with Effentora as well as with other fentanyl products. Effentora should only be used for conditions specified in section 4.1. PL Section 4 (possible side effects) Effentora like other fentanyl products can cause very severe breathing problems which can lead to death.   |

| II/0003 | Update to several sections of the SPC (4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 and 4.9) for alignment with the CCDS. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Also the phone numbers in the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet have been updated. Finally, annex II is revised to include the conditions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product and to update the RMP version. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet | 24/09/2009 | 10/12/2009 | SmPC, Annex II and PL | Sections 4.2 and 4.4 were revised to make the information clearer for the reader. In section 4.3, the use in acute pain other than breakthrough pain was added as a contraindication to strengthen the use in the approved indication. In section 4.6, a recommendation for breastfeeding not to be resumed within 48 hours of administration was included, reflecting the fact that fentanyl passes into breast milk. Events in section 4.8 revised to reflect post-marketing experience and clinical trial data. Several adverse events were added, others were reclassified in term of frequency and the event multiple myeloma was removed. A description of symptoms of overdose was added to section 4.9. Furthermore, annex II was revised to updated the version of the latest approved RMP (version 1.4), and consequently to include reference to the educational materials included in the RMP. |
