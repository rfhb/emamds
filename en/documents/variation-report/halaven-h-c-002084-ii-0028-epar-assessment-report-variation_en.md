## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a rare group of heterogeneous mesenchymal tumours. There are more than 50 histologic subtypes of STS, many of which are associated with distinct clinical profiles, response to individual therapies and prognosis. Many of the individual subtypes are very rare. In the past, all subtypes of STS were grouped together for the purposes of treatment, however consensus is now emerging that treatment selection should be governed by histology, particularly in the setting of advanced disease. Soft tissue sarcomas account for less than 1% of all adult solid tumours (Burningham, et al., 2012) and the international annual incidence of STS is reported to range from 1.8 to 5/100 000 per year (Wibmer, et al., 2010). It was estimated that 12 020 new cases of STS would be reported in the US in 2014 and 4 740 deaths would occur as a result of the disease (Siegel, et al., 2014). In the EU, the total crude incidence of sarcomas was 5.6 per 100,000 per year with an estimated 27,908 new cases per year, of which 84% were soft tissue sarcomas and 14% were bone sarcomas (Stiller et al, 2013). The 5-year survival in Europe for adult STS (excluding visceral STS) averages 60%, with substantial geographic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

variations (Storm, 1998). The median survival time in patients with metastatic STS is 11 to 15 months, and only a small subgroup of these patients achieve long term survival. With the median survival of ≤ 1 year for patients with metastatic STS, there is a need for more effective treatments in this setting (Billingsley, et al., 1999; Van Glabbeke, et al., 1999). For localised disease, surgical resection with or without adjuvant radiotherapy is usually the preferred first-line approach.  Adjuvant chemotherapy is also sometimes considered although its role remains controversial because of conflicting results (ESMO guideline 2014).  However even when radical surgery is performed, in about 50% of the time, cases of high-grade sarcoma develop metastases which lead to death (Delaney et al., 1991). who have already received standard dose (Minchom, 2010), trabectedin, and gemcitabine (either alone or

For advanced STS, the majority of patients receive 1 st line chemotherapy with doxorubicin alone or in combination with ifosfamide. Of those patients receiving adjuvant or first-line chemotherapy, approximately half will receive a second-line regimen (Minchom, 2010). At the time of the study, options for second line therapy included the use of standard-dose ifosfamide (or high-dose ifosfamide in patients in combination with docetaxel), dacarbazine, or best supportive care (ESMO clinical practice guideline, 2014). Since the start of the study, pazopanib has been approved in EU on 3 August 2012 for the treatment of patients with advanced STS of selected tumour types, who have received prior chemotherapy. However none of these agents has as yet demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. Recently a study comparing trabectedin (Yondelis) to dacarbazine in pretreated locally advanced/metastatic liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma patients failed to demonstrate an OS benefit (Demetri et al, 2015).

## About the product

Eribulin mesylate (Halaven) is a synthetic analog of halichondrin B (HalB), a large polyether macrolide isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai (Hirata and Uemura, 1986). Results of in vitro studies demonstrate that eribulin inhibits cell growth in a wide range of established human cancer cell lines including breast, colon, prostate, ovarian, small cell and non-small cell lung cancer and uterine sarcoma. Eribulin exerts its anti-cancer effects via a tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism, leading to G2/M (GAP 2/mitosis stages of cell cycle) cell cycle blocks, disruption of mitotic spindles and ultimately apoptotic cell death.

In the European Union, Halaven is approved for the following indication:

'HALAVEN is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have progressed after at least one chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced disease (see section 5.1). Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxane in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting unless patients were not suitable for these treatments.'

The MAH has now applied for an extension of the indication to include:

'HALAVEN is also indicated for the treatment of patients with inoperable soft tissue sarcoma (STS) who have received prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease (see section 5.1). Efficacy and safety have been established primarily in patients with leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma.'

To substantiate this claim, the MAH has submitted one pivotal Phase III study (study 309) and two supportive Phase II studies (studies 207 and 217).

The final approved indication further to the CHMP review is:

'HALAVEN is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable liposarcoma who have received prior anthracycline containing therapy (unless unsuitable) for advanced or metastatic disease (see section 5.1).'

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.2.1. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

To evaluate the primary pharmacodynamic effects of eribulin mesilate in nonclinical models of human soft tissue sarcoma (STS), the following in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted.

- Antiproliferative activity against human adult and paediatric sarcoma cells (in vitro)
- Antitumor activity in human adult and paediatric sarcoma xenograft models (in vivo)

## In vitro studies

As a part of the Paediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) supported by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), antiproliferative effects of eribulin mesilate against 10 childhood STS cell lines including 4 rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS), 2 rhabdoid, and 4 Ewing's sarcomas were evaluated. The median half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of eribulin mesilate in these 3 types of STS cell lines were 0.14, 0.27, and 0.14 nmol/L, respectively. Another panel of 20 human childhood Ewing's sarcoma cell lines demonstrated a median IC50 value of 0.38 nmol/L. Eribulin mesilate inhibited the proliferation of the MES-SA human uterine sarcoma cell line with an IC50 value of 1.99 nmol/L.

## In vivo studies

Antitumor activity of eribulin mesilate against nonclinical models of human STS was evaluated in SK-LMS1 (human leiomyosarcoma), A673 (human Ewing's sarcoma), and HT-1080 (human fibrosarcoma) xenograft models grown subcutaneously in athymic mice. In the SK-LMS-1 model, eribulin mesilate (0.19 - 1.5 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth at 0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg. In the A673 and HT-1080 models, eribulin mesilate (0.875 - 3.5 mg/kg for A673, 1.27 and 1.69 mg/kg for HT-1080) almost completely inhibited tumour growth, with complete responses (CRs) observed in some mice.

In the PPTP evaluation, eribulin mesilate (1 mg/kg) administration resulted in a CR or maintained complete response (MCR) against 8 of the 11 human STS xenograft models; the CRs/MCRs were found in 4 of the 5 Ewing's sarcoma and 4 of the 4 RMS xenograft models. In dose-response studies in 4 selected xenograft models of Ewing's sarcoma and RMS, eribulin mesilate (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg) was active against 3 of the 4 models, with MCRs and CRs observed at doses ≥0.25 or ≥0.5 mg/kg. The treatments were well tolerated in all mice in all of the xenograft studies.

## 2.2.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Using a worst-case combined refined Fpen value of 0.000088 for breast cancer and STS (based on EU epidemiological data for all breast cancer and STS patients, maximum dose of 2.2 mg and maximum possible number of treatment cycles, 17 per year for all patients), the overall PECSURFACEWATER value for eribulin has been calculated to be 0.000097 μg/L. This value is &gt;100 times lower than the action limit of 0.01 μg/L.

The log Kow of eribulin mesilate is 2.25, such that it does not present a hazard with respect to bioaccumulation and persistence. Therefore, the drug substance, eribulin mesilate, is not classifiable as a Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT) substance.

A Phase II environmental fate and effects assessment is not necessary for HALAVEN 0.44 mg/mL Solution for Injection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Despite there being no environmental trigger for further environmental testing, 3 studies have been performed using eribulin mesilate:

- Acute toxicity study using Daphnia magna (OECD 202) NOEC=0.46 mg/l
- Activated sewage sludge respiration inhibition test (OECD 209) NOEC = 56 mg/l
- Ready biodegradability test (OECD 301B) Not readily biodegradable (7-8%)

## 2.2.3. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The MAH has presented in vitro data showing antiproliferative activity against the human uterine sarcoma cell line MES-SA with an IC50 of 1.99 nmol/l. In a xenograft model in athymic mice, eribulin mesilate showed antitumor activity against the human leiomyosarcoma cell line SK-LMS-1.

These in vitro and in vivo data support the clinical development of eribulin mesilate in the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.

With regard to the ERA, it is agreed that no further Phase II testing is required, as a consequence of introducing a new indication. Although eribulin mesilate was shown not to be readily biodegradable, due to the very low anticipated exposure it is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment.

## 2.2.4. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The non-clinical data submitted support this application for an extension of indication.

The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of eribulin mesilate. Considering the above data, eribulin mesilate is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

New plasma concentration data are available from the two phase II studies (207 and 217) and from the phase III study (309) of eribulin in the treatment of advanced STS. In study 207, PK sampling was performed on Day 1 in cycle 1 only. In studies 217 and 309, PK sampling was performed on Day 1 and 8 in cycles 1 and 3. The pharmacokinetic data was used to perform two new Population PK and PK/PD analyses. The first analysis (Report No CPMS-E7389-003R) included data from Study 207 pooled with data from 7 previous Phase 1 studies (Studies 101, 102, 103, 105, 108, 109, and 110) and one previous Phase 2 Study (Study 211). The second analysis (Report No CPMS-E7389-005R) included also data from the STS studies 217 and 309.

The results of the first analysis (Report No CPMS-E7389-003R), including STS data from study 207 only, were in line with previous population PK analyses of eribulin and are not further discussed. The results from the analysis including data from all STS studies (207, 217 and 309) are described below.

In addition, the MAH submitted a number of new in vitro studies on protein binding, interaction potential, and transporter substrate specificity.

## 2.3.2.1. Population Pharmacokinetic Analyses

The final population analyses included 478 subjects who contributed a total of 4566 eribulin plasma concentrations (1753 observations from 253 subjects from Studies 101, 102, 105, 108, 109, 110, and 207 and 1753 observations from 253 subjects from Studies 217 and 309).

Model-based analyses consisted of a population PK model for eribulin and population PK/PD models for longitudinal tumour size measurements (depending on any apparent eribulin exposure PK/PD

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

relationship), neutropenia and change from baseline in QTcF. All models were developed using NONMEM 7.2. Model building and covariate assessments were conducted using standard methods.

The final population PK model was used to derive individual PK parameters and eribulin exposures, which were then incorporated into the PK/PD datasets to be used in the subsequent population PK/PD analyses.

The results from this population PK analysis were consistent with those from previous analyses. The PK of eribulin were best described by a three compartment model with linear elimination from the central compartment and parameterized for CL, V1, Q2, V2, Q3 and V3. The use of an allometric model with body weight, used in a previous eribulin PK analysis, was also used in this case. The IIV was estimated for CL, V1, Q2 and V3, but not for volume of distribution for V2 and inter-compartmental clearance for the 2nd and 3rd compartments (Q2). Residual variability was described by a proportional error model and estimated separately for data rich Phase 1 studies and for sparse data in the Phase 2/3 studies and for the maximum duration of infusion period (≤1.5 h).

Eribulin CL was found to increase with increasing albumin levels (power = 0.693) and decline with increasing bilirubin (power = -0.129). No significant effect of gender, age, race, ECOG status, renal function (creatinine clearance) or tumour type (STS vs. others) on eribulin exposure was identified. Model parameters are presented in the table below.

## 2.3.2.2. New in vitro studies using human biomaterial

## Study B2012-002: In vitro protein binding of eribulin in human plasma

Blank plasma aliquots from volunteers were spiked with eribulin (E7389) to achieve final concentrations of 5, 50, and 500 ng/mL. Plasma samples were spiked into the membrane side of Rapid Equilibrium Devices (RED). Phosphate buffer solution was spiked into the outer well of the RED. After an overnight incubation, an aliquot was removed from each side of the membrane. The resulting samples were extracted and concentrations of eribulin were determined by LC/MS/MS. The percentage of protein binding in plasma was determined by comparing the concentrations calculated from each side of the membrane.

The protein binding of eribulin (5, 50 and 500 ng/mL) in human plasma was 61.6%, 67.4% and 63.8%, respectively. There was no concentration dependency.

## Study 301054911: Eribulin induction potential on CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4

Eribulin was incubated in three separate preparations of human hepatocyte cultures at concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 μM for three days. Hepatocytes were also incubated with positive controls, β-naphthoflavone (20 μM) for CYP1A1/2, phenobarbital (2 mM) for CYP2B6 and rifampicin (20 μM) for CYP2C9 and 3A4. The enzyme induction was determined using probe substrates selective for these drug-metabolizing enzymes and quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA expression. The cytotoxicity potential of eribulin towards hepatocyte cultures was tested using a MTT assay at the end of the 3-day exposure period.

The positive control inducers produced at least 12-fold increase in the enzyme activities for CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in all three donors. As expected, the induction in CYP2C9 activity by rifampicin was relatively low (2.8-9.1-fold).

Eribulin caused no induction for all enzymes tested. Instead, a decrease in enzyme activities was found for all three donors, with a maximal decrease at 10 μM of 32-77%. The RT-PCR data generally supported the activity results. The cytotoxicity assessment using the MTT assay showed no obvious decrease in hepatocyte viability in cultures of hepatocytes for all donors at any of concentrations examined (1, 5 and 10 μM).

## Study 2010-003: Eribulin inhibition of select CYPs in microsomes

Co-incubation of probe substrates at their respective Km values and multiple eribulin concentrations (up to 200 μM) in human liver microsomes (HLM) was utilized to create IC50 curves. The P450s explored were CYP1A, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A. Positive controls utilising probe inhibitors was also assessed to verify the validity of the incubations.

For all P450s except CYP3A, the IC50 values for inhibition by eribulin were greater than 200 μM. For CYP3A, the IC50 values for inhibition by eribulin against the probe substrates of midazolam, nifedipine, and testosterone were 2.21, 1.17, and 10.6 μM, respectively.

Study 2013-121: Eribulin as a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3 and MATE, and as inhibitor of MATE

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate if eribulin was a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, and MATE1, and inhibitor of MATE1. For the substrate assays, eribulin (0.3, 1, or 3 μmol/L) was co-incubated in transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO), Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) or MDCKII cells overexpressing OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, and MATE1 with or without a selective transporter inhibitor. The parental cells were used as the control. Following the incubation, eribulin concentrations in cell lysates were analysed using LC/MS/MS. For the evaluation of inhibition, eribulin was co-incubated in transfected and parental cells overexpressing MATE1 with probe substrate [14C]-metformin. The amount of the probe substrate in cell lysates was analyzed using a liquid scintillation counter. Transporter mediated uptake was represented by the difference in fold uptake in the transporter expressing cells and the parental cells.

At concentrations ranging from 0.3-1 μmol/L of eribulin, generally less than two-fold uptake of eribulin was observed in transfected cells compared to those in the parental cells. In addition, the fold increase in each transfected cell was not significantly reduced in the presence of selective inhibitor. Active transport was demonstrated by uptake of the model substrates, which was inhibited by the control inhibitors.

The results from the inhibition study suggest that up to 10 μmol/L of eribulin did not inhibit the MATE1mediated transport of the probe substrate.

## Study 2013-139: Eribulin as a substrate of BCRP, MRP2, MRP4 and BSEP

The purpose of the study was to evaluate eribulin at lower concentrations as a potential substrate of BCRP, MRP2, MRP4, and BSEP.

For the BCRP substrate assays, the transcellular transport of eribulin at 0.3 and 1 μmol/L in the absence or presence of a BCRP inhibitor (KO 143) was measured in transwell inserts using BCRP-transfected (MDCKII-BCRP) cells and parental cells. Flux ratio (FR) was defined as the ratio of the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) in basolateral-to-apical (BA) direction to that of apical-to-basolateral (A-B) direction. The FR was normalized by the parental cells, expressed as the corrected flux ratio (CFR). KO 143 was co-incubated with eribulin to determine if CFR values decreased.

Eribulin was assessed as a substrate of MRP2, MRP4, and BSEP using vesicle membrane assays. Eribulin at 0.3 and 1 μmol/L was incubated in the transporter-enriched vesicle membranes and the control vesicle membranes. The ATP/AMP ratios were calculated to assess the ATP dependent transport. Transporter inhibitors (benzbromarone, MK 571, and cyclosporin A for MRP2, MRP4, and BSEP, respectively) was cotreated with eribulin to determine if ATP/AMP ratios decreased.

In the BCRP substrate assay, the corrected flux ratio (CFR) values for 0.3 and 1 μmol/L of eribulin were 0.8 and 0.9, respectively. The respective CFR values for eribulin were 0.8 and 0.3 in the presence of KO 143, i.e. there was no substantial reduction of eribulin transport in presence of inhibitor (Table ). The CFR for [3H]prazosin, a known BCRP substrate, was 4.1 and 1.0 in the absence and presence of KO 143, a known BCRP inhibitor, respectively, indicating that the BCRP activity in MDCKII-BCRP was substantially greater than that in MDCKII-mock cells and the activity was blocked by cotreating with a BCRP inhibitor.

In the MRP2, MRP4, and BSEP substrate assays, almost all the ATP/AMP ratios of eribulin treatments in the transporter enriched vesicle membranes were less than 2 fold and the co-treatment of transporter inhibitors did not decrease the ATP/AMP ratios of eribulin (Table 7). Results with model substrates ([3H]E17βG for MRP2, [3H]DHEAS for MRP4, and [3H]taurocholate for BSEP) indicated transporter activity in the transfected vesicles but not in control vesicles.

The results of this study suggest that eribulin, at 0.3 and 1 μmol/L, is not a substrate of BCRP, MRP2, MRP4, or BSEP.

Based on the data presented above, eribulin is not a clinically relevant inhibitor of any of the investigated transporters (based on the 50*Cmax(u) cut-off of 8.5 µM). Eribulin seems to be a weak substrate of OATP1B3. However, the known OATP1B3 inhibitor fluvastatin did not inhibit the uptake of eribulin. Taken together, the modest OATP1B3 accumulation (1.4-2.16 fold) and the lack of fluvastatin inhibition of eribulin OATP1B3 uptake clearly indicates that eribulin is actually not a substrate of OATP1B3 in vitro.

In conclusion, eribulin is neither an inhibitor nor a substrate of MRP2, MRP4, BSEP, OATP1B3, OCT1 and OCT2 in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations.

## Study XS-0084: Eribulin as an inhibitor of BCRP, OCT1, OAT1, OAT3 and OATP1B1

This study investigated if eribulin was an inhibitor of BCRP, OCT1, OAT1, OAT3 and OATP1B1 by measuring its inhibition of model substrates in membrane vesicles (BCRP) or transfected S2 and HEK293 cells (OCT1, OAT1, OAT3 and OATP1B1). Control vesicles and parental cells were used as negative controls. The substances used, its concentration and intended use is given in the table below.

## Study XS-0085: Eribulin as a substrate of BCRP, OCT1, OAT1, OAT3 and OATP1B1

The transcellular transport or cellular uptake of eribulin at 5 and 10 μmol/L was measured in BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, and OCT1 expressing cells and respective control cells. The concentrations of eribulin in the samples were determined by LC/MS/MS. The Papp ratio, a parameter for assessing the efflux of BCRP, and R value, a Papp ratio normalized by control cells, were calculated to assess the BCRP susceptibility of eribulin. The cleared volume, a parameter for assessing cellular uptake, was used to evaluate the susceptibility of OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, and OCT1. The cellular uptake of eribulin was assessed by measuring the concentrations of eribulin in cell lysate.

Efficient uptake of model substrates was observed, indicating functional transport in the cell systems.

No uptake of eribulin by BCRP was observed. Although the cleared volumes of eribulin at 10 μmol/L in OAT1 expressing cells were significantly higher than the ones in the control cells, the difference was suggested mainly due to lower cleared volume of eribulin at 10 μmol/L observed in the control cells. The cleared volumes of eribulin at 10 μmol/L were similar to those at 5 μmol/L in the OAT1 expressing cells.

Overall, the data indicate that eribulin is not a substrate of BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, or OATP1B1. However, eribulin at 5 and 10 μmol/L exhibited higher cleared volumes in OCT1 expressing cells compared to those in the control cells, suggesting that eribulin may be an OCT1 substrate.

## 2.3.3. PK/PD modelling

The population PK/PD (exposure-efficacy) analysis for eribulin tumour growth inhibition, OS efficacy analysis and graphical eribulin exposure-safety and exposure-efficacy analysis were based on data from Studies 217 and 309. Time-to-event analysis for OS was performed for studies 217 and 309 separately. Due to the low number of patients in study 217, only results from study 309 will be discussed here.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The population PK/PD (exposure-safety) analysis for eribulin-induced neutropenia was based on data from Studies 207, 217 and 309. The population PK/PD analysis for eribulin exposure-QTcF relationship was based on data from studies 217 and 309.

In all three studies, the starting dose was 1.4 mg/m 2  on Days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle.

## Tumour growth inhibition model

For the tumour growth inhibition model, data of the sum of the longest diameter for target lesions by independent review from Studies 217 and 309 was used. Subjects only for which both tumour size and PK information was available were evaluated.

The final PK/PD study 217 and 309 dataset for tumour growth inhibition had 938 observations from 241 subjects.

The drug exposure parameter tested in the tumour growth inhibition model was individual eribulin AUC at the time of the assessment and was calculated as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Dose is in μg on the day of tumour assessment and clearance in L/h is the population PK model predicted individual clearance.

Tumour size appeared to decrease with time but not with increasing eribulin exposure.

## OS analysis

For study 309 out of the 226 subjects dosed with eribulin mesylate with available OS and PFS data, PK parameters to calculate eribulin exposure were available from 215 subjects. PFS week 12 data were available for 75 subjects. Time-to-event analysis for OS was performed on data from subjects in the eribulin arm. OS data was explored using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses using survfit() and coxph() functions, respectively in S-plus v 8.1.

For the PK/PD analysis of OS, PFS and BOR the exposure parameter used was individual eribulin AUC based on the starting dose as for Tumour size above.

The results from the univariate (p≤0.05) Cox regression analysis for the effect of eribulin exposure and other covariates on OS in study 309 (assessed in subjects receiving eribulin mesylate) are presented in the table below. Significant predictors are shown in bold type.

The significant predictors of OS from the above univariate analysis were identified to be loge % change tumor size at Week 6, ECOG status, years since diagnosed, and loge baseline tumour size. These predictors were carried forward to the multivariate analysis where all significant predictors for OS from the univariate analysis were assessed simultaneously. Multivariate Cox regression analysis (p≤0.01) results are presented in the table below.

A check for confounding between baseline tumour size with % change in tumour size at Week 6 was performed. Percentage change in tumour size at Week 6 was not confounded with baseline tumour size confirming the results of the multivariate.

## Neutropenia model

For the neutropenia model, eribulin concentration at the time of ANC assessment was predicted using the final population PK model in all subjects participating in studies 207, 217 and 309 with post-dose ANC measurements. The PK/PD dataset for the neutropenia model development consisted of 6602 records from 402 subjects.

Absolute neutrophil count data following eribulin mesilate administration in Studies 207, 217 and 309 was best described by a PK/PD model for haematological toxicity where model predicted eribulin concentrations reduced the neutrophil proliferation rate or induced cell loss. The results of the neutropenia PK/PD analyses for eribulin, including 24% greater inhibition of neutrophil proliferation in Japanese subjects, were consistent with previous analyses (Study 221). Parameters for the final eribulin neutropenia PK/PD model are presented in the table below.

## QTcF model

For the dQTcF model, observed eribulin concentrations during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 were used with postdose dQTcF measurements in studies 217 and 309. The PK/PD dataset for the QTcF model development consisted of 463 records from 127 subjects.

The relationship between observed eribulin concentration and change from baseline QTcF (dQTcF) during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 was assessed using the following linear relationship, where the slope of the relationship was estimated:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

The analysis showed that QTcF was not influenced by eribulin concentrations.

## Evaluation of safety parameters:

No change in laboratory values for haematology, blood biochemistry and renal function with eribulin exposure was detected. Median cumulative eribulin exposure appears to be higher in subjects with AEs of Grade ≥3 compared to subjects not having these AEs. However, of the 253 subjects with PK and AE data, only 6 had Grade ≥3 neuropathy. No PK/PD relationship between average or cumulative eribulin exposure and occurrence of Grade ≥3 fatigue, nausea, anaemia and febrile neutropenia was observed.

## 2.3.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The results of the new population pharmacokinetic analysis are fully in line with previous analyses. The data do not indicate a different pharmacokinetic behaviour of eribulin in patients with STS compared to patients with breast cancer. No changes to the pharmacokinetic information in the SmPC are therefore needed.

The MAH submitted a number of new in vitro studies on protein binding and interaction potential. Protein binding results were in line with previous data and warrants no changes to the SmPC.

The induction studies submitted with the original MAA had some flaws. Data were however considered sufficient to exclude a strong induction potential of eribulin and additional inductions studies were not requested by the CHMP. However, the MAH submitted further drug interaction studies. The new study investigating the eribulin induction potential on CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 provides further reassurance. No changes to the SmPC are indicated.

A CYP inhibition study previously not submitted indicated a potential of eribulin to inhibit CYP3A4. The results of this study have been discussed previously, as they were used in a Physiologically-based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling, submitted and discussed in variation EMEA/H/C/002084/II/011 (EC decision on 27 June 2014). The PBPK model indicated that an in vivo inhibitory potential on CYP3A4 cannot be completely ruled out, although strong inhibition is not expected.

Several studies on eribulin as a substrate and/or inhibitor of different transporters were submitted. Overall the study setups were acceptable. The investigations were somewhat overlapping and the results are summarised below.

Overall, eribulin appeared to be neither substrate nor inhibitor of the tested transporters. Eribulin has previously been concluded to be eliminated primarily via biliary excretion and the approved SmPC includes a general warning to avoid concomitant administration of inhibitors of transport proteins such as OATP or MRP. Based on the results of the new in vitro studies, indicating that eribulin is not a substrate of transporters known to be involved in drug-drug interactions, this warning has been removed.

A previous DDI study with rifampicin showed no effect on eribulin exposure. However, as it was then unknown whether eribulin was an OATP substrate, it could not be absolutely excluded that an inducing effect of rifampicin was counteracted by OATP inhibition, and the results from the rifampicin study could not be extrapolated to other inducers. Therefore, a warning of a potential effect of CYP3A4 inducers on eribulin was included in the SmPC. Since eribulin has now been shown not to be a substrate of OATP transporters, this warning has been removed.

## 2.3.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

An updated PPK model, with addition of data from Study 207, 217 and 309, and a new PK/PD model including data from study 301 only have been submitted. The updated PPK model does not alter the conclusion drawn on eribulin pharmacokinetics as compared with previous PPK models. Results of the PK/PD modelling are also in line with what has been previously observed and do not have implications for the benefit/risk assessment of the currently applied indication.

New in vitro data on eribulin protein binding and on eribulin as an inducer of CYPs confirms previous results.

New in vitro data indicate that eribulin is not a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP),

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

organic anion (OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3), multi-drug resistance-associated protein (MRP2, MRP4) and bile salt export pump (BSEP) transporters. Neither has it inhibited BCRP, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporter-mediated activity at relevant clinical concentrations. The SmPC has been updated in line with these results (see section 4.5 of the SmPC).

## 2.4. Clinical efficacy

## 2.4.1. Dose response study(ies)

No formal dose response study has been submitted.

Two phase II studies were conducted with eribulin in STS using the 1.4 mg/m 2  of eribulin mesylate (please see section below on supportive studies).

The eribulin dose regimen (1.4 mg/m 2  IV on Days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle) administered in study 309 was established in the E7389-G000-305 study (EMBRACE) performed in metastatic breast cancer which constituted the basis for licensure for eribulin. The dose regimen is considered justified.

It is to be noted that the dose 1.4 mg/m 2  used in e.g. EMBRACE and the 309 study refers to the salt form (eribulin mesilate) which is equivalent to 1.23 mg/m 2 of the base of the active substance (eribulin).  This is adequately highlighted in the Halaven SmPC section 4.2.

## Treatments

Arm A: Eribulin mesilate at a dose of 1.4 mg/m 2 as an IV infusion over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle.

Arm B: Dacarbazine (DTIC), either 1200 mg/m 2 , 1000 mg/m 2 , or 850 mg/m 2  (each administered once every 3 weeks ) as starting dose could be chosen at the discretion of the investigator depending on the individual clinical status of the patient at entry. The selection of the starting dose of dacarbazine for each subject had to be confirmed prior to randomization.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary Efficacy Endpoint

- OS measured from the date of randomisation until date of death from any cause.

## Secondary Efficacy Endpoints

- PFS, defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of first documentation of disease

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

progression, or date of death (whichever occurs first).

- PFR12wks, defined as the proportion of subjects alive and progression-free at 12 weeks from the date of randomisation.
- CBR, defined as the proportion of subjects who had best overall response of CR or PR or dSD (duration &gt; 11 weeks).
- Safety endpoints included AEs according to CTCAE v4.0 grades and serious AEs, haematology and clinical chemistry, urinalysis, regular measurement of vital signs, 12-lead ECGs and performance of physical examinations.
- Population PK profile of eribulin in the subjects with STS.

Exploratory Endpoints

- ORR, the proportion of subjects who had overall response of CR or PR.
- DCR, the proportion of subjects who had best overall response of CR, or PR, or SD.
- dSD, defined as the proportion of subjects who had the duration of SD ≥11 weeks.
- QoL scores measured using the QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D questionnaires.
- The following exploratory PK/PD endpoints:
- Relationship between exposure to eribulin and pharmacodynamic biomarkers and efficacy.
- Relationship between exposure to eribulin and AEs.
- Blood and tumour biomarkers which may be correlated with safety and efficacy endpoints.

## Sample size

The sample size determination was estimated and based upon the required number of target events to detect a treatment difference in the comparison of OS. The estimated median OS of Arm B was assumed to be approximately 6 months, based on historical controls (Anderson et al., 2006). An improvement of 2.5 months or more was considered to be of clinical importance, which translated to a median OS in Arm A of 8.5 months and a hazard ratio of 0.706. Alpha was set at 0.05 assuming a two-sided test and the power at 90%. The required number of deaths for the assumed effect size was projected to be 353 events. It was estimated that approximately 450 subjects would need to be randomized and with a randomization ratio of 1:1 this would be a minimum of 225 subjects per treatment arm.

## Randomisation

Randomization was conducted in a 1:1 ratio (Arm A, eribulin; Arm B, dacarbazine) and stratified by histology (ADI or LMS), region (Region 1: USA and Canada; or Region 2: Western Europe, Australia and Israel; or Region 3: Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia), and number of prior regimens for advanced STS (2 or &gt;2 prior regimens).

## Blinding (masking)

Study 309 was open-label.

## Statistical methods

The study was designed to provide evidence to either support the null hypothesis:

H0: Seribulin(t)=Sdacarbazine(t) (the survival distributions in the two arms are equal) or to reject it in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

favour of the alternative hypothesis:

## H1: Seribulin(t) ≠ Sdacarbazine(t)

where Seribulin(t) is the survival function in the eribulin arm and Sdacarbazine(t) is the survival function in the dacarbazine arm.

Stratified log-rank test was used to compare the primary efficacy endpoint OS between treatment arms on the Full Analysis Set. Subjects who were lost to follow-up and the subjects who were alive at the date of data cut-off were censored at either the date the subject was last known to be alive, or the date of data cut-off, whichever was earliest. Subjects who died on the date of randomization had a survival time of 0.5 day. The significance levels were as follows:

- 0.0148 for the interim analysis when 70% of the target events have been observed,
- 0.0455 for the final analysis.

ECOG Performance Status (PS) were considered as additional stratification factors (0/1 vs. 2 or above) in primary analysis if baseline ECOG PS imbalance rate between two arms were more than 10%.

Three sensitivity analyses were performed on the final primary analysis.

- An analysis same as the final primary analysis but on per-protocol set.
- An analysis similar to the final primary analysis except without any stratification.
- Subjects starting new anti-cancer treatment were censored at the date of the new treatment

Subgroup analyses, via stratified Cox proportional model, were performed by age (&lt;65, or ≥ 65), sex, race, ethnicity, number of prior regimens for advanced STS, region, histology, baseline ECOG performance status , prior anti-cancer therapy type and AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) Sarcoma tumor stage at the date of histological diagnosis. If it was applicable, the stratified factors would be histology, geographic region, and number of prior regimens for advanced STS.

PFS was compared between the treatment arms using two-sided stratified log-rank test, stratified by histology, geographic region and number of prior regimens for advanced STS on both Full Analysis Set and Per-Protocol Analysis set.

## Recruitment

Study 309 was conducted between 10 Mar 2011 and 02 Jan 2015 at 110 study sites in three geographical regions: the United States and Canada (Region 1); Western Europe, Australia, and Israel (Region 2); and Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia (Region 3).

## Conduct of the study

An interim analysis on efficacy data was conducted when 247 deaths (70% of the events) were observed, and was performed by an independent statistical reporting team. The data cut-off date for the interim analysis was 20 Oct 2013 (the date of the 247 th  event). The DMC reviewed the interim efficacy and safety data on 18 Feb 2014 and recommended that the study continue without modification.

Dry runs were conducted on hypothetical data to test the statistical programs on the datasets to ensure

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

they would work properly for the final analysis. However, unintentionally interim results from study 309 were used for these dry runs. Once the final analysis was conducted, it became obvious that the final KM curves and those from the dry runs were almost identical.

The Applicant conducted an internal investigation and concluded that there was no evidence that the exposure of the interim results had any impact on the final results. The first dry run was conducted on June 19, 2014, one year after the last patient was enrolled (May 28, 2013). The last dry run was conducted in November 2014. At the time of the first dry run, 82% of survival endpoints had been accrued. The MAH did not make any major amendments to the protocol after the dry runs.

## Amendments and Protocol Deviations

There were two amendments to the protocol. Amendment 01 was issued on 25 May 2012 and pertained mainly to revisions of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Amendment 02 was issued on 08 Aug 2012 and pertained to study drug permanently discontinued in the event of Grade 3 or 4 QTc interval prolongation. An initial review of all protocol deviations identified 22 subjects who had a major protocol violation based on the following protocol specified criteria:

- Deviation from inclusion criteria 1 - 3
- Treated with the incorrect study drug versus the randomized treatment.

Following review of the analysis, an additional 16 subjects were identified as having a major protocol violation on the basis of inclusion/exclusion criteria, study drug dosing error, or other criteria that could potentially affect the safety or efficacy analyses. Therefore, a total of 38 subjects (8.4%) were excluded from the Per Protocol Analysis Set and a larger percentage of subjects in the dacarbazine arm (11.2%) had a major protocol violation than subjects in the eribulin arm (5.7%).

As the subgroup analyses for OS and PFS indicated a differential benefit between the ADI and LMS (ADI [OS HR 0.51; PFS HR 0.52] vs. LMS [OS HR 0.93; PFS HR 1. 07]), separate baseline and outcome data for the two subtypes including subgroup analyses were requested:

## Study Outcomes by Histology

## Adipocytic (ADI)

OS for ADI subjects is shown in the figure below.

PFS for ADI subjects is shown in the figure below.

Figure 7: PFS by treatment for adipocytic (ADI) subjects - Study 309

From these analyses it is apparent that the OS benefit for eribulin over dacarbazine is entirely driven by the patients with the ADI subtype (HR 0.51 (95% CI 0.346, 0.753), P=0.0006) with a median OS of about 16 months for the eribulin arm compared with approximately 8 months for the dacarbazine arm. In

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

addition, a benefit in PFS for this subtype can be observed (median 2.9 months vs. 1.7 months in the dacarbazine arm with a HR of 0.52 (95% CI 0.346; 0.784, P=0.0015).

## Analysis of OS by dacarbazine dose level

Since the starting dose of dacarbazine was allowed to be determined by the treating investigator, OS by planned dacarbazine dose was evaluated.

Summary of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - Investigator Assessment. The tumor assessment is based on REciST 1.1. [a]: If a subject had both progressing disease and death, only progressing disease data will be included. If a subject had clinical progression before progressing disease or censoring. only clinical 1progression at last dose date will be (ADI or LMS):geographic region（1,2or3） andnumber of prior regimens for advancedSTS （2 or &gt;2). [e]: Hasardl ratio is based on a Cox regression model including treatment as covariate， andl histology (ADIor LMS)， geographieregion (l,2 or 3]and number of prior regimens for advanced ST8 (2 or &gt;2) asstrata.

## Analysis of PRO and QoL

Two PROs were included for the analysis of QoL (exploratory analyses). These were the EORTC questionnaire QLQC30 and the EQ-5D-3L (administered at baseline, pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment cycle and at the Off-treatment Visit).

## Compliance

Overall study compliance was good for both measures throughout the course of the study and did not fall below 70%.

No absolute differences in PRO compliance were observed between treatment arms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sarcoma

A multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized study conducted in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Poland and France. A total of 128 subjects were enrolled between13 Dec 2006 to 28 Jun 2012.

The study was an EORTC conducted study.

The study enrolled subjects who had histologically confirmed and measurable (RECIST) advanced and/ or metastatic STS of the following histology: leiomyosarcoma (LMS), adipocytic (ADI), synovial sarcoma (SYN), or other types of sarcoma (OTH) and with evidence of objective progression within the last 6 months (RECIST). No more than one prior combination regimen or two single agent cytotoxic drugs for metastatic disease were allowed (prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy included).

The subjects were treated with eribulin mesilate 1.4 mg/m² on Days 1 and 8, every 21 days.

A total of 115 patients were evaluable for efficacy and were divided into four strata: leiomyosarcoma (LMS, n=38), adipocytic (ADI, n=32), synovial sarcoma (SYN, n=19) or other types of sarcoma (OTH, n=26). The limited number of patients in each group is recognised.

Primary endpoint was PFS12 weeks and secondary endpoints were Overall PFS, ORR, CRB rate, time to onset of response, duration of response and OS.

The primary endpoint showed response in 47% of the patients in the ADI stratum, 32% in the LMS stratum, 21% in the SYN stratum and 19% in the OTH stratum.

The median PFS time was similar for each of the four strata (82, 88, 81 and 72 days for the ADI, LMS, SYN and OTH strata respectively).

Only one patient (in the ADI stratum) experienced a CR at Week 12. One patient in each of the ADI, SYN, and OTH strata experienced a PR. No difference among the strata for the ORR was observed (3%, 5%, 5%, and 4% for the ADI, LMS, SYN and OTH strata respectively).

## Study E7389-J081-217 (study 217): An Open-label, Multi-centre, Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Eribulin in Previously Treated Subjects with Advanced or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma

Study 217 was initiated to investigate the efficacy and safety of eribulin in the treatment of subjects with advanced or metastatic STS in Japan.

The study was conducted between 14 November 2011 and 14 November 2014 (date of database cut-off) at 13 study sites in Japan.  A total of 51 patients were evaluable for efficacy in this study (35 patients in the ADI (n=16)/LMS (n=19) stratum and 16 patients in the OTH stratum. The inclusion/ exclusion criteria and eribulin dose regimen are in line with that of the pivotal study 309.

Primary endpoint was PFR12wks and secondary endpoints were PFS, OS, ORR, DCR, CBR and dSDR.

The primary endpoint showed progression-free survival at Week 12 in 60 % of the patients (95% CI: 42.1, 76.1) in the ADI/ LMS stratum and 31 % (95% CI: 11.0, 58.7) in the OTH stratum.

The median PFS time was 5.5 months (95% CI: 2.79, 8.18) in the ADI/LMS stratum and 2 months (95% CI: 1.22, 4.07) in the OTH stratum.

The median OS was 17 months (95% CI: 11.01, 20.47) in the ADI/LMS stratum and about 8 months (95% CI: 3.84, 16.13) in the OTH stratum.

There were no complete or partial responses observed. DCR was 80 % and 50 %, CBR was 74 % and 50 % and dSDR was 74 % and 50 % for ADI/ LMS and OTH strata respectively.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The MAH is applying for an extension of the indication for eribulin in the treatment of patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS).

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The application formally rests on the pivotal 309 study, a randomized, open-label, multi-centre, Phase III study comparing the efficacy and safety of eribulin to that of dacarbazine in patients previously treated for locally advanced and/or metastatic tumours of either the adipocytic subtype (liposarcoma [ADI]) or of smooth muscle origin (leiomyosarcoma [LMS]).

The inclusion- and exclusion criteria are considered adequately reflecting the target population for the proposed indication in terms of ADI and LMS subtypes. However, although STS may also occur in the paediatric population, it is noted that only patients aged ≥ 18 years were eligible for inclusion in the pivotal study. The safety and efficacy of Halaven in children from birth to 18 years of age have not yet been established in soft tissue sarcoma and the indication in the SmPC now refers to 'adults'.

In Q2 2015 the MAH informed the regulatory authorities of so-called 'dry runs' where interim results from study 309 were used for these dry runs. This became clear once the final analysis was conducted, as the final KM curves and those from the dry runs were almost identical. The primary endpoint of the study is OS and it is considered robust and not easily manipulated.  Thus, even though interim results were unintentionally exposed there is no evidence of any bias of the primary analysis of study 309.

The protocol was amended twice and it is considered unlikely that the amendments and protocol violations have a relevant impact on the integrity of the study.

The study enrolled 452 patients randomised in a 1:1 design (n=228 in the eribulin arm; n=224 in the dacarbazine arm) and stratified by histology (ADI or LMS), region (Region 1: USA and Canada; or Region 2: Western Europe, Australia and Israel; or Region 3: Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia), and number of prior regimens for advanced STS (2 or &gt;2 prior regimens).

Median time from diagnosis is about 3 years which is a common feature observed in the target population. The vast majority had non-lymph nodes as target lesions which is not unexpected since STS most commonly metastasize to the lungs and to a lesser extent to the lymph nodes.

Some imbalances in terms of baseline disease characteristics ('time between the original histological diagnosis and randomisation' and 'non-target lesions at baseline') were noted. This has been adequately clarified during the procedure and there is no reason to assume that these imbalances could have an effect on OS and PFS.

The eribulin dose regimen (1.4 mg/m 2  IV on Days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle) was established in the E7389-G000-305 study (EMBRACE) performed in metastatic breast cancer and is considered justified. It is to be noted that the dose of 1.4 mg/m 2 refers to the salt form (eribulin mesilate) which is equivalent to 1.23 mg/m 2  of the base of the active substance (eribulin).  This has been adequately highlighted in the Halaven SmPC section 4.2.

Dacarbazine as the comparator is considered acceptable. In 2010 the MAH applied for a scientific advice on the clinical development plan for eribulin in STS and the design of the future Phase III study 309 including the use of dacarbazine as the comparator. Either1200 mg/m 2 , 1000 mg/m 2 , or 850 mg/m 2  as starting dose could be chosen at the discretion of the investigator. The selection of the starting dose for each patient had to be confirmed prior to randomization.

Although a blinded study would have been preferred, feasibility issues, such as differences in tolerability between treatment arms could be foreseen and therefore the open-label design is acceptable.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Demographic and baseline characteristics are reasonably well balanced between the treatment arms. It is recognised that the study enrolled heavily pre-treated patients. It is noted that while STS in general show a slight predominance in the male gender, in this study the majority were female patients (67 %). This is likely due to a higher than expected proportion of patients with uterine LMS enrolled (about 30 % of the LMS stratum).

Median age at study entry was 56 years which reflects the clinical target population. About 21% of subjects were aged ≥65 years. Close to 50 % were recruited from Region 2 (Western Europe, Australia and Israel).

Approximately 1/3 of the overall population were patients with ADI and 2/3 were LMS with similar distribution between the two arms.

AEs as reasons for treatment discontinuations were low with approx. 6 % in the erbulin arm and 4.5 % in the DTIC arm. Withdrawal of consent was likewise low with about 1 % and 2 % respectively. About 10 % discontinued due to clinical progression which was similar in both arms.

In conclusion, there are no major concerns identified with respect to the conduct of the pivotal study. The population studied is considered representative for the target population in terms of ADI and LMS.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The primary endpoint of the pivotal study was OS. The study met its primary objective with an estimated reduction of death of 23 % in the experimental arm (HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.618, 0.954]; p=0.0169) with an improved benefit favouring eribulin of a median of 2 months (13.5 months and 11.5 months respectively). The magnitude of the statistical significance with a p-value of about 0.017 is not considered overwhelming but is still within the boundaries of statistical significance.

No differences between the two arms were observed with respect to the secondary endpoints (PFS, PFR12wks and CBR). In terms of PFS no difference in medians between the arms was observed with 2.6 months (HR=0.877 [95% CI 0.710, 1.085]; P=0.2287) however the HR of 0.88 may be indicative of an improved treatment effect for eribulin as compared to dacarbazine.

The PFR12wks was 33 % (95% CI 27.2, 39.9) in the eribulin arm and about 29 % (95% CI 22.8, 35.0) in the control arm (p = 0.253).  The CBR was 46 % (95% CI 39.5, 52.8) in the eribulin arm and 48 % (95% CI 41.1, 54.5) in the dacarbazine arm (p=0.741).

ORR was performed as an exploratory analysis. No significant differences between the two arms for either ORR, DCR or dSD rate could be observed.

There is no overall consistency in regard to HR in the subgroups analyses for either OS or PFS. In particular, the apparent discrepancy with respect to histology stands out indicating a differential benefit.

In addition to the pre-planned efficacy analysis of OS and PFS by histological subtypes, the MAH has provided as requested, post hoc analyses in terms of baseline and outcome data separately for the two histology subtypes including data on the subtypes of ADI enrolled in the study i.e. dedifferentiated, myxoid/round cell and pleomorphic liposarcoma. The OS benefit for eribulin over dacarbazine appears entirely driven by the patients with the ADI subtype (HR 0.51 (95% CI 0.346, 0.753), P=0.0006) with a median OS of about 16 months for the eribulin arm compared with approximately 8 months for the dacarbazine arm. In addition, a benefit in PFS can be observed with a median PFS of 2.9 months vs. 1.7 months in the eribulin and dacarbazine arm, respectively, with a HR of 0.52 (95% CI 0.346; 0.784, P=0.0015).

As emphasised by the MAH, the different subtypes of ADI (dedifferentiated, myxoid/round cell, pleomorphic) may be viewed as biologically different, but the small sample size and absence of preformed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hypotheses make further analyses less than meaningful. Thus it is accepted that activity has been shown irrespective of the different subtypes of ADI.  On the other hand, a benefit is not shown in the LMS population as no difference at all between the two treatment arms is observed. The HR is 0.93 (95% CI 0.714, 1.203; P=0.57) for OS with a median of about 13 months in both arms. For PFS the HR is 1.07 (95% CI 0.835, 1.375; P=0.585) with a similar median of about 2.5 months.

The MAH has been unable to provide evidence that dacarbazine is meaningfully active in LMS. If this actually were the case, i.e. that similarity in PFS (HR 1.07) reflected a meaningful delay in progression for both study arms vs. a virtual placebo, then it would be expected that post progression survival would be prolonged in the eribulin arm, analogues to findings in breast cancer and ADI. This is not the case, however. Therefore the most reasonable interpretation is that neither dacarbazine nor eribulin is meaningfully active in LMS.

The apparent difference, especially in PFS between uterine and non-uterine sarcoma is noticed. This is an unexpected finding from a tumour biology perspective as currently described and from the perspective of 'non-activity' of dacarbazine and eribulin is rather interpreted as reflecting differences in baseline prognostic factors.

There seemed to be an interaction between ECOG PS 0 and 1 with patients with performance status &gt;0 having little effect of eribulin. The requested exploratory analysis shows that the interaction seems to be driven by patients with LMS and ECOG 1. Although it is recognised that patients were not stratified by ECOG score, nevertheless this analysis seems to add more evidence to the fact that the effect of eribulin in the LMS population is limited.

The overall number of events in the study at the time of the analysis (data cut-off date 02 January 2015) was about 79 % for OS and 85 % for PFS. A satisfactory level of data maturity is considered reached.

It is concluded that in isolation the two exploratory studies (207 and 217) cannot be claimed as supportive. To this effect, contextualisation of the primary endpoint PFR12weeks was warranted. PFR12wks for ADI and LMS was compared with corresponding data in study 309. For eribulin it is agreed that there is consistency shown for the respective histology subgroups between study 309 and study 207 with 41 % and 47 % for ADI vs. 30 % and 32 % for LMS in the respective studies. An overall higher PFS12weeks was observed in the 217 study but with similar discrepancy pattern between the two histology subgroups as observed in the 309 and 207 studies.

For dacarbazine PFR12wks for ADI and LMS in study 309 was to be compared with corresponding data from other dacarbazine studies, e.g. using the EORTC data base.  The study by García-del-Muro, et al. (2011) compared gemcitabine plus dacarbazine with dacarbazine alone in 113 patients with previously treated STS (mixed). The PFR at 3 months was 56% (95% CI: 43% to 69%) for gemcitabine plus dacarbazine versus 37% (95% CI: 23.5% to 50%) for dacarbazine alone (P=0.001). The study by Demetri G, et al., (2015) compared trabectedin with dacarbazine in 518 patients with metastatic ADI or LMS. The PFR at 3 months was 34% for patients on the dacarbazine arm.

It is noted that the PFS12weeks for dacarbazine in the two publications is similar to the results obtained for eribulin in LMS in the 309 study. In terms of PFS12weeks, the findings are consistent with the primary analysis i.e. no superior efficacy obtained for eribulin in regard to LMS as compared to dacarbazine.

The initially proposed indication encompassed STS not subtype specified. As no benefit has been demonstrated in LMS the indication has been revised to only include adult patients with unresectable liposarcoma. Moreover, 'prior systemic therapy' has been revised to reflect that standard chemotherapy is based on anthracyclines as the 1st line treatment.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

A benefit of eribulin over dacarbazine has been shown exclusively in the ADI population and as such the indication has been restricted to the adult patient population with unresectable liposarcoma. The magnitude of the benefit is of definite high clinical relevance in this STS subtype and would meet an unmet medical need.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

## Existing safety profile

The current knowledge of the safety profile is based primarily on studies in breast cancer. In this setting, the major undesirable effects related to Halaven include, as per SmPC, bone marrow suppression including neutropenia (57%; grade 3/4: 50%) with associated infections (e.g. sepsis 0.5%); anaemia (21%) and thrombocytopenia (5%). New onset or worsening of pre-existing peripheral neuropathy (36%; grade 3/4: 8%). Gastrointestinal toxicities are common, including nausea (34%), vomiting (18%), diarrhoea (18%), constipation (20%), and stomatitis. Other significant adverse drug reactions (ADRs) include fatigue (48%; grade 3/4: 8%), alopecia, increased liver enzymes, pyrexia (20%), bone pain (10%) and musculoskeletal pain.

## Safety analysis populations

The data to support the safety of eribulin in the soft tissue sarcoma (STS) indication are based on data from 404 subjects in 1 pivotal phase III trial and 2 phase II trials, supported by data from 1559 subjects in one of eight completed trials in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) as follows:

| Population   |
|--------------|

a: Subjects who received 28-day cycles of eribulin in Study 201 have been excluded from the analysis.

b: The six subjects who continued to receive eribulin in extension Study 224 after receiving eribulin in Study 221 are included in the total of 81 treated subjects for Study 221. Data from Study 221 were pooled with the data from Study 224, once all enrolled subjects had discontinued treatment in Study 224.

The safety data in this review are based on a data cut-off date for Study 309 of 02 January 2015, a data cut-off date for Study 217 of 14 November 2014 and a data cut-off date for Study 207 of 12 June 2012.

All MBC trials except Study 206 have been previously submitted and assessed.

In all studies submitted as part of this variation application, the labelled standard dose of eribulin was used, i.e. 1.4 mg/m 2 (equivalent to 1.23 mg/m 2  in the EU SmPC) on Day 1 and 8 in a 21-day cycle.

Dose reduction (applicable to eribulin): eribulin dose was reduced to 1.1 mg/m or 0.7 mg/m².

Max = maximum, MBC = metastatic breast cancer, Min = minimum, STS = soft tissue sarcoma.

a The STS Population includes all subjects treated with eribulin in sarcoma shudies 207, 217, and 309.

b The MBC Population includes all subjects treated with eribulin monotherapy in 21-day cycles in breast cancer studies 201, 206, 209, 211, 221, 224, 301, and 305.

C The Eribulin Integrated Safety Population includes all subjects in the STS and MBC Populatious

d Cumulative dose (mg/m') = the sum of doses received (mg/m) during the entire study

e Actual dose intensity (mg/m²/week) = Cumulative dose (mg/m) / Duation of exposure (week)

f Relative dose intensity = Actual dose intensity (mg/m/week) / Planned dose intensity (mg/m/week), where plammed dose intensity is 1.4 mg/m² x 2/3 for subjects receiving eribulin mesilate and 850 (or 1000, 1200) mg/m' x 1/3 for subjects receiving dacarbazine.

名 58 of 59 subjects had dose reductions due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). See Table 15

A subject with two or more TEAEs in the category of one row is counted once in that row.

Study 207 did not assess action taken with respect to the study drug through the adverse event CRF data, and is therefore not reflected in the rows for \"study drug action taken\" and \"study drug withdrawn\" for its incidence of this nature.

Adverse event terms are coded using MedDRA version 17.1.

CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, MBC = metastatic breast cancer, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, STS = soft tissue sarcoma, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event.

a The STS includes all subjects treated with eribulin in sarcoma studies 207, 217, and 309.

b The MBC Population includes all subjects treated with eribulin monotherapy in 21-day cycles in breast cancer studies 201, 206, 209, 211, 221, 224, 301, and 305.

c The Eribulin Integrated Safety Population includes all subjects in the STS and MBC Populations

d Relationship to treatment as determined by the Investigator

e A subject with both non-fatal and fatal SAEs is counted in both the non-fatal SAEs row and the fatal SAEs row f Drug withdrawn, dose reduction, or drug interruption

g These TEAEs are reported as Sponsor Derived Query (SDQ) terms; details of groupings were provided. Alopecia and neutropenia are reported as a single terms.

## STS vs. MBC

Compared with the MBC population some differences in the overall patter of treatment-emergent adverse events TEAEs are noted. Severe TEAEs (≥CTCAE toxicity grade 3) were a few percent lower, while nonfatal SAEs were around 10% higher in the STS population, as well as in the pivotal study, compared with the MBC population. (Fatal SAEs were similar around 4%.) TEAEs leading to dose reduction, interruption or withdrawal were considerable higher in the pivotal phase III trial (47%), but only slightly higher in the full STS population (31%) compared with the MBC (27%). Withdrawals due to TEAEs were numerically lower, however; thus, the differences in the former figures reflect differences in dose adjustments.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With regard to TEAEs of special interest, most showed lower frequencies in the pivotal study (and full STS population) compared with the MBC population (potentially related to observation time, as noted above). Asthenia/fatigue was considerably more frequent in the STS studies however (61-63% vs. 51% in MBC).

## Eribulin vs. dacarbazine

In Study 309, the proportion of patients with TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) were similar across arms (numerically around 2% higher in the eribulin arm for each item). Severe TEAEs were more frequent in the eribulin arm (67 vs. 56%). Fatal SAEs were more frequent in the eribulin arm (4.4 vs. 1.3%; n= 10 vs. 3). Dose adjustments and withdrawals due to TEAEs were more frequent in the eribulin arm. It is noted that the frequencies of dose adjustments and withdrawals due to TEAEs were higher in both study arms compared with the eribulin-treated MBC population.

For TEAEs of special interest, see further below. No new safety concern is raised.

The well-known major side effects of eribulin were seen as anticipated, e.g. neutropenia and related infections, peripheral neuropathy, fatigue and asthenia, nausea and vomiting, musculo-/skeletal pain, pyrexia, and alopecia.

It is noted that for some AEs related to tolerability, the frequencies were similar across study arms. These include fatigue/asthenia, musculo-/skeletal pain, anaemia and diarrhoea. With regard to nausea and vomiting the dacarbazine arm had higher frequencies. Other ADRs that are likely to affect the B/R balance and that occurred in higher frequency in the eribulin arm include peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, infections and stomatitis . Alopecia may also be of some importance.

## STS vs. MBC

Some TEAEs in the eribulin arm of Study 309 were less frequent compared with the MBC population, which may reflect the shorter observation time in the STS setting, differences in the underlying disease, or other differences in the study settings, including investigator's perception of the drug and the disease.

Some TEAEs were relevantly more frequent in the STS pivotal study compared with the MBC population. These include pyrexia, stomatitis, fatigue and asthenia, and anaemia. For all except anaemia, the frequencies were similar (or higher) in the full STS population including the Phase II studies, indicating that there may be a relevant difference in the safety profile in the STS indication for these AEs.

## Treatment-related TEAEs

The direction of observed differences and the similarities for TEAEs across arms in study 309 noted above were consistent for the treatment-related TEAEs, although these were reported at lower absolute frequencies.

If a subject had two or more treatment-emergent adverse events in the same system organ class (or with the same preferred term) with different CTCAE grades, then the event with the highest grade was used for that subject. System organ classes are presented in descending frequency.

Adverse event terms are coded using MedDRA version 17.1.

CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, MBC = metastatic breast cancer, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, STS = soft tissue sarcoma, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event.

The STS Population includes all subjects treated with eribulin in sarcoma studies 207, 217, and 309

The MBC Population includes all subjects treated with eribulin monotherapy in 21-day cycles in breast cancer studies 201, 206, 209, 211, 221, 224, 301, and 305.

The Eribulin Integrated Safety Population includes all subjects in the STS and MBC

*: selected by assessor based on interest for the assessment.

The proportion of subjects with any toxicity grade 3 or higher was approximately 10% higher in the eribulin arm compared with the dacarbazine arm of Study 309. This corresponds to the approximately 10% higher frequency of haematological grade 3 events in the eribulin arm. Infections grade ≥ 3 are approximately twice as common in the eribulin compared with the dacarbazine arm (10 vs. 5%).

Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy (including sensory, motor, and paraesthesia) was more frequent in the eribulin arm (3.1%) compared with the dacarbazine arm (0.4%).

Grade ≥ 3 fatigue/asthenia was similar across arms (approximately 5%), just as the overall frequency was similar. For pyrexia a large difference in overall frequency across study arms was observed (28 vs 14%), but similar grade ≥ 3 frequencies (&lt;1%).

For the respiratory conditions SOC, grade ≥ 3 events would be of similar frequencies if pulmonary embolism was referred to the Vascular disorders SOC (where deep vein thrombosis is the major event), which would then in turn also have similar grade ≥ 3 frequencies. Thus, no real difference of importance across arms appears to be present.

Grade ≥ 3 musculoskeletal pain, including back and bone pain, was reported somewhat more frequently in the dacarbazine arm.

In conclusion, with regard to severe TEAEs (toxicity grade ≥ 3), relevantly higher frequencies were seen in the eribulin compared with the dacarbazine arm of Study 309 for neutropenia, infections, and peripheral neuropathy. Severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia were relevantly higher in the dacarbazine arm. In other parts grade ≥ 3 toxicities were comparable across arms.

A subject with two or more TEAEs in the same system organ class is counted once for that system organ class. System organ classes are presented in descending frequency. Relationship to treatment was assessed by the Investigator.

TEAEs include AEs that were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study drug and AEs with missing relationship to study drug Adverse event temms are coded using MedDRA version 17.1.

AE = adverse event, MBC = metastatic breast cancer,MedDRA =Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, SAE = serious adverse event, STS = soft tissue sarcoma, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event.

The STS includes all subjects treated with enibulin in sarcoma studies 207, 217, and 309.

b The MBC Population includes all subjects treated with enbulin monotherapy in 21-day cycles in breast cancer studies 201, 206, 209, 211, 221, 224, 301, and 305.

C TheEnibulinIntegrated SafetyPopulation includes all subjects in the STSand MBC Populations

The overall incidence of non-fatal serious adverse events (SAEs) was similar across arms in Study 309, 32.7 vs. 31.3%. Similar frequencies were also seen for SAEs considered by investigators to be treatment related, 13.7 vs. 13.8%.

SAE differences of relevance across arms were confined to the Blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC, and to the TEAE pyrexia.

Neutropenia was the most common SAE in the eribulin arm at 4.9%, compared with 4.5% (1 patient less) in the dacarbazine arm; i.e. the frequency was similar. Other SAEs in this SOC were more common in the dacarbazine-treated patients. Thus, thrombocytopenia was the most common SAE in the dacarbazine arm at 5.8%, compared with 0% in the eribulin arm. Similarly, pancytopenia was a SAE in 3 patients (1.3%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in the dacarbazine arm vs. none in the eribulin arm. Overall, dacarbazine had more SAEs in the Blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC than eribulin (11.6 vs. 7.5%).

Pyrexia was more common as an SAE in the eribulin compared with the dacarbazine arm, 4.4 vs. 1.8%.

Pulmonary embolism + deep vein thrombosis constituted SAEs in 6 patients (2.7%) in both arms.

## Deaths

Table 35: Listing of TEAEs Leading to Death (Sarcoma Population: Study 309, Study 217 and Study 207)

- d A TEAE ofrespiratory failure was reported for Subject 2204101l; however, the cause of death was given as disease progression. This subject was excluded from the listing of deaths in theStudy 309 CSR.

<!-- image -->

Most of the fatal TEAEs listed above were deemed by the MAH to be due to disease progression.

In 2 cases, the Investigator and MAH opinion differed regarding relatedness to study drug: a fatal TEAE of septic shock in Study 309 was considered to be unrelated to eribulin by the Investigator, although the MAH considers the event was possibly related to eribulin; and for the fatal TEAE of cerebrovascular ischemia in Study 207, the Investigator considered the event to be possibly related to eribulin, but the MAH considers the event more likely to be related to the subject's past medical history. This included arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, coronary bypass, congestive heart failure, and a history of treatment with oral anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, hypolipidemic agents, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, and other supportive medication.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the reviewed deaths in the STS population, 2 cases of fatal neutropenic sepsis and septic shock, respectively, were considered related to the eribulin treatment. In the dacarbazine arm all three deaths were due to progressive disease.

## Adverse events of special interest

The MAH has selected the following 'adverse events of special interest' (AESI):

Peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, arthralgia/myalgia, asthenia/fatigue, and alopecia. Most are addressed in prior sections of this assessment report. For neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, please see under Laboratory findings below.

- a The STS Population includes all subjects treated with eribulin in sarcoma studies 207, 217, and 309.
- b The MBC Population includes all subjects treated with eribulin monotherapy in 21-day cycles in breast cancer studies 201, 206, 209, 211, 221, 224, 301, and 305.
- C The Enibulin Integrated Safety Population inchudes all subjects in the STS and MBC Populations.
- d Time to onset of PN (weeks) = (start date of first PN -- date of first dose + 1)/7. Subjects without PN were censored at the last safety assessment. Time to onset of PN and cumulative PN rate were estimated by the product limit method.
- e A subject is couuted as having resolution if all ongoing PN events had resolution.

In the 1559 breast cancer patients the most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of treatment with eribulin was peripheral neuropathy (3.4%).  The median time to Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy was 12.6 weeks (post 4 cycles). Out of the 404 sarcoma patients, 2 patients discontinued treatment with eribulin due to peripheral neuropathy. The median time to Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy was 18.4 weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Development of Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 7.4% of breast cancer patients and 3.5% of sarcoma patients. In clinical trials, patients with pre-existing neuropathy were as likely to develop new or worsening symptoms as those who entered the study without the condition.

In breast cancer patients with pre-existing Grade 1 or 2 peripheral neuropathy the frequency of treatment-emergent Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was 14%.

No fatal events (Grade 5 severity) were reported in any population and there were no events of Grade 4 severity in the STS population.

The frequency of PN events was similar in the STS and MBC populations (approximately 40%).

Of the 166 patients (41%) of the STS population (n=404) who experienced a PN event, 116 (28% of all patients, 70% of those with PN) had PN ongoing at last treatment. For 26 patients (22% of those with PN) PN resolved within 60 days post treatment; for 47(41% of those with PN) PN was unresolved at 60 days post treatment, and for the remainder, 37 patients (37% of those with PN), resolution was unknown due to start of new therapy.

At an updated analysis in the STS population 180 days after the last treatment 28% (32/166) of eribulin PN events had resolved compared with 22% (26/166) at 60 days after last treatment, indicating further resolution.

## Pyrexia

A large difference in overall frequency of pyrexia across arms in Study 309 was observed (28 vs 14%), but the grade ≥ 3 frequencies were similar (&lt;1%). The incidence was highest (14-12%) in the first two cycles, following which the incidence decreased substantially. Median duration of pyrexia was 2 days and events were of low grade in most cases (only 1% were grade ≥3).

| Neutropenia (any PT)         |
|------------------------------|
| Febrile neutropenia (any PT) |

Low neutrophils and leukocytes were less frequently observed in the STS compared with the MBC setting, likely at least partly related to the shorter duration of treatment, based on the similar rates of neutropenia in time-adjusted analyses. The use of immunostimulants (such as filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) was similar in the arms of Study 309 and the STS population: 26.1% of subjects in the eribulin arm of Study 309, 25.4% in the dacarbazine arm of Study 309 and 23.8% in the STS population.

- d The Eribulin Integrated Safety Population includes all subjects in the SIS and MBC Populations

In Study 309, markedly-abnormally low calcium, phosphorous, and potassium occurred more frequently in the eribulin group (2.3%, 3.6%, and 8.0%, respectively), compared with the dacarbazine group (0.4%, 1.8%, and 2.7%, respectively). Markedly-abnormally high glucose, AST and bilirubin was also more common the in eribulin group (3.8%, 1.8 and 1.8%, respectively) compared with the dacarbazine group (1.0%, 0.9 and 0.5%, respectively).

Markedly-abnormally low phosphorous was also reported more commonly in the STS population (8.2%), compared with the MBC population (4.2%). Markedly-abnormally low calcium, was reported less commonly in the STS population (0.5%), compared with the MBC population (1.6%). Other clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test values occurred at a similar frequency in both the STS and MBC populations.

## Hy's law

The integrated laboratory data were assessed for evidence of drug-induced liver injury. A total of 41 subjects had total bilirubin concentrations that were ≥1.5 x ULN with either concurrent AST and/or ALT ≥ 3 x ULN at least once during the study. The data showed that there were 9 subjects in the STS studies whose laboratory values met these limits. One of these subjects was in the dacarbazine arm of Study 309, and the remaining 8 subjects were treated with eribulin (4 subjects in Study 309, 3 subjects in Study 207 and 1 subject in Study 217). Metastatic disease was present in the liver for 7 of these 9 subjects, and 1 subject had hepatic necrosis (ischemic necrosis of the liver) at baseline; none of these subjects had increased total bilirubin concentrations or liver enzyme activities that were not reasonably explainable by their baseline liver conditions. No subjects in the STS population met the criteria for Hy's law (including criteria concerning cholestasis and alternative aetiologies).

The proportion of subjects in the STS population with elevated bilirubin (≥1.5 x ULN) concurrently with elevated AST and/or ALT (≥3 x ULN) was 8/404 subjects (2.0%); similar to that seen for the MBC population (36/1559 subjects [2.3%]).

## Vital signs

There was no apparent pattern of changes with time on treatment for vital sign parameters (e.g. blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate). Results were consistent with the known safety profile of eribulin and did not signal any new significant safety concerns.

## QTc prolongation

In Study 309, there were no changes of clinical importance in mean ECG parameters over time.

The incidence of QT prolongation TEAEs was calculated using the following Sponsor-derived query for QT prolongation: 'Broad and narrow SMQ terms for Torsade de pointes with the exception that 'Long QT syndrome congenital' was deleted. Also, broad and narrow SMQ terms for tachyarrhythmias (including supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmia).'

- The Enibulin Integrated Safety Population inchudes all subjects in the STS and MBC Populations

The 5 treatment-related TEAEs of Grade ≥3 severity in the STS population were all events of electrocardiogram QT prolonged which occurred in Study 309; all 5 events were of Grade 3 severity. The 3 treatment-related TEAEs of Grade ≥3 severity in the MBC population were: 1 event of sudden death (Grade 5), 1 event of electrocardiogram QT prolonged (Grade 3), and 1 event of syncope (Grade 3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An analysis using a narrower SDQ term for QT prolongation was provided in response to questions. This included the TEAEs coding to the SDQ Torsades de pointes/QT prolongation SMQ narrow with the deletion of 'Long QT syndrome congenital'. The only PT reported coding to this SDQ in the eribulin studies was 'Electrocardiogram QT prolonged'.

## Safety in special populations Intrinsic factors

## Age

In the 404 sarcoma patient population, 90 patients (22.3%) treated with eribulin were ≥65 years of age. Population PK analyses showed that there was no significant effect of age on eribulin PK. Eribulin exposure in elderly subjects was similar to that in younger subjects.

CICAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, MBC = metastatic breast cancer, STS = soft tissue sarcoma, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event.

- a The STS Population includes all subjects treated with eribulin in sarcoma studies 207, 217, and 309.
- b The MBC Population includes all subjects treated with enibulin monotherapy in 21-day cycles in breast cancer studies 201, 206, 209, 211, 221, 224, 301, and 305.

An increased incidence of neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased in Asian/Pacific Islander subjects is a known effect of eribulin; the increased incidence was also seen in the MBC population as well as in the STS population. This difference seems not to be a drug specific phenomenon, as several other publications (Gandara, et al., 2009; Hasegawa, et al., 2011) have discussed similar situations where the incidence of neutropenia in Asian subjects has been shown to be twice as high as in non-Asian subjects. Other than TEAEs of neutropenia, and laboratory abnormalities of neutrophil count decreased, there did not appear to be a consistent pattern of overall TEAE incidence with racial group, among eribulin-treated subjects in the STS and MBC populations. These results confirm the data seen in the breast cancer population, which indicate that, with the exception of neutropenia, race does not affect the way eribulin is tolerated.

A subject with two or more TEAEs in the category of one row is coumted once in that row.

A subject with both non-fatal and fatal SAEs is coumted in both the non-fatal SAEs row and the fatal SAEs row.

Adverse event terms are coded using MedDRA version 17.1.

CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities,

SAE = serious adverse event, STS = soft tissue sarcoma, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event.

- a The STS includes all subjects treated with enibulin in sarcoma studies 207, 217, and 309.

b Drug withdrawm, dose reduction, or drug intemuption.

Analyses by sex are confounded by indications (ADI/LMS) with different treatment effect and time on therapy. Thus, the eribulin-treated leiomyosarcoma subgroup of Study 309 consisted of 82% women, while the adipocytic subgroup was more balanced with 46% women. In addition, differences in baseline characteristics indicated slightly poorer prognosis in women compared with men (higher tumour grade, higher ECOG performance status, larger number of prior chemotherapy regimens). Together, these circumstances may provide explanations for the higher frequency of fatal AEs seen in women compared with men, which were mostly related to disease progression. The frequencies of treatmentrelated deaths (0.8 vs. 0.7%) were not unbalanced across sexes, however. The higher frequency of the cumulative toxicity peripheral neuropathy observed in men compared with women may be due to the imbalances in the histologic subgroups noted above. No important differences in safety profile across sexes are seen.

The safety profile of eribulin appears similar in the different histologic/anatomic subgroups; observed differences may be the result of differences in exposure and/or underlying disease.

Peripheral neuropathy and related PTs were more frequent in adipocytic compared with leiomyosarcoma, particularly with regard to events ≥ grade 3, which was approximately 6 vs. 2 % in both Study 309 and the full STS population. PFS data indicate that the time on eribulin was longer in the adipocytic compared with the leiomyosarcoma subgroup.

## Renal insufficiency

The eribulin sarcoma studies excluded subjects with severe renal impairment (e.g. included patients with serum creatinine ≤2.0 mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/minutes per the Cockcroft and Gault formula).

A study in renal impairment has been previously submitted and assessed within the Variation II/23 and findings were reflected in the SmPC. A large variability was found between patients and across renal impairment groups, why a recommendation regarding starting dose could not be made; instead increased monitoring is recommended for all patients with renal impairment.

## Neutropenia in relation to liver function

The overall cumulative incidence of neutropenia events, including laboratory abnormalities observed in the registration of laboratory parameters, was lower in the STS compared with the MBC, as previously noted, at least partially attributable to differences in treatment duration. Similar trends were seen in both disease settings for a small increase in neutropenia events in patients with grade 1 liver toxicity compared with patients with normal liver function. In the MBC population information from patients with grade ≥ 2 liver toxicity was also available, indicting a further small increase in the frequency of neutropenia events. Lower frequencies of neutropenia were seen in pivotal Study 309, with a similar trend in relation to liver toxicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Peripheral neuropathy in relation to liver function

The corresponding analysis was performed for peripheral neuropathy, where no trend of increased toxicity was seen for patients with grade 1 liver toxicity in study 309 or in the STS (n=40 and 72, respectively). In the MBC, as well as in the eribulin integrated safety population (STS+MBC), a clear trend of increased frequencies of peripheral neuropathy at grade ≥ 2 liver toxicity was seen, however. The approximate frequencies of peripheral neuropathy in both these populations were 40% for normal liver function, 4142% for grade 1 liver toxicity, and 51% for grade ≥ 2 liver toxicity.

Similar trends of increased toxicity overall depending on baseline bilirubin, ALT, or AST statuses, respectively, and for peripheral neuropathy depending on a combined liver function status, have been observed in previous Halaven submissions based on the MBC population (e.g. Variation II/11 for new indication, SCS Tables 34, 58-60) and discussed in ARs.

It has previously been established that hepatic impairment increases the exposure to eribulin, therefore these findings are expected. The increase in toxicity is overall rather limited. No new safety issue is raised.

## Extrinsic factors

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No AEs of drug interaction were reported in Study 309, Study 207 or Study 217.

## Sarcoma population (STS) adverse drug reactions

The table below is based on all adverse reactions observed for all 3 sarcoma studies and shows TEAEs by incidence rate (regardless of investigator assessment of relationship to eribulin treatment) and has been compiled according to the recommendations of CIOMS III - Core Clinical Safety Information.  Detailed analysis of the source tables, including analyses of individual TEAEs and review of individual TEAE reports where necessary, have been performed in compiling the table.  Events are included if the company believes there to be sufficient evidence of a relationship with eribulin mesilate; the table is thus a summary compiled using the frequencies of individual events and medical judgment in assessing the evidence for those less common individual events to be included.

A subject with two or more adverse events in the same system organ class (or with the same preferred term) is coumted only once for that system organ class (or prefenred term).

Adverse event tems are coded using MedDRA version 17.1.

Study 207 did not assess action taken with respect to shudy dnug through adverse events data. Study treatment discontinuation in Study 207 is only reported in Table 2 based on subject disposition data.

ALT = alamine transaminase, AST = aspartate transaminase, MBC = metastatic breast cancer, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, STS = soft tissue sarcoma, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event, WBC = white blood cell cout.

- a The STS Population includes all subjects treated with eribulin in sarcoma studies 207, 217, and 309.
- b The MBC Population includes all subjects treated with enibulin monotherapy in 21-day cycles in breast cancer studies 201, 206, 209, 211, 221, 224, 301, and 305.
- The Enibulin Integrated Safety Population includes all subjects in the STS and MBC Populations

With regard to TEAEs leading to drug action taken (dose reduction, dose interruption, or drug withdrawn), the Blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC was the most prominent with similar frequencies overall

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

across arms, but with emphasis on neutropenia in the eribulin arm and thrombocytopenia in the dacarbazine arm, in line with the safety profiles.

Peripheral neuropathy and pyrexia caused drug action to be taken in the eribulin arm (at 4.4 and 3.5%) but only in single patients in the dacarbazine arm, also in line with the known toxicity profiles.

While similar overall and grade ≥ 3 frequencies were observed for fatigue/asthenia across arms, these conditions lead to dose reduction/interruption/(withdrawal, see below) more often in the eribulin compared with the dacarbazine arm (4.4 vs 1.8%, n: 10 vs. 4).

ALT elevation, AST elevation, and hyperglycemia were each causes for dose reduction or interruption in three eribulin-treated patients (1.3%), but not for drug withdrawal apparently. No drug action was taken based on these events in the dacarbazine arm.

When only TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal were summarised it was noted that for neuropathy this was done in 2 vs. 1 patient in the eribulin vs. dacarbazine arm; fatigue lead to drug withdrawal in 2 vs 2 cases, asthenia 0 vs. 0, neutropenia 0 vs. 0, thrombocytopenia in 2 vs. 3, and infections (SOC) in 3 vs 0 patients. It is also noted that ECG QT prolongation was the cause for eribulin withdrawal in one patient in Study 309 (none in the dacarbazine arm).

The overall frequency of treatment discontinuation due to AE was higher in the eribulin arm compared with the dacarbazine arm (7.5 vs 4.9%).

## Supportive safety data

This study evaluated therapy with single-agent eribulin mesylate for first-line treatment in subjects with previously untreated locally recurrent or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.

Source: Tables 14.3.1.2.2, 14.3.1.2.6, and 14.3.1.2.10.

Serious AEs reported in more than one subject in Study 206 were febrile neutropenia (n=3; 5.4%), neutropenia (n=3; 5.4%), and pulmonary embolism (n=2; 3.6%). Two deaths occurred. Both deaths occurred more than 30 days after the subject received her last dose of eribulin mesylate. One was attributed to disease progression. The second subject died due to pericardial and pleural effusion, reported by the investigator to be not related to study drug. Although the death occurred more than 30 days after last dose of eribulin mesylate, the onset date of the event was during the study treatment period. There were no clinically relevant trends in group mean/median lab or vital sign values over time. No subject had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) score of Grade 3 or 4 during the study and one subject had a shift of two grades (Grade 0 to Grade 2) from Baseline to worst value during treatment. A total of 33 subjects had an abnormal ECG finding some time during treatment, which was clinically significant in 3 subjects. A total of 23 subjects had an abnormal ECG finding at the end of treatment, which was clinically significant in 1 subject. Two subjects had QT prolongation (one Grade 2, possibly related, study drug interrupted, recovered; one Grade 3, probably related, study drug discontinued, not recovered).

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

## Sarcoma

## STS vs MBC

The overall eribulin safety profile in the studied soft tissue sarcoma (STS) population was similar to that seen in the previously approved metastatic breast cancer (MBC) setting. No new safety concerns have been identified.

The mean and median duration of eribulin exposure are lower in the STS compared with the MBC population (median 12 vs. 16 weeks). Similarly, the cumulative eribulin dose is lower in the STS compared with the MBC population. This is most likely an effect of the efficacy in the respective indications. The absolute and relative dose intensity is slightly higher in the STS compared with the MBC population, indicating similar tolerability in the two indications. Dose reductions were slightly less frequent (25.7 vs. 30.5%), but could potentially be attributable to the shorter time on drug.

For many ADRs, the AE frequencies were numerically or significantly lower in the STS setting compared to the MBC setting. This could at least partly be explained by a shorter duration of exposure.

For a smaller number of ADRs, relevantly higher frequencies were seen in the STS compared with the MBC population. These include pyrexia (27 vs. 20%), stomatitis (17 vs 9%), and fatigue/asthenia (60 vs. 51%).

## Eribulin vs. dacarbazine

The duration of study drug exposure was numerically slightly longer in the eribulin arm compared with the dacarbazine comparator arm of the pivotal Study 309 (difference in means 3.7 weeks, difference in medians 1 week), likely reflecting the difference in efficacy. The relative dose intensity was numerically higher in the comparator arm, which could potentially reflect a difference in tolerability.

Notable differences across arms in pivotal Study 309 for eribulin vs. dacarbazine (underlined when higher) included: pyrexia, 28 vs. 14%; nausea + vomiting, 59 vs. 70%; stomatitis, 14 vs. 5%; neutropenia AEs, 44 vs. 24%; thrombocytopenia, 6 vs. 28%; peripheral neuropathy, 37 vs. 15%; headache, 18 vs. 9%; dysgeusia, 8 vs. 2%; alopecia, 35 vs. 3%; and Infections and infestations SOC, 43 vs. 28%.

With regard to severe TEAEs (toxicity grade ≥ 3), relevantly higher frequencies were seen in the eribulin compared with the dacarbazine arm of Study 309 for neutropenia, infections, and peripheral neuropathy. Severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia were relevantly higher in the dacarbazine arm. In other parts grade ≥ 3 toxicities were comparable across arms.

SAE frequencies were similar across arms of Study 309. Of the fatal AEs, 2 cases of fatal neutropenic sepsis and septic shock in the STS population were considered related to eribulin treatment following review of narratives; both occurred in the pivotal Study 309. In the dacarbazine arm, all deaths were due to disease progression.

The overall frequency of treatment discontinuation due to AEs was higher in the eribulin arm compared with the dacarbazine arm (7.5 vs 4.9%).Apart from infections as a group, no meaningful differences were found between arms at the individual PT/SOC levels with regard to TEAEs leading to drug discontinuation, however.

For some of the major ADRs of eribulin, the frequencies were similar in the dacarbazine arm, e.g. fatigue/asthenia, musculo-/skeletal pain, anaemia and diarrhoea.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ADRs with higher frequency in the eribulin arm that may have major impact on the B/R assessment include peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia and infections and stomatitis. Alopecia may also be of some importance.

## ADRs of specific interest

## Pyrexia

In eribulin-treated patients of Study 309, the median duration of pyrexia was 2 days and events were of low grade in most cases (only 1% was grade ≥3). Pyrexia is therefore not considered likely to affect tolerability to an important extent. It is noted that while a large difference in overall frequency of pyrexia across arms in Study 309 was observed (28 vs 14%), the grade ≥ 3 frequencies were similar (&lt;1%).

## Peripheral neuropathy

The median time to onset of peripheral neuropathy appears shorter in the STS compared with the MBC population, around 20 weeks vs. 28 weeks. The reason for this is not obvious considering the similar values observed for e.g. dose intensity and relative dose intensity across the two populations, and also that breast cancer patients to a greater extent have received prior neurotoxic therapy with taxanes. However it is acknowledged that the smaller sample size in the STS (n= 226) compared with the MBC (n=1559) population may affect the estimates.

The lower frequencies of grade ≥3 events in pivotal study 309 and the STS population generally compared with the MBC population may be due to the longer exposure time in the MBC and potentially also other differences between populations such as prior therapies.

Similar to the MBC population the information on resolution of peripheral neuropathy is limited and the possibility of late reversibility of PN is still largely unknown. As part of the eribulin EU RMP, the MAH is currently conducting a study (E7389-A001-303) in order to generate information on the frequency and time to resolution of eribulin-induced or aggravated PN. The results of this study will provide more accurate data on the outcome of eribulin-induced PN (see RMP).

## Neutropenia

Fatal cases of febrile neutropenia, neutropenic sepsis, sepsis and septic shock have been reported. Out of 1963 breast cancer and soft tissue sarcoma patients who received eribulin at the recommended dose in clinical trials there was one fatal event each of neutropenic sepsis (0.1%) and febrile neutropenia (0.1%). In addition there were 3 fatal events of sepsis (0.2%) and one of septic shock (0.1%).

Severe neutropenia may be managed by the use of G-CSF or equivalent at the physician's discretion in accordance with relevant guidelines. 18% and 13% of eribulin treated patients received G-CSF in the two phase 3 breast cancer studies (Studies 305 and 301, respectively). In the phase 3 sarcoma study (Study 309), 26% of the eribulin treated patients received G-CSF.

## QT prolongation

A relevantly higher incidence of QT prolongation was observed in both arms of Study 309, and in the STS, compared with the MBC population. There was no obvious explanation for this finding, as pre-treatment with (cardiotoxic) anthracycline was an inclusion criterion in the pivotal breast cancer studies 305 and 301, as well as in the sarcoma Study 309. It could be hypothesised that sarcoma patients might have received generally higher doses of anthracycline due to different treatment practices in the two indications, leading to larger variability in transduction in myocardia, but no data to substantiate that notion have been presented. As the frequency in the dacarbazine arm of Study 309 is similar to the frequency in the eribulin-treated overall STS population, no strong signal is considered received by the 1.7% difference between arms in Study 309, however.

To date, the QT prolonging potential of eribulin has not been definitively investigated, since a thorough QTc study could not be performed for this cytotoxic agent and the dedicated QT Study 110, which was an uncontrolled open-label ECG study in 26 patients, could not exclude an effect on QT. In addition, the NonClinical data available at market authorisation were non-informative due to poor tolerability in animals. The current SmPC text regarding QT prolongation refers to Study 110 and gives precautions for use.

## Electrolytes

Low potassium and low phosphorous was observed in higher frequency in the eribulin treated STSpopulation compared with the MBC population, as well as in eribulin-treated patients compared with dacarbazine-treated patients in the pivotal study. The causes for this are unknown.

## Liver function tests

Liver function tests abnormalities were generally (i.e. for ALT, AST ALP) less common in the STS setting compared with the MBC setting. Total bilirubin was slightly more frequent in Study 309 (1.8%, n= 4), but similar in the overall STS population (1%) compared with the MBC population (0.8%). Low albumin was seen more frequently in the STS population (2.2%) compared with 0.9% in the MBC, but also in the pivotal study.

Compared with the dacarbazine control arm, AST and bilirubin abnormalities were numerically higher, and ALT and ALP abnormalities numerically lower.

In conclusion, no important differences in liver function tests were observed for eribulin vs. dacarbazine in the STS setting. Compared with the MBC setting liver function tests abnormalities were generally less frequent (possibly due to shorter duration of exposure).

## Subgroups

The safety profile of eribulin appears similar in the different histologic/anatomic subgroups and observed differences may likely be the result of differences in exposure and/or underlying disease characteristics.

There were 151 male patients treated with eribulin in the STS studies, thus constituting 37% of the STS population and 8% of the combined STS+MBC population (Integrated safety population).

Analyses of AEs by sex are confounded by the indications, ADI and LMS, which had different proportions of men and women as well as different treatment effect and time on therapy. In addition, differences in baseline characteristics in the STS population indicated slightly poorer prognosis in women compared with men (higher tumour grade, higher ECOG performance status, larger number of prior chemotherapy regimens). When this is taken into account, no important differences in safety profile across sexes are seen.

In an analysis of patients divided by age &lt; 65 years vs. ≥ 65 years of age, only small differences (0.13%) were seen in the overall AE frequencies in the STS and the MBC populations. The only larger differences were seen in the STS population for fatal SAEs (n= 8/314; 2.5% vs. 6/90; 6.7%) and for TEAEs leading to study drug being withdrawn (n=13; 4.1% vs. n= 8; 8.9%). The numbers are small, however, and tolerability appears overall largely similar irrespective of age. On the basis of PK and safety data, no specific dose adjustments are recommended based on the age of the subject.

As 18% (n=283/1559) of the patients in the MBC population and 22% (n=90/404) in the STS population were aged ≥ 65 years, 'elderly' has now been removed as missing information in the RMP.

## Study 206

The breast cancer study 206, evaluating eribulin as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer, was not previously submitted and was therefore assessed in this procedure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

An unusually high incidence of treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy (61%) in Study 206 compared with the overall MBC population (41%) was noted. The relatively small increases in duration of exposure in Study 206 (median 137 days; 7 cycles) compared with studies 301 (125 days; 6 cycles) and 305 (118 days; 5 cycles) might provide an explanation. The considerably higher frequency of peripheral neuropathy in Study 206 could also, at least in part, be a chance finding due to the relatively small sample size (n= 56).

## Drug-drug interactions

No AEs of drug interaction were reported in Study 309, Study 207 or Study 217. Nonclinical in vitro studies indicate CYP3A4 as the major pathway for eribulin mesilate metabolism, and a low potential for clinical drug-drug interactions caused by eribulin mesilate via inhibition or induction.

Until further data are available, concomitant medications that are metabolized through liver CYP3A4 pathways that have a narrow therapeutic window should be used with caution with eribulin mesilate. In addition, drugs (including herbal supplements or grapefruit juice) that demonstrate potent CYP3A4 inhibition or CYP3A4 induction should be administered with caution, at a low dose whenever possible.

## SmPC

The new table of ADRs in the SmPC, section 4.8 is based on the combined STS and MBC populations. For some ADRs the frequencies have therefore decreased. As the STS comprises only 21% of the total safety population, the decreases are small, however. Important differences across therapeutic settings are adequately reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

No new safety concerns were identified for eribulin in the STS setting compared with the previously approved MBC setting. Eribulin ADRs of importance to the B/R assessment include peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia and infections, stomatitis and alopecia. For some major ADRs of eribulin, the frequencies were similar in the dacarbazine arm of Study 309, e.g. fatigue/asthenia, musculo-/skeletal pain, anaemia and diarrhoea. The dacarbazine arm had more nausea and vomiting and thrombocytopenia.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

Please could you send an updated version of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed with the CHMP at the time of the Opinion, to h-eurmpevinterface@emea.europa.eu within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable as the changes to the leaflet were considered minimal.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The application formally rests on the pivotal 309 study: a randomized (1:1), open-label, multi-centre, Phase III study comparing eribulin (n=228) to dacarbazine (n=224) in patients previously treated for locally advanced and/or metastatic tumours of either the adipocytic subtype (liposarcoma [ADI]) or of smooth muscle origin (leiomyosarcoma [LMS]). The primary endpoint was OS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The study met its primary objective with an estimated reduction of death of 23 % in favour of eribulin to that of the control (HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.618, 0.954]; p=0.017) with a median gain of 2 months (13.5 months and 11.5 months respectively).

As the subgroup analyses for OS and PFS clearly indicated a differential benefit between the ADI and LMS (ADI [OS HR 0.51; PFS HR 0.52] vs. LMS [OS HR 0.9; PFS HR 1.1]), separate baseline and outcome data for the two subtypes including subgroup analyses were requested:

## Adipocytic sarcoma (ADI)

It is concluded that the OS benefit for eribulin over dacarbazine is entirely driven by the patients with the ADI subtype (HR 0.51 (95% CI 0.346, 0.753), P=0.0006) with a median OS of about 16 months for the eribulin arm compared with approximately 8 months for the dacarbazine arm. In addition, a benefit in PFS for this subtype can be observed (median 2.9 months vs. 1.7 months in the dacarbazine arm with a HR of 0.52 (95% CI 0.346; 0.784, P=0.0015).

The different subtypes of ADI (dedifferentiated, mixed/round cell or pleomorphic) may be viewed as biologically different but the small sample size and absence of preformed hypotheses make further analyses less than meaningful. Thus it is accepted that activity has been shown irrespective of ADI subtype.

## Leiomyosarcoma (LMS)

Evidence of a benefit of eribulin over dacarbazine has not been shown in the LMS population. No difference at all between the two treatment arms is observed. The HR is 0.93 (95% CI 0.714, 1.203; P=0.57) for OS with a median of about 13 months in both arms. For PFS the HR is 1.07 (95% CI 0.835, 1.375; P=0.585) with a similar median of about 2.5 months.

The apparent difference, especially in PFS between uterine and non-uterine sarcoma is noticed. This is an unexpected finding from a tumour biology perspective as currently described and from the perspective of 'non-activity' of dacarbazine and eribulin is rather interpreted as reflecting differences in baseline prognostic factors.

The MAH has been unable to provide evidence that dacarbazine is meaningfully active in LMS. If this actually was the case, i.e. that similarity in PFS (HR 1.07) reflected a meaningful delay in progression for both study arms vs. a virtual placebo, then it would be expected that post progression survival would be prolonged in the eribulin arm, analogous to findings in breast cancer and ADI. This is however not the case. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that neither dacarbazine nor eribulin is meaningfully active in LMS.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

In the overall population there is a lack of substantial support of a benefit of eribulin compared to dacarbazine in STS aside from the demonstrated OS gain. The mechanistic rationale to the differential benefit between ADI and LMS is lacking.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The eribulin safety profile in the studied soft tissue sarcoma (STS) population (Studies 309, 217 and 207) was generally similar to that seen in the previously approved metastatic breast cancer (MBC) setting. No new safety concerns were identified.

For many ADRs, the AE frequencies were numerically or significantly lower in the STS setting compared to the MBC setting. This could at least partly be explained by a shorter duration of exposure. For a smaller

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

number of ADRs, relevantly higher frequencies were seen in the STS compared with the MBC population. These include pyrexia (27 vs. 20%), stomatitis (17 vs 9%), and fatigue/asthenia (60 vs. 51%).

Notable differences across arms in pivotal Study 309 for eribulin vs. dacarbazine included: pyrexia, 28 vs. 14%; nausea + vomiting, 59 vs. 70%; stomatitis, 14 vs. 5%; neutropenia, 44 vs. 24%; neutropenia including laboratory abnormalities, 70 vs 43%; thrombocytopenia, 6 vs. 28%; peripheral neuropathy, 37 vs. 15%; headache, 18 vs. 9%; dysgeusia, 8 vs. 2%; alopecia, 35 vs. 3%; and Infections and infestations SOC, 43 vs. 28%.

For some ADRs related to tolerability the AE frequencies were similar across study arms. These include fatigue/asthenia (65 vs. 61%), musculo-/skeletal pain (46 vs. 40%), anaemia (30 vs. 31%) and diarrhoea (17 vs 16%).

The incidence of pyrexia in eribulin-treated patients in Study309 was highest (14-12%) in the first two cycles, following which the incidence decreased substantially. Median duration was 2 days and only 1% was grade ≥3, making these events less likely to affect the overall tolerability.

With regard to severe TEAEs (toxicity grade ≥ 3), relevantly higher frequencies were seen in the eribulin compared with the dacarbazine arm of Study 309 for neutropenia, infections, and peripheral neuropathy. Severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia were relevantly higher in the dacarbazine arm. In other parts grade ≥ 3 toxicities were comparable across arms.

SAE frequencies were similar across arms of Study 309. There were 2 vs. 0 treatment-related deaths in the eribulin vs. dacarbazine arm. These were due to neutropenic sepsis and septic shock. Treatment discontinuation due to AEs was higher in the eribulin arm compared with the dacarbazine arm (7.5 vs 4.9%). However apart from infections as a group, no meaningful differences were found between arms at the individual PT/SOC levels with regard to TEAEs leading to drug discontinuation,.

The safety profile of eribulin appears similar in the different histologic and histologic-anatomic subgroups (ADI, LMS; Uterine LMS, Non-uterine LMS) and the observed differences across subgroups may be the result of differences in exposure and/or in the underlying disease.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

Currently the QT prolonging potential of eribulin is unknown, since no thorough QTc study has been performed and the Non-Clinical available data at market authorisation were non-informative due to poor tolerability in animals. The current SmPC text regarding QT prolongation refers to an uncontrolled openlabel ECG study in 26 patients and gives precautions for use.

Similar to the MBC population the information on resolution of peripheral neuropathy is limited and the possibility of late reversibility of peripheral neuropathy is still largely unknown. As part of the eribulin EU RMP, the MAH is currently conducting a study in order to generate information on the frequency and time to resolution of eribulin-induced or aggravated peripheral neuropathy.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

While a statistically significant benefit in OS in the overall population has been demonstrated in favour of eribulin vs. dacarbazine with a reduction of death of 23 %, it becomes clear based on subgroup analyses per histology subtype that the OS benefit for eribulin over dacarbazine is entirely driven by the patients with the ADI subtype with a reduction of death of about 50 % and approximately 8 months median gain.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Important ADRs of eribulin that had relevantly higher incidence in the eribulin compared with the dacarbazine arm of Study 309 included peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, infections, stomatitis and alopecia.

Neutropenia is routinely managed by oncologists and may as such be of less importance to the B/R balance, except in cases of hospitalisation due to e.g. febrile neutropenia. Infections related to neutropenia are of concern, however, and eribulin is associated with deaths due to infections in a few percent of patients; less than 1 percent in the present sarcoma setting. Peripheral neuropathy is debilitating and unpleasant (sometimes painful), and may affect patients' activities of daily living and quality of life. Stomatitis is a painful condition that affects the possibility to eat normal food and quality of life.

## Benefit-risk balance

A differential benefit between ADI and LMS was identified in the pre-planned subgroup analysis. In further requested analyses, a benefit in OS and PFS favouring eribulin over dacarbazine was convincingly shown in the ADI population and it is accepted that activity has been shown irrespective of ADI subtype (dedifferentiated, mixed/round cell or pleomorphic).

There is no evidence that eribulin has a superior efficacy over dacarbazine in the LMS population.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

Due to the overall rarity of STS and the heterogeneity within in terms of histology, the challenges in performing large randomised studies are recognised. Hence a regimen that can demonstrate an OS benefit would meet a high medical need.

Although the 309 study met its primary objective with an estimated reduction of death of 23 % in favour of eribulin in the overall population, the subgroup analysis identified a differential response between the two subtypes. A benefit of eribulin over dacarbazine has convincingly been demonstrated in the ADI subtype which is of high clinical relevance. This however, has not been shown in the LMS population. The MAH has been unable to provide evidence that dacarbazine is meaningfully active in LMS and therefore the most reasonable interpretation is that neither dacarbazine nor eribulin is meaningfully active in LMS.

As the post progression and therefore post treatment effects on survival are of major interest, further studies are strongly encouraged.

The initially proposed indication encompassed STS not subtype specified. The MAH proposed a revised indication:

HALAVEN is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma who have received prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic disease (see section 5.1).

This has not been accepted as no benefit has been demonstrated in LMS. Moreover, 'prior systemic therapy' should reflect that standard chemotherapy is based on anthracyclines as the 1 st line treatment. The following wording has been proposed:

HALAVEN is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma who have received prior anthracycline containing therapy (unless unsuitable) systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic disease (see section 5.1).

## Conclusion

The B/R is considered positive exclusively in the ADI population.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following changes:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I and IIIB         |

Extension of Indication to include the treatment of unresectable liposarcoma in adult patients who have received prior anthracycline containing therapy (unless unsuitable) for advanced or metastatic disease; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated with the PK, efficacy and safety information. The Package Leaflet and RMP are updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 9.1.

The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP by consensus  is of the opinion that Halaven (eribulin) is not similar to Yondelis (trabectedin) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

## 5. EPAR changes

The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this group of variations. In particular the EPAR module 8 \" steps after the authorisation \" will be updated as follows:

## Scope

Extension of Indication to include the treatment of unresectable liposarcoma in adult patients who have received prior anthracycline containing therapy (unless unsuitable) for advanced or metastatic disease; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated with the PK, efficacy and safety information. The Package Leaflet and RMP are updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 9.1.
