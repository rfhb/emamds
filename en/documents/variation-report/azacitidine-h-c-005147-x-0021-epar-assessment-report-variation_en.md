<!-- image -->

The chemical structure of azacitidine was elucidated by a combination of  1 H and  13 C NMR, MS, IR, UV and elemental analysis. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by XRPD.

The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white to off-white solid, sparingly soluble in water.

Azacitidine exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of four chiral centres. Three of the chiral centres originate in one of the starting materials while the fourth centre is generated during the synthesis of the active substance. Enantiomeric purity is controlled by a test for specific optical rotation in the specification of the active substance.

Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance and an overview of eight potential polymorphic forms was provided. The manufacturing process consistently results in polymorphic form I, and no conversion of the polymorphic form during the manufacturing process and stability studies was observed.

## 2.2.2.2. Manufacture, characterisation and process controls

## 2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

## 2.2.3.1. Description of the product and pharmaceutical development

The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets of two strengths containing 200 mg or 300 mg of azacitidine. The appearances of the tablets are as follows:

200 mg: Pink colour, oval shaped, film coated tablet, debossed with 'MA1' on one side and plain on other side (17.0 x 7.6 mm).

300 mg: Brown colour, oval shaped, film coated tablet, debossed with 'MA2' on one side and plain on other side (19.0 x 9.0 mm).

The finished product was developed to be equivalent to Onureg 200 mg and 300 mg film-coated tablets. The development aimed to create a bioequivalent immediate release product with a comparable dissolution profile to the reference product and acceptable pharmaceutical stability. The quality target product profile QTTP was defined during pharmaceutical development.

The active substance azacitidine exhibits high solubility considering the intended dose and is regarded as a BCS Class III active substance. The physical characteristics of the active substance that could impact product performance have been discussed and suitably controlled where relevant. The polymorphic form is controlled in the specification of the active substance. The particle size distribution is also controlled in the active substance specification to enable suitable flow and blending properties during the manufacturing process of the finished product.

The formulation development strategy was to select common excipients similar to the reference product. Based on the excipient profile and the flow characteristics of the active substance, a direct compression strategy was followed. In addition to this, the dose proportional nature of the proposed formulations allowed  for  a  common  blend  strategy  which  could  be  used  for  both  proposed  tablet  strengths.  The information gained during the development was used to inform the proposed commercial manufacturing process and control strategy.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with relevant standards such as the Ph. Eur. One of the excipients, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, complies with the relevant USP monograph and relevant standards have also been described for the in-house filmcoatings. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC.

A bioequivalence study was conducted to compare the 300 mg proposed tablet strength to the 300 mg Onureg reference product tablet. The results of this study were acceptable, for further details please refer to the clinical sections of this report. Comparative in-vitro dissolution studies were performed in addition to the bioequivalence study, the dissolution results at three pH conditions (pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8) showed that the in vitro dissolution profiles of the 300 mg test and reference product are similar. In support of the 200 mg proposed strength a biowaiver was requested considering the acceptable bioequivalence results of the 300 mg test product and dose proportionality of the formulations. The applicant provided comparative in-vitro dissolution data at three different pH values (pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8) between the proposed 300 mg and 200 mg strengths. The dissolution profiles were similar across the pH conditions and the request for the biowaiver was agreed as all relevant conditions for this were met.

The applicant performed considerable investigation into the discriminatory power of their chosen dissolution method. All investigations showed the active substance to be highly soluble with no

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

meaningful difference in dissolution evident despite the parameters varied. This was considered acceptable in light of the high solubility across the physiological pH range for the active substance.

The primary packaging is alu-alu blisters or alu-alu blisters or alu/PVC/PCTFE blisters. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure systems has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

## 2.2.3.2. Manufacture of the product and process controls

The finished product is manufactured by one manufacturing site. During the procedure a major objection (MO) was raised by the CHMP as satisfactory evidence regarding GMP standards at the site was not available.  To  resolve  this  MO  the  applicant  provided  evidence  that  the  site  had  been  appropriately inspected by the relevant competent authorities.

The steps that can have a significant impact on the processability of the intermediates and on the resulting properties of the finished product have been identified as critical process steps. These steps are controlled by the respective normal operating range (NOR) and proven acceptable range (PAR) and adequate in-process controls. The applicant has provided sufficient data to justify the hold times proposed for the bulk product.

Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.

## 2.2.3.3. Product specification

The finished product release &amp; shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form:  description  (visual),  average  weight,  identification  (HPLC  &amp;  UV),  water  content  (Ph.  Eur.), dissolution  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  related  substances  (HPLC), microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.).

The  specification  for  the  control  of  the  finished  product  contains  the  typical  tests  for  this  type  of pharmaceutical form and the limits have been adequately justified.

The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment  it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.

A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 'Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products' (EMA/409815/2020) and the 'Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products' (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary.

The initially proposed limit for quality control (QC) dissolution could not be accepted as it had not been set in line with the dissolution performance of the batch used in the bioequivalence study. As this aspect could impact in-vivo performance an MO was raised by the CHMP, requesting the applicant to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tighten the limit for both tablet strengths in line with the bio-batch. To resolve this MO the applicant tightened the dissolution limit as requested.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for four commercial scale batches of each strength confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

## 2.2.3.4. Stability of the product

Stability data from three commercial scale batches of each strength of the finished product and in both packaging configurations stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  The  batches  are  representative  of  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

Samples were tested for description, water content, dissolution, related substances, assay and microbial quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. At long term and accelerated conditions no  significant  trends  or  out  of  specification  results  are  observed.  Increases  in  water  content  and hydrolysis products are seen for both packaging types, in particular during accelerated conditions. This trend is more pronounced in the alu/PVC/PCTFE presentation, however the results remain acceptable and within specification.

In  addition,  one  batch  of  each  strength  were  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No sensitivity to light was observed.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months with no special storage condition as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.

## 2.2.3.5. Adventitious agents

It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner.

During the procedure two MOs were raised on quality aspects these concerned evidence of appropriate GMP standards for the site conducting finished product manufacture and the need to tighten the specification limit for finished product dissolution in line with the batch used in the bioequivalence study. To resolve these aspects the applicant provided evidence that the site in question had been appropriately inspected for GMP standards, and tightened the specification limit for finished product dissolution as requested.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

## 2.2.6. Recommendation(s) for future quality development

N/A

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

Pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  properties  of  azacitidine  are  well  known.  As azacitidine is  a  widely  used,  well-known  active  substance,  the  applicant  has  not  provided  additional studies and further studies are not required. Submitted overview based on literature review is considered appropriate.

## 2.3.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The MAH submitted an environmental risk assessment based on Phase I. The PECSURFACE WATER (PECSW) for Azacitidine calculated according to the standard formula with a default value of Fpen (0.01) and the maximum daily dose of 300 mg resulted in value of 1,5 µg/L, which is above the action limit of 0.01 µg/L.  The  MAH  then  presented  a  refined  Fpen  calculations  based  on  actual  API  consumption  data  of Azacitidine and epidemiological prevalence data.

The data of API consumption over last 4 years (2020-2023) is presented for several markets within EU along with population data and Fpen calculated accordingly. The highest value of refined Fpen (0.00016%) was used for the re-estimation of PECSW which resulted in a value of 0.00024 µg/L, which is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L.

Furthermore, the MAH considered the maximum prevalence data for of Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) at 0.0043% (obtained from literature) for refined Fpen. The estimated PECSW based on that was 0.0064 µg/L, less than the action limit of 0.01 µg/L.

A Phase II assessment is thus not deemed necessary as the Phase I assessment has concluded that Azacitidine tablets are unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its recommended usage in patients and no further risk assessment is required. Furthermore, the submitted product is intended for generic substitution. Hence no increase in environmental load is to be expected. The ERA is therefore expected to be similar and not increased.

## 2.3.2. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The  non-clinical  overview  on  the  pre-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  in  the application contains an adequate review of published non-clinical data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.3. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

There are no objections to the approval of Azacitidine Accord film-coated tables from a non-clinical point of view.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## · Population(s) studied

A total of 60 patients of Asian race were enrolled in the study (30 females and 30 males; 19 -69 years) and dosed in period 1. All 60 patients completed the study but 59 were included in the EU and US pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis, respectively.

Reasons for the dropouts/withdrawals:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One patient had no reported concentration values following dosing in any period and was therefore excluded from the PK set.

## · Analytical methods

The study samples were analysed by a validated LC-MS/MS method after solid phase extraction method. The method validation was completed on 08-Oct-2023, before onset of the initial bioanalytical phase of the study in line with bioanalytical method SOP no. MS-1817-00. Initial bioanalytical phase of the study started on 11-Oct-2023.

Amendment I (dated 13-Feb-2024) to the method validation report was initiated to update the method and  to  perform  requisite  experiments  to  validate  a  change  in  column,  run  time,  chromatographic condition (mobile phase composition) and injection volume following an investigation into a consistent poor chromatography in several consecutive runs which led to the rejection of the entire data of all samples analyzed up to that point (total of 36 patients) with the Method SOP MS-1817-00.

Analysis in line with method SOP no. MS-1817-01 (dated 22-Jan-2024) was initiated on 23-Jan-2024.

Amendment II (dated 18-Mar-2023) included the results of long-term stability  of  analyte  in  human plasma and analyte stability in human whole blood in ice cold water batch maintained at or below 4°C (established for 42.0 minutes).

The method was fully and partially validated in human plasma and can be summarized as follows:

Calibration range: 3.006 ng/mL to 500.136 ng/mL

QC concentrations  (ng/mL):  3.059  (LLOQ),  8.998  (LQC),  59.194  (LMQC),  159.984  (MQC),  399.961 (HQC) and 1496.800 (DQC)

Sample analysis (according to method SOP no. MS-1817-01) took place on 23-Jan-2024 to 14-Feb-2024.

The accuracy and precision of the QC samples at 8.998, 29.597, 59.194, 159.984 and 399.961 ng/ml during analysis of patient samples were as follows:

Inter-run accuracy: 99.2% to 100.3%,

Inter-run precision: 3.0% - 6.6%.

Duration of sample storage until completion of analysis was 169 days from the first sample collection (26-Aug-2023) to the last sample analysis.

A  total  of  3420  samples  were  analysed.  A  total  of  140  individual  samples  were  reanalysed,  due  to significant variation in internal standard response (104), elimination of low calibration curve standard (24), concentration above highest standard (06), poor chromatography (05) and no internal standard response (01).

Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) was performed on 221 samples out of 3420 samples for Azacitidine in order to evaluate the incurred sample reproducibility; 215 (97.3%) samples were within acceptance criteria.

All the selected ISR samples from one patient, demonstrated more than 20% difference from original results. Thus, in line with SOP on Incurred sample reproducibility (AHM/BA/0069-2) an investigation was conducted into why that occurred. The investigation concluded a considerable difference between the patient´s samples from Lot-1 (from original analysis) and Lot-2 samples (used for repeat analysis and ISR analysis). Hence selected samples from Lot-1 and Lot-2 were re-processed and re-analysed, upon

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

which a considerable difference in the concentration values between the samples lots was confirmed, with a concentration data reported for samples of Lot-1, but below LOOQ for the samples of Lot-2. No bioanalytical  anomaly  could  be  identified  which  explained  this  difference,  and  furthermore  an investigation at the clinical site identified no reasons for this discrepancy. Based on this the patient´s data was considered unreliable and all samples of this patient were identified as Not Reportable (NR).

## · Pharmacokinetic Variables

The primary pharmacokinetic parameters for this study were as follows for EU analysis:

Primary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax and AUC0-t.

Secondary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: AUC0-∞ , Tmax, AUC\\_%Extrap\\_obs, R 2  adjusted, λ z, and t1/2.

## · Statistical methods

Descriptive statistics  were  to  be  computed  and  reported  for  plasma  concentration  data  and pharmacokinetic parameters of azacitidine.

For continuous variables the summary statistics presented were to be the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values.  Categorical values were to be summarized using frequencies and percentages.

All statistical analyses were to be conducted using the SAS version 9.4. Pharmacokinetic analyses were to be performed using Phoenix WinNonlin version 8.3. The ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were to be subjected to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for Azacitidine.

The ANOVA model included terms for Center, Sequence, Sequence*Center, Patient (Sequence*Center), Formulation, Formulation*Center and Period (Center) effects. The Sequence, Center and Sequence*Center effect were to be tested using the Patient (Sequence*Center) as an error term. Each analysis of variance included calculation of least-squares means, the difference between adjusted formulation means and the standard error associated with this difference.

The above statistical analyses were to be done using PROC MIXED SAS® Procedure (for US analysis) and PROC GLM SAS® procedure (for EU analysis). Additionally, the applicant was requested to submit an ANOVA analysis with all fixed effects for sequence, subject within sequence, period and formulation.

Where the number of participants for BE evaluation was &lt; 5 participants in any Center, then that Center was to be combined to another Center.

An F-test were to be performed to determine the statistical significance of the effects involved in the model at a significance level of 5% (alpha=0.05).

The 90% confidence interval for the ratio of geometric least squares means between drug formulations were to be calculated and reported for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for Azacitidine.

## Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence - EU analysis:

Based on the statistical results of 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the geometric least squares means for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t, conclusion would be drawn for Test Formulation-T vs. Reference Formulation-R2.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Bioequivalence was concluded if the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of geometric least squares means between test and reference formulations fell within the acceptance range of 80.00 - 125.00% for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t for Azacitidine.

The data of AUC0-∞ was provided as supportive information only.

## · Exemption

The Applicant is seeking marketing authorisation for Azacitidine Accord film-coated tablets with 2 strengths, namely 300 mg, and 200 mg.

A strength based biowaiver was applied for the additional strength of 200 mg based on the in vivo data (bioequivalence study) of the 300 mg strength.  The justification for the strength based biowaiver is as follows:

- a) Azacitidine 200 mg and 300 mg Tablets are manufactured at the same manufacturing site i.e. Intas Pharmaceutical Limited using a similar manufacturing process.
- b)   Azacitidine demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range.
- c)   The qualitative compositions of Azacitidine 200 mg tablets are the same as that of Azacitidine 300 mg Tablets.
- d)   The formulations of both the strengths are dose proportional, i.e. the ratio between the amounts of each excipient to the amount of active substance(s) are the same for both strengths.
- e)   In-vitro dissolution profile is similar under identical conditions for the additional strengths and the strength of the batch used in the bioequivalence study.

## 2.4.2.1. Pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

To support this application, the MAH submitted one study, no. 033-22. The study was an open-label, randomised, three-treatment (test product, US reference product and EU reference product), three-arm, three-period, single-dose, multi-center, cross-over bioequivalence study of Azacitidine 300 mg tablet and ONUREG 300 mg tablets (US reference and EU reference) under fasting condition in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia in remission phase. A total of sixty patients (60) were enrolled and dosed in Period 1, in line with the protocol. Sixty (60) patients completed the study, but 59 patients were included in the PK and statistical analysis, since no concentration data were available for one patient in any of the periods.

The pivotal bioequivalence study was conducted in line with the general bioequivalence guidance in terms of design, analyte, and parameters for bioequivalence assessment.

The results of study no. 033-22 indicate that the test product is bioequivalent with the EU reference product under fasting conditions as the 90% CI of the ratio for geometric least square means of lntransformed data of AUC0-t and Cmax for Azacitidine of the test and reference product falls within the conventional acceptance criterion of 80.00-125.00%.

The concentration data of the subject that was excluded from the analysis was not presented with the clinical study report. A sensitivity analysis with the original concentration data of this subject included was  however  provided  which  confirmed  the  bioequivalence  between  the  test  product  and  the  EU reference product.

The biowaiver request for the lower strength is considered acceptable since Azacitidine demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range. Furthermore, the requirements of the general biowaiver criteria of the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1/Corr** are considered fulfilled and the biowaiver therefore considered justified for the 200 mg strength. Tabular in vitro dissolution data of 12 units including individual values, mean values and RSD (%) of the investigated products have been provided. The data provided was generated under three different testing conditions (0.1M HCl, pH 4.5 and pH 6.8) with paddle apparatus at 50 rpm in 500 ml.

The applicant concludes similarity is demonstrated between the two strengths of the test products since more than 85% release was observed at pH 0.1M HCl (the profiles can therefore be concluded to be similar without further mathematical evaluation) and at pH 4.5 and 6.8 similarity was demonstrated with F2 &gt;50.

This is agreed and the biowaiver is therefore justified for the 200 mg strength.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

Bioequivalence has been appropriately shown between the test product and reference product in patients under fasting conditions in line with the EU guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence.

There  are  no  objections  to  the  approval  of  Azacitidine  Accord  film-coated  tablets  from  a  clinical pharmacology point of view.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.5. Clinical safety

A total of 18 adverse events were reported by nine (09) of 60 patients during the study. Four (04) adverse events were reported by four patients (04) following administration of the test product. Seven (07) adverse events were reported by three (03) patients following the administration of Reference-R1 (US) product. Seven (07) adverse events were reported by five (05) patients following the administration of Reference-R2 (EU) product.

Out of these 18 adverse events, 15 were mild and 03 were moderate in nature. The causality assessment was judged as certain for 3 adverse events, probable/likely for 7, possible for 2 and as unlikely for 6 adverse events. The outcome of all (18) the adverse events was Recovered/Resolved.

No serious adverse event occurred, and no death occurred during the conduct of the study.

## 2.4.6. Discussion on clinical safety

The adverse advents have been adequately analysed including incidence by treatment, relation with investigational medicinal product, intensity and time of onset and resolution.

There were no serious adverse events during the conduct of this study. Overall, the drugs tested were generally safe and well tolerated by the patients included in this study.

## 2.4.7. Conclusions on the clinical safety

There are no objections to the approval of Azacitidine Accord film-coated tables from a clinical safety point of view.

## 2.5.4. Conclusion

The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 2.0 is acceptable.

## 2.5.5. Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## 2.5.6. Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

## 2.6. Product information

## 2.6.1. User consultation

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Onureg 200 mg and 300mg film-coated tablets and Solifenacin succinate 5/10mg film-coated tablets.  The bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

This application is aimed at registering Azacitidine Accord 200 mg and 300 mg film-coated tablets.

The application is based upon Article 10(1) (a) (iii) (essentially similar products i.e. generics) of Directive 2001/83/EC. The reference product Onureg (Azacitidine) film-coated tablets 200 mg and 300 mg  is indicated as maintenance therapy in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who achieved complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) following induction therapy with or without consolidation treatment and who are not candidates for, including those who choose not to proceed to, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant's clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature is considered sufficient.

The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with an open label, randomized, three-treatment (test product,  US  reference  product,  EU  reference  product),  three-arm,  three-period,  single-dose,  multicentre, crossover bioequivalence study in patients. The study design is considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. The study was conducted under fasting conditions, which is considered appropriate. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied are adequate.

The test formulation of Azacitidine Accord 300 mg film-coated tablet met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the EU reference product, Onureg 300 mg tablet. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t, and Cmax were all contained

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

within  the  protocol-defined  acceptance  range  of  80.00  to  125.00%.  Bioequivalence  of  the  two formulations has been demonstrated.

Having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference medicinal product, no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 3.1. Conclusions

The overall benefit/risk balance of Azacitidine Accord is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 'Recommendations'.

## 4. Recommendations

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Azacitidine Accord is not similar to Dacogen, Mylotarg, Xospata, Daurismo, Vyxeos liposomal, Rydapt, and Tibsovo within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix on similarity.

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of, Azacitidine Accord 200 and 300 mg film-coated tablets is favourable in the following indication(s):

Azacitidine Accord is indicated as maintenance therapy in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who achieved complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) following induction therapy with or without consolidation treatment and who are not candidates for, including those who choose not to proceed to, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Azacitidine Accord subject to the following conditions:
