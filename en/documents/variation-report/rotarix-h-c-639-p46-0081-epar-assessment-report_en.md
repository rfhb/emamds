## 2. Assessment of the post-authorisation measure PAM

## 2.1. Introduction

Study DTPa-HBV-IPV-118 PRI assesses the immunogenicity and safety of GSK combined DTPa-HBVIPV/HiB vaccine ( Infanrix TM hexa) administered as a three-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 4 and 6  months  of  age  in  healthy  infants  in  Canada. Rotarix was  not  specifically  studied  and  no immunogenicity results for Rotarix were generated in this study.

According to the Rotarix Product Information, Rotarix can be administered at the same time as other recommended vaccines, such as Hib, diphtheria, tetanus, pertusis, oral or inactivated polio, hepatitis B vaccines  as  well  as  pneumococcal  and  meningoccal  serogroup  C  conjugate  vaccines.  The  MAH  has reviewed the results of this study and has concluded that no changes to the Product Information are needed.

## 2.2. Study design

Study Objectives: The primary objective was to assess the immune response to the Hib component of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib in terms of seroprotection rates one month after a three-dose primary vaccination course in 'Aboriginal Infants' and 'Non Aboriginals Infants'.

The secondary objective were (i) to assess the response to Hib component of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib in terms  of  anti-polyribosyl-ribitol  phosphate  (PRP)  GMCs  one  month  after  the  three-dose  primary vaccination, (ii) to assess the immune response to the hepatitis B components of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib in terms of seroprotection rates and anti-HBs GMCs one month after the three-dose primary vaccination course, and (iii) assess safety of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib in terms of medically attended adverse events and serious adverse events during the three-dose primary vaccination course.

Study Design: Phase IV, non-randomised, open-label study conducted in 3 centres in Canada.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

There were two parallel groups, (i) 'Aboriginal Infants' which included infants of the Canadian First Nation, Metis and Inuit people and (ii) 'NonAboriginal Infants' which included infants exclusive of Aboriginals.

This was a self-contained study. The Non-Aboriginal infants ' group served as control for evaluating the response to the vaccine in the Aboriginal infants ' group. Blood sample was collected from all subjects one month after the third dose of the primary vaccination.

All subjects were to receive three doses of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib at 2, 4, and 6 months of age and two doses of Rotarix (lyophilised or liquid formulation) at 2 and 4 months of age, as well as  pneumococcal conjugate vaccine according to the recommended provincial infant immunisation schedules.

Study Population: Healthy infants between and including 6 and 12 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination  and  born  after  a  gestation  period  of  minimum  36  weeks.  Subjects  with  evidence  of previous or intercurrent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B and/or Hib vaccination or disease were excluded from the study.

Study period: From September 2008 to November 2013 (date of database freeze)

## Study endpoints:

## Primary Outcome/Efficacy Variable:

- Immunogenicity one month after the third dose of primary vaccination course:
- -Anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥ 0.15 µg/ml.

## Secondary Outcome/Efficacy Variable(s):

- Immunogenicity one month after the third dose of primary vaccination course:
- -Anti-PRP antibody concentration ≥ 1 µg/ml.
- -Anti-HBs antibody concentration ≥ 10 mIU/ml and ≥ 100 mIU/ml
- -Anti-PRP and anti-HBs antibody concentrations.

## Secondary Outcome/Safety Variable(s):

- Occurrence of medically attended adverse events and serious adverse events. An adverse event requiring medical attention is defined as:
- -a visit to or from medical personnel (doctor of medicine or nurse practitioner) for any reason (excluding scheduled study visits);
- -an emergency room visit; or
- -any serious adverse event including hospitalisation and death.

## Statistical methods:

The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  the  ATP  cohort  for  analysis  of  immunogenicity  and  safety.  An analysis on the Total Vaccinated cohort was to be performed to complement the ATP analysis only if

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

more than 5% of the subjects with available immunogenicity data were excluded from the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity.

## Safety

- The verbatim reports of medically attended AEs were reviewed by a physician and the signs and symptoms were coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Every verbatim term was matched with the appropriate Preferred Term. The percentage of subjects with AEs that required medical attention occurring within 31 days (Day 0 to Day 30) with its exact 95% CI was tabulated by preferred term for each study group.
- The percentage of subjects who started to receive at least one concomitant medication (i.e. any medication, antipyretic medication, prophylactic antipyretics) during the 31-day follow-up period after vaccination was tabulated with exact 95% CI.
- Concomitant vaccinations received during the course of the study were tabulated.
- Serious adverse events and withdrawals due to AEs and SAEs following vaccination were described in detail.

Seroprotection rates, percentage of subjects with groups (ATP cohort for immunogenicity)

Assessor's comment: The number of subjects with antibody concentrations ≥ 100 mIU per ml is not round and the table should be corrected for those values.

## Safety /reactogenicity:

- At  least  one  unsolicited  symptom  that  required  medical  attention  during  the  31-day  follow-up period after vaccination was reported for 23.2% and 17.0% of subjects in Aboriginal Infants and Non-Aboriginal Infants groups.
- In the Aboriginals Infants, pyrexia (5.4%) was the most commonly reported unsolicited symptom that required medical attention followed by bronchiolitis and otitis media (both 3.6%). In the NonAboriginal  Infants,  eczema  (2.7%)  was  most  commonly  reported  followed by  bronchiolitis,  otitis media and respiratory syncytial virus infection (all three 1.8%).

## Serious adverse events:

- SAEs were reported for six subjects in the Aboriginal Infants group during the entire study period. Two SAEs were reported after dose 1, three SAEs were reported after dose 2 and one SAE was reported after dose 3. All the SAEs were recovered/resolved by the end of the study.
- One SAE (Pyrexia) reported for a subject was assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccine. This SAE was reported immediately after the administration of the dose 1 and this warranted an emergency room visit. This SAE resolved in 2 days.
- No fatal SAEs were reported in the study.

## 2.4. Conclusion:

- One month after the primary vaccination with Infanrix TM hexa ,  anti-PRP seroprotection levels were seen in 97.9% of subjects in the Aboriginal Infants group and in 99.1% of subjects in the NonAboriginal Infants group.
- Anti-PRP  GMCs  were  6.123 μ g/ml  (95%  CI:  4.498-8.334)  in  the  Aboriginal  Infants  group  and 3.510 μ g/ml (95% CI: 2.745-4.488) in the Non-Aboriginal Infants group.
- One  month  after  the  primary  vaccination  with Infanrix  hexa ,  seroprotective  anti-HBs  antibody concentration ≥ 10  mIU/mL  was  observed  in  100%  of  subjects  in  Aboriginal  Infants  and  NonAboriginal Infants and antibody concentration ≥ 100 mIU/mL was observed in 97.4% and 97.3% of subjects in Aboriginal Infants and Non-Aboriginal Infants groups, respectively.
- The anti-HBs GMCs were 1797.9 mIU/mL (95% CI: 1375.1- 2350.7) and 1544.4 mIU/mL (95% CI: 1210.4-1970.5) for Aboriginal Infants and Non-Aboriginal Infants groups, respectively.
- No confirmatory analyses were performed on the primary and secondary objectives.
- At  least  one  unsolicited  symptom  that  required  medical  attention  during  the  31-day  follow-up period after vaccination was reported for 23.2% and 17.0% of subjects in Aboriginal Infants and Non-Aboriginal Infants groups, respectively.
- SAEs were reported for six subjects in the Aboriginal Infants group during the entire study period. One SAE (pyrexia) was assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccine. All the SAEs were recovered/resolved by the end of the study. No fatal SAEs were reported.
- In this study, the study vaccine was generally well tolerated.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion

No data on the immunogenicity of Rotarix was provided in this report.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Study DTPa-HBV-IPV-118 PRI was not designed to exclude an effect of Rotarix on the immunogenicity and safety of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine in health infants. Those results are not unexpected and do not modify the current knowledge on the vaccine.

- PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required
