## BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE

## 1. Submission of the dossier

The  company  Pfizer  Limited,  UK  submitted  on  29  September  1997  an  application  for  Marketing Authorisation  to  the  European  Agency  for  the  Evaluation  of  Medicinal  Products  (EMEA)  for VIAGRA,  through  the  centralised  procedure.  After  agreement  by  the  CPMP  on  17-18  June  1997, this medicinal product is referred to Part B of the Annex to Council Regulation No. (EC) 2309/93 of 22 July 1993.

The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CPMP were as follows:

Rapporteur:

Dr. H. van Bronswijk Co-Rapporteur: Prof. F. de Andres-Trelles

## Licensing status

The  product  was  approved  by  the  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration  on  27  March  1998,  for  the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

## 2. Steps taken for the assessment of the product

- The procedure started on 27 October 1997.
- During its meeting on 16-17 December 1997, the CPMP agreed that a GMP inspection of the manufacturing site was not necessary.
- The Rapporteur's first assessment report was circulated to all CPMP  Members on 19  December  1997.  The  Co-Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP Members on 12 January 1998.
- During  its  meeting  on  24-25  February  1998,  the  CPMP  agreed  on  the  consolidated  list  of questions  to  be  sent  to  the  company.  The  final  consolidated  list  of  questions  was  sent  to  the company on 24 February 1998.
- The company submitted the responses to the consolidated list of questions on 18 March 1998.
- The  Rapporteur  and  the  Co-Rapporteur  circulated  assessment  reports  on  the  company's responses to the list of questions to all CPMP Members on 29 April 1998 and 30 April 1998, respectively.
- During its meeting on 26-27 May 1998, the CPMP agreed on a list of outstanding issues (safety, posology and starting dose in the elderly, SPC issues, and usage surveillance) to be addressed by the company in an oral explanation.
- A  hearing  was  held  at  the  CPMP  meeting  on  27  May  1998,  to  address  the  remaining outstanding  issues  in  particular  related  to  the  SPC,  i.e.  the  starting  dose  in  the  elderly,  the proposed  contra-indications,  the  incidence  of  undesirable  effects  and  interactions  with  nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The applicant also addressed the CPMP safety concerns about reported deaths in the USA and the usage surveillance of sildenafil, including educational training material covering the area of ED for prescribers for appropriate use.
- The CPMP, during its meeting on 26-27 May 1998, considered the responses provided by the company and discussed the recommendations presented by the Rapporteur. Amendments were discussed  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  and  Package  Leaflet  texts.  The  CPMP opinion  was  that  the  legal  status  should  be  medical  prescription.  There  were  no  scientific reasons to limit the prescription status, as erectile dysfunction was considered to be a medical condition that could be treated in a general practice setting.
- The applicant, Pfizer Limited, provided a letter of undertaking on the follow-up measures to be fulfilled as requested by the CPMP (quality issues, in vitro interaction study with theophylline and  dipyridamole,  conduct  of  a  post-marketing  surveillance  study),  dated  27  May  1998. The  applicant  also  stated  their  undertaking  to  take  into  consideration  any  comments  and requests  from  the  CPMP  which  result  from  their  review  of  educational  materials  relating  to erectile dysfunction. The applicant agreed to provide the CPMP with monthly safety reporting

until  the  Commission  Decision  is  adopted  and,  if  necessary,  to  update  the  SPC  before  the adoption of the Commission Decision.

- During the meeting on 26-27 May 1998 the CPMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for  granting  a Marketing Authorisation for VIAGRA on 27 May 1998 .
- The CPMP opinions were forwarded, in all official languages of the European Union, to the European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decisions on 15 September 1998.
