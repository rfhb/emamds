## Missed dose

If a dose of rilzabrutinib is missed, patients should take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day with a return to the regular schedule the following day. The missed dose and the next regular scheduled dose must be taken more than 2 hours apart. Extra tablets should not be taken to make up for the missed dose.

## Discontinuation

Treatment with rilzabrutinib should be discontinued after 12 weeks of rilzabrutinib therapy if the platelet count does not increase to a level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding.

## Special population

## Elderly

No dose modification is required for elderly (≥ 65 years) patients (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No dose modification is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Rilzabrutinib has not been studied in clinical trials in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

No dose modification is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment. Rilzabrutinib has not been studied in clinical trials in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment, rilzabrutinib should not be administered (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of rilzabrutinib in children and adolescents below 18 years of age with ITP have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

## Rilzabrutinib is for oral use.

The tablets can be taken at approximately the same time each day with or without food (see section 5.2). In patients who experience gastrointestinal symptoms, taking rilzabrutinib with food may improve tolerability. Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole with water. The tablets should not be split, crushed, or chewed in order to ensure the entire dose is delivered correctly.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Serious infections

Serious infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal) have been reported during clinical studies (see section 4.8). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and treat appropriately.

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective method of contraception while taking rilzabrutinib (see section 4.6). Pregnancy status of females of child-bearing potential should be verified prior to initiating treatment.

## Hepatic impairment

In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment, rilzabrutinib should not be administered (see section 5.2). Bilirubin and transaminases are to be evaluated at baseline and as clinically indicated during treatment with rilzabrutinib. For patients who develop abnormal liver tests after rilzabrutinib, continue to monitor for liver test abnormalities as well as clinical signs and symptoms as clinically indicated.

## QT shortening

In the clinical trials with ITP patients, there were no clinically meaningful QTc interval changes. In a thorough QT study, rilzabrutinib produced a shortening in the QTc interval (see section 5.1). Although the underlying mechanism and safety relevance of this finding is not known, clinicians should use caution when prescribing rilzabrutinib to patients at risk for further shortening their QTc duration (e.g., Congenital Short QT Syndrome or patients with a family history of such a syndrome).

## Excipients

## Sunset yellow FCF

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product contains azo colouring agent sunset yellow FCF (E 110), which may cause allergic reactions.

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Rilzabrutinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A.

## Agents that may increase rilzabrutinib plasma concentrations

Co-administration of rilzabrutinib with a moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitor increases rilzabrutinib plasma concentrations. Increased rilzabrutinib concentrations may increase the risk of rilzabrutinib adverse reactions.

## CYP3A inhibitors

Co-administration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor (ritonavir) increased the rilzabrutinib Cmax by approximately 5-fold and AUC by 8-fold in healthy subjects.

Avoid co-administration of moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, clarithromycin, itraconazole, erythromycin, fluconazole, verapamil, diltiazem) with rilzabrutinib. If these inhibitors will be used short term (such as anti-infectives for seven days or less), interrupt rilzabrutinib (see section 4.2).

Avoid co-administration of grapefruit, starfruit and products containing these fruits, and Seville oranges with rilzabrutinib, as these are moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP3A.

## P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors

After co-administration of rilzabrutinib with a strong P-gp inhibitor (quinidine), a modest increase in exposure to rilzabrutinib, considered not to be clinically meaningful, was observed by 12.7% for AUC, relative to rilzabrutinib alone.

## Agents that may decrease rilzabrutinib plasma concentrations

Co-administration of rilzabrutinib with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers decreases rilzabrutinib plasma concentrations. Co-administration with a PPI decreases the plasma concentrations of rilzabrutinib. Decreased rilzabrutinib plasma concentrations may reduce rilzabrutinib efficacy.

## CYP3A inducers

Co-administration with a strong CYP3A inducer (rifampicin) decreased rilzabrutinib Cmax and AUC by about 80% in healthy subjects.

Avoid co-administration of rilzabrutinib with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenytoin) (see section 4.2).

## Gastric acid reducing agents

Rilzabrutinib solubility decreases with increasing pH. Co-administration with a PPI (esomeprazole) decreased rilzabrutinib AUC by 51% in healthy subjects. Co-administration of rilzabrutinib with a H2RA (famotidine) reduced rilzabrutinib AUC by approximately 36% and no significant change was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

observed in rilzabrutinib exposure if rilzabrutinib was administered at least 2 hours prior to famotidine.

Avoid co-administration of rilzabrutinib with PPIs. If treatment with a gastric acid reducing agent is required, consider using a H2RA. Rilzabrutinib should be administered at least 2 hours before taking a H2RA (see section 4.2). The effect of elevating gastric pH with antacids on the pharmacokinetics of rilzabrutinib has not been studied and may be similar to that seen with famotidine (H2RA). Therefore, it is recommended to take rilzabrutinib at least 2 hours before taking the antacid.

## Agents that may have their plasma concentrations altered by rilzabrutinib

## CYP3A substrates

Rilzabrutinib is both an in vitro inhibitor and inducer of the CYP3A4 enzyme. Co-administration of a single 400 mg dose of rilzabrutinib with a CYP3A substrate (midazolam) increased substrate exposure by 1.7-fold in healthy subjects. When midazolam was administered 2 hours after the rilzabrutinib dose there was increase in midazolam exposure approximately by 2.2-fold. The effect of a multiple-dose regimen of rilzabrutinib on CYP3A4 activity was not assessed in clinical trials. Caution should be exercised if co-administering rilzabrutinib with CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g. cyclosporin).

## Transporter substrates

Rilzabrutinib has shown potential to inhibit the P-gp, BCRP, and OATP1B3 transporters in vitro . There is a possible risk of drug-drug interactions, therefore, caution should be exercised when coadministering rilzabrutinib with P-gp, BCRP, or OATP1B3 sensitive substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g. digoxin, cyclosporin, tacrolimus) (see section 5.2).

## Hormonal contraceptives

The effect of rilzabrutinib on the plasma concentrations of hormonal contraceptives is unknown. Therefore, women of childbearing potential should use an alternative non-hormonal or additional highly effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after discontinuation of rilzabrutinib (see section 4.6).

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential

Women of child-bearing potential must use highly effective contraception during rilzabrutinib treatment and for 1 month after stopping treatment (see section 4.5 regarding potential interaction with hormonal contraceptives). Pregnancy status of females of child-bearing potential should be verified prior to initiating treatment.

## Pregnancy

Rilzabrutinib should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Based on the available nonclinical animal studies, there may be a risk to the foetus (see section 5.3). There are no available data on rilzabrutinib use in pregnant women.

## Breast-feeding

There are no available data on the presence of rilzabrutinib or its metabolites in human milk, effects on milk production, or the breastfed infant. No conclusions can be drawn regarding whether or not rilzabrutinib is safe for use during breastfeeding. Rilzabrutinib should be used during breastfeeding

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

only if the potential benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks, including those to the breastfed child.

## Fertility

There are no data on the effect of rilzabrutinib on human fertility. Effects of rilzabrutinib on male and female fertility were studied in rats at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day [Human Equivalent Dose (HED) 48 mg/kg/day]. Animal studies do not indicate any effect on fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Rilzabrutinib may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Mild dizziness has been reported in some patients taking rilzabrutinib and should be considered when assessing a patient's ability to drive or operate machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions were diarrhoea (34.5%), nausea (25.4%), headache (18.3%), abdominal pain (15.8%), COVID-19 (15.5%), nasopharyngitis (11.6%), and arthralgia (11.3%). The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of rilzabrutinib, which occurred each in 2 patients (0.7%), were diarrhoea, nausea, headache, and pneumonia.

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Unless otherwise stated, the following frequencies of adverse reactions are based on the 284 ITP patients exposed to rilzabrutinib in the phase 1/2 and phase 3 clinical trials (see section 5.1). The median duration of exposure was 6.6 months (range: &lt;1 month to 70.8 months).

Adverse reactions are organised according to primary system organ class (SOC) for each preferred term in MedDRA. The adverse reactions are ranked by frequency within each SOC, and presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to &lt;1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to &lt;1/1 000), very rare (&lt;1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

*Due to aspergillosis in 2 cases

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Infections

Among patients exposed to rilzabrutinib, the most common infection adverse reactions were COVID19 (15.5%) and nasopharyngitis (11.6%). The majority of infections were Grade 1 or 2 and resolved within 8 days. For those that experienced an adverse reaction of infection, the median time to onset was 2.9 months (range: 1 day; 41.7 months). In the LUNA-3 Study double blind period, Grade 2 or higher occurred in 17.3% and 14.5% in the rilzabrutinib group and placebo group, respectively. Grade 3 or higher occurred in 3.8% in the rilzabrutinib group and none in the placebo group. In the LUNA-3 Study double blind period, serious grade 3 or higher adverse reaction of infection occurred in 2 (1.5%) patients in the rilzabrutinib group, including a fatal case of pneumonia due to aspergillosis and COVID-19, and none in the placebo group.

## Gastrointestinal disorders

Among patients exposed to rilzabrutinib, the most common GI adverse reactions were diarrhoea (34.5%), nausea (25.4%), and abdominal pain (15.8%). Majority of GI reactions were Grade 1 and resolved with median duration of 19 days for nausea, 12 days for abdominal pain, and approximately 7 days for diarrhoea. For those that experienced a GI adverse reaction, the median time to onset for GI disturbances was 4 days (range: 1 day; 12.7 months).

## Rash

Among patients exposed to rilzabrutinib, rash (including rash maculo-papular, rash papular, rash erythematous, rash pruritic, erythema, erythema nodosum, urticaria) were all non-serious. All were Grade 1 or 2. For those that experienced an adverse reaction of rash, the median time to onset was 3.4 months (range: 6 days; 57.7 months).

## Other special population

## Elderly

Among the patients exposed to rilzabrutinib (n=284), 51 (17.9%) patients were 65 years of age or older. In  these  elderly  patients,  2  (3.9%)  patients  experienced  serious  adverse  reactions  of  pneumonia.  In patients  below  65  years  of  age,  3  (1.3%)  patients  had  serious  adverse  reactions  of  pneumonia  and COVID-19.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no specific antidote for overdose with rilzabrutinib. In the event of overdose, closely monitor the patient for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment immediately.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: not yet assigned, ATC code: not yet assigned

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Mechanism of action

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is an intracellular signalling molecule of the B-cell and innate immune cells. In B-cells, BTK signalling results in B-cell survival, proliferation, and maturation. In innate immune cells, BTK participates in inflammatory pathways that include, toll-like receptor signalling, Fc gamma receptor signalling, and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Rilzabrutinib is a selective, covalent, reversible inhibitor of BTK, with a tailored residence time at BTK to reduce off-target effects. In ITP, rilzabrutinib mediates its therapeutic effect through multiimmune modulation by inhibiting B cell activation, interruption of FcγR mediated phagocytosis, and potentially amelioration of chronic inflammation associated with ITP.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Cardiac Electrophysiology

In the 'Thorough QT Study,' co-administration of 400 mg rilzabrutinib and the CYP3A inhibitor (ritonavir) resulted in plasma exposure 8 times higher than rilzabrutinib alone. Under these conditions, there was no prolongation of the mean QTc interval to any clinically relevant effect. In this same study, a concentration dependent shortening in the QTc interval was observed with a maximum shortening of -10.2 ms (90% CI: -12.24, -8.16) following the supratherapeutic dose (combination of rilzabrutinib and ritonavir 100 mg)]. The shortening was smaller [-7.3 ms (90% CI: -9.33, -5.19)] at the rilzabrutinib 400 mg twice a day dose.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The safety and efficacy of rilzabrutinib in adult patients with primary persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) was evaluated in a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind (DB), placebocontrolled, parallel-group study consisting of 24 weeks of blinded treatment, followed by an openlabel (OL) period of 28 weeks and long-term extension (LTE) period during both of which all patients received rilzabrutinib (LUNA 3 Study). The patients enrolled in this study did not have a sustained response to either intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg/anti-D) or corticosteroid (CS), or had a documented intolerance or insufficient response to any appropriate course of standard-of-care ITP therapy.

Patients were randomized 2:1 to rilzabrutinib or placebo and randomization was stratified with respect to prior splenectomy and severity of thrombocytopenia.

Concomitant ITP medicinal products [oral CS and/or thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA)] were allowed at stable doses at least 2 weeks before the start of the study and throughout the DB period. Rescue therapy was permitted.

Only patients that responded during the first 12 weeks of the DB period could continue the DB treatment until Week 24 before entering the OL period. Those who did not respond could enter the OL period at Week 13 or discontinue from the study. After completing the OL period, eligible patients could continue into the LTE period.

In the LUNA 3 Study, 202 patients were randomized and treated, 133 to the rilzabrutinib group and 69 to the placebo group. At baseline, the median age was 47 years (range: 18 to 80 years), 62.9% were female, 61.9% were Caucasian, and 31.7% Asian. Of the 202 patients, 15.8% (rilzabrutinib) and 21.7% (placebo) were 65 years of age and older while 4.5% (rilzabrutinib) and 4.3% (placebo) were 75 years of age and older.

At baseline, the majority (92.6%) of patients had chronic ITP, with a median time since ITP diagnosis of 7.69 years (range: 0.3, 52.2 years), and 27.7% had undergone splenectomy. The median platelet count was 15 300/μL, with almost half (48%) less than 15 000/μL. Twenty-four (11.9%) patients had

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

only one prior therapy and 178 (88.1%) patients had ≥ 2 prior therapies. The median number of prior therapies, including splenectomy, was 4 (range: 1 to 15). Prior ITP treatments varied, with the most common prior therapies being CS (95.5%), TPO-RAs (68.8%), IVIg or anti-D immunoglobulins (55.4%), and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody/rituximab (35.1%.). In addition, at baseline 65.8% of patients received both CS and TPO-RAs. Baseline characteristics were generally similar across both groups.

During the DB period, the median duration of exposure was 98 days (range: 22 to 182) and 84 days (range: 17 to 173) for the rilzabrutinib group and placebo group, respectively. The cumulative duration of treatment exposure was 44.3 participant-years and 17.9 participant years for the rilzabrutinib group and placebo group, respectively. All rilzabrutinib treated patients received 400 mg twice a day. In addition, 39.8% of patients received rilzabrutinib without CS or TPO-RA, 25.6% received rilzabrutinib and CS, 18.8% received rilzabrutinib and TPO-RA, and 15.8% received rilzabrutinib and both CS and TPO-RA.

During the first 12 weeks of the DB period, 85 (63.9%) patients and 22 (31.9%) patients in the rilzabrutinib group and placebo group, respectively, achieved platelet count response (≥ 50 000/μL or between 30 000/μL and &lt; 50 000/μL and doubled from baseline). Among the patients who responded during the DB period, the median time to platelet response was 15 days and 50 days for the rilzabrutinib group and placebo group, respectively. Those who achieved platelet count response by week 13 were eligible to continue the DB period. Fifty-five (41.4%) and 55 (79.7%) patients in the rilzabrutinib and placebo groups, respectively, discontinued the DB period due to not achieving predefined criteria of platelet response and/or due to lack of response per investigator judgment. These individuals were counted as treatment failure in the primary endpoint analysis.

In the LUNA 3 Study, the primary endpoint was durable platelet response. A durable platelet response was the achievement of a weekly platelet count ≥ 50 000/μL for at least 8 out of the last 12 weeks of the 24-week DB period in the absence of rescue therapy, The proportion of patients achieving durable response was significantly higher in the rilzabrutinib group (23.3%) compared to the placebo group (0%) during the DB period (see Table 3 for study outcomes). A numerically higher percentage of patients that received rilzabrutinib with concomitant CS and/or TPO-RA had durable platelet response (27.5%) compared to those taking rilzabrutinib as monotherapy (17%).

Key secondary endpoints included persistence of platelet response, onset of clinical response, use of rescue therapy and patient reported outcome related to bleeding (see Table 3 for study outcomes).

After the DB period, 180 patients entered the OL period (115 patients from the rilzabrutinib group and 65 patients from the placebo group in the DB period) with a cumulative duration of treatment exposure of 75.6 participant-years. Of these 180 patients, 115 patients completed the 28-week OL period.

In the OL period, 14/65 (21.5%) patients from the placebo group achieved a durable response after being exposed to rilzabrutinib, and 10/84 (11.9%) patients in the rilzabrutinib group achieved a durable response despite not achieving durable response during the DB period.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with rilzabrutinib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in ITP (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Mean Cmax (%CV) and AUC24h (%CV) at steady state were estimated to be 150 ng/mL (56%) and 1 540 ng.h/mL (57.5%), respectively, for the ITP population. Accumulation, as reflected by the fold change in maximum median concentrations, was 1.3-fold following dosing at 400 mg twice daily. Rilzabrutinib exhibits approximately dose proportional increases in exposure over the dose range of 300 mg to 600 mg.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Absorption

The absolute oral bioavailability of rilzabrutinib was 4.73%. The median time to peak rilzabrutinib plasma concentrations (Tmax) was 0.5 to 2.5 hours.

## Effect of food

No clinically significant differences in rilzabrutinib AUC or Cmax were observed following the administration of a single 400 mg tablet with a high-fat meal, high-calorie meal as compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Resulting Tmax was delayed by 1.5 hours.

## Distribution

Volume of distribution at terminal phase (Vz) after intravenous administration is 149 L. The in vitro plasma protein binding of rilzabrutinib is 97.5%, mainly bound to human serum albumin, and the blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.786.

## Metabolism

Rilzabrutinib is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A enzymes.

## Elimination/Excretion

Rilzabrutinib is rapidly cleared from the plasma, with a t1/2 of approximately 3 to 4 hours. Following administration of a single 400 mg 14C-labeled rilzabrutinib dose, radioactivity was predominantly excreted in feces (~86%) and to a lesser extent in urine (~5%) and bile (~6%). Approximately 0.03% of rilzabrutinib is excreted unchanged in the urine.

## Special populations

Based on population PK analysis, gender, body weight (range 36-140 kg), race/ethnicity and age (range 12-80 years) had no meaningful effect on rilzabrutinib PK. The PK of rilzabrutinib in Chinese and Japanese populations is similar to the Caucasian population.

## Hepatic impairment

Rilzabrutinib exposure increased by approximately 1.5-fold in mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and approximately 4.5-fold in moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Rilzabrutinib has not been studied in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.

## Renal impairment

Patients with mild (60-90 mL/min) or moderate (30-60 mL/min) renal impairment participated in rilzabrutinib clinical trials. Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggest that mild or moderate renal impairment do not impact rilzabrutinib exposure.

## Transporter inhibition

Rilzabrutinib was shown in vitro to be a P-gp substrate, and to a lower extent potentially a substrate of BCRP. Rilzabrutinib was not a substrate for OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BSEP. Rilzabrutinib exhibited in vitro a potential to inhibit P-gp, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and BSEP. However, PBPK simulations suggest that rilzabrutinib does not have any relevant effect on P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 substrate (see section 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship

## Plasma exposure and BTK occupancy

Rilzabrutinib has a short duration of systemic exposure with a long duration of action on the target due to its slow dissociation from BTK. At therapeutic doses in healthy participants, durable BTK occupancy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was observed over a 24-hour period.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## General toxicity

In the 6-month repeat-dose toxicology study in rats, the oesophagus (haemorrhage), duodenum (haemorrhage), stomach (haemorrhage), brain (inflammation; neutrophilic inflammation), uterus (distended, pyometra), cervix (distended uterus), vagina (distended uterus), and ovaries (distended uterus) were identified as target organs. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was 150 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure margin of 4.5-fold) for males and 50 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure margin of 3.7-fold) for females. No rilzabrutinib-related changes, with the exception of the brain, were observed at the end of the 4-week recovery period. No evidence of neurodegeneration or cellular alteration in the brain was observed.

In a 9-month repeat-dose study in dogs, the stomach (increased intraepithelial lymphocytes with mucosal atrophy) and liver (Kupffer cell pigment, Kupffer cell hypertrophy and increase in ALT and AST) were identified as target organs. the NOAEL of this study was considered to be 30 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure margin of 0.4- to 0.5-fold). At the end of the 4-week recovery period, with the exception of Kupffer cell pigment, the liver and stomach findings had reversed.

## Carcinogenicity/genotoxicity

Rilzabrutinib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutagenicity (Ames) assay, was not clastogenic in an in vitro human peripheral lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay, nor was it clastogenic in an in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats.

## Rilzabrutinib was not carcinogenic in a 6-month transgenic mouse study.

In a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, rilzabrutinib-related thyroid adenomas and carcinomas were observed for male rats at 100 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure margin of 2.4-fold). The non-carcinogenic dose was considered to be 30 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure margin of 0.64-fold) for males and 5 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure margin of 0.13-fold) for females. Transcriptomic analysis suggests that thyroid tumours in rats derive from rilzabrutinib-mediated perturbation of thyroid hormone maintenance. This nongenotoxic effect was discovered to be specific for rats with a mechanism not considered relevant to humans, therefore, the potential for thyroid tumours in humans is considered low. In this study, the non-neoplastic observation of erythrocytosis was noted for the mesenteric lymph nodes.

## Developmental and reproductive toxicity

In the combined male and female rat fertility study, no rilzabrutinib-related effects were observed for any reproductive parameters. The NOAEL for fertility, reproductive performance, and early embryonic development was considered to be 300 mg/kg/day (HED 48 mg/kg/day), the highest dose evaluated.

In definitive rat and rabbit embryo-foetal toxicity studies, no rilzabrutinib-related foetal development and foetal external, visceral, or skeletal malformations were observed. The embryo-foetal development NOAELs were 300 and 100 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively, which were the highest doses evaluated. Exposure ratios (AUC) at the embryo-foetal NOAEL compared to human clinical exposure at 400 mg twice daily, were 11.1- and 4.5-fold, in rats and rabbits, respectively. Skeletal variations of unknown relevance were observed at the same highest dose levels. Variations consisted in a shift in

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the number of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae (rats and rabbits) and an increase in the incidence of supernumerary rib pairs (rats). No such variations were observed at 150 and 30 mg/kg/day (resulting in 11.9- and 0.24-fold of clinical exposure at 400 mg twice daily, respectively) in rats and rabbits, respectively. In an exploratory rat embryo-foetal range-finding study, increased post-implantation loss and incidence of early resorption, and decreased foetal weight were observed at 500 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure margin of 21.8-fold). Foetal external, visceral and skeletal changes were observed at 500 mg/kg/day. No malformations were noted at ≤ 150 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure margin of 10-fold). In an exploratory rabbit embryo-foetal range-finding study, a slight increase in the incidence of early resorption was observed at 150 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure margin of 5.6-fold). Foetal visceral changes were observed at 150 mg/kg/day (AUC exposure margin of 5.6-fold).

In a pre-/postnatal developmental toxicity study investigating the effects of orally administered rilzabrutinib, the maternal (F0) systemic toxicity NOAEL was considered to be 50 mg/kg/day (HED 8.1 mg/kg/day). The NOAEL for F1 neonatal/developmental toxicity was considered to be 150 mg/kg/day (HED 24.2 mg/kg/day) and the NOAELs for F1 parental system toxicity, F1 reproductive toxicity, and F2 embryonic toxicity were considered to be 300 mg/kg/day (HED 48 mg/kg/day).

## Other Toxicity Studies

Rilzabrutinib did not show any phototoxicity potential in the in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test.

## What is in this leaflet

1. What WAYRILZ is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you take WAYRILZ
3. How to take WAYRILZ
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store WAYRILZ
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What WAYRILZ is and what it is used for

WAYRILZ contains the active substance rilzabrutinib. It belongs to a group of medicines called Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

WAYRILZ is used to treat adults with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) when prior treatments for ITP have not worked well enough. ITP is an autoimmune disease, in which the body´s own immune system attacks and destroys platelets in the blood, causes fatigue, and increases risk of bleeding. Platelets are needed to help create clots and stop bleeding.

The active substance in WAYRILZ, rilzabrutinib, works by blocking Bruton´s tyrosine kinase, a protein in the body that plays a role on the immune system (the body´s defences). By blocking this protein, WAYRILZ can decrease the destruction of blood platelets and help increase the number of healthy platelets in the body. This helps reduce the risk of bleeding.

## 2. What you need to know before you take WAYRILZ

## Do not take WAYRILZ

- if you are allergic to rilzabrutinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if:

- you have an infection or if you often get infections.
- If you have liver problems

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- you have a heart condition known as congenital short QT syndrome or a family history of this syndrome. Taking rilzabrutinib could make this condition worse.

## Children and adolescents

## Other medicines and WAYRILZ

Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, especially if you take any of the following, but not limited to. This is because rilzabrutinib may affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines can affect the way rilzabrutinib works.

- Medicines that may increase the concentration of rilzabrutinib in the blood and thus may increase side effects
- o Ritonavir, itraconazole, and fluconazole (used to treat viral and fungal infections)
- o Clarithromycin and erythromycin (used to treat bacterial infections)
- o Verapamil and diltiazem (used to treat high blood pressure)
- Medicines that may reduce the concentration of rilzabrutinib in the blood and thus may reduce efficacy

- o Carbamazepine and phenytoin (which is an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer)
- o Proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole (used to treat acid reflux or heartburn)
- If treatment with a gastric acid reducing agent is required, consider using an H2 blocker medicine, such as famotidine and cimetidine, or antacids (used to treat acid reflux). Take rilzabrutinib at least 2 hours before taking these medicines.
- Medicines whose concentration could be increased by rilzabrutinib and thus may increase their side effects. Caution should be taken when these medicines are taken with rilzabrutinib.
- o Midazolam (used to treat fits (seizures) or epilepsy)
- o Cyclosporin and tacrolimus (used to reduce immune reactions and prevent organ rejection)
- o Digoxin (used to treat abnormal heart rhythm or disorders)
- Medicines that may be less effective when taken with rilzabrutinib
- o Hormonal birth control. It is not known if rilzabrutinib interferes with how well hormonal contraceptives work. Alternative or additional forms of contraception should be considered.
