activities independently, or/and prevents decline in renal function and reduces total mortality.

In view of the preliminary findings in the ALTITUDE trial (aliskiren treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with renal dysfunction on top of standard RAS blocking therapy) which was terminated early in December 2011 based on futility and potential increases in adverse events in the aliskiren group, it was agreed with regulatory authorities to contraindicate the use of aliskiren in diabetic hypertensive patients on concomitant RAS blocker therapy. Many patients enrolled in APOLLO were diabetic and were receiving another agent acting on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) such as an ACEI or and ARB as standard of care, and it was decided to exclude them from APOLLO. Following the exclusion of diabetics from the study, Novartis concluded that the study in its current design would not provide the needed information about the efficacy and safety of aliskiren in elderly hypertensive patients within the required timeframe and decided in agreement with Health Authorities to terminate the study early.

At the time of the early termination of the APOLLO study, a total of 1759 patients had been randomized as against the originally planned 11,000 patients. A total of 25 primary CV composite endpoints had accrued in the study as against the planned 2000. These low numbers significantly limit interpretation of the results.

The CHMP considers that the presented data set does not add new significant information either for safety or efficacy of aliskiren because of the study limitations (premature termination of the study). The safety findings are consistent with the known safety profile of aliskiren in the general hypertensive population. Despite the fact that the

The CHMP considers that this new data does not warrant any SmPC changes. The premature termination of the APOLLO study leaves unsolved the problem of the dose- response of aliskiren in elderly hypertensive patients. This area of missing information is reflected in the RMP of the aliskiren containing products and appropriate pharmacovigilance activities are employed in order to collect the needed data. Study CSPP100A2370 (ASSESS) is currently planned as a follow up to APOLLO, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alikiren containing products in elderly patients. The CHMP concludes that the worksharing variation is approvable and the risk/benefit balance of alsikiren containing products in the approved indication remains authorised   |

This paper was reviewed by the MAH and since the results with orange or apple juice were pertinent to the use of aliskiren, an update to the Summary of Product Characteristics was proposed in order to add a statement for not recommending the concomitant use of aliskiren with orange or apple juice. When combined with all available data (clinical trial, literature and post-marketing), the results of the study described in the above mentioned paper showed that the bioavailability of aliskiren is most sensitive to co- administration with food in general. The available clinical data do not suggest an additive effect of different types of foods and/or drinks, however the potential for decreased aliskiren bioavailability due to this additive effect has not been studied and therefore cannot be excluded. Literature data indicate that vegetable components or extracts may decrease aliskiren bioavailability. Therefore, the CHMP considered that based on the available data the concomitant consumption of vegetable components or extracts (including herbal teas and fruit juices) should be avoided in conjunction with aliskiren intake. authorised   |

Update the SmPC section 5.1 of all aliskiren containing products in order to reflect the relevant efficacy and safety information reported in ASTRONAUT (CSPP100A2368) Clinical Study Report.

C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH

with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular and/or patients with renal events, ALI at a target dose of 300 mg o.d. (compared to placebo), on top of conventional treatment (either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker), reduces cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. On 14 December 2011, the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) of the ALTITUDE trial recommended the study to be halted due to futility and potential for excess harm in patients receiving ALI (non-fatal stroke, renal complications, hyperkalaemia and hypotension in this high-risk study population was observed).

The submitted clinical study report confirms previously submitted and assessed ASTRONAUT preliminary results and did not show a significant benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy including an ACEI or ARB in patients hospitalized with a recent episode of AHF, neither with respect to the primary endpoint (CV death or HF rehospitalization within 6 months), nor with respect to key secondary endpoint (first confirmed occurrence of either CV death or HF rehospitalisation within 12 months). The subgroup analysis showed a statistically significant interaction of treatment by diabetes status at baseline for the composite of CV death and HF re-hospitalization within 12 months and all-cause mortality within 12 months, showing excess of CV events and the increase in all-cause death in the aliskiren group in diabetic patients. In the subgroup of patients with diabetes mellitus the hazard ratio was 1.64 in favour of placebo (95% Confidence Interval: 1.15-2.33), whereas the hazard ratio in the subgroup of patients without diabetes was 0.69 in favour of aliskiren (95% Confidence Interval: 0.50-0.94); p-value for interaction = 0.0003.

An increased incidence of hyperkalaemia (20.9% versus 17.5%), renal impairment/renal failure (16.6% versus 12.1%) and hypotension (17.1% versus 12.6%) was observed in the aliskiren group compared with placebo. As it concerns the impact of the ASTRONAUT preliminary results on the safety profile of aliskiren and on the product information, the CHMP considers that the currently approved aliskiren product information is adequately updated in this regard in sections 4.3 and 4.4 (i.e. contraindication of dual RAAS blockade in diabetic and/or renal disease patients, and a warning for dual blockade use in all other patients). The CHMP concludes that the presented data doesn't raise any additional safety concerns besides those already reflected in the product information and that the overall the benefit/risk of aliskiren containing products remains unchanged. The agreed text included in section 5.1 of the SmPC is considered by the CHMP as appropriately reflecting the relevant findings from ASTRONAUT study.

The post-marketing data doesn't indicate a higher incidence of AEs attributable to a reduced torasemide effect when aliskiren is taken together with torasemide. These observations don't support the DDI hypothesis nevertheless such interaction cannot be out- ruled either. Therefore, the CHMP accepted the MAH's proposal to include a warning statement concerning the concomitant use of aliskiren and torasemide in patients with heart failure (SmPC section 4.4) and to present the available information on the potential for drug-drug interaction between aliskiren and torasemide (SmPC section 4.5). authorised                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The WSA updated section 4.4. of the SmPCs of all aliskiren containing products with regard to the combined use of agents acting on the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)) and the associated risk of symptomatic hypotension. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- product | 30/05/2013 | 27/06/2013 no longer | and Labelling Based on a review of the published literature and available clinical trial and post marketing data the CHMP agreed with the MAH's conclusion that there is a higher risk of hypotension in patients taking aliskiren in combination with other agents acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Therefore, the MAH's proposal to update section 4.4. of the SmPCs of all aliskiren containing products with regard to the combined use of agents acting on the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (dual blockade of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)) and the associated risk of symptomatic hypotension was found acceptable by the CHMP. |

| WS/0280   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. The MAH proposed the update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) in order to update the information regarding aliskiren interaction with furosemide following completion of the drug-to-drug interaction study CSPP100A2255. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the | 13/12/2012 | 21/01/2013 no | SmPC longer | The MAH performed the present study [CSPP100A2255] with the aim of assessing whether a pharmacodynamic (diuretic efficacy) interaction exists between aliskiren and furosemide in heart failure patients. The study assessed the effect of a single (150 mg) and multiple doses (150 and 300 mg/day) of aliskiren on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of once daily 60 mg furosemide at steady state in patients with chronic heart failure. Overall, the study data suggest that aliskiren may decrease the efficacy of furosemide. Results of study CSPP100A2255 are the basis of a proposal for a modification of SmPC text to update the sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC. authorised                                      |

| WS/0277 | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. Update of the existing amlodipine information in section 4.5 of the SmPC in line with the revised drug interactions section for Norvasc (amlodipine monotherapy) approved as part of the recent article 30 procedure EMEA/H/A-30/1288 for amlodipine products. In addition, section 4.5 of the SmPC has been updated with information about the potential drug interaction between amlodipine and simvastatin. This variation followed a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data Medicinal product | 18/10/2012 no | The following information was included in the SmPC as part of this procedure: Administration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as bioavailability may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects. Concomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to significant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic variations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus be required. There is no data available regarding the effect of CYP3A4 inducers on amlodipine. The concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum) may give a lower plasma concentration of amlodipine. Amlodipine should be used with caution together with CYP3A4 inducers. Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to limit the dose of simvastatin to 20 mg |

Renal excretion only accounts for 0.6% of the administered dose. No adjustment of the initial dosage is required in patients with mild to severe renal impairment, however caution should be exercised in patients with severe renal impairment. The MAH has conducted a study (Study SPP100A2262) to characterize the pharmacokinetics and safety of aliskiren in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients receiving haemodialysis (HD). It is concluded that no dose adjustment is needed in patients with ESRD. A novel and important finding of the study is that aliskiren cannot be efficiently removed by HD. Based on the data of Study SPP100A2262, the MAH proposes to change the section 4.9 and 5.2 of the SmPC. |

|           | On 20 December 2010, the European Commission initiated a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for all aliskiren-containing medicinal products authorised in the centralised procedure and requested the CHMP to assess all the available data and its impact on the risk benefit balance for aliskiren-containing medicinal products and to give its opinion on whether the marketing authorisations for these products should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. The scope of the review was to assess the risk benefit balance of all aliskiren-containing medicinal products in the approved indication of hypertension in light of the emerging safety data from the ALTITUDE study in patients with diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular and renal events which lead to the premature study termination.   | II and PL A20-16-Assessment Report-Article no longer authorised   |

The most frequent are osteoarthritis, gout, bursitis, infectious diseases, injury, osteomyelitis, and autoimmune diseases. However, it is also considered that hypersensitivity/allergic reactions sometimes manifest with systemic involvement including arthralgia. Joint swelling is also very commonly associated with the above mentioned joint disorders, or could be linked to peripheral oedema or to systemic manifestation of hypersensitivity reactions. This review focused on arthralgia and joint swelling cases where underlying hypersensitivity reactions likely played a role in the development of arthralgia and where both conditions could have been due to the direct effect of aliskiren. In response to the request from CHMP, MAH conducted a comprehensive review of all cases of 'Arthrlagia'. Based on this new analysis, CHMP requested the addition of the ADR 'Arthralgia' in section 4.8 of aliskiren containing product |

| WS/0167   | This was an application for a variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. This type II variation concerns an update of section 4.5 of the SPC in view of the results of study CSPP100A2112 investigating the potential interaction between aliskiren and grapefruit juice in healthy subjects. Administration of grapefruit juice with aliskiren resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of aliskiren. Co-administration with aliskiren 150 mg resulted in a 61% decrease in aliskiren AUC and co-administration with aliskiren 300 mg resulted in a 38% decrease in aliskiren AUC. This decrease is likely due to an inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide- mediated uptake of aliskiren by grapefruit juice in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, because of the risk of therapeutic failure, grapefruit juice should not be taken together with Rasilamlo/Riprazo HCT. This application was submitted for a Type II variation following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.

|           | Update of sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC to include information about the efficacy and safety of aliskiren in elderly and very elderly hypertensive patients based on data from the AGELESS study. This application is submitted in fulfilment of the FUM 002 for Riprazo HCT, Sprimeo HCT and Rasilamlo. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data   |               | hypertensive patients. Overall the results of this clinical study support the conclusion of a positive benefit/risk ratio in the use of the aliskiren+HCTZ as antihypertensive treatment of elderly and very elderly patients. However, the review of available data also suggests different response to the treatment of elderly and very elderly demonstrating no clinically meaningful additional blood pressure reduction by increasing the dose to 300 mg in the majority of elderly patients. Sections 4.2 has been updated with this information. Furthermore, section 5.1 has been updated by including information about the efficacy and safety of aliskiren in elderly and very elderly hypertensive patients. longer authorised   |
