The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

TED-C14-006 was a phase 3, multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double blind, safety, efficacy, andPKstudyinchildren,agedless than18yearswithintestinalfailureduetoshortbowelsyndrome (o) a go ps e   a nn e   ao s  () randomisedtoeither0.025or0.05mg/kgsubcutaneousoncedailyinadouble-blindedmanner.Fifty subjects enrolled in the teduglutide treatment arm and 9 subjects enrolled in the SoC arm.

The percentage of subjects achieving a ≥20% reduction in PN/IV volume increased over the course of the 24-week treatment period in both teduglutide dose groups but not the subjects treated with SoC. BothteduglutidedosegroupsexperiencedgreaterreductionsinPN/IVvolumeandcalories,daysper weekonPN/IVandhoursperday,increasesinenteralnutritionalvolumeandcaloriesfrombaselineto dosageschedules of teduglutide.Thus,the studyoverall demonstrated aclinicalrelevantefficacy of teduglutide. However, no formal statistical tests were used to document efficacy.

Teduglutide was generally well tolerated by paediatric patients with SBS. The safety profile was favourable and consistent with the prior 12-week paediatric study, the underlying disease, and previous experiencewithteduglutidein adultpatientswithSBS.

Overall,itisendorsed thattheMAH includesinformationregardingchildrenless than18years of age based on a24-week study(TED-C14-006) insections 4.2,4.4,4.8 and 5.1 of theSmPC forRevestive. s recommendedafterwhichtreatmenteffectshouldbeevaluated\"hasbeenacceptedinsection4.2 provided that the teduglutide treatment should be evaluated after 12 weeks in children below the age of two years.

In conclusion, thevariation is recommended for approval.

## 5. Introduction

peptide secreted byL-cellsof the distal intestine.Teduglutideunder the tradenameRevestive?first received marketing authorizationinthe EuropeanUnionvia centralizedprocedurefor thetreatment of short bowel syndrome (SBS) on 30 Aug 2012. On 29 Jun 2016, the European Commission granted an extensionof theMarketAuthorizationfor teduglutide(Revestive)forthetreatmentofpatients aged 1 yearandabovewithSBS.

The variation is to cover the submission of a clinical study report (TED-C14-006); a 24-Week Doubleblind, Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacodynamic Study investigating two doses of teduglutide in pediatric Subjects Through 17Years of Age with Short Bowel Syndrome who are Dependent onParenteral Support

## Assessor'scomment

Descriptivestatisticsofexposureparametersofteduglutidebyagefora0.o5mg/kgdosepresentedin Table 6 has been age stratified accordingly.However, the number of subjects(n) should be provided for each age group. (oc).

Mean Cmaxss of teduglutide in adult and adolescent subjects were 39.7 and 29.7 ng/mL, respectively. For pediatric patients, Cmaxss values ranged from 21.1 to 77.4 ng/mL and consistent with those in adults and adolescents (19.3 to 73.4 ng/mL). The Cmaxs of teduglutide in the neonate patient (n=1, 1 to &lt; 2 years of age group) was within 26% and 2% of those observed in adults and adolescents, respectively. The Cmaxss of teduglutide in the neonate patient (1 to &lt; 2 years of age) was consistent with thoseobserved inotherpediatric groups.MeanAuCssvalueswereage-dependent andgradually decreased with age from a mean of 252 ng.h/mL in adults to127 ng.h/mL in pediatric patients between2and3yearsofageand85.1ng.h/mLintheneonatepatientbetween1and&lt;2yearsof age.It is tobe noted that a 6-fold decrease in weight(from 60.1 kg in adults to 10.5 kg in 1 to&lt;2 years) resulted in an approximate 3-fold decrease in AUCss (252 and 85.1 ng.h/mL in adults and 1 to &lt;2yearsoldagegroup,respectively).

## Assessor's comment

ThePKmodelhasoverallbeenpresentedinaccordancewiththeEMAGuidelineonreporting the results ofpopulationpharmacokinetic analyses(Doc.ref.CHMP/EWP/185990/06,June 2007),and are SBS. However, only one child in the age group 1-2 years was included in the PK model. The MAH (OC).

## 6.3. Discussion

The objective of the study (PK model) was to enrich the dataset with additional Phase I clinical studies 006)to ultimately support dosing inpediatric patients.

The MAH hasprovided a sufficientintroduction to theTeduglutide(SHP633)POPPKmodel inpediatric patientswithSBS，andtheobjectivesoftheanalysishasbeendescribedsufficiently.Furthermore,the MAH has overall described the studies from which the data included in the analysis originate, sufficiently.Of notice,CL0600-004,TED-C13-003 and TED-C14-006 were pediatric studies covered by theEMEA-000482-PIP01-08-M04.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TheMAHhasdescribed thehandlingofconcentrationsvaluesbelowBLQ.However,withreferenceto CHMP/EWP/185990/06,June2007),theMAH isaskedto:

- Apply the type of bioanalytical methods used and the LLoQ for each analyte in each method.
- Discuss the possible consequences of ignoring the concentrations below BLQ/LLoQ. (oc)

However, the pediatric age groups should be stratified as follows: &lt;2, 2-&lt;6, 6-&lt;12, 12-&lt;18 years.

## (OC)

The stepwise covariate building model procedure has been presented adequately, herein the statistical significancecriteriaforcovariateselection.

The MAH should elucidate the handling of BLQ samples further, and discuss the possible consequences in relation to the final model. (oc).

TheMAHhaspresentedthepcVPCs ofthefinal model accordingly.Themodelappearstocapture the teduglutideconcentrationswell.

In the presentation of result in general, the MAH should provide the number of pediatric trial participants in each age group as follows: &lt;2 years, 2-&lt;6, 6-&lt;12, 12-&lt;18 years. (0c).

Table 6 has been age stratified accordingly. However, the number of subjects (n) should be provided for each age group. (oc).

The MAH should provide the number/percentage of subjects with SBS and Crohn' disease, respectively. (OC).

ThePK model has overall been presented in accordance with the EMA Guideline on reporting the resultsofpopulationpharmacokineticanalyses(Doc.ref.CHMP/EWP/185990/06,June2007),andare SBS. However, only one child in the age group 1-2 years was included in the PK model. The MAH is requestedtodiscussandjustifythevalidityoftheresultsinrelationtotheposologyinchildren&lt;2 years. (oc).

mg/kg/dayand 0.05mg/kg/day.Randomizationacross dose groupswas stratifiedbyage:&lt;1year,1 to&lt;12years,12to&lt;17years,and 17to&lt;18years.

Subjects in both arms followed the same visit schedule. After the screening period, subjects visited the site atbaseline,weeklyforthefirst2weeks(ie,Weeks 1and 2),and theneveryotherweekthrough Week 12(Weeks 4,6,8,10,and 12).Forthe remainderof the treatment period,subjects visited the sites once every3weeks(ie,Weeks15,18,21,and24).Forallother study weeks,subjects were contactedbytelephone.Atallsitevisitsandtelephonecontacts,safetywasmonitoredandnutritional supportwasreviewed andadjustedasneeded.Attheendof thetreatmentperiod(Week24/Endof Treatment[EOT]),allsubjectsentered a4-weekfollow-upperioduntil theendofstudy(Week28/End of Study [Eos]) during which time no study drug (ie, teduglutide) was administered.A final visit occurredatWeek28，4weeksafterEOT.

## Assessor's comments

Study design, including selection of study groups, randomization and blinding, and dose selection are appropriate. The SoC treatment arm serves as an observational cohort for the 24-week treatment period. Although the relevance of an observational cohort is acknowledged, comparisons between SOC and teduglutide treatment arms may be biased. Selection criteria for inclusion into the SoC treatment armthereforebecomesimportant.

TheMAHshoulddiscusstheselectioncriteriaforinclusionintheSOCtreatmentarminmoredetails, and in which way they may influence(orhave influenced) the interpretation of results.(oc).

Note: Percentages are based on the mumber of subjects in the safety analysis set in each treament group.

E=events: TEAE=treatment-emergent adverse event.

Note: Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) are defined as adverse events that started or worsened on or after the date of first dose for treatment arms and adverse events that started or worsened on or after the baseline visit for standard of care group. Adverse events with an unknown date of onset and a stop date after the start of the date of first dose or unknown are included as TEAEs.

Note: Adverse events were coded to primary system organ class and prefelred term using MedDRA dictionary. Version 19.1.

Note: Subjects are counted no more than once for incidence, but can be counted multiple times for the mumber of events.

Note: Primary system organ classes are sorted by alphabetically and preferred terms are sorted by the descending order of the frequency of Total Tecuglutide treament group.

Note: Percentages are based on the mumber of subjects in the safety analysis set in each treatment group.

E=Total number of events in each treatment group:; TEAE=Treamment-emergent adverse event.

Note: Treatment Emergent Adverse Eventis (TEAEs) are defined as adverse events that started or worsened on or after the date of first dose for treatment groups and adverse events that started or worsened on or after the baseline visit for standard of care group. Adverse events with an unknown date of onset and a stop date after the start of the date of first dose or unknown are included as TEAEs.

Note: Subjects are counted no more than once for incidence. Only maxinum severity per subject per system organ class (per PT) is counted for incidence and percentage.

E=events, TESAE=treatment-emergent serious adverse event.

Note: Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Evenis (TESAEs) are defined as serious adverse evenis that started or worsened on or afier the date of first dose for treatment arms and serious adverse events that started or worsened on or after the baseline visit for standard of care group.

Note: Adverse events were coded to primary system organ class and prefered term using MedDRA dictionary, Version 19.1.

Serious adverse events with an umknowm date of onset and a stop date after the start of the date of first dose or unknown are included as TESAEs. Note: Subjects are counted no more than once for incidence, but can be coumted multiple times for the nuber of events.

Note: Primary system organ classes are sorted by alphabetically and preferred terms are sorted by the descending order of the fequency of Total Teduglutide treatment group.

2. 2.The MAH has presented the covariates selected for the model sufficiently. However, in addition the pediatric age groups should be stratified as follows: &lt;2, 2-&lt;6, 6-&lt;12, 12-&lt;18 years.
3. 3.The MAH should elucidate the handling of BLQ samples further, and discuss the possible consequences inrelation to thefinal model.
4. Descriptive statistics of exposure parameters of teduglutide by age for a 0.05 mg/kg dose should be provided for each age group.
5. The MAH should provide the number/percentage of subjects with SBS and Crohn' disease, respectively.

Mean Cmaxss values in the 2 to &lt; 6 and 6 to &lt;12 years group were consistent (33.1 and 34.5 ng/mL, respectively).

Mean AuCss values were age-dependent and gradually decreased with age from a mean of 252 ng.h/mL in adults to 122 ng.h/mL in pediatric patients 2 to &lt; 6 years of age and 85.1 ng.h/mL in the patient &lt;2 years of age.

## AssessmentoftheMAH'sresponse

The MAH has stratified the age groups as requested, which is endorsed. The Table illustrates that some age groups contains very few subjects. The MAH should justify that only three adolescents, 12- &lt;18 groups makes it difficult to interpret data adequately for the respective age groups. The question is thereforenotconsidered fully resolved.(oc).

## AssessmentoftheMAH'sresponse

TheMAHhasprovided anoverviewoverteduglutideplasmaconcentrationsfor theonlychild&lt;2years of age. Plasma concentrations appears to be consistent with the range of those observed in older children(2-6years).However,data,whichconsists oftotally 4plasma concentrationmeasurements, ofwhichthelatestmeasurementwasconductedafter4weeks,isfoundtoolimitedtosupport teduglutide treatment in paediatric patients&lt; 2 years after 12 weeks as already approved. The total numberoffourplasmaconcentrationmeasurementsinpaediatricpatients&lt;2yearsisnew information, which has not been provided in the Application previously. The Question has therefore been upgraded to a Major Concern. In SmPC section 4.2, the MAH should provide the following information: \"Data does not support teduglutide treatment in children &lt; 2 years of age beyond 12 weeks\".

## MAH's response

In the TED-C14-006 study there was one event of ileus. This event was serious, moderate in severity, relatedtoteduglutide,startedonstudyday133,andresolvedonstudyday135.Thestudydrugwas interruptedduringthistime andwas thenrestarted.TheMAHhasdeemedthiseventtobeunrelated toteduglutideforthefollowingreasons:

- 1.This subject hadprior similareventsbefore startingteduglutide.As described in theSAEnarratives screening period, but was subsequently rescreened.
2. There was a time to onset latency of approximately 4 months following the start of the study medication.
- 3.Therewasnorecurrenceoftheeventafterteduglutidetreatmentwasresumed.

In the TED-C14-006 study there was one event of faecaloma. This event was duplicated in the clinical database,once asserious,related toteduglutide,beginning onstudyday143andresolving onstudy restarted.Thesubjectpresentedwithabdominaldistensionanddifficultywithspontaneousdefecation. Anabdominalultrasoundshowedfecalstasisintheleftcolonandrectum,withmarkeddilationofthe loops in the central abdominal quadrants confirmed by abdominal x-ray.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

require medical intervention, usually with a combination of enemas, laxatives, manual disimpaction, and occasionally endoscopic or surgical intervention. The spontaneous passage of stool by this patient and the lack of clear radiographic features of a fecaloma suggest that this may not be the most accuratetermtodescribetheevent.

TheMAHhasdeemedthiseventtobeunrelated toteduglutidefor thefollowingreasons:

Documented bowel habits in this subject are not consistent with chronic constipation. This subject had 1-2 bowel movements daily for the 2 days prior to every clinic visit. The Bristol stool form was 6 (mushy) at every study visit through study day 107 (week 15). The Bristol stool form was 1 and 2 (hard) on study day 125 and 126 (week 18), but on study days 146 and 147 (week 21), which occurred during the SAE, the typical Bristol stool form was recorded as 6.

Therewasa timetoonsetlatencyof almost5months.

There was no recurrence of any stool with a Bristol form less than 6 after teduglutide was restarted.

A review ofintegrated safety data from the completedpediatric studies TED-C14-006 and TED-C13003 evaluated the frequencies events of constipation, faecaloma, and ileus.The overall frequency of constipationwassimilarbetweentheteduglutideandSoCtreatedsubjects.

Acid-base derangements are a known complication of short bowel syndrome.Acidosis in SBS can occur as a result of imbalance in chloride and acetate in the parenteral support, bicarbonate losses in the stoolduetomalabsorptivediarrhea,andd-lacticacidosisduetosmallintestinalbacterialovergrowth. These causes are all proximally related to intestinal malabsorption, which improves with teduglutide treatment.

Based on the data analysispresented above,further precautions in thepediatricpopulation arenot required.

The MAH respectfully notes that approval of thepediatric indication was based on the results of the 28 subjects: 10 in each teduglutide dose group and 8 in the standard of care arm.

The range of body weight in adolescents (n=7) was 38.0 to 48.7 kg. Body weight in adult subjects overlapped with those observed in adolescents (i.e., a total of 11 adult subjects presented body weight valueslessthan48.7kg).

Overall, a large range of body weight was available to robustly assess the relationship between body weight and PK parameters (CL/F and Vc/F) of teduglutide.

Basedontheoverlappingbodyweightinadolescentandadultsubjects,thenextpartoftheanalysis focused onbody weight as 1) a continuous parameter across age groups, and 2)the primary parameter explaining differences in PK parameters across age groups.

The relationship between PK parameters of teduglutide and body weight are presented in Figure 1.

## Question 5

TheMAH states that1o0%reductioninPN/IVvolume(completeweaningofPN/IVsupport)atweek 24was a predefined efficacy endpoint,which is endorsed.None the less,in the SmPC the MAH should emphasizethatcompleteweaningwasnotaprimaryendpointandthatthegroupsinvestigatedwere inhomogeneous.

## MAH's response

The sponsor acknowledges the assessor's request. Due to the small sample sizes and the open label designof thestudies,thereareslightdifferencesinthepatientsenrolledintheSoCarmversusthe teduglutide arm,however,the sponsor respectfully disagrees thatthe groupsinvestigated could be considered inhomogeneous, based on the baseline disease characteristics such as SBS history/etiology, percent remaining colon, etc. In order to address the assessor's request to denote weaning as not a primary endpoint, the sponsor proposes the following revisions to the text:

- ·TED-C13-003 (N=6 per subject; N= 219 samples in total):
- 0 Week 1: Pre-dose, and at 1 and 6 hours post-dose
- 0 Week 4: Pre-dose, and at 2 and 4 hours post-dose
- TED-C14-006 (N=4 per subject; N=187 samples in total):
- 0 Pre-dose, at 1, 2 and 4 hours post-dose at start of treatment

A total of 6 PK samples were collected for assessment of teduglutide PK in each patient 1-&lt;2 years in studyTED-C13-003.Inwhich,a total of3patients 1-&lt;2yearswere enrolled.

As aresult,a totalof18samplescollected atWeek1 andWeek4wereavailableinpatients1-&lt;2 yearsenrolledinstudyTED-C13-003.

The time-independent properties of teduglutide were previously demonstrated as part of a population PKanalysisbasedon theclinicalpackage.The time-independentpropertiesof teduglutideinadult pediatric patients (1-&lt;2 years, study TED-C13-003) are discussed below.

Asexpected,thePKconcentrationsof teduglutideinthe singlepatient1-&lt;2yearswerecomparableto those observed in the same age patients (TED-C13-003).

Given the PK time-impendency properties of teduglutide in patients with SBS, data collected in one patient 1-&lt;2 years in Study TED-C14-006 are reasonably combined with other 3 patients 1-&lt;2 years for PK, efficacy and safety evaluation, supporting an extrapolation between pediatric patent groups and betweenpediatricpatientsandadultpatients，especiallyforpatientswithSBS.

## Population PK Analysis

The population PK model provided an adequate goodness-of-fit of teduglutide concentrations in pediatricpatientsenrolledinstudiesTED-C13-003and TED-C14-006.Overall,PKparameters in patients1-&lt;2yearswerewellcharacterizedwiththepopulationPKmodel aspresentedinFigure6.

Line of identity, LOESS: Locally weighted smoothing scatterplot function; IDENT= Line of identity. Conc = Concentration; PK= Pharmacokinetic. Note: only values above the LOQ are presented in the above figure. Samples collected between the first dose and the lag timeof absorption had PRED and IPRED=0. Those samples are not presented on the log-scale plots. Red and black circles represent the observed concentrations in patients 1-&lt;2 years and 2-17 years, respectively.

PK parameters of teduglutide in various age groups are presented in Table 1. Since time-independency has been confirmed across pediatric age groups and pediatric and adult populations, the population PK modeling and simulation approach has provided basis (along with other clinical observations) for the extrapolationbetweenthepopulations.

## Conclusions

Based on the above discussions, similarity in dose-exposure response PK properties (timeindependency), similarity in clinical manifestation and treatment of the disease, and clinical efficacy and safety observations between pediatric age groups and between pediatric and adult populations for up to 24 weeks of treatment, Shire believes that clinical observations obtained in four1-&lt;2 year 006),although limited, are sufficient to support an extrapolation between populations and support safe andefficaciousSCdailydoseof0.05mg/kginpediatricpatientswithSBS(1-&lt;2years)and tosupport theproposedchangestotheSmPC.

## AssessmentoftheMAH'sresponse

TheApplicanthas argued thattheclinicalobservationsobtainedin:\"obtained infour1-&lt;2year pediatricsubjects(3subjectswerestudiedinTED-C13-003and1subjectwasstudiedinTED-C14006),\" is sufficient to support extrapolation between populations. However, such an extrapolation is based on several assumptions, and thus paediatric data from four patients in the specifically vulnerable age group&lt;2 years is still considered too limited.

Thus, the following wording in section 4.2 in the SmPC could be acceptable:

\"A treatment period of 6 months is recommended after which treatment effect should be evaluated. In childrenbelowtheageoftwoyears,treatmentshouldbeevaluatedafter12weeks.Therearenodata available in paediatric patients after 6 months.\"

The Applicant is though encouraged to introduce the data and results for the respective age group in theSmPCsection5.1inaccordancetotheSmPCguideline.

## AssessmentoftheMAH'sresponse

TheMAHfinds that thesamplesizeis toosmall to drawmeaningfulstatistical comparisons across age groups, and the MAH thus suggest the text revision as follows marked with tracked changes:
