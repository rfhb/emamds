This application was submitted for a group of variations consisting of Type II variations following a worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 17/03/2011   | 20/04/2011   | SmPC and PL | Review of the safety information from Lilly Safety System and literature data sources pertaining to the risk of fluid retention (including oedema and peripheral oedema) with the use of insulin lispro suggests a causal association between insulin lispro and the adverse event of oedema. Therefore it was proposed to provide information regarding oedema in the adverse event sections of the product information. Analysis of the patients exposed to insulin lispro between 1 January 1983 through 31 August 2010 confirmed causal association between insulin lispro and the adverse event of oedema. Consequently Summary of Product Characteristics section 4.8 is updated by adding a warning on an increased incidence of oedema. It was agreed not to mention frequency as the majority of the reports occur within the first weeks of treatment. The Package Leaflet section 4 is updated accordingly. |

After the review of the available evidence, during its October 2010 meeting the PhVWP has concluded this review with a recommendation to the CHMP on the need to harmonise the SmPC and PL for all insulin products by including appropriate warning. The CHMP endorsed this recommendation, and in this context the Committee agreed that all centrally authorised insulin containing products should include warning on increased cardiac failure when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin, especially in patients with predisposing factors in the in the section 4.4 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL.   |

| II/0035   | Update of section 4.5 of the SPC and Package Leaflet to add angiotensin II receptor blockers in the list of medicinal products that may reduce insulin requirements. The details of local representatives are updated. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   | 22/03/2007   | 02/05/2007   | SmPC and PL   | The MAH reviewed their safety database over the period 01 January 1983 - 28 February 2005. No suspected interaction with an angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) was reported. However, the review of the safety database showed a slight increased frequency of hypoglycaemic events in patients receiving an ACE inhibitor or an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ARB) as concomitant medication, which supports a possible interaction with insulin. Although the overall number of reports is lower with ARBs than with ACE inhibitors, the reporting rate appears to be the same. Although the mechanism of the interaction is not well understood, both types of medicinal products share the similar endpoint to decrease the effect of angiotensin II and thus, both have the potential to increase insulin sensitivity. A published clinical study comparing the effects of an ACEI and an ARB showed more pronounced effects of the ACE inhibitors on endothelial function but similar effects on insulin sensitivity (Am J Hypertens. 2005 Feb;18(2 Pt 1):178-82) and thus support the data from the MAH safety database. Therefore section 4.5 of the SPC was updated to include ARBs in the list of   |

| II/0030 | This variation refers to an update of section 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics to add clinical efficacy information based on the results of two phase IV clinical studies. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 27/07/2006 | 01/09/2006 | SmPC     | The MAH provided the results of two randomized, open- label, crossover studies investigating the efficacy and safety of the combination of twice-daily insulin lispro LM plus metformin and once-daily insulin glargine plus metformin on overall glycaemic control, as measured by% HbA1c. Patients who participated in these studies had type 2 diabetes with inadequately controlled blood glucose, either on one or more oral anti-hyperglycaemic medications only (study IOND, N=74), or on one or more oral anti- hyperglycaemic plus one daily injection of insulin or a conventional insulin regimen consisting of once- or twice- daily NPH insulin (study IOMX, N=93). Results showed that twice-daily insulin lispro LM in combination with metformin has a greater HbA1c-lowering effect than once-daily insulin glargine with metformin, as expressed in mean %HbA1c thereafter. The new data were reflected in section 5.1 of |

| X/0012  | Addition of a new route of administration. Sections 4.2 and 6.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet were updated. X-3-v_Addition of a new route of administration | 24/07/2003 | 07/11/2003 | SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL | The MAH submitted an application to include a new route of administration (intravenous use). Until that moment, the authorised route of administration for Liprolog was subcutaneous use. The MAH submitted two studies to support the intravenous use of Liprolog solution for injection (vial, cartridge and pen). The data submitted suggested that Liprolog, given intravenously in circumstances as acute illness or during and after surgery, might be effective and safe in controlling hyperglycaemia in diabetic patients. Sections 4.2 and 6.6 of the SPC and the PL were updated with this information. |

| II/0011   | Update of sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics. Also to include minor changes in sections 2, 4.2, 4.9, 5.1, 6.1 and 6.6. Update of the Package Leaflet accordingly. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   | 24/07/2003   | 07/11/2003   | SmPC and PL   | The MAH applied for a variation to update section 4.6 of the SPC regarding data from animal studies on fertility impairment, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. The MAH provided a review of some studies included in the original dossier aiming to evaluate the overall reproductive performance in animals. The studies showed that insulin lispro did not induced fertility impairment, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity in animals. The MAH also applied to include the following sentence in section 5.1 of the SPC: \"Insulin lispro has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis but its effect is more rapid and a shorter duration\". Previously submitted data from the IMAC study was referred by the MAH to support this claim. Data from IMAC study demonstrated that at different doses, insulin lispro and regular human insulin showed almost identical pharmacokinetics and glucodynamics.Additionally, the MAH applied to update the SPC regarding the concomitant use of Liprolog and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The reference that certain antidepressants might reduce insulin requirements was updated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors in section 4.5 of the SPC and PL. Three published papers were cited by the MAH as supporting evidence.Conditions which describe warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were also updated in section 4.4 of the SPC.   |
