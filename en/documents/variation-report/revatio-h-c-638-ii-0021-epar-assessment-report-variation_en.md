## 1. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1. Introduction

Revatio  (sildenafil)  20  mg  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class III, to improve exercise capacity. Efficacy has been shown in  primary  pulmonary  hypertension  and  pulmonary  hypertension  associated  with  connective tissue disease.

Sildenafil  is  an  orally-active,  potent  and  selective  inhibitor  of  the  enzyme  phosphodiesterase  5 (PDE5),  that  causes  the  breakdown  of  cyclic  guanosine  monophosphate  (cGMP).  Given  the  high levels of PDE5 in the pulmonary endothelium, and the role of the nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP system in modulating  pulmonary  vascular  tone,  sildenafil  has  been  studied  in  PAH.  In  patients  with  PAH, inhibition  of  PDE5  could  lead  to  selective  (NO/cGMP-dependent)  vasodilatation  of  the  pulmonary vascular bed (with a lesser degree of vasodilatation in the systemic circulation), resulting in reduced pulmonary arterial pressure and symptomatic improvement.

This Type II variation has been submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to broaden the existing therapeutic indication to include treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II.

The proposed indication is as  follows:  'Treatment  of  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity. Efficacy has been shown in  primary  pulmonary  hypertension  and  pulmonary  hypertension  associated  with  connective  tissue disease.'

Additional data is also proposed in section 5.1

## 1.2 Clinical aspects

Pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH)  is  a  disease  of  the small pulmonary  arteries  that is characterized  by  vascular  proliferation  and  remodelling.  It  results  in  a  progressive  increase  in pulmonary  arterial  resistance  and,  ultimately,  right  ventricular  failure  and  death.  The  functional classification (FC) of PAH, modified from the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of patients with cardiac disease, is as follows:

- Class  I:  PAH  without  a  resulting  limitation  of  physical  activity.  Ordinary  physical  activity does not cause undue dyspnoea or fatigue, chest pain, or near-syncope.
- Class II: PAH resulting in a slight limitation of physical activity. The patient is comfortable at rest,  but  ordinary  physical  activity  causes  undue  dyspnoea  or  fatigue,  chest  pain,  or  near syncope.
- Class III: PAH resulting a marked limitation of physical activity. The patient is comfortable at rest,  but  less  than  ordinary  activity  causes  undue  dyspnoea  or  fatigue,  chest  pain,  or  near syncope.
- Class IV: PAH resulting in an inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. The patient has signs of right heart failure. Dyspnoea, fatigue, or both may be present even at rest, and discomfort is increased by any physical activity.

In many patients the course of PAH is one of steady deterioration and reduced life expectancy, with lung or heart and lung transplant being the only curative treatment available (De Backer et al, 2002). D'Alonzo et al (1991) reported the median survival time for untreated functional class I and class II patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension as 58.6 months, while untreated functional class III and class IV patients had median survival times of 31.5 months and 6 months, respectively.

It has been shown that patients who improve from functional class III or class IV to functional class II after treatment have significantly improved survival. Therefore, it might be reasonable to expect that early  treatment  of  WHO  functional  class  II  patients  might  provide  an  improvement  in  survival  as progression to functional class III might be delayed. Furthermore, early treatment of functional class II patients is supported by the finding that not all patients respond to treatment and if treatment initiation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

is delayed until the patient progresses to functional class III or IV, a significant proportion will remain in functional class III or class IV.

In 2005, Revatio was evaluated and approved for the indication of PAH in WHO FC III patients only. At that time the 6 minute walk distance (6MWT) for functional class II patients was considered to be approximately 450 metres based on results of a study conducted by Miyamoto et al (2000).

Humbert et  al. published  results  from  the  French  National  PAH  Registry  in  2006.  The  Registry included  a  substantial  number  of  PAH  patients  (n=674)  from  17  French  University  hospitals  and included all consecutive adult ( ≥ 18 years) patients with PAH seen between October 2002 and October 2003. The results from the French National PAH Registry indicated that the 6 minute walk test results correlated with functional class in all forms of PAH and haemodynamic improvement correlated with functional class and 6MWT in all subgroups of patients.

Based  on  this  article,  the  MAH  would  like  to  show  that  the  original  studies  of  Revatio  provide evidence that this medication can be used in WHO FC II as well.

Until recently, no therapeutic options were available in Europe for WHO/NYHA functional class II patients. In 2008, ambrisentan (Volibris) was approved as an NCE for both functional class II and III patients,  and  bosentan  (Tracleer)  had  its  functional  class  III  label  extended  to  include  benefit  in functional  class  II  patients.  The  basis  to  include  WHO  functional  class  II  patients  were  on  two grounds:

1. The  functional  class  II  subjects  recruited  into  the  trials  were  a  demonstrably  different population from the functional class III subjects;
2. Efficacy was demonstrated for both functional class II and class III subjects.

## 1.2.1 Clinical efficacy

No  new  clinical  research  studies  were  included  to  support  this  Type  II  variation.  The  MAH  reevaluated data from two previously submitted studies: A1481140 and A1481142. The MAH believes that WHO FC II patients have been adequately studied in these studies.

The MAH refers to ambrisentan (Volibris), a selective endothelin receptor antagonist, which recently was  approved  for  the  indication  of  WHO  FC  II  patients.  The  MAH  is  convinced  that  the considerations of ambrisentan can now be similarly applied to the sildenafil data.

## 1.2.1.1  Main studies

This  Type  II  variation  is  based  on  two  studies  involving  sildenafil  (Revatio):  A1481140  and A1481142. Data of these studies are re-evaluated.

## · Methods and baseline

Study  A1481140 was  a  12-week  multinational,  multi-center,  randomised,  double-blind,  doubledummy, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3 doses of oral sildenafil (20, 40, and 80 mg TID) for the treatment of PAH. The primary objective of the study was to assess the effect of sildenafil therapy on exercise capacity, as measured by the 6-Minute Walk test (6MWT), after 12 weeks of treatment in subjects with PAH.

Study A1481142 was a multi-center, long-term extension study to assess the safety and toleration of subject optimised treatment regimens of oral sildenafil for PAH in subjects who have completed Study A1481140. The duration of Study A1481142 was until the last enrolled subject in Study A1481142 had  completed  3  years  of  treatment  in  Study  A1481142.  All  subjects  completing  Study  A1481140 were  eligible  to  receive  active  therapy  in  Study  A1481142.  Subjects  were  blinded  to  their  Study A1481142 regimens until the last subject entering the study had completed 12 weeks of treatment. This  allowed  collection  of  blinded  toleration  data  as  subjects  optimised  their  dose  (based  on tolerability) in the first 12 weeks of Study A1481142. Subjects were followed up in the clinic on a 6weekly basis for the first 12 weeks and 3-monthly thereafter. Primary Endpoints were 6-MWT, BORG

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

dyspnoea score,  pulmonary  hypertension  criteria  for  functional  capacity  and  therapeutic  class,  QoL and assessment of yearly survival status using the PPH prognostic index.

The difference between the functional class II and functional class III baseline mean 6MWDs was 54 m and the difference between the medians was 63 m. The difference between the functional class II and function class III baseline mean 6MWDs was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001).

- -Baseline 6-MWT by Cut-off Point

Table 2 shows the 6-MWT baseline in functional class II and functional class III subjects characterised by using the cut-off point of 400 metres. In Study A1481140, 48% of functional class II and 20% of functional class III subjects had a baseline 6-MWT of &gt;400 metres.

The functional class II and functional class III subjects were clearly differentiated in Study A1481140 and comparable with the functional class II and functional class III subjects reported in the Volibris EPAR.

The  baseline  6MWT  and  haemodynamic  parameters  observed  for  baseline  functional  class  II  and functional class III subjects in Study A1481140 were comparable to the results in the French National Registry.

## Concomitant medication:

Analysis  of  patients  in  study  A1481140  based  on  their  background  medications  also  showed  a differentiation between patients classified as functional class II and III e.g. the use of diuretics, digoxin and oxygen were reported more frequently in patients classified as FC III than II as follows: 71.3% vs. 52.3% and 23.1%% vs. 19.6% and 38.8% vs. 19.6% respectively.

In  conclusion,  comparison  of  baseline  characteristics  demonstrate  that  functional  class  II  subjects recruited  into  Study  A1481140  were  clinically  distinguishable  from  functional  class  III  subjects recruited into Study A1481140, and had less severe PAH. The functional class II and functional class III subjects in Study A1481140 are also comparable to subjects in the French National Registry and the ambrisentan Studies with respect to baseline 6-MWT and haemodynamic parameters.

Comparison  of  the  sildenafil  20  mg  treatment  group  versus  placebo  demonstrated  a  statistically significant increase in 6-MWT for baseline functional class II and class III subjects at Week 12. The overall  treatment  comparison  of  all  sildenafil  treatment  groups  versus  placebo  demonstrated  a statistically  significant  increase  in  6-MWT  for  baseline  functional  class  II  and  functional  class  III subjects at Week 12.

The change from baseline in 6-MWT for baseline functional class II and functional class III subjects treated with sildenafil are comparable with the results reported for ambrisentan subjects.

- -6-MWT By cut off point

The MAH also performed analyses of change from baseline in 6-MWT by Baseline 6-MWT with cut off 400m and 415m, respectively as stated in the ambrisentan EPAR. The results are provided in the tables below.

In addition to the original parametric analysis, the MAH provided, at the request of the CHMP, the changes for the different cut-off points used ( ≤ 400 m,&gt;400 m and ≤ 415 m, &gt;415 m) according to a non parametric approach (Hodges-Lehman, 95% CI for the median estimates by treatment group and the median difference and 95% CI in the continuous efficacy variables).

The MAH further characterised the efficacy data for baseline functional class II and functional class III subjects by defining a responder as either:

- A subject whose 6MWD improves by 30 m at Week 12.
- A subject whose 6-MWT improves by 30 m and by 10% over the baseline distance at Week 12.

If the first definition of responder is used, 60% of functional class II subjects and 56% of functional class  III  subjects  were  responders.  If  the  second  definition  of  responder  is  used,  54%  of  functional class II subjects and 55% of functional class III subjects were responders.

The  re-analysed  6-MWT  data  from  Study  A1481140  shows  the  efficacy  profile  for  sildenafil  is comparable  for  baseline  functional  class  II  and  functional  III  subjects  in  Study  A1481140,  with statistically  significant  improvements  in  6-MWT  observed  in  both  groups  of  subjects.  Furthermore, comparable  improvements  in  6-MWT  were  observed  when  baseline  6-MWT  rather  than  baseline functional class was used to define disease severity at baseline in Study A1481140.

- -Secondary endpoints

Further  to  the  request  from  the  CHMP,  the  MAH  provided  results  of  the  investigated  secondary endpoints  in  study  A1481140  (changes  in  mean  PAP,  time  to  clinical  worsening  and  change  from baseline in BORG Dyspnoea score) for FCII.

The numbers (%) of patients with clinical worsening events , especially from functional class II, were too small for meaningful evaluation:

The median baseline BORG Dyspnoea scores in the WHO FC II population were 2, 3, 3, 2 for placebo, sildenafil  20mg,  sildenafil  40mg  and  sildenafil  80mg  respectively,  compared  to  4,  4,  3  and  4 respectively in the WHO FC III population. Given that there was little scope for improvement with the WHO FC II population (a score of 2 corresponds to 'slight breathlessness') it isn't unexpected that the sildenafil groups show no improvement over placebo below.

## Study A1481142

The primary objective of extension Study A1481142 was to assess safety. However, it did provide supportive efficacy data. Change in 6-MWT, survival data, and long term functional class data from Study A1481142 are discussed in this section. It should be noted that care needs to be taken when interpreting data from Study A1481142 because of potential bias from the lack of a control group and open label study design.

Overall,  the  change  in  6-MWT,  survival  data,  and  functional  class  data  from  extension  study A1481142 support the long-term efficacy of sildenafil in functional class II subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -6-Minute Walk Distance

At Week 12 in Study A1481142 the mean change from Study A1481140 baseline in 6-MWT was 39 m  and  34  m  for  baseline  (Study  A1481140)  functional  class  II  and  functional  class  III  subjects, respectively, where baseline is defined as the pre-randomisation value in Study A1481140. The mean changes in 6-MWT were 50 m and 45 m at 36 months for baseline functional class II and functional class III subjects, respectively. At 36 months 71 of the 96 baseline (Study A1481140) functional class II subjects entered into Study A1481142 remained in study. As already discussed, caution is needed in interpreting the data from  open  label study A1481142.  However,  these  results suggest that improvements in 6-MWT are maintained in less severe functional class II subjects after 36 months of sildenafil treatment.

## -Long-term Maintenance of Functional Class

Long-term functional class data were also collected in Study A1481142. The majority of subjects who were  baseline  functional  class  II  (62%)  or  functional  class  III  (59%)  improved  or  maintained  their functional class after 3 years of sildenafil treatment.

## 1.2.1.2  Discussion on clinical efficacy

No new clinical studies were submitted to support the current application. The MAH re-evaluated data from the study A1481140 and its long term extension study A1481142 which were the pivotal studies submitted  in  the  Revatio  application  and  resulted  in  the  registration  of  Revatio  for  WHO  FC  III. Ambrisentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, is currently registered for PAH FC II based on the results  of  studies  ARIES-1/ARIES-2.  The  ARIES  studies  were  12  week  double-blind  placebocontrolled  multi-center  studies  in  394  PAH  patients  (both  FC  II  and  III)  with  6-MWT  as  primary endpoint.

With the publishing of the French Registry of PAH patients (Humbert et al ., 2006) based on data from 674  patients,  lower  6-MWT  values  were  assigned  for  FC  II  than  those  previously  reported  in  the article  by  Miyamoto  et  al.,  2000:  415m  vs.  450  m  respectively.  The  values  reported  in  the  French Registry are currently the accepted ones.

Adequate number of patients in FC II were recruited in the pivotal study A1481140 (n=103, compared to n=158 in FC III). The reported baseline 6-MWT for FC II in the pivotal study A1481140 (mean 379±60m) still appears lower than those reported in the French Registry (mean 415±86m); however, they are comparable to those reported in the ARIES studies (Table 1).

The submitted data supports that recruited PAH patients in study A1481140 had statistically different haemodynamic values for WHO FC II and III. The haemodynamic parameters for FC II and FC III appear comparable to those reported in the French Registry.

It can be agreed with the MAH that the submitted data show that at baseline the recruited WHO FC II patients  in  study  A1481140  were  distinguishable  from  WHO  FC  III  based  on  their  6-MWT  and haemodynamic  data.  This  is  also  supported  by  lesser  administration  of  background  supportive medications e.g. diuretics, digoxin and oxygen. These WHO FC II patients appear comparable to those described in the French Registry and those recruited in the ARIES studies. The MAH established that the baseline characteristics in the subgroups of grade II functional status was balanced between the placebo and sildenafil groups.

Administration of the registered dose of sildenafil 20 mg t.i.d resulted in a significant increase in 6MWT in FC II of 49.2 m (95% CI: 21.5- 76.97) which is comparable to the increase achieved in FC III (45.4 m 95% CI: 15.56-75.26).

The MAH has also analysed the change from baseline in 6MWD using different cut-off points ( ≤ 400 m,  &gt;400  m, ≤ 415  m  and  &gt;415  m).  In  general,  the  changes  observed  for  all  cut-off  points  were clinically relevant for all dosages although the effect size was lower for the less severe patients (who

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

walked &gt;400 and &gt;415 m) and who took the lower dose (20 mg), for whom the change from baseline was around 25 m (24.1 and 28.6m respectively). The MAH argued that the less size effect observed with  20  mg  dose  in  these  subgroups  could  be  the  result  of  the  variability  in  the  data  and  a  chance consequence.  The  MAH's  response  appears  reasonable  given  that  a  number  of  non-pre-specified analyses have been performed and consistency is observed for most of them.

In order to assess the robustness of the previous parametric analyses, the MAH provided the changes for  these  different  cut-off  (&lt;400  m  /  &gt;400  m  and  &lt;415  m  /  &gt;415  m)  according  to  a  numerical  and graphical non parametric approach (Hodges-Lehman, 95% CI for the median estimates by treatment group  and  the  median  difference  and  95%  CI  in  the  continuous  efficacy  variables).  The  additional analyses using non-parametric methods were consistent with the previous parametric analyses.

Results of the secondary endpoints (PAP, clinical worsening events and BORG dyspnoea) in FC II were submitted at the request of the CHMP. After administration of sildenafil 20 mg, a trend for a reduction in PAP: -3.2 mmHg is noticed. Only with higher doses of sildenafil 80 mg or for the whole sildenafil group, significant reductions are shown. These results are in line with those shown for FC III.  It  is  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the  small  number  of  clinical  worsening  events  preclude  any conclusions.  Similarly,  BORG  dyspnoea  scores  did  not  show  differences  following  treatment  as patients were only suffering from slight breathlessness at baseline and not much improvement would have been expected. In conclusion, sildenafil 20 mg may have a pressure lowering effect on PAP, in FC II. As with other haemodynamic parameter, the clinical relevance of such effects is not clear.

The principal disease aetiology of patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension (n=100) was PAHCTD (class II- N: 32; class III- N: 51). The number of patients in the PAH-CTD group (class II) is limited and it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions. However, the magnitude of the observed effect (63  m)  is  consistent  with  that  seen  for  the  PAH-PPH  group,  class  II  and  III  (52  m  and  29  m, respectively), though not statistically significant.

Overall,  the  post  hoc  analysis  can  be  regarded  as  globally  acceptable  since  it  may  facilitate  the comparison with other marketed products.

As  stated  by  the  MAH,  results  of  the  long  term  extension  study  should  be  reviewed  cautiously considering  the  open  label  non-controlled  design.  Generally,  the  reported  results  are  reassuring regarding maintenance of efficacy (50 m and 45 m at 36 months for baseline functional class II and functional class III subjects, respectively).

## 1.2.2 Clinical safety

## 1.2.2.1  Main studies

The safety profile, based solely on safety tables, was generally similar for baseline functional class II subjects  and  baseline  function  class  III  subjects  in  Study  A1481140.  As  would  be  expected,  more severe AEs, SAEs, and deaths were reported in baseline functional class III subjects with more severe PAH.

In  Study  A1481142 sildenafil  was  generally  well  tolerated.  The  AEs  reported  were  consistent  with known side effects of sildenafil. The most frequently reported treatment related AEs were headache, dyspepsia, diarrhoea and blurred vision. Most AEs (all causality and treatment related) were mild or moderate in severity.

## Survival at 1, 2, and 3 Years (presented under Safety)

One year survival data from Study A1481142 were provided in the original Revatio submission. Since the original submission in 2005, the long-term survival data after 3 years of sildenafil treatment has become available.

The 1, 2 and 3 year survival data from Study A1481142 were analysed for subjects randomised to sildenafil  in  Study  A1481140  and  for  baseline  functional  class  II  and  functional  class  III  subjects randomised  to  sildenafil  in  Study  A1481140.  The  Kaplan  Meier  survival  estimates  for  subjects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

randomised  to  sildenafil  in  Study  A1481140  were  96%,  91%,  and  82%  at  1,  2,  and  3  years, respectively.  Kaplan  Meier  survival  estimates  at  1,  2,  and  3  years  for  baseline  functional  class  II subjects were 99%, 91%, and 84%, respectively, and for baseline functional class III subjects were 94%, 90%, and 81%, respectively.

These data suggest that sildenafil treatment improves survival and, as would be expected, functional class  II  subjects  treated  with  sildenafil  have  a  better  prognosis  than  functional  class  III  subjects. Survival data for sildenafil are comparable with the results presented for ambrisentan.

## Safety data in patients with FC II and III, administered the registered dose of 20 mg t.i.d.

## -Adverse Events

Table 9 summarises treatment-emergent, all causality adverse events (AEs) by baseline FC in Study A1481140 for the 20 mg treatment group.  Overall the proportion of subjects with all causality AEs and SAEs were similar for baseline FC II and baseline FC III subjects in the 20 mg treatment group of Study  A1481140.  Few  subjects  had  dose  reductions,  temporary  discontinuations,  or  permanently discontinued due to AEs in either group. A higher proportion of severe AEs were reported for baseline FC III subjects.

## -Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs)

The proportion of subjects with TRAEs and SAEs were similar for baseline FC II and baseline FC III subjects  in  the  20  mg  treatment  group  of  Study  A1481140.  Few  subjects  had  dose  reductions  or temporary  discontinuations,  and  no  subjects  permanently  discontinued  due  to  AEs  in  either  group. Two subjects experienced severe AEs in the baseline functional class III group, compared with none in the baseline functional class II group.

According to the MAH, these data are difficult to interpret because of the relatively small number of baseline functional class II (24) and baseline functional class III (40) subjects in the 20 mg treatment group of Study A1481140.

## -Permanent Discontinuations

One  FC  II  patient  in  the  20  mg  treatment  group  permanently  discontinued  treatment  because  of decreased  creatinine  clearance  on  day  1  of  the  study.  The  causality  was  given  as  concomitant treatment furosemide. The subject discontinued from the study and only took study drug on Day 1.

## -Deaths

No deaths  were  reported  with  FC  II;  2  deaths  were  reported  in  FC  III,  none  considered  related  to sildenafil.

## -Serious Adverse Events

Three serious adverse events were reported in FC II administered sildenafil 20 mg table 5, whereas 7 SAEs were reported in FC III.

In these three patients, 6 SAEs were reported; all except one were assessed as not related to sildenafil and did not lead to permanent study discontinuation.

In  one  SAE:  left  ventricular  dysfunction  was  assessed  as  related  to  sildenafil  and  ended  with permanent discontinuation of sildenafil. The haemodynamic measurements were as follows:

The investigator attributed the left ventricular dysfunction to sildenafil. In the opinion of the sponsor, the  event,  most  likely  represented  a  complication  of  disease  under  study;  however, the contributory effect of sildenafil, a pulmonary vasodilator, in unmasking the underlying left ventricular dysfunction cannot be excluded.

## 1.2.2.2  Post-Marketing Safety Data

According to International Marketing Service (IMS) estimates, approximately 33,883 patient-years of exposure  to  sildenafil  (PAH)  occurred  during  the  period  second  quarter  of  2005  through  the  first quarter of 2008.

A total of 47 sildenafil (PAH) cases (containing 75 events) were identified for the period 01 June 2008 through 31 August 2008. Eleven of these 47 cases involved death in patients treated with sildenafil for PAH. In 7 cases, assessment of the cause of death was not possible because insufficient data were provided.  In  the  remaining  four  cases,  the  reported  events  and  the  fatal  outcome  most  likely represented complications of patients' underlying diseases or intercurrent illnesses.

In addition, review of cases involving hemorrhagic events, ocular events, nervous system disorders, skin  and  subcutaneous  events,  cardiovascular  events,  or  hearing  impairment  were  performed.  The risk/benefit balance for sildenafil (PAH) remained unchanged upon review of these events.

## 1.2.2.3  Discussion on clinical safety

The reported K-M survival estimates at 1, 2, and 3 years for baseline functional class II subjects of 99%, 91%, and 84% are slightly lower than those reported with ambrisentan of 94% for 2 and 3 years, but no conclusion can be drawn.

The  MAH  was  requested  to  submit  safety  data  in  patients  with  FC  II  and  III,  administered  the registered dose of 20 mg t.i.d, in order to establish the safety profile of sildenafil in its registered dose of 20 mg tid in patients with FC II.

The number of patients recruited in FC II administered sildenafil 20 mg in study A1481140 was 24, precluding  any  robust  conclusions.  Generally  it  can  be  observed  that  the  frequencies  of  treatment related AEs such as headache, dizziness and abdominal pain NOS were higher in FC II (41.7%, 16.7% and  12.5%  respectively)  compared  to  either  FCIII  (30%,  0,  and  0  respectively,  or  the  matching placebo  (21.9%,  6.3%  and  3.1%  respectively).  The  MAH  did  not  comment  on  these  unexpected findings.  No  deaths  were  reported.  The  single  case  of  discontinuation  in  FC  II  was  not  considered related to sildenafil. In one single event of SAE (left ventricular dysfunction) the investigator related the event to sildenafil.

In conclusion, the safety profile of sildenafil 20 mg in patients with FC II is limited. In future PSURs, AEs should be separately reported per FC.

With respect to post-marketing data, the MAH provided the narratives and the medical review for two cases  in  which  the  contribution  of  sildenafil  to  the  fatal  outcome  cannot  be  ruled  out  due  to  direct causality, concomitant therapy (other PAH treatment) or due to the natural progression of PAH. The

MAH committed to including these cases in the seventh Revatio PSUR and updating any follow-up information received.

## 1.3 Orphan Medicinal Products

Sildenafil  was  granted  an  orphan  designation  (EU/3/03/178)  by  the  European  Commission  on  12 December  2003  for  the  treatment  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  and  chronic  thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

Due to the overlap of the extension of indication in PAH WHO functional class II proposed by the MAH of Revatio with that approved for Volibris (ambrisentan) and Tracleer (bosentan), the MAH was requested  to  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with  this  authorised  orphan medicinal product.

Having  considered  the  arguments  presented  by  the  MAH  of  Revatio  on  10  December  2008,  it  is concluded  that sildenafil does not share the same  principal molecular structural features as ambrisentan and bosentan and the differences in molecular structure are not only minor. Sildenafil is regarded as structurally not similar to ambrisentan and bosentan. As defined in Art. 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000), Revatio is considered as non-similar to Volibris and Tracleer.

Therefore, with reference to article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, the existence of any market exclusivity for Volibris and Tracleer in PAH including WHO functional class II, does not prevent the granting  of  the  extension  of  indication  of  Revatio  in  PAH  WHO  functional  class  II  which  can  be considered  as  significantly  overlapping  with  the  indication  approved  for  Volibris  and  Tracleer  (see Attachment 5).

## 1.4 Benefit/Risk Assessment

PAH is a rare and devastating disease. Owing to the difficulties associated with the diagnosis, many patients will have progressed to WHO functional class (FC) III or even IV before treatment is offered. Nevertheless, about 25% of PAH patients seen in the clinic are classed as WHO FC II or less at the time of diagnosis. Recently, it has been recognized that PAH patients in WHO FC II may benefit from specialized PAH therapy. Ambrisentan and bosentan have been recently approved for this indication (ref. EPAR)

The MAH did not submit new clinical data. Clinical data from previously submitted studies are reevaluated. Based on data of the French registry re-defining PAH patients FC II, it could be seen that the pivotal study A1481140 recruited an adequate number of FC II patients, who are distinguishable from FC III.  Haemodynamic analysis also supported  such  a distinction.  The  enrolled  patients  were PAH-treatment naïve, but the administered background medications further supports a distinction in their  FC.  The  recruited  patients  appear  comparable  to  those  recruited  in  the  Ambrisentan  studies. Administration of sildenafil 20 mg t.i.d in WHO FC II patients resulted in significant improvement in the 6-minute walk test 6-MWT, comparable to that shown in the whole studied population or FC III. The  results  are  also  comparable  to  those  reported  with  Ambrisentan  (Ambrisentan  EPAR).  A requested non-parametric analysis of the 6-MWT further supported the already presented parametric analysis.  Of  the  investigated  secondary  endpoints,  only  a  trend  for  pressure  lowering  in  PAP  was noticed with the 20 mg t.i.d sildenafil. The number of recruited patients in the PAH-CTD group (class II) is limited precluding any firm conclusions. However, the magnitude of the observed effect is in line with the general results, though not statistically significant.

No safety issues were identified with long term use of sildenafil in PAH patients FC WHO II, but the specific database for the 20 mg t.i.d sildenafil in FC II is limited. In future PSURs, AEs should be reported separately per FC.

In  conclusion,  the  benefit  risk  assessment  for  sildenafil  is  considered  positive  for  the  proposed extension of indication. Consequently, the CHMP agreed for sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SPC to be updated accordingly.
