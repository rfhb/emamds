The suspension and emulsion, once mixed, form a multidose vaccine in a vial.  See section 6.5 for the number of doses per vial.

## Excipient with known effect

The vaccine contains 5 micrograms thiomersal

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection.

The suspension is a colourless light opalescent liquid.

The emulsion is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Prophylaxis of influenza caused by A (H1N1)v 2009 virus. Pandemrix should only be used if the recommended annual seasonal trivalent/quadrivalent influenza vaccines are not available and if immunisation against (H1N1)v is considered necessary (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

Pandemrix should be used in accordance with Official Guidance.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Posology

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The dose recommendations take into account the safety and immunogenicity data from clinical studies in healthy subjects

See sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 for details.

No data are available in children aged less than 6 months.

## Adults aged 18 years and older:

One dose of 0.5 ml at an elected date.

Immunogenicity data obtained at three weeks after one dose of Pandemrix (H1N1)v suggest that a single dose may be sufficient.

If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and the second dose.

See section 5.1 regarding immune responses to one and two doses of Pandemrix (H1N1)v, including antibody levels after 6 and 12 months.

## Paediatric population

## Children and adolescents aged 10-17 years

Dosing may be in accordance with the recommendations for adults.

## Children aged from 6 months to 9 years

One dose of 0.25 ml at an elected date.

There is a further immune response to a second dose of 0.25 ml administered after an interval of three weeks.

The use of a second dose should take into consideration the information provided in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1.

## Children aged less than 6 months

No data are available.

It is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Pandemrix should complete the vaccination course with Pandemrix (see section 4.4).

## Method of administration

Immunisation should be carried out by intramuscular injection preferably into the deltoid muscle or anterolateral thigh (depending on the muscle mass).

For instructions on mixing of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

History of an anaphylactic (i.e. life-threatening) reaction to any of the constituents or trace residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate) of this vaccine.

Immunisation should be postponed in subjects with a severe febrile illness or acute infection.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

The vaccine can only be expected to protect against influenza caused by A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)vlike strains.

Caution is needed when administering this vaccine to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1, to thiomersal

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and to residues (egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate and sodium deoxycholate).

As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.

Pandemrix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly.

There are no data with Pandemrix using the subcutaneous route.  Therefore, healthcare providers need to assess the benefits and potential risks of administering the vaccine in individuals with thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk of bleedings.

Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient.

A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1).

There are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Pandemrix with other (H1N1)v vaccines.

Epidemiological studies relating to Pandemrix in several European countries have indicated an increased risk of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy in vaccinated as compared with unvaccinated individuals. In children/adolescents (aged up to 20 years), these studies have indicated an additional 1.4 to 8 cases in 100,000 vaccinated subjects. Available epidemiological data in adults aged over 20 years have indicated approximately 1 additional case per 100,000 vaccinated subjects. These data suggest that the excessive risk tends to decline with increasing age at vaccination.

The relationship between Pandemrix and narcolepsy is still under investigation.

Pandemrix should only be used if the recommended annual seasonal trivalent/quadrivalent influenza vaccines are not available and if immunisation against (H1N1)v is considered necessary (see section 4.8).

## Paediatric population

There are no safety and immunogenicity data available from clinical studies with Pandemrix (H1N1)v in children aged less than 6 months. Vaccination is not recommended in this age group.

In children aged 6 to 35 months (N=51) who received two doses of 0.25 ml (half of the adult dose) with an interval of 3 weeks between doses there was an increase in the rates of injection site reactions and general symptoms after the second dose (see section 4.8).  In particular rates of fever (axillary temperature ≥38°C) increased considerably after the second dose. Therefore, monitoring of temperature and measures to lower the fever (such as antipyretic medication as seems clinically necessary) are recommended in young children (e.g. up to approximately 6 years of age) after each dose of Pandemrix.

Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination especially in adolescents as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Data obtained on co-administration of Pandemrix (H1N1)v with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluarix, a split virion vaccine) in healthy adults aged over 60 years did not suggest any significant interference in the immune response to Pandemrix (H1N1)v. The immune response to Fluarix was satisfactory.

Co-administration was not associated with higher rates of local or systemic reactions compared to administration of Pandemrix alone.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Therefore the data indicate that Pandemrix may be co-administered with non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines (with injections made into opposite limbs).

Data obtained on the administration of a non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluarix, as above) three weeks before a dose of Pandemrix (H1N1)v in healthy adults over 60 years of age, did not suggest any significant interference in the immune response to Pandemrix (H1N1)v.  Therefore the data indicate that Pandemrix may be administered three weeks after the administration of non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines.

In a clinical study where a non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluarix, as above) was administered 3 weeks after the second dose of Pandemrix (two doses were given 21 days apart), a lower immune response to Fluarix was observed as compared to subjects who had not previously received Pandemrix.  It is not known whether the observed effects would apply to administration of nonadjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine after a single dose of Pandemrix or when longer dose intervals have elapsed since administration of Pandemrix.  It is preferable that non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccines should be administered before or with the first dose of Pandemrix.

There are no data on co-administration of Pandemrix with other vaccines. If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be intensified.

The immunological response may be diminished if the patient is undergoing immunosuppressant treatment.

Following influenza vaccination, false-positive serology test results may be obtained by the ELISA method for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus and, especially, HTLV-1. In such cases, the Western blot method is negative.  These transitory false-positive results may be due to IgM production in response to the vaccine.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

Pandemrix has been administered to women in each trimester of pregnancy. Information on outcomes from estimated more than 200,000 women who have been vaccinated during pregnancy is currently limited. There was no evidence of an increased risk of adverse outcomes in over 100 pregnancies that were followed in a prospective clinical study.

Animal studies with Pandemrix do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).

Data from pregnant women vaccinated with different inactivated non-adjuvanted seasonal vaccines do not suggest malformations or fetal or neonatal toxicity.

## Breast-feeding

Pandemrix may be administered in lactating women.

## Fertility

No fertility data are available.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 'Undesirable Effects' may affect the ability to drive or use machines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Clinical studies have evaluated the incidence of adverse reactions in more than 1,000 subjects 18 years old and above who received Pandemrix (H1N1).

In adults 18 to 60 years of age, the most frequently reported adverse reactions after vaccination were injection site pain (87.8%), fatigue (32.9%), headache (28.1%), arthralgia (17.9%), myalgia (30.0%), shivering (19.4%), injection site swelling (11.5%) and sweating (11.3%).

In subjects &gt; 60 years of age, the most frequently reported adverse reactions after vaccination were injection site pain (59.0%), myalgia (20.6%), fatigue (17.9%), headache (17.6%) and arthralgia (14.3%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions reported are listed per dose according to the following frequency:

Very common ( ≥ 1/10) Common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10) Uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100) Rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000) Very rare (&lt;1/10,000)

Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

In clinical studies that evaluated reactogenicity in adults aged 18 years and above who received two 0.5 ml doses of Pandemrix (H1N1)v, higher rates of general solicited symptoms (such as fatigue, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, shivering, sweating and fever) were observed after the second dose compared to the first dose.

## Paediatric population

## Children aged 10-17 years

In clinical studies that evaluated the reactogenicity in children 10 to 17 years of age who received either two 0.5 ml doses (adult dose) or two 0.25 ml doses (half adult dose) (21 days apart) of Pandemrix (H1N1)v, the per-dose frequency of the following adverse reactions was as shown in the table:

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Pandemrix in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prevention of influenza infection (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

Information from non-clinical studies:

The ability to induce protection against homologous and heterologous vaccine strains was assessed nonclinically using ferret challenge models.

In each experiment, four groups of six ferrets were immunized intramuscularly with an AS03 adjuvanted vaccine containing HA derived from H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/04 (NIBRG-14). Doses of 15, 5, 1.7 or 0.6 micrograms of HA were tested in the homologous challenge experiment, and doses of 15, 7.5, 3.8 or 1.75 micrograms of HA were tested in the heterologous challenge experiment. Control groups included ferrets immunized with adjuvant alone, non-adjuvanted vaccine (15 micrograms HA) or phosphate buffered saline solution. Ferrets were vaccinated on days 0 and 21 and challenged by the intra-tracheal route on day 49 with a lethal dose of either H5N1/A/Vietnam/1194/04 or heterologous H5N1/A/Indonesia/5/05. Of the animals receiving adjuvanted vaccine, 87% and 96% were protected against the lethal homologous or heterologous challenge, respectively. Viral shedding into the upper respiratory tract was also reduced in vaccinated animals relative to controls, suggesting a reduced risk of viral transmission. In the unadjuvanted control group, as well as in the adjuvant control group, all animals died or had to be euthanized as they were moribund, three to four days after the start of challenge.

Additional information is available from the studies conducted with a vaccine similar in composition to Pandemrix but containing antigen derived from H5N1 viruses. Please consult the Product Information of Pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Not applicable.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data obtained with the mock-up vaccine using a H5N1 vaccine strain reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, female fertility, embryo-fetal and postnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period).

- -one pack of 50 vials (type I glass) of 2.5 ml suspension with a stopper (butyl rubber).
- -two packs of 25 vials (type I glass) of 2.5 ml emulsion with a stopper (butyl rubber).

The volume after mixing 1 vial of suspension (2.5 ml) with 1 vial of emulsion (2.5 ml) corresponds to 10 doses of vaccine (5 ml).

## 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Pandemrix consists of two containers:

Suspension: multidose vial containing the antigen,

Emulsion: multidose vial containing the adjuvant.

Prior to administration, the two components should be mixed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Instructions for mixing and administration of the vaccine:

1. Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be brought to room temperature (allow a minimum of 15 minutes); each vial should be shaken and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine.
2. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by means of a 5 ml syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen. It is recommended to equip the syringe with a 23-G needle.  However, in the case this needle size would not be available, a 21-G needle might be used. The vial containing the adjuvant should be maintained in upside down position to facilitate the withdrawal of the full content.
3. After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed vaccine is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid emulsion.  In the event of other variation being observed, discard the vaccine.
4. The volume of the Pandemrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml. The vaccine should be administered in accordance with the recommended posology (see section 4.2).
5. The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance.  In the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine.
6. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml (full dose) or 0.25 ml (half dose) is withdrawn into a 1 ml syringe for injection and administered intramuscularly. It is recommended to equip the syringe with a needle gauge not larger than 23-G.
7. After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25°C. If the mixed vaccine is stored in a refrigerator, it should be brought to room temperature (allow a minimum of 15 minutes) before each withdrawal.

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

## Pandemrix suspension and emulsion for emulsion for injection

Influenza vaccine (H1N1)v (split virion, inactivated, adjuvanted)

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you receive this vaccine because it contains important information for you.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.
- -This vaccine has been prescribed for you only.  Do not pass it on to others.
- -If you get any of side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet.  See section 4.

## What is in this leaflet:

1. What Pandemrix is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you receive Pandemrix
3. How Pandemrix is given
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Pandemrix
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Pandemrix is and what it is used for

## What Pandemrix is and what it is used for

Pandemrix is a vaccine to prevent influenza (flu) caused by A(H1N1)v 2009 virus.

Your doctor will normally recommend a different vaccine (annual trivalent/quadrivalent influenza vaccine) instead of Pandemrix, but if the trivalent/quadrivalent vaccines are not available Pandemrix may still be an option if you need protection against A(H1N1)v influenza (see Take special care with Pandemrix).

## How Pandemrix works

When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body's natural defence system) will produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu.

## 2. What you need to know before you receive Pandemrix

## Pandemrix should not be given:

- if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine (listed in section 6) or to any of the substances that may be present in trace amounts as follows: egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or sodium deoxycholate. Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue.
- if you have a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38°C). If this applies to you then your vaccination will usually be postponed until you are feeling better. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but your doctor or nurse will advise whether you could still be vaccinated with Pandemrix.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before having this vaccine.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before you receive Pandemrix:

- if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction to any ingredient contained in this vaccine (listed in section 6), to thiomersal, to egg and chicken protein, ovalbumin, formaldehyde, gentamicin sulphate (antibiotic) or to sodium deoxycholate. .
- if you are having a blood test to look for evidence of infection with certain viruses. In the first few weeks after vaccination with Pandemrix the results of these tests may not be correct. Tell the doctor requesting these tests that you have recently been given Pandemrix.
- if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily.

In any of these cases, TELL YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE, as vaccination may not be recommended, or may need to be delayed.

Excessive sleepiness during the day, often at the wrong times (a long-term condition called narcolepsy), has been reported very rarely after vaccination with Pandemrix in several European countries. Narcolepsy can occur with or without sudden muscle weakness that can cause falls (a condition called cataplexy).

## Children and adolescents

If your child receives the vaccine, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense after the second  dose,  especially  temperature  over  38°C.  Therefore  monitoring  of  temperature  and  measures  to lower the temperature (such as giving paracetamol or other medicines that lower fever) after each dose are recommended.

Fainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore tell the doctor or nurse if you fainted with a previous injection.

## Other medicines and Pandemrix

Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or have recently received any other vaccine.

Pandemrix can be given at the same time as seasonal influenza vaccines that do not contain an adjuvant.

Persons who have received a seasonal influenza vaccine that does not contain an adjuvant may receive Pandemrix after an interval of at least three weeks.

There is  no information on administration of Pandemrix with other vaccines.  However, if this cannot be avoided, the vaccines should be injected into separate limbs.  In such cases, you should be aware that the side effects may be more intense.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before you receive this vaccine.

## Driving and using machines

Some effects mentioned under section 4. 'Possible side effects' may affect the ability to drive or use machines.

## Pandemrix contains thiomersal

Pandemrix contains thiomersal as a preservative and it is possible that you may experience an allergic reaction. Tell your doctor if you have any known allergies.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pandemrix contains sodium and potassium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) and less than 1 mmol of potassium (39 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially sodium- and potassium-free.

## 3. How Pandemrix is given

Your doctor or nurse will administer the vaccine in accordance with official recommendations.

## Adults, including the elderly

A dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given.

Clinical data suggest that a single dose may be sufficient.

<!-- image -->

If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and second dose.

## Use in children and adolescents

## Children from the age of 10 years onwards

A dose (0.5 ml) of the vaccine will be given.

Clinical data suggest that a single dose may be sufficient.

If a second dose is administered there should be an interval of at least three weeks between the first and second dose.

## Children from 6 months to 9 years of age

A dose (0.25 ml) of the vaccine will be given.

If a second dose of 0.25 ml is given this will be administered at least three weeks after the first dose.

## Children aged less than 6 months of age

Vaccination is currently not recommended in this age group.

The vaccine will be injected into a muscle (usually in the upper arm).

If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your doctor or nurse.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Allergic reactions:

Allergic reactions may occur following vaccination, in rare cases leading to shock.  Doctors are aware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases.

## Other side effects:

The side effects listed below have occurred with Pandemrix in clinical studies in adults, including the elderly.

## Very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people

- Headache
- Tiredness
- Pain and swelling at the injection site
- Shivering
- Increased sweating

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Aching muscles, joint pain

## Common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people

- Redness and itching at the injection site
- Fever
- Feeling sick, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pain

## Uncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people

- A hard lump and warmth at the injection site
- Swollen glands in the neck, armpit or groin
- Tingling or numbness of the hands or feet
- Sleeplessness
- Dizziness
- Itching, rash
- Generally feeling unwell
- Flu-like symptoms

<!-- image -->

These side effects usually disappear within 1-2 days without treatment. If they persist, CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR.

## Additional side effects in children and adolescents

## Children aged 10-17 years

The side effects listed above have also been observed with similar frequencies in clinical studies in children 10 to 17 years of age, except for redness at the injection site which was very common and sweating which was common.

## Children aged 3-9 years

In children 3 to 9 years of age who received two 0.25 ml doses of Pandemrix (H1N1) the side effects reported were similar to those reported in adults, except for redness at the injection site and gastrointestinal symptoms which were very common and shivering and sweating which were common. In addition, fever was very common in children aged 3-5 years. Some side effects (including local redness and fever) occurred more frequently after the second dose compared to the first dose.

## Children aged 6-35 months

In children aged 6-35 months who received two doses of 0.25 ml of Pandemrix (H1N1), there was an increase in reports of pain, redness and swelling at the injection site as well as fever (&gt;38°C), drowsiness, irritability and loss of appetite after the second dose compared to the first dose.  All these side effects were reported very commonly after each dose.

The side effects listed below have happened after Pandemrix (H1N1)v came on the market:

- Allergic reactions leading to a dangerous decrease of blood pressure, which, if untreated, may lead to shock. Doctors are aware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available for use in such cases.
- Generalised skin reactions including facial swelling and urticaria (hives)
- Fits due to fever
- A long-term condition with excessive daytime sleepiness (narcolepsy), with or without sudden weakness (cataplexy), which may lead to falls without loss of consciousness
- Short-term sleepiness following vaccination
- Reactions at the injection site such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and heat (inflammation), hard lump (mass)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The side effects listed below have occurred in the days or weeks after vaccination with vaccines given routinely every year to prevent flu.  They may also happen with Pandemrix.

Rare: may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people

- Severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves
- Low blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising

Very rare: may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people

- Vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels which can cause skin rashes, joint pain and kidney problems)
- Neurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system), neuritis (inflammation of nerves) and a type of paralysis known a Guillain-Barré Syndrome

## Reporting of side effects

If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

Pandemrix consists of two containers: Suspension: multidose vial containing the antigen, Emulsion: multidose vial containing the adjuvant.

Prior to administration, the two components should be mixed.

## Instructions for mixing and administration of the vaccine:

1. Before mixing the two components, the emulsion (adjuvant) and suspension (antigen) should be brought to room temperature (allow a minimum of 15 minutes); each vial should be shaken and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. In the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine.
2. The vaccine is mixed by withdrawing the entire contents of the vial containing the adjuvant by means of a 5 ml syringe and by adding it to the vial containing the antigen. It is recommended to equip the syringe with a 23-G needle.  However, in the case this needle size would not be available, a 21-G needle might be used. The vial containing the adjuvant should be maintained in upside down position to facilitate the withdrawal of the full content.
3. After the addition of the adjuvant to the antigen, the mixture should be well shaken. The mixed vaccine is a whitish to yellowish homogeneous milky liquid emulsion.  In the event of other variation being observed, discard the vaccine.
4. The volume of the Pandemrix vial after mixing is at least 5 ml. The vaccine should be administered in accordance with the recommended posology (see section 3 'How Pandemrix is given').
5. The vial should be shaken prior to each administration and inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance.  In the event of either being observed (including rubber particles from the stopper), discard the vaccine.
6. Each vaccine dose of 0.5 ml (full dose) or 0.25 ml (half dose) is withdrawn into a 1 ml syringe for injection and administered intramuscularly. It is recommended to equip the syringe with a needle gauge not larger than 23-G.
7. After mixing, use the vaccine within 24 hours. The mixed vaccine can either be stored in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C) or at room temperature not exceeding 25°C. If the mixed vaccine is stored in a refrigerator, it should be brought to room temperature (allow a minimum of 15 minutes) before each withdrawal.

The vaccine should not be administered intravascularly.

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.
