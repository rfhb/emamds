| II/0016 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet This variation refers to an update of section 4.8 of the Summary of Product Characteristics concerning gastro-intestinal events associated with nateglinide following a request from the CHMP to reflect the findings from a six month observational safety study in patients treated with nateglinide or gliclazide in combination with metformin. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. | 01/06/2006          | 13/07/2006                               | no SPC, PL                       | longer Study DJN608AGB05 was a 6-months multi center, prospective, observational non interventional and non blinded study in subjects treated with either nateglinide or gliclazide in combination with metformin. A statistically significant difference in the frequency of gastrointestinal disorders was reported between the total nateglinide and total gliclazide groups (5.6 vs. 0.4%! ; p<0.001). This was the only System Organ Class (SOC) for which a significant difference was observed between treatment groups. The SPC has been updated to reflect these findings and therefore abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting have been included as an adverse reaction in section 4.8 of the SPC. Section 4 of the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. |

| II/0014 | Update of Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package Leaflet The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied for this variation to update section 5.1 of the Summary of product Characteristics (SPC) to reflect information from a study comparing the efficacy of nateglinide plus metformin versus a sulphonylurea plus metformin, as requested                                                                                                     | 27/07/2005          | 05/09/2005                               | SPC, Labelling, PL               | The efficacy of nateglinide in combination with metformin has been compared to the combination of gliclazide plus metformin in a 6-month randomised, double-blind trial in 262 patients using a superiority design. The decrease from baseline in HbA 1C was -0.41% in the nateglinide plus metformin group and -0.57% in the gliclazide plus metformin group (difference 0.17%, 95% CI -0.03, 0.36). Both treatments were well-tolerated. Section 5.1 of the SPC has been updated to reflect this information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
