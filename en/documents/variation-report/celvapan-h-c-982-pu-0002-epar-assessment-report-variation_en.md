## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1 Introduction

An influenza pandemic is a global outbreak of influenza disease that occurs when a type A influenza strain to which most or all humans are immunologically naïve emerges.

¾

In April 2009, a new strain of human influenza A(H1N1)v was identified and characterised.  On 11 June 2009 the WHO declared Phase 6 of the influenza pandemic. The declaration reflected sustained transmission of the virus from person to person in several WHO regions. WHO and other international agencies are  calling  the  disease pandemic (H1N1) 2009 .  For  the  virus  the  nomenclature influenza A(H1N1)v (where v indicates variant) has been chosen. The  attack  rate  for  the  (H1N1)v  virus  strain  is  expected  to  be  higher  than  for  recently  circulating seasonal  strains  because  of  the  lower  levels  of  pre-existing  immunity  in  the  population.  Current estimates for the attack rate associated with the influenza A(H1N1)v virus over the first major wave of infection  vary  from  approximately  10-30  %  in  different  geographical  areas.  As  a  result,  the  actual numbers of clinically apparent infections, cases that require hospitalisation and deaths in the pandemic period  is  expected  to  be  higher  than  in  recent  years  for  seasonal  influenza.  These  estimates  may change (upwards or downwards) during the course of the pandemic. So far in this pandemic there has been a marked under-representation of infections in people over 65 years of age. In Europe, the median age has been 25 years in those who acquired the infection during travel  and  13  years  in  those  infected  within  the  EU.  Nearly  80%  of  cases  have  been  in  individuals under 30 years of age. Deaths have occurred in previously healthy subjects as well as in those with underlying  conditions  or  pregnancy  that  would  predispose  them  to  complications  of  influenza.  For more  information  about  the  known  clinical  features  of  the  disease  caused  by  influenza  A(H1N1)v virus please see the updated Risk Assessment report from ECDC under: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/Documents/0908\\_Influenza\\_AH1N1\\_Risk\\_Assessment.pdf Specific guidance has been developed for the fast track assessment procedure for pandemic influenza vaccines 2 , which can only be used once WHO/EU have officially declared the pandemic (WHO Phase 6). The procedure involves the submission and evaluation of a core pandemic dossier during the interpandemic period, followed by a fast track assessment of the data for replacing the mock-up vaccine strain with the recommended pandemic strain as a variation to the MAA. The approval of a core dossier followed by a strain change variation is based on a Proof of Principle approach by which safety and immunogenicity data are generated with mock-up vaccines containing subtypes of influenza A to which the majority of the population is naïve. These principles are based on: ¾ The immune responses to a specific mock-up vaccine containing a strain to which subjects within a specific age range were immunologically naïve is expected to predict responses to the same vaccine construct containing an alternative strain of the same subtype or an alternative subtype of influenza A in a comparable population. The safety data generated with a specific mock-up vaccine in clinical studies is expected to predict the safety profile observed with the same vaccine construct containing an alternative strain  of  the  same  subtype  or  an  alternative  subtype  of  influenza  A  in  a  comparable population.

2 Guideline on Submission of Marketing Authorisation Applications for Pandemic Influenza Vaccines through the Centralised Procedure (CPMP/VEG/4986/03).

Guideline on Dossier Structure and Content for Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Marketing Authorisations Application (CPMP/VEG/4717/03).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

On  the  basis  of  these  assumptions  the  mock-up/core  dossier  construct  allows  for  insertion  of  the pandemic strain into a vaccine construct based on all the data obtained with the corresponding mockup  vaccine  together  with  specific  data  relating  to  the  pandemic  strain.  This  approach  rests  on  the premise  that  the  final  pandemic  vaccine  is  produced  in  the  same  way  (i.e.  with  regards  to  the formulation,  manufacturing  process  and  control  methods)  as  approved  for  the  mock-up  vaccine. Therefore the strain change variation contains mainly the quality data that are new and relevant for the pandemic influenza vaccine virus.

Baxter AG received a Marketing Authorisation Application (core pandemic dossier) for  the mock-up vaccine Celvapan in line with the above mentioned guidelines. The mock-up vaccine is a whole virion inactivated influenza vaccine, which is produced in Vero cells and employing a wild type virus H5N1 strain.  The  final  vaccine  comprises  7.5µg  of  HA  antigen  of  strain  A/Vietnam/1203/2004  (or A/Indonesia/05/2005) per 0.5 ml dose and is presented in a 10-dose vial with no preservative added. On 22 September 2009 Baxter applied for a variation to change the strain used for manufacture of Celvapan  to  A/California/07/2009  (H1N1)v.  The  strain  used  has  been  officially  recommended  by WHO and CHMP for the manufacture of vaccines during the current pandemic. Celvapan is based on a wild type strain and the proposed new strain, A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v, complies  with  the  WHO 3 and  CHMP 4 recommendations  for  the  emergent  novel  H1N1  influenza vaccine  composition.  In  support  of  the  strain  change  to  A/California/07/2009  (H1N1)v,  Baxter submitted  quality  data  in  accordance  with  the  quality  requirements  for  a  novel  influenza  H1N1 vaccine, the Guideline On Dossier Structure And Content For Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Marketing Authorisation (CPMP/VEG/4717/03 Rev. 1) and EMEA fast track procedure for community human influenza  inactivated  vaccines  annual  strain(s) (CHMP/BWP/99698/07).  The  same  manufacturing process, with the exception of strain-dependent parameter, and safety precautions were applied to the production  of  H5N1  and H1N1, which includes the release and shelf-life  specifications.  The  MAH provided  quality  data  in  support  of  this  variation  to  demonstrate  that  the  vaccine  containing A/California/07/2009  (H1N1)v  is  comparable  from  the  Quality  point  of  view  to  the  Mock-up containing H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (or A/Indonesia/05/2005). Data from ongoing and planned clinical trials and as specified in the agreed pharmacovigilance/risk management  plan  using  the  Celvapan  vaccine  construct  with  the  influenza  A(H1N1)v  strain  are reviewed on an ongoing basis. These studies will allow to obtain safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data for the influenza A(H1N1)v pandemic vaccine. The first clinical data from the vaccine including the (H1N1)v strain become available end September 2009 as regards safety and immunogenicity will become available  in  October  2009.  The  Celvapan  SPC  summarises  the  existing  clinical  data.    The Clinical Particulars will be updated as new data are submitted and reviewed.. 2.2 Quality aspects The quality section is divided into two parts of which chapter 3.2.1 describes quality characteristics pertaining  to  the  initial  Mock-up  vaccine  (developed  with  A/Vietnam/1203/2004  (H5N1)  with supporting data from A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1)) and chapter 3.2.2. describes quality characteristics submitted in support of the strain change variation to introduce the new  pandemic  strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v.

The  production  process  of  the  pandemic  influenza  vaccine  is  based  on  previous  experience  with Baxter's interpandemic influenza process. The Active Substance is the Vero cell-derived, formaldehyde- and UV-inactivated and sucrose gradient purified whole virions of influenza virus. The finished  product  is  a  suspension  for  injection  presented  in  a  multidose  formulation  with  no preservative added. For details on the composition of Celvapan please refer to Table 1. Table 1. Composition of Celvapan Active Substance The Active Substance is an aqueous solution containing Vero cell-derived, formaldehyde- and UVinactivated, and sucrose gradient purified whole virions of influenza virus. Additional components of the Active Substance are Tween 80, Sodium Chloride and Tris-buffer (TBS, containing Trometamol). The strain change variation to replace H5N1 with  H1N1 virus antigen does not affect the quality of the  active  substance.  For  further  information  on  the  quality  data  submitted  in  support  of  the  strain change variation see the section on Pandemic Strain Variation below. · Manufacturer Medicinal product no longer authorised

All  manufacturing  steps  of  Celvapan  are  performed  in  Baxter  facilities  under  Good  Manufacturing Practice  (GMP)  conditions.  The  involved  facilities  Baxter  AG  in  Orth/Donau-  Austria  and  Baxter BioScience s.r.o. in Kostelec nad Cernymi lesy - Czech Republic hold current GMP certificates and valid Manufacturing Authorisations. The specific development work was performed with H5N1 strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The production process using the Vero cell technology can be divided into four main stages:

- -Vero Cell Propagation
- -Virus Propagation and Harvesting
- -Inactivation
- -Purification and sterile Filtration

In the upstream processing, cells are produced and then infected with the respective influenza virus (i.e.  H5N1). Then the virus is harvested and inactivated by sequential formaldehyde and Ultraviolet Irradiation  (UV)  inactivation  steps.  Two  separate  inactivation  steps  were  designed  for  two  separate targets  i.e.  primarily  protein  for  formaldehyde  and  nucleic  acid  as  a  target  for  UV  irradiation.  In Purification  I,  the  product  is  concentrated  and  purified  using  ultra-centrifugation  with  a  sucrose gradient.  During  Purification  II,  the  product  is  homogenized  and  sucrose  and  further  impurities  are removed by ultrafiltration. The final stage of Active Substance manufacture is the sterile filtration of the Monovalent Bulk. · Control of Materials The following starting materials used in the production of monovalent bulk are of biological origin: Vero cell line used in the production of viral antigens and Influenza virus seed. The H5N1 working seed is derived from the Strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and Strain A/Indonesia/05/2005. The different Vero cell populations Master Cell Bank (MCB), Working Cell Bank (WCB) and Post Production Cell Bank (PPCB) were tested for characterisation and safety according to Ph. Eur. 5.2.3. including  DNA  fingerprinting  on  MCB,  WCB,  and  PPCB.  Mycoplasma  testing  by  indicator  DNA fluorochrome test  or  by  cultivation  assay.  Morphology  examination,  extraneous  agents  testing    and tests for bacterial and fungal contamination and retroviruses. In conclusion the testing panel on the cell bank  system  provide  assurance  that  the  cell  banks  can  be  considered  free  of  extraneous  agents according to Ph. Eur. 5.2.3. Extraneous  Agents  were  evaluated in  vitro and in  vivo . In  vitro testing  of  the  neutralized  Vietnam strain  Production  Virus  Banks,  both  from  the  Orth  and  Bohumil  facility,  confirmed  the  absence  of extraneous agents in the Production Virus Banks. Additionally the Applicant studied the evaluation of feasibility to completely neutralize H5N1 for the purpose of extraneous agents in vivo testing on the Production Virus Banks of the Vietnam strain, as sufficient neutralisation of the virus banks is a prerequisite for the performance of the in vivo testing. The neutralized samples were inoculated into appropriate numbers of adult mice suckling and guinea pigs as per Ph. Eur. 2.6.16 animals were observed for the requested time period for sign of disease or death.  The  studies  in  suckling  mice,  guinea  pigs  and  adult  mice  were  considered  to  have  been completed  successfully  in  compliance  with  Ph.Eur.  2.6.16.  In  addition  the  extraneous  agents  test program for virus banks of a future pandemic strain will be revised to be fully in line with Ph. Eur 2308.  In  conclusion  sufficient  data  on  extraneous  agents  testing in  vitro and in  vivo as  well  as  by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been generated to demonstrate absence of extraneous agents. The  excipients  of  animal  origin,  Trypsin  and  Cytodex,  are  used  in  the  production  of  the  Active Substance. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The two animal components and the manufacturing process itself (including media used in equipment with  direct  contact  with  the  product)  have  been  evaluated  according  to  the  relevant  guidelines  and found to present no risk of TSE transmission. Biological reagents involved in routine manufacture of the active substance do not contain components of bovine origin.

- Process validation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Production of the Active Substance starts with the Vero Cell Inoculum and the Production Virus Bank. Quality control testing is performed on intermediate products at the following steps:

- -Vero cell culture in Fermenter step 3 prior to infection
- -Fermentation Broth
- -Formaldehyde Treated Virus Harvest
- -Purified Monovalent Virus Harvest (PMVH) as the result of Purification I

Critical  steps  in  the  production  of  the  Active  Substance  are  those  associated  with  viral  safety  and sterility. These include tests for inactivation with formaldehyde, inactivation by UV light, control of total inactivation process and sterile filtration, which has been tested through filtration contact time, filter integrity and sterility according to Ph.Eur. Validation studies for Celvapan were based on the H5N1 Influenza strains A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005. The validation of Active Substance manufacture has been carried out with the Vietnam/1203/2004 strain. The occurrence of human infections with Clade 2 H5N1 influenza strains in Indonesia, and the high mortality rate (56 %) associated with these infections, has prompted Baxter to also produce a whole virus H5N1  influenza candidate vaccine based on the Clade 2 A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain for a clinical Phase 1 study, which was used to validate the formulation and filling process steps. The validation of WCB production was performed retrospectively on all relevant WCBs produced in the last years at the Orth/Austria facility. The WCB lots listed in the dossier were used for production of  material  for  clinical  trials  of  several  investigational  products,  e.g.  pandemic  and  interpandemic influenza,  SARS  and  Ross  River  vaccine.  In  conclusion,  sufficient  information  has  been  provided regarding the specific WCB(s) used for production of Celvapan clinical trial material and conformance lots.  All  tests  according  to  Ph.  Eur.  2308  and  5.2.3  have  been  conducted  and  were  included  in  the specification for production of future Working Cell Banks. Process  validation  of  the  Vero  Cell  Inoculum  in  Bohumil  included  twelve  consecutive  lots.  The conformity  of  the  cell  propagation  from  120  L  up  to  6000  L  bioreactors  was  tested  on  three consecutive lots for the purpose of the Process Validation of the Cell Propagation at different stages of Fermentation. These results demonstrated that different lots used for both the vero cell inoculation and fermentation process were found to be comparable. The  strain  used  for  process  validation  covering  virus  propagation,  harvest  and  inactivation  was A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (Clade 1). Three conformance lots were produced in the Bohumil facility and the results confirmed the consistency of the manufacturing process. During the process validation for Celvapan production, it was verified that the manufacturing process of the virus propagation, harvest and inactivation, purification and transport conforms to the process validation protocols. In  conclusion  the  data  generated  during  process  validation  at  both  facilities  Orth/Austria  and Bohumil/Czech Republic demonstrated a consistent manufacturing process. · Characterisation and Specification The biological, immunological, genetic and physicochemical characterisation included a comparison between egg-derived and vero-cell derived influenza virus seeds. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The biological characterisation of the inactivated whole virus vaccine Active Substance was carried out by determining the haemagglutination (HA) titre and the infectious titre. For this purpose the egg infectious  dose  50  (EID50/mL)  as  well  as  the  plaque  forming  units  (pfu/mL)  were  determined. Additionally  the  Applicant  also  detected  the  neuraminidase  (NA)  activity.  The  Applicant  tested whether egg-derived influenza virus vaccine strains would differ from the vero cell derived ones with respect to their biological characterisation, however, no significant differences could be detected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The genetic stability of the influenza virus grown in Vero cells versus egg derived virus was evaluated by  comparing  the  genetic  sequence  of  the  Haemagglutinin  gene  sequence  of  an  egg-derived  Seed Virus Bank to that of a Post Production Virus developed in Vero cells. The egg-derived Seed Virus Bank and the Vero-derived post production virus preparations were identical on the DNA and on the amino  acid  level,  demonstrating  that  once  a  recommended  vaccine  strain  has  been  adapted  to sufficient growth in eggs, no re-adaptation during the passages in serum free Vero cells occurs.

Immunological characterization was carried out on the egg derived and vero derived by haemagglutination  inhibition  (HI)  assay,  neuraminidase  inhibition  (NAI)  assay  and  Western  blot analysis. Further immunological characterization was done by infection and immunization studies in mice with egg-derived and Vero-derived viruses and vaccines. Additionally, a challenge experiment was  carried  out  in  ferrets.  There  were  generally  no  significant  differences  in  hemagglutination inhibition  assay  (HI)  titres  between  any  of  the  samples  from  any  season,  egg-derived  or  Vero  cellderived. These results demonstrate that passages of egg-derived influenza virus on Vero cells do not change their antigenicity. The  physicochemical  characterization  was  carried  out  by  Coomassie  staining  of  the  viral  proteins, separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The protein compositions of the Vero cellderived influenza virus MVBs were comparable to those of the egg-derived NIBSC standard antigen reagents. The  following  product-  and  process-related  impurities  have  been  identified  during  the  Active Substance  manufacturing  process  and  are  routinely  tested  for  during  the  process:  Vero  Cell  DNA during Manufacturing of Monovalent Bulk (MVB); Residual Vero Cell DNA in the Monovalent Bulk; Vero Host Cell Protein; residuals of formaldehyde, sucrose, trypsin and benzonase. The agreed specifications for the monovalent bulk include a test for vero cell protein via ELISA, the Haemagglutinin  assay  and  single  radial  immunodiffusion  (SRD)  test  for  HA  protein,  the  Bradford Method  for  total  protein,  the  Haemagglutination  Inhibition  (HI)  test,  H5N1  identity  test  using  RT PCR, a safety test for preparative influenza virus on Vero cells, a test for Tween 80 concentration via photometric detection, the LAL test for bacterial endotoxin and a sterility test. The  specifications  of  the  monovalent  bulk  have  been  sufficiently  justified  and  are  considered adequate. · Stability Stability test results of up to 12 month on 4 lots of Purified Monovalent Virus Harvest and 5 lots of monovalent bulk have been provided. An apparent decrease in protein concentration measured by the Bradford method was observed after 9 month with all MVBs produced to date. Therefore the shelf life of the monovalent bulk has been set at 6 month. The Applicant committed to provide the outcome of the his investigations regarding the decrease of total protein in the MVB and further results of stability studies on Monovalent Bulk as a follow up measure as soon as they become available. Medicinal Product The strain change variation to replace H5N1 with  H1N1 virus antigen does not affect the quality of the  finished  product.

## · Pharmaceutical Development

Celvapan  finished  product  contains  the  formalin-  and  UV-inactivated,  purified  whole  virion  in  a formulation of 7.5 μ g HA/0.5 mL dose without adjuvant. The product is presented in a 10 mL glass vial of hydrolytic type I. The filling volume corresponds to a content of 10 doses with 0.5 mL. The stopper consists of latex-free halogen-butyl rubber and is qualified by the supplier to be penetrated up to ten times. Overfilling of the vials by 0.85 mL minimum ensures that the nominal amount of product

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

doses (10 doses per vial) can be drawn from the vial. Therefore, the 10 dose vial contains at least 5.85 mL of Medicinal product solution.

The Applicant's pharmaceutical development was based on experience with various influenza strains, which  have  shown  that  individual  strains  exhibit  different  aggregation  behaviour  which  results  in losses during sterile filtration. Therefore, prior to sterile filtration a homogenization step is performed in the course of the Purification process. No additives or preservatives are added, except for Tween 80, which prevents re-aggregation of the virions. The excipients Tris-buffered saline (TBS containing Tris (Trometamol)  and  Sodium  Chloride,  Tris  (Trometamol,  20  mM)  as  buffer,  NaCl  (137  mM)  as electrolyte and Tween 80 detergent are used for the finished product (see Table 1).

Sterile  Monovalent  Bulks  (MVB)  are  transported  at  +2  to  +8  °C  from  the  Bohumil  facility  in  the Czech Republic to Vienna/Austria for formulation. Tris-buffer and Tween 80 solution are delivered from the Orth/Austria facility to Lange Allee 51. The Bulk Medicinal product is prepared in a closed production  system,  which  has  been  validated  by  media  runs.  The  calculated  amount  of  Tween  80 solution and Tris-Buffer are sterile filtered into the formulation tank. No preservatives are added. The mobile tank is stored in a cold storage at 2-8 °C until filling.  The  Bulk  Medicinal  product  is  filled under clean room Class A conditions (EU cGMP Guide) in multi dose vials and the vials are stoppered and crimped under class A conditions to give the Final Container Product. All components of the final container that come into contact with the product comply with the respective requirements in Ph. Eur., USP,  and  ISO  standard  specifications  concerning  containers  for  injectables.  Visual  inspection  is

The most critical aspect of formulation and filling is to maintain sterility of the Medicinal product as the sterile filtration is performed at the final stages of Active Substance preparation. All added buffer solutions  are  sterile  filtered  directly  prior  to  introduction  into  the  formulation  system.  Primary container  components  are  sterilized  and  the  vials  depyrogenized  before  filling.  The  second  critical aspect  is  the  homogeneity  of  the  product  throughout  the  filling  process.  This  is  guaranteed  by continuous stirring of the formulation vessel. Formulation and filling steps are performed according to established and validated procedures. The Bulk  Medicinal  product  is  prepared  in  a  closed  production  system  that  assures  aseptic  working conditions.  The  Bulk  Medicinal  product  is  filled  clean  room  Class  A  conditions  according  to  EU cGMP Guide, in multi dose vials and the vials are stoppered and crimped under class A conditions to give the Final Container Product. All components of the final container that come into contact with the product  comply  with  the  respective  requirements  in  USP,  Ph.  Eur.  and  ISO  standard  specifications concerning containers for injectables. The components of the Medicinal product have been adequately described and justified. No novel or unusual excipients are used and the formulation development is supported by clinical development. The  manufacturing  process  complies  with  standard  formulation  and  filling  procedures  used  for inactivated viral vaccines. · Adventitious Agents No materials of animal origin are added to the Active Substance in the manufacture of the finished product. Only the excipients Tris-buffered saline and Sodium Chloride and Tween 80 are used for the finished  product.  The  excipients  used  are  tested  for  sterility  using  membrane  filtration,  bacterial endotoxins using the LAL test, pH, conductivity and Tween 80 content. The analytical methods are performed according to Ph. Eur. where applicable and are validated according to ICH guidelines. The  two  excipients  of  animal  origin,  Trypsin  and  Cytodex,  used  in  the  production  of  the  Active Substance  have  been  evaluated  and  found  to  present  no  risk  of  TSE  transmission.  No  biological reagents involved in routine manufacture of the active substance contain any components of bovine origin. Overall, sufficient data is provided to exclude a risk of TSE transmission through Celvapan. The risk of transmitting TSE by Celvapan is thus considered very remote.

## · Product Specification

The quality control program performed on the Bulk Medicinal product for Celvapan include the single radial  haemolysis  (SRH)  Assay  for  quantification  of  haemagglutinin  (HA),  the  Bradford  assay  to determine total protein, a PCR test for detection of residual Vero cell DNA, an ELISA test for residual benzonase as well as tests for Tween 80 concentration, sucrose, formaldehyde, ph and sterility. Quality control  testing  performed  on  Final  Container  Product  consists  of  SRH  Assay  for  quantification  of haemagglutinin (HA), extractable volume, ph, bacterial endotoxin using the LAL test and sterility. All analytical methods are performed according to Ph. Eur. where applicable and are validated according to ICH guidelines.

With regard to the quality requirements for a novel influenza H1N1 vaccine, the Guideline On Dossier Structure And Content For Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Marketing Authorisation (CPMP/VEG/4717/03  Rev.  1)  and EMEA  fast  track  procedure  for  community  human  influenza inactivated  vaccines  annual  strain(s) (CHMP/BWP/99698/07)  are  applicable.  The  same  quality requirements and safety precautions apply to production of H5N1 and H1N1.

To overcome a possible limitations of availability of SRD reagents during a pandemic situation, the Applicant  developed  an  alternative  haemagglutinin  (HA)  quantification  method  based  on  HPLC determination of the HA-1 subunit of the HA protein. The value determined with this HPLC testing is compared to results of Influenza strains where SRD reagents are available.   The acceptability of the alternative HPLC method was subject of a Scientific Advice and was assessed to be acceptable. The Applicant has committed to complete the validation and implementation of this method in follow-up measures. Compliance  with  the  product  specifications  has  been  shown  on  three  conformance  lots  each,  the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 and the A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain. The provided data is considered acceptable. · Stability of the Product The stability indicating parameters cover identity, potency and purity as well as general quality and safety parameters.  The  specifications  used  in the stability studies and  the end  of shelf life specifications,  are  identical  with  the  acceptance  criteria  defined  in  the  release  specification  for  the respective production stage. Stability studies are performed using the actual final container (10 dose vials), except for the studies performed on clinical Phase 1/2 material, which was filled in single-dose syringes of the same glass material. Based on the data currently available on the Pandemic Influenza Vaccine for Clinical Phase 1/2, Phase 3 and Conformance Batches and taking the experience with several inter-pandemic Vero cell derived Influenza  Vaccine  lots  into  consideration  a  shelf  life  of  12  months  for  the  Medicinal  product  was accepted.  To  investigate  the  source  of  an  apparent  upward  trend  of  the  HA  content  detected  in  the SRD assay stability of the H5N1 vaccine will be further addressed in a follow up measure. The open shelf life following the first withdrawal of a dose is the following: 'vial to be used within one vaccination session or within 3 hours, whichever is less' 2.2.2  Pandemic Strain Variation (A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v) Medicinal product no longer authorised

The proposed influenza strain for Celvapan is: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v. This vaccine strain is a wild type strain and complies with the WHO 5 and CHMP 6 recommendations for the emergent novel H1N1 influenza vaccine composition and therefore is accepted.

Batch analysis results of monovalent bulk were provided. All batches have been tested according to the approved specifications. The results of the production batch analysis demonstrate the reproducibility of the manufacturing process for the drug substance.

Process  validation  data  on  virus  inactivation  have  been  submitted  for  three  consecutive  pilot  scale batches.  The  absence  of  validation  data  from  commercial  scale  production  batches  on  virus inactivation by formaldehyde was raised as a major objection, which remained unresolved until the last round of responses. The major objection has eventually been resolved following the assessment of the MAH's  responses on 15 September 2009. The scientific justification a well as the chronological events  that  led  to  resolving  this  major  objection  is  detailed  in  the  discussion  below.  Overall,  the validation data demonstrated the high capacity of the process in place to effectively inactivate H1N1 virus within a short time frame. Hence it can be concluded that a sufficient safety margin exists for vaccine  produced  at  industrial  scale.  In  addition  the  MAH  is  committed  to  provide  additional inactivation data on three industrial scale batches to confirm these results. An overview of commercial batches of drug substance produced until 23 September 2009 revealed that bacterial contamination of cell culture medium was detected in 3 out of 16 produced fermentation batches. The three contaminations occurred in a row due to the fact that the root cause could not be identified  immediately  and  because  of  the  fact  that  nonetheless  production  was  continued  to  meet urgent  product  requests.  Contaminated  batches  have  not  been  released  from  quarantine.  Major concerns  were  raised  in  a  Request  for  Supplementary  Information  in  this  respect  on  24  September 2009.  In  his  responses,  Baxter  provided  data  to  demonstrate  that  the  root  cause  for  these  bacterial contaminations  had  been  identified  and  corrective  measures  were  put  into  place  preventing  future contaminations..  This  was  further  demonstrated  by  raw  data  from  an  additional  11  batches  of manufactured drug substance, which was contamination free. Following the assessment of these data by the Rapporteur, the CHMP considered that the major objections and other concerns raised in the Request of Supplementary Information were resolved. A product related inspection on the issues was raised in the RSI of 24 September 2009, which took place at the Baxter BioScience manufacturing site (Baxter  BioScience  s.r.o.  -  Jevany  Bohumil  138  -  Kostelec  nad  Cernymi  lesy  -  Czech  Republic), confirmed  the  conclusions  that  the  root  cause  for  bacterial  contamination  during  fermentation  was identified  and  corrective  measures  were  effective.  The  manufacturing  site  was  confirmed  to  be compliant with GMP. Due  to  the  general  growth  characteristics  of  the  A/California/07/2009  (H1N1)v  virus  strain  the specification for HA content of the drug substance has been adjusted to be not less than 40 µg/mL. Other approved specifications for the drug substance have not been changed. Qualification studies for the SRD and HPLC assay were performed for the new virus strain. Sufficient assay qualification data is provided to assure acceptable performance of SRD assay to quantify HA content in the monovalent bulk and as such also of the drug product. The MAH commits to provide SRD validation data as follow-up measure. A comparability analysis on the physico-chemical level confirms the equivalence of the H1N1 based vaccine to the H5N1 based vaccine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Kinetics of the viral inactivation

The viral inactivation processes were reviewed by the CHMP.

With regard to whole H1N1v inactivation data which have been provided to date including

- o virus inactivation validation data by formaldehyde treatment and UV irradiation on 100 L scale including formaldehyde kinetics

o virus inactivation data by UV irradiation only on research scale including UV kinetics o virus  validation  report  (validation  of  technical  parameters  during  inactivation  (i.e. temperature, formaldehyde, titre) on 10 consecutive commercial batches including safety data (virus inactivation test in Vero cells and chicken embryo fibroblasts as part of the release  specifications)  from  the  PMVH.  Virus  inactivation  kinetics,  however,  were  not preformed on commercial batches. o supportive  information  including  an  inactivation  study  using  inactivation  conditions applied for seasonal Influenza strains and preliminary day 7 safety data on 100 subjects it is sufficiently ensured that an acceptable safety margin is obtained after formaldehyde treatment and UV irradiation for the vaccine produced at industrial scale. Nevertheless, the MAH has committed to provide additional inactivation data in order to verify the results from small scale validation runs as done for H5N1 previously. Conclusion Overall, the information presented in Modules 2.3 and 3 was considered in accordance with the abovementioned guidelines and was therefore acceptable. Minor issues have been identified and remain unresolved, which do not impact on the overall benefitrisk of the product. The Applicant has committed to resolve these issues through follow-up measures. 2.3 Non-clinical aspects Introduction A preliminary challenge experiment without testing the vaccine has been conducted, and only limited non-clinical data with Celvapan has been generated with vaccine materials that contain the pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) strain, whereas most of the non-clinical data was generated with vaccine made of an influenza A (H5N1) strain. Pharmacology studies evaluated both the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the vaccines in small  animals.  Mice  subcutaneously  (s.c.)  immunized  with  the  A/Vietnam/1203/2004  candidate vaccines  developed  anti-H5  HA-specific  antibodies  as  well  as  functional  antibodies  (HI  and/or microneutralisation (MN) titers), and survived the challenge with homologous or heterologous (clade 2.1 A/Indonesia/05/2005 or clade 3 A/HongKong/156/1997)  strains.  The  vaccines were  also demonstrated to be immunogenic in rats and guinea pigs in terms of all three serological tests (H5 specific  binding  ELISA,  HI  and  MN  assay).  Immune  antisera  raised  against  non-GMP  research material in guinea pigs cross-neutralized an array of heterologous H5N1 strains (3x Clade 1, 1x Clade 2.1, 2x Clade 2.2, 1x Clade 3, and H5N3) in vitro. Further supportive data on the immunogenicity and (cross-)protective  efficacy  were  generated  in  small  animals  (mice,  guinea  pigs:  s.c.,  preclinical materials) with the A/Indonesia/05/2005 H5N1 candidate vaccines.

## Pharmacology

- Primary Pharmacodynamics

## Non-clinical studies with H5N1 antigen:

Two ferret challenge studies demonstrated protective efficacy against a homologous challenge with 2.1 x 10 6 TCID50 in the ferrets previously immunised using a clinical lot of H5N1 vaccine prepared from strain A/Vietnam (Lot VNV1G001A, 7.5µg HA) and using the intended route and time interval. Whereas all animals in the control group receiving buffer died 4 to 7 days after administration of the challenge dose, 100% of ferrets in the vaccine group survived challenge. Data on virus recovery from post-mortem tissues confirmed that every animal in the control and vaccine group demonstrated some level  of  virus  replication  either  in  nasal  wash  or  in  one  or  more  tissues.  At  moribund  sacrifice,  all animals of the control cohort except one had high titres of virus in the lungs (between 3.8 to 6.4 logs TCID50 per gram of tissue), liver (4.3 to 5.9 logs TCID50 per gram), brain (2.9 to 4.9 logs TCID50 per gram) and olfactory bulb (5.4 to 7.1 logs TCID50 per gram). One animal only had virus recovered from the nasal wash and the liver (4.3 logs TCID50 per gram) and was found to have an atypical course of infection. The animals of the vaccinated cohort, having all survived to day 14, had for the most part cleared virus from every tissue examined except the liver. There was an absence of detectable virus in the lungs of all but one animal and in the brain of all but two animals. All olfactory bulbs taken from the vaccinated ferrets were negative for virus. The viral titres in the livers of the vaccinated ferrets were lower (between 3.5 to 4.4 logs TCID50 per gram) than for the control cohort (4.3 to 5.9 logs TCID50 per gram). In general  disease  symptoms  were  mitigated  in  the  vaccinated  ferrets  compared with the control group, i.e. reduced weight loss, a less pronounced and shorter increase in temperature, a less marked reduction in lymphocyte counts and in reduction of necrosis in the brain and olfactory bulb. Protection  against  homologous  or  heterologous  challenge  was  investigated  using  ferrets  immunised with a Clade 2 strain A/lndonesia/05/2005 vaccine. Sixty-six animals were divided into 6 cohorts and received either a dose of 7.5µg HA, 3.75µg HA or buffer on days 0 and 21. Animals were challenged intranasally with either A/Indonesia/05/2005 (1.0x10 5 TCID50, 1 log lower as targeted) or A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (1.5x10 6 TCID50) on day 35. Both the high and low doses of A/lndonesia/05/2005 vaccine were shown to be efficacious with 100% survival, reduced incidence of fever,  reduced  weight  loss,  reduced  virus  burden,  and  reduced  haematological  changes  in  the vaccinated cohorts following homologous challenge. However, due to the low challenge dose, 2 out of 8 animals in the control group survived the homologous challenge. Cross-protection  against  a  heterologous  challenge  indicated  a  vaccine  dose-dependent  survival  as compared to the control cohort. All control animals infected with A/Vietnam/1203/04 died between days  3  and  7  following  heterologous  challenge,  while  38%  of  animals  vaccinated  with  2  doses  of 7.5µg HA and 63% of animals vaccinated with 2 doses of 3.75µg HA died between days 6 and 10. Similarly to the homologous challenge, vaccination reduced virus burden, and reduced haematological changes against a heterologous challenge. Moreover, there is some evidence that survival correlates with  absence  of  viraemia  since  hepatic  inflammatory  necrosis  was  not  found  in  any  of  the  ferrets which survived 14 days post challenge. Non-clinical studies with (H1N1)v antigen: In support of the strain change two studies were submitted, PAN0080E01 and PAN0090E01. PAN0080E01 was a challenge study (non-GLP condition) with the aim to establish a challenge model. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Design:

Three  animal  species,  mice  (outbred  CD1  and  inbred  Balb/c),  hamsters,  and  guinea  pigs  were challenged either intranasally (i.n.), intraperitoneally  (i.p.)  or  intravenously  (i.v.)  with  the  wild-type A/California/07/2009 H1N1  strain, at doses ranging from  10 1 to  10 6 TCID50.  Challenging experimental conditions were:

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Female  mice  (6-9  weeks  old),  anesthetized,  i.n.  -  20  µl  (2.9x10 4 /dose);  i.p.  -  100  µl (1.45x10 5 /dose; i.v. - 100 µl (1.45x10 5 /dose); control mice received buffer;
- Female  hamsters  (20  weeks  old),  anesthetized,  i.n.  -  50  µl  (4.4x10 4 /dose);  i.p.  -  1  ml (8.7x10 5 /dose); control hamsters received buffer;
- Female  guinea  pigs  (6-9  weeks  old),  anesthetized,  i.n.  -  50  µl  (4.4x10 4 /dose);  i.p.  -  1  ml (8.7x10 5 /dose); control animals received buffer.

Challenged and control animals were observed for disease signs and death over a period of 14 days. On  day  14  (+/-  1  day)  post  inoculation,  sera  were  also  collected  from  mice  and  guinea  pigs  to investigate whether A/H1N1 challenge provoked an antibody response.

12 groups of 10 female CD1 mice (6-9 weeks old) were immunized s.c. twice, 3 weeks apart, with one of 6 doses of the vaccine (dose ranges from 0.0012 µg to 3.75 µg HA in 5-fold increments): 6 groups received  non-adjuvanted  vaccine  and  the  remaining  6  groups  received  the  0.3%  alum-adjuvanted vaccine.  For  each  animal  the  1 st and  2 nd immunizations  comprised  the  same  antigen  dose  and formulation. Negative controls received buffer alone or buffer containing 0.3% alum hydroxide.

Results and Discussions: Irrespective  of  the  route  of  challenge  (i.n.,  i.p.,  or  i.v.),  infection  with  A/California/07/2009  H1N1 wild-type influenza virus was not lethal for adult CD1 or Balb/c mice. At a dose of ≥ 10 4 TCID50, CD1 mice inoculated i.n. showed clinical symptoms. Symptom severity and the number of animals affected appeared to be dependent on challenge dose; In addition, high titer of infectious A/California/07/2009 H1N1 virus were detected on day 4 post inoculation in lungs of all CD1  mice  examined  which  received ≥ 10 3 TCID50  i.n.  challenge.  In  contrast  to  the  i.n.  route, however, the i.p. challenge ( ≥ 10 4 TCID50/dose) only caused mild disease symptoms (i.e. ruffled fur) in some but not all mice. In contrast to outbred CD1 mice, however, inbred Balb/c mice inoculated i.n. with a dose of ≥ 10 4 TCID50 showed only mild disease symptoms (i.e. ruffled fur) within 7 days after challenge. Moreover, whereas CD1 mice suffered on average for around 7 days, most Balb/c mice had recovered the following day. As expected, all control mice remained healthy and displayed no clinical symptoms during in-life phase of studies. Irrespective of inoculation route, CD1 mice elicited detectable HI antibodies against A/California/07/2009 H1N1 virus 14 days after challenge. In contrast, i.n. challenge in Balb/c mice failed  to  provoke  a  consistent  antibody  response  and  HI  antibodies  undetectable  in  4/5  challenged Balb/c mice. None of the hamsters or guinea pigs died or showed any disease symptoms throughout the 14 day observation  period.  i.n.  inoculation  of  guinea  pigs  could  elicit  relatively  low  but  detectable  HI antibodies against A/California/07/2009 H1N1 virus 14 days after challenge, however, i.p. inoculation failed to do so. In conclusion, CD1 mouse is susceptible to A/California/07/2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection and therefore is a suitable small animal challenge model, whereas Balb/c mice, hamsters and guinea pigs are not suitable as a challenge model for A/California/07/2009 H1N1 influenza virus. Overall, the  preliminary challenge study without testing vaccine demonstrated that the CD1 mice are a  suitable  model  for  investigating  the  protective  efficacy  of  Celvapan  in  against  H1N1  in  animal models. PAN0090E01 was an immunogenicity, dose-finding and adjuvant study (non-GLP), with the aim to evaluate the immunogenicity of Baxter's 100 L GMP monovalent bulk material A/H1N1 vaccine in CD1 mice.

Three  weeks  after  the  primary,  two  and  three  weeks  after  the  secondary  immunization,  the immunogenicity of Baxter's 100 L GMP monovalent bulk material A/H1N1 candidate vaccine was determined using the HI assay. The results are presented in the tables below.

It was found that a single immunization (Week 3 data) with the 100 L GMP monovalent bulk material A/H1N1 candidate vaccine provoked antibody responses against A/California/07/2009 influenza virus as  measured  by  the  HI  assay.  A  dose-dependent  antibody  response  was  provoked  by  both  the  nonadjuvanted and adjuvanted candidate vaccines. Furthermore, HI antibodies against A/California/07/2009  influenza  virus  increased  when  measured  two  weeks  after  the  secondary immunization, the effective dose 50% (that is, the dose inducing an HI titre of at least 1:40 in half of the immunized mice) decreasing from 300ng for a single immunization to 13ng for sera collected two weeks after  a  second  immunization  (Week  5  data).  Interestingly,  the  HI  titre  continued  to  increase when measured one week later (Week 6 data). The effective dose 50% was calculated to be 7ng for sera collected three weeks after a second immunization. These results demonstrate that the 100 L GMP monovalent bulk material A/H1N1 candidate vaccine is immunogenic in CD1 mice.

HI antibody titres were determined three weeks after the first and two and three weeks after the second immunization. 1 serum from individual mice was tested and the geometric mean titre (GMT) calculated. 2 for the HI assay, chicken erythrocytes were used.

In  conclusion,  the  MAH's  100  L  GMP  monovalent  bulk  material  A/California/07/2009  H1N1 candidate vaccine,  was  demonstrated  to  be  immunogenic  in  mice  both  with  non-adjuvanted formulation  and  with  adjuvanted  formulation  containing  0.3%  aluminum  hydroxide.  Furthermore,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

based on the ED50 values, it appears that the non-adjuvanted formulation is superior to the adjuvanted formulation.

The initial immunogenicity dose-finding study demonstrated that the MAH's 100 L GMP monovalent bulk  material  A/California/07/2009  (H1N1)v  candidate  vaccine,  adjuvanted  or  not  with  0.3% aluminum hydroxide, was immunogenic in CD1 mice. A clear dose-dependent antibody response was demonstrated.  However,  these  initial  data  presented  with  research  material  should  be  regarded  as preliminary,  and  the  results  generated  with  the  final  container  product  of  the  A/California/07/2009 H1N1 vaccine are awaited.

The  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  performed  in  CD  rats  was  a  pivotal  GLP  study  and  is  considered appropriate  for  toxicity  evaluation  (local  and  systemic).  In  this  study,  an  appropriate  number  of animals  per  sex  per  group  was  included  and  relevant  vaccine  exposure  (clinical  lot,  intramuscular route, 3x injections at a dose of either 24 µg HA with alum or 36 µg HA without adjuvant) given. The study consisted of a main study arm (32 days) and a 2-week recovery arm (46 days). The induction of relevant, functional immune response was provided by the induction of  functional immune response (HI  titers,  on  day  32  and  46).  Overall,  no  treatment-related  effects  were  observed  on  general conditions, clinical signs (including injection sites), body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology,

· Secondary pharmacodynamics Secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  not  performed.  This  approach  is  in  accordance  with  the relevant  guidelines,  note  for  guidance  on  preclinical  pharmacological  and  toxicological  testing  of vaccines  (CPMP/SWP/465/95)  and  the  guideline  on  dossier  structure  and  content  for  pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application, CPMP/VEG/4717/03. · Safety Pharmacology No studies were conducted as no specific concerns in physiological functions are raised. · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions No studies were performed. Pharmacokinetics Experimental studies to demonstrate absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the active ingredients  in  Celvapan  have  not  been  performed.  This  is  in  line  with  the  relevant  guidelines CPMP/SWP/465/95 and CPMP/VEG/4717/03. Toxicology The non-clinical toxicological testing program comprises a literature-based risk assessment of Tween 80  (Polysorbate  80),  a  non-GLP  rabbit  pyrogenicity  study,  a  GLP  single-dose  toxicity  study  and  a GLP pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study in which local tolerance assessment was included. · Single-dose toxicity The GLP single-dose toxicity study assessed the acute toxicity and local tolerance of the candidate vaccine  after  single  intramuscular  injection  in  Wistar  rats.  In  this  study,  the  vaccine  used  was  Preclinical 100L GMP material, and both adjuvanted (0.2% alum, 30 µg HA) and non-adjuvanted (45 µg HA) formulations were tested. No treatment-related systemic and local reactions (except the expected microscopical findings at the injection sites) were noted. However, the potency of these preparations in the tested rat strain is not known and the magnitude of immune responses to vaccines after single intramuscular injection was not shown.

urine  analysis,  haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  bone  marrow,  gross  macroscopical  pathology,  or organ weight. However, dose-dependent or treatment-related abnormalities in two clinical pathology parameters  were  noted:  one  was  a  slight  but  statistically  significant  increase  in  the  liver  enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP) and the other is slight but statistically significant decrease in plasma calcium, both occurring in male animals. These changes are small at group mean levels, however, some individual ALT  values  reached  2-fold  increase  relative  to  concurrent  controls  and  many  individual  plasma calcium values were found out of the range of control values. Whether these variations are within the limits  of  biological  variability  of  these  clinical  parameters  in  the  tested  animal  strain  is  unknown. Histology analysis (in this study, that is liver on day 46, and parathyroid gland and bone on days 32 and 46) has not been performed.

Also in this pivotal toxicity study it was found that the mean weights of lungs and bronchi (absolute change) were lower and of the thyroids (adapted change) were higher in females treated with nonadjuvanted  vaccine  in  comparison  with  concurrent  control.  A  relationship  of  this  change  with treatment is difficult to determine, because the finding was only observed on one occasion (day 46). The  MAH  considered  the  finding  to  be  of  doubtful  toxicological  importance,  and  justified  the statement by providing new histological data for thyroids/parathyroids and lungs and bronchi in the recovery group animals (Day 46). There were no abnormal findings or treatment-related changes in the concerned organ/tissues, and therefore it is considered that the slight changes seen in the weights of these organs were of less toxicological importance. · Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity No studies on genotoxicity and carcinogenicity were conducted with the candidate vaccines. · Reproduction Toxicity Two reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been submitted post authorisation of the initial  H5N1  mock-up  vaccine.  Data  was  not  availabale  at  the  time  of  the  evaluation  of  the  initial marketing authorisation. This was accepted taking into account the relevant guidelines as there is not a requirement for mock up vaccines to have  such data before authorisation. The results of these studies have been reflected in the SPC in variation II 01. The same study design was used for both studies. Two  groups  of  44  females  rats  were  allocated  to  each  study  and  treated  with  a  series  of  3x  i.m. injections  (400 μ l/occasion)  of  either  inactivated  wild  type  H5N1  influenza  vaccine  or  the  Vehicle control (buffer) on Day -42 and Day -14 before pairing and Day 7 after mating. Treated female rats were paired with stock males of the same strain and for each group, 22 females were killed on Day 20 after mating (embryo-fetal phase) and 22 females were allowed to rear their young to Day 21 of age (littering phase). Unselected offspring were killed on Day 21 of lactation and the selected F1 offspring were raised to sexual maturity and killed at seven weeks of age. The F1 offspring received no direct administration of the test substance; any exposure was in utero or via the milk. During  the  study,  clinical  condition,  dosing  observations,  bodyweight,  food  consumption,  gestation length, parturition observations and macroscopic pathology investigations were undertaken on the F0 females. Fetuses on the embryo-fetal phase of the study were examined macroscopically at necropsy and subsequently by detailed internal visceral examination or skeletal examination. For offspring on the littering phase of the study, clinical condition, survival, sex ratio, bodyweight, pre-weaning reflex development and macropathology findings were assessed. For selected F1 offspring clinical condition, bodyweight,  sensory  examinations,  sexual  maturation,  organ  weights  and  macroscopic  pathology investigations were undertaken.

In each study, the vaccine dose used was equivalent to 80% of human dose (i.e. 6 µg HA compared to 7.5 µg HA chosen for human use).

Serum samples were obtained from all F0 females on Days -49 and -7 before pairing, from embryofetal phase animals at Day 20 of gestation, from fetuses at Day 20 of gestation, from littering phase

females at Day 21 of lactation, from up to 1 male and 1 female offspring in all litters at Day 21 of age and from all selected F1 offspring at either week 6 (BAX0012) or week 7 (EWA0013) of age.

Based on the results of the studies with A/Indonesia/05/2005 and the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 candidate vaccines, it was concluded that treatment of female CD rats with these Influenza vaccines on Days -42 and  -14  before  pairing  and  on  Day  7  of  gestation  did  not  affect  mating  performance  or  fertility, embryo-fetal  survival  or  growth  or,  pre-  and  post-natal  survival  and  growth  of  the  offspring  or, adversely affect the pre- and post-natal development of the offspring up to 7 weeks of age.

The  design  of  the  studies  was  considered  adequate  with  the  endpoints  appropriately  selected  and evaluated. The serological responses to the vaccine and exposure of fetuses to specific antibodies were demonstrated.  According  to  the  data  presented,  no  vaccine-related  harmful  effects  were  seen  on mating performance or female fertility, embryo-foetal survival and pre- and post-natal development. · Local tolerance See single-dose studies. · Other toxicity studies A non-GLP rabbit pyrogenicity study investigated the pyrogenicity characteristics of the H5N1 whole viral  candidate  vaccine  in  comparison  with  a  licensed  seasonal  influenza  vaccine,  Vaxigrip,  as  a Standard  Reference.  In  this  study,  the  vaccine  formulation  used  (final  container  sample)  and  the vaccine  exposure  (i.v.,  5  human  doses)  were  relevant.  Two  separate  tests  (12  rabbits  in  total) suggested that the candidate vaccine is non-pyrogenic. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment No  environmental  risk  assessment  is  included  in  the  application.  According  to  the  guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  ' Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human Use' vaccines due to the nature of their constituents are exempted from the requirement to provide an environmental risk assessment in the application for a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product for human use. 2.4 Clinical aspects Introduction The avian influenza strain H5N1 strain was initially considered as a possible candidate to cause the next influenza pandemic. Therefore the MAH decided to base the mock-up dossier on clinical studies performed (immunogenicity and safety) with vaccine containing the A(H5N1) strain. Since then, Phase 6 of the influenza pandemic has been declared and the strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v  was  officially  recommended.  Clinical  data  on  Celvapan  A(H1N1)v  are  expected  in accordance with agreed timelines. GCP Inspection performed Medicinal product no longer authorised

The clinical trial 810601 was performed in accordance with the quality standards of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and reflected the requirements  of  the  EMEA  guidance.  Study  810601  was  performed  in  Europe.  Written  informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to entry into the study.

## Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic studies  were  not  performed  in  accordance  with  the  'Note  for  guidance  on  clinical evaluation of new vaccines' (CPMP/EWP/463/97) and the Guideline on dossier structure and content for pandemic influenza vaccine marketing authorisation application (CPMP/VEG/4717/03).

## Pharmacodynamics

The  pharmacodynamic  principle  of  vaccines  generally  could  be  regarded  as  the  induction  of  an immune  response  sufficient  to  protect  from  infection  with  or  disease  arising  from  the  specific pathogen,  the  vaccination  is  directed  against.  In  the  context  of  influenza,  surrogate  parameters  are defined (CPMP/VEG/4717/03) that allow conclusion on the efficacy of the vaccine. Clinical studies performed on Celvapan were designed to obtain information on these specific surrogate parameters and  further  characteristics  of  the  immune  response,  i.e.  the  level  and  type  of  specific  antibodies elicited the persistence of antibody titres and the investigation of a dose response relationship to define the appropriate dosing recommendation. Thus the immunological response to Celvapan is covered as part of the evaluation of efficacy. Clinical efficacy The  initial  mock-up  application  was  based  on  two  clinical  studies  810501  and  810601  that  are summarised  below.  Both  studies  were  multicentre  uncontrolled  studies.  Whereas  in  study  810501 different vaccines formulations containing H5N1 whole virion inactivated antigen derived from Vero cells were investigated in adults aged 18-45 years study 810601 employed the final formulation in two age groups - healthy adults (18-59 years) and elderly (60 years and older). For  the  primary  vaccination  series  H5N1  strain  A/Vietnam/1203/2004  was  used  to  prepare  the investigational vaccine, whereas for the booster immunizations strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (clade1, Month 6 booster), and strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 (clade 2; Month 6, M12, M24 booster) were used to prepare the prototype vaccine. In study 810601 vaccine derived from both strains were administered for the booster immunisations, whereas in study 810703 - the follow-up of subjects enrolled in study 810501 - 7.5µg HA of vaccine prepared from strain A/Indonesia was given as booster immunisation.

Post-authorisation the final CSR of Study 810701 became available. Study 810701 was an open-label Phase I/II study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two doses (3.75µg or 7.5µg HA) of a Vero cell-derived,  whole  virion  Clade  2  H5N1  Influenza  vaccine  (strain  A/Indonesia/05/2005)  in  healthy volunteers aged 21 to 45 years. The study was conducted in Hong Kong and Singapore and an interim CSR was available during the initial procedure for marketing authorisation of the mock-up vaccine.

Interim clinical reports were planned for study 810501 following the primary immunisation series and at 6 months after first vaccination in order to get information on antibody persistence. For 810501 two clinical  study  reports  (Part  A  alone,  and  Part  A  and  B  combined)  were  submitted  containing  the analyses after completion of the primary series and analyses for antibody persistence up to 6 months after  primary  vaccination.  The  6-months  safety  analysis  and  analysis  of  cellular  immune  responses were available during the procedure (Part C). For study 810601 an interim report after completion of the primary immunisation series (Part A) was submitted in the initial marketing authorisation application. Results on antibody persistence derived from  study  810601  and  the  6-months  booster  immunisations  of  study  810601  (Part  B)  and  12-15 month  booster  immunisation  of  study  810703  have  been  provided  during  the  initial  marketing authorisation procedure. A clinical study report (CSR) for Part C of study 810601 was made available post-authorisation in Q2/2009 and has been assessed as a Follow-Up Measure (FUM). Parts D and E of the study 810601 are ongoing and the anticipated completion of the CSR is given as Q2 2010. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Immunogenicity results

The  immunogenicity  of  Celvapan  was  investigated  in  two  clinical  trials  using  haemagglutination inhibition  (HI)  assays,  microneutralisation  (MN)  assays  and  single  radial  haemolysis  (SRH)  assays. For both studies the interpretation of the HI and SRH results for each H5N1 vaccine formulation after each injection was linked to the immunogenicity requirements defined by the Note for Guidance on Harmonisation for Influenza vaccines (CPMP/BWP/214/96).

The  high  variability  and  low  sensitivity  of  the  HI  assay  was  also  subject  of  the  EMEA  Scientific Advice  (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/310862/2007)  and  the  company  was  encouraged  to  provide  further immunogenicity data based on the SRH assay and challenge studies using the ferret model to confirm proof-of-concept.

Table 2: Parameters of the Note for Guidance (CPMP/BWP/214/96) *   Proportion of subjects with a pre-vaccination HI titer &lt;1:10 to a post-vaccination HI titer ≥ 1:40 Proportion of subjects with a baseline haemolysis area of ≤ 4 mm² and  an area of ≥ 25 mm²  post vaccination †   Proportion of subjects with HI titres ≥ 1:10 before vaccination and ≥ 4-fold increase of the titer. Proportion of subjects with a ≥ 50% increase in haemolysis area if the pre-vaccination area is &gt;4 mm² ‡   Geometric mean of individual ratios (post-/pre-vaccination titres: D21/D0 or D42/D0) With regards to the MN  assay similar requirements were defined for the calculation of seroneutralisation rates using a cut-off of ≥ 1:20. Further as proposed in guideline EMEA/CHMP/VWP/263499/2006  the  proportions  of  achieving  at  least  a  fourfold  increase  in  the neutralising antibody titer (criterion for seroconversion) and GMTs were reported along with reverse cumulative distribution curves. To allow the use of the immunogenicity criteria it should be demonstrated that the Vero-cell derived pandemic influenza vaccine is antigenically similar to the egg-cultured vaccine, as requested in the NfG on influenza vaccines (CPMP/BWP/214/96). The MAH provided data on the characterization of egg-derived and Vero cell-derived influenza virus vaccine strains of previous influenza seasons. No significant differences in their infectivity, antigenicity and immunogenicity in mice were demonstrated. Moreover the egg-derived seed virus remains genetically stable during five passages in Vero cells. Hence it can be anticipated that the production system has no influence on the antigenicity of the vaccine. HI assay The evaluation  of  human  sera  by  HI  assays  revealed  a  high  variability  in  the  test  results,  although varying designs of the assay were applied: HI titres were assessed using horse or turkey erythrocytes as well as utilising antigen from homologous or heterologous wild type or RG reassortant strains from different sources (egg-derived or MDCK-derived). Surprisingly the highest immune responses across all vaccine groups were found with antigen of the RG reassortants regardless whether it was egg or MDCK derived or represent a homologous or heterologous strain. In general, a low responsiveness was observed throughout all  analyses  of  human  sera  most  probably  due  to  a  low  sensitivity  of  the assay in clinical studies - in contrast to pre-clinical studies. Similar findings were reported for some other H5N1 vaccines. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## MN assay

The MN assay is based on ability of neutralising antibodies to inhibit the attachment of virus to cells as  well  as  intracellular  penetration  and  propagation.  Such  assays  are  commonly  used  to  detect

protective antibodies in human reconvalescent sera or sera from vaccinees. However, at present it is not  known  which  neutralising  antibody  titer  confers  protection  against  a  potential  pandemic  strain. Moreover  there  is  a  high  variability  in  test  results  depending  on  the  laboratory  and  the  specific neutralisation  assay  employed.  Several  studies  have  indicated  that  a  cut-off  of  1:20  is  appropriate whereas  others  have  used  a  cut-off  of  1:40.  The  interpretation  of  results  based  on  different neutralisation assays is further hampered because no international reference material is available for standardisation.

The MAH performed passive immune transfer studies in mice to evaluate whether the chosen cut-off titer  of  1:20  is  appropriately  defined.  A  MN  titer  of  1:5  (mouse  immune  sera)  or  1:7  (guinea  pig immune  sera),  respectively,  was  demonstrated  to  correlate  with  50%  protection  against  a  lethal challenge.  In  addition  two  independent  passive  immune  transfer  experiments  using  pooled  human immune sera  from  vaccinees  enrolled  in  study  810601  were  conducted.  One  day  after  intravenous injection  of  different  dilutions  of  the  human  antibodies  mice  were  challenged  with  a  lethal  dose  of wild  type  virus  strain  A/Vietnam/1203/2004  of  133  LD50  units.  Two  hours  before  challenge  the animals were bled and the neutralising antibody titres were determined before and after administration. The calculated MN titre of 1:10 was found to protect 50% of animals, whereas these calculated MN titres  were not measurable after administration. However, these data suggest that the cut-off titer of 1:20  is  appropriately  defined  for  the  MN  assay  and  that  the  neutralising  antibody  response  as measured in cell culture corresponds to a functional immune response in vivo. With regard to assay validation  an  initial  validation  report  was  presented.  In  addition  upon  request during  the  procedure  and  following  a  GCP  inspection  revalidation  of  the  assay  was  conducted.  In summary, the new validation data were found to be satisfactory. SRH assay As requested per EMEA Scientific Advice standard SRH assays were conducted to confirm the results obtained with the MN assay. A detailed description of the assay and the validation report was provided in  the  Applicant's  response  to  the  day120  LoQ.  The  performance  of  the  assay  was  found  to  be satisfactorily validated. Cellular immunity Preliminary data on cellular immunity were provided and demonstrate a strong bias towards a humoral immune response. · Dose response studies Dose response study 810501 In  the  dose-response  study  810501  four  vaccine  formulations  adjuvanted  with  alum  (3.5µg,  7.5µg, 15µg  and  30µg)  and  2  non-adjuvanted  vaccine  formulations  (7.5µg  and  15µg)  were  evaluated  in healthy adults of 18-45 years of age. Vaccines were administered intramuscularly on day 0 and day 21 . Medicinal product no longer authorised

Based  on  the  MN  and  SRH  assay  using  the  homologous  vaccine  strain  (A/Vietnam)  the  highest immune  responses  were  achieved  following  two  immunisations  with  the  non-adjuvanted  vaccine formulations.  Moreover  after  the  first  vaccination  significantly  higher  seroprotection  rates  by  SRH assay and seroneutralisation rates (percentage of subjects with MN titre ≥ 1:20)  by  MN assay were observed in the non-adjuvanted vaccine groups compared to the adjuvanted vaccine groups indicating no  adjuvanting  but  rather  an  inhibitory  effect  of  alum  throughout  all  antigen  concentrations.  These results  are  contrary  to  the  experience  with  an  already  approved  whole  virion  vaccine  where  an adjuvanting effect of alum could be demonstrated. The controversial effects might be explained by the fact that different manufacturing processes are used for the two vaccines.  Celvapan is based on a wild type virus strain propagated in Vero cells whereas the other whole virion vaccine utilises a reassortant strain grown in embryonated hen eggs.

The  seroprotection  and  seroneutralisation  rates  following  the  2-dose  vaccination  schedule  and  6 months later are summarised in Table 3 (MN assay) and Table 4 (SRH assay).

Reverse cumulative analyses on MN titre distributions post dose 1 and 2 provide additional evidence on the lack of an adjuvanting effect of alum and demonstrate that there is no impact of the antigen concentration on the immune response, i.e no dose-response is observed neither for the adjuvanted nor the non-adjuvanted vaccine formulations (Figure 1).

Four  different  alum  adjuvanted  (3.75µg,  7.5µg,  15µg,  30µg  HA)  and  two  non-adjuvanted  (7.5µg, 15µg HA) vaccine formulations of the pandemic candidate influenza vaccine (single-dose presentation) were administered each on D0 and D21 as primary vaccinations. Each subject received two injections of 0.5ml of the same vaccine dose and formulation by intra-muscular injection into the musculus  deltoideus.  Blood  samples  were  taken  on  day  0,  day  21  and  41  as  well  as  on  day  180 (+14 days) for the immunogenicity assessment.

With  both  the  SRH  and  the  MN  assay  all  three  requirements  were  fulfilled  following  two immunisations with the non-adjuvanted 7.5µg vaccine formulation with seroprotection rate of 78.6% by SRH assay and seroneutralisation rate of 76.2% by MN assay, seroconversion rates of 69.0% and 73.8% and a GM fold increase of 5.3 and 6.3, respectively. Moreover cross-neutralisation experiments indicate a high responsiveness for the original prototype A/Hongkong strain (76.2%) and a reasonable cross-neutralising  response  for  the  further  evolved  strain  A/Indonesia  (45.2%).  The  neutralising antibody responses against all three virus strains persist over 6 months with low to moderate decline rates (A/Vietnam: 54.8%; A/Indonesia: 33.3%; A/Hongkong: 71.4%). Thus, the choice of the non-adjuvanted 7.5µg formulation is justified for Celvapan. · Main studies Study 810601 immunogenicity of the 7.5µg vaccine in healthy adults and elderly METHODS  (The methods for study 810501 and 810601 are described together in this section) Study Participants The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  for  both  studies  810501  and  810601  were  in  general  identical except for the age at the time of first vaccination.

## Study 810601:

One  lot  (Lot  Number  VNV1G001A)  of  the  candidate  vaccine  was  used  for  the  first  and  second vaccinations  in  all  subjects.  The  vaccine  for  the  primary  vaccination  series  was  produced  of  strain A/Vietnam/1203/2003  according  to  the  final  manufacturing  process.  It  was  provided  as  multi-dose presentation containing no preservative

Objectives

Study 810501: The primary objective of this study was to identify the immunogenicity and safety of different doses of an adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted mock-up pandemic influenza vaccine. Study 810601: The primary objectives of this study were: To assess the immune response to an H5N1 influenza vaccine in an adult and elderly population; To assess the safety and tolerability of an H5N1 influenza vaccine in an adult and elderly population; To assess the need for and timing of a booster vaccination; For a subset of subjects further objectives of the study included: To evaluate the T-cell  mediated immune response induced by an H5N1 influenza vaccine after the first, second and booster vaccination.

four fold titer increase) 21 days after the first and second vaccinations as measured by MN, SRH and HI assays and booster data measured with different assays.

For a subset of subjects cellular immunity has been assessed.

## Sample size

Study 810501 :  The  sample size was planned under the assumption that for a seroprotection rate of 80% and 40 subjects  per  group,  the  (half-)  width  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  for  this  rate  is  at  most 15.2%. To account for a drop-out rate of about 10% forty-five subjects had to be enrolled per group. Study 810601 : Anticipating an observed seroprotection rate of about 60%, with a sample size of 250 subjects, the (half-) width of the two-sided 95% CI for this rate is at most 6.4%. In order to account for a drop-out rate of 10% a total number of 275 subjects were to be included into each of the 2 age strata (18 to 59 years, ≥ 60 years).

## Study population

Randomisation In study 810501 patients were randomised in cohorts. In cohort 1 patients were randomised applying a  randomisation  ratio  of  1:1:1  to  receive  3.75 μ g  adjuvanted,  7.5 μ g  adjuvanted  or  7.5 μ g  nonadjuvanted  H5N1,  in  cohort  2  patients  were  randomised  in  an  1:1  ratio  to  receive  either  15 μ g adjuvanted or 15 μ g non-adjuvanted H5N1 while patients in cohort 3 were not randomised but received 30 μ g adjuvanted H5N1. In study 810601 initially all patients received 7.5 μ g non-adjuvanted H5N1. Subjects were randomised at visit 4 (day 180 +/- 14 days) in a ratio of 2:1:1 to receive either 6 months, 12-months or 24-months booster vaccinations. Blinding (masking) Study  810501  was  blinded  with  respect  to  the  individual  treatment  group  within  cohorts  1  and  2 respectively. The reported part of study 810601 was performed as a not controlled, open label trial. Statistical methods Seroprotection  rates  were  the  primary  efficacy  parameter  in  both  trials.  In  study  810501  for  each treatment group the seroprotection rates (defined as MN titer ≥ 1:20 and HI titer ≥ 1:40 respectively) 21 days after the first and second vaccination and their 95% CIs intervals were calculated separately for both, HI and MN assays. In study 810601 the seroprotection rates (defined as MN titer ≥ 1:20) 21 days after the second vaccination and their 95% confidence intervals calculated separately for both age strata. All secondary immunogenicity endpoints were described by means of point estimates including their 95%-CIs stratified for the pre-defined strata. In  order  to  assess  the  effect  of  adjuvant,  in  study  810501  the  antibody  response  to  the  two  vaccine doses prepared with and without adjuvant (with 7.5 µg and 15 µg of antigen) was evaluated by an analysis of covariance. Dose, presence of adjuvant and the interaction between dose and adjuvant were the  factors  included  into  the  analysis  model;  baseline  values  were  considered  as  covariates.  These analyses were done separately for the HI assay and the MN assay, as well as for the first and second vaccination. Logistic regression was used to perform similar analyses with respect to seroprotection rates and seroconversion rates. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## RESULTS

Participant flow

## Study 810601:

Each subject received two 0.5ml doses of the same vaccine intramuscularly in the primary vaccination series (D0 and D21) and a booster dose of the vaccine containing either the homologous A/Vietnam strain  or  the  heterologous  A/Indonesia/05/2005  strain  was  administered  to  a  subset  of  subjects  on month 6, month 12 or month 24, respectively (see flow chart below).

## Recruitment

In study 810501 the date of first enrolment was 12.06.2006, for Part A (through day 42): 05.10.2006, for Part B (through Day 180): 16.02.2007 and the last subject completed Part C (through Day 250) on 07.03.2007.

In study 810601 the first subject has been enrolled 10.04.2007 and the last subject completed Part A (through Day 42) at 02.08.2007.

Conduct of the study In study 810501 a total of 284 subjects were enrolled of which 275 received the first vaccination and 257 subjects received the second vaccination. In total, 249 subjects were  valuable for the immunogenicity analysis. Seventeen subjects did not come back after the first vaccination and eight subjects did not come back after the second vaccination at day 42. Study 810601 had 8 amendments to the original protocol, but only 7 were ultimately implemented. For the German study centres, a blood draw to evaluate liver function 7 days after the first and second vaccination  was  introduced  in  response  to  elevated  liver  enzymes  in  a  preclinical  test  in  rats.  The amended booster vaccination schedule includes a booster vaccination at 6-months, 12-months and 24months using the H5N1 influenza vaccine containing alternatively the vaccine strain or the clade 2 A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain. In the amendment 5, the principal investigator of a study site in Austria was replaced  because  of  GCP/GDP  related  irregularities  at  this  site.  Amendment  6  comprised  of  a revision  of  the  12  months  booster  to  include  both  the  3.75  and  7.5µg  dose  of  A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain  vaccine.  In  amendment 7 to the study protocol the 24 months booster was revised to include both the 3.75 and 7.5 µg dose of A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain vaccine. Baseline data In study 80501 slightly more male subjects (143 for the first and 137 for the second vaccination) than female subjects (115 for the first vaccination and 112 for the second vaccination) were included in the immunogenicity dataset. On Day 180 slightly more male subjects (136) than female subjects (111) were included in the immunogenicity dataset. The largest number of subjects in both datasets was aged 18 to 25 years (23%-35% across groups); the second largest number of subjects was aged 26 to 30 years (19%-35% across groups). Study 810601 Gender was evenly distributed in both strata. Age was well distributed in Stratum A, in Stratum B 51.1 % of subjects were between 60 and 65 and a further 32.5 % of subjects between 66 and 70 years old. Seropositive antibody titres against the H5N1 vaccine strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) at baseline were shown in 4.1% and 16.9% of subjects for MN, and 4.5% and 5.3% for SRH in Stratum A and B, respectively. Numbers analysed In study 810501 t he immunogenicity dataset was used for the analysis of antibody response after the first  and  second  vaccinations  and  on  Day  180  and  comprised  the  subjects  who  fulfilled  the inclusion/exclusion criteria and had immunogenicity data available for the first (n=258) and second (n=249) vaccination, as well as for Day 180 (n=247). No subjects were excluded for major protocol violations. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In study 810601 number of subjects planned were 550 (275 Stratum A, 275 Stratum B) and analyzed (Part A) were 561 (281 Stratum A, 280 Stratum B) in full analysis dataset for first vaccination, 542 (270 Stratum A, 272 Stratum B) in ITT dataset for first vaccination (ITT 1), 539 (269 Stratum A, 270  Stratum  B)  received  second  vaccination,  539  (269  Stratum  A,  270  Stratum  B)  in  full  analysis dataset  for  second  vaccination,  535  (265  Stratum  A,  270  Stratum  B)  in  ITT  dataset  for  second vaccination (ITT 2) and 525 (257 Stratum A, 268 Stratum B) in PP dataset for second vaccination

Following two vaccinations and based on the MN assay all three requirements were fulfilled in the age group of adults and 2 out of 3 requirements were met in the elderly (Table 5). With regards to the group of adults a seroneutralisation rate of 72.5%, a seroconversion rate of 60.8% and a 4.7 fold GM increase  was  achieved.  In  the  elderly  a  seroneutralisation  rate  of  74.1%,  a  seroconversion  rate  of 26.7% and a 2.8 fold increase was obtained (Table 5). In summary based on the MN assay 3 out of 3 CHMP requirements were met for the adults and 2 out of 3 requirements were fulfilled for the elderly subjects.

The results of the MN assay were generally confirmed by the SRH assay (Table 6). Following two vaccinations 2 out of 3 three CHMP requirements were fulfilled in adults and all three 3 requirements were met in the elderly. In the group of the adults a seroprotection rate of 63.3%, a seroconversion rate

Of  note  is  the  high  rate  of  seropositivity  in  the  MN  assay  prior  to  vaccination.  Detectable  prevaccination anti H5N1 neutralising antibodies were found in 4.1% of subjects in the group of adults (11 subjects) and 16.9% of subjects in the group of elderly (46 subjects). This finding is confirmed by the reverse distribution of MN titres where 60% of elderly subjects achieved MN titres of at least 1:10. Considering that elderly are routinely vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccines, it can be assumed that  an  antibody  response  against  N1  is  at  least  partially  responsible  for  the  pre-existing  immunity towards  H5N1  viruses.  The  presence  of  cross-reactive  antibodies  especially  at  older  ages  is  well documented  and  was  also  reported  for  other  pandemic  vaccines.  It  should  be  noted  however,  that cross-neutralisation experiments conducted in guinea pigs demonstrate that the immune response to Celvapan is predominantly directed against the H5 molecule and not the N1 protein. This implies that a  pre-existing  immunity  against  the  N1  protein  is  probably  not  boostered  by  Celvapan.  In  order  to

clarify, whether the baseline seropositivity is due to cross reactive anti NA antibodies cross-absorption analyses using different concentrations of NA and HA were requested and have been assessed as a Follow Up Measure.

These data confirmed the results of cross-neutralisation experiments conducted in guinea pigs where it was found that the immune response to Celvapan (H5N1) was predominantly directed against the H5 molecule and not the N1 protein.

Although a high proportion of the elderly were found to have pre-existing neutralising antibodies only a low seroconversion rate (defined as 4-fold increase) could be achieved post dose II indicating that there  is  a  reduced  ability  to  react  to  antigen  or  to  boost  the  immune  response.  Moreover  the comparison of the seroconversion rates measured by MN vs. SRH assay reveals significant differences for elderly subjects. Post dose I seroconversion rates of 14.3 % (MN assay) and 52.4 % (SRH assay) were obtained and reached 26.7 % and 62.4 % by MN assay and SRH assay, respectively following post dose II. In order to dispel the influence of baseline H5N1 antibody titres on the immunogenicity results, a detailed analysis of the serology endpoints according to baseline status was requested. The study population was divided into two groups by using a cut-off of &lt;25mm² for the SRH and &lt;1:20 for the MN assay. Therefore, one group consisted of those subjects who already had so-called 'protective' titres at baseline and the other group was made up of subjects who where either seronegative or had low titres before the first immunization. This analysis predictably showed that those subjects who had a high titre at baseline still had high titres at day 42, but fold increase and seroconversion rates were lower for both assays. The subjects with low or negative baseline titres showed adequate SRH fold increase and seroconversion rates, but the rate of subjects with a titre ≥ 25mm² was 61.8% in the group of adults and therefore well below the acceptance limit. In the group of the elderly all 3 requirements for  the  SRH  assay  were  met.  Regarding  the  MN  assay,  if  the  CHMP  guideline  requirements  are applied,  all  of  them  can  be  satisfied  in  both  age  strata.  A  further  analysis  of  subjects  negative  for baseline neutralising antibodies is deemed to be of greater relevance to identify the responsiveness of immunologically naïve subjects. Antibody persistence Data on antibody persistence up to day 180 were also provided by the MAH  (see table 5 (MN assay) and Table 6 (SRH  assay) above). The data on antibody persistence reveal a decline in seroneutralisation/seroprotection rates of 35% to 40% for both age groups using either the MN or the SRH assay. The decline in the neutralizing antibody responses is however less pronounced than the decline in antibody responses determined by SRH assay. Whereas a substantial number of vaccinees have neutralizing antibody titres (of at least of 1:10) up to 180 days post vaccination (Figure 2), for only approximately 50% of adults and elderly subjects antibodies ≥ 4mm 2 are detectable in the SRH assay (Figure 3).

Blood samples were drawn on Day 0 before vaccination, as well as on Day 7 and 21 of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The following serological assays were performed to assess the antibody response to the vaccine: MN, SRH and HI. The HI results were again consistently low with and highly inconsistent with the immune response detected with MN and SRH assays.

The seroneutralisation/seroprotection rates against strain A/Vietnam and strain A/Indonesia following a  heterologous booster immunisation with 7.5µg HA strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 are summarised in Table 7 for the MN assay and in Table 8 for the SRH assay.

With the MN assay a seroneutralisation rate of 100%, a GM fold increase of 14.0 and a seroconversion rate  of  91.7%  were  achieved  against  the  booster  strain  A/Indonesia.  Based  on  the  SRH  assay  all subjects were found to be seronegative (&lt;25mm 2 ) for the heterologous strain A/Indonesia prior booster immunisation and 7 to 21 days after the heterologous booster SPR of ~70%, a GM increase of 7.4 and a SCR of ~70% were obtained. While the neutralising antibody response against the A/Vietnam strain was generally  lower  than  against  strain  A/Indonesia  after  the  heterologous  booster  immunisation  it was significantly higher against strain  A/Vietnam than against strain A/Indonesia by SRH analysis. These findings indicate that most likely different types of antibodies are measured by the two different assays. While for the SRH assay complement is used, it is not specifically added to the MN assay. Consequently antibodies not binding to and thereby activating complement will not be detected in the SRH assay but might be measured in the MN assay. It can be speculated that complement dependent antibodies are more  specific in their epitope binding activity  than  complement  independent neutralising antibodies.  Another possible explanation for the different antibody responses to

homologous and heterologous antigens could be the presence of anti NP or M2 antibodies detectable in one assay but not the other.

## Study 810601

For the 6-months booster immunisation half of the subjects were randomized into 4 groups to receive one of the following dosages:

- -3.75 µg HA antigen, strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 per 0.25 mL
- -7.5 µg HA antigen, strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 per 0.5 mL

.

-3.75 µg HA antigen, strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 per 0.25 mL -7.5 µg HA antigen, strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 per 0.5 mL Antibody response to the vaccine was assessed using the following assays: -Microneutralisation (MN) -Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) -Single Radial Haemolysis (SRH) Immunogenicity endpoints determined by MN, HI and SRH assay were evaluated against the H5N1 influenza strain contained in the vaccine for the 6-months booster vaccination (either A/Vietnam/1203/2004 or A/Indonesia/05/2005). Currently no SRH analysis was provided using strain A/Indonesia/05/2005 as antigen. Immunogenicity endpoints were analyzed for the ITT dataset only and comprised all subjects who had data available on Day 180 (± 14 days) and for the subjects randomized to receive the 6-months booster vaccination with available data on Day 201 (21 ± 3 days). The ITT dataset for Day 180 (pre booster vaccination) comprises 501 subjects (243 in Stratum A adults and 258 in Stratum B - elderly). The post 6-months booster vaccination ITT dataset comprises 243 subjects (116 adults and 127 elderly). The Day 201 results of the HI assay reported (using horse erythrocytes) were consistently low with respect to all measures i.e. seroprotection rate, seroconversion rate, GMT and GM fold increase from baseline  after  the  6-months  booster  vaccination.  These  tests  were  inconclusive  due  to  the  apparent insensitivity of the HI assay. Seroneutralisation/seroprotection The rates of subjects who achieved an antibody titer ≥ 1:20 measured by MN against the vaccine strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 or A/ Indonesia/05/2005 after the 6-months booster vaccination are presented in Table 13 (Adults) and Table 14 (Elderly). The rates of subjects with antibody response associated with protection as defined by area ≥ 25mm 2 is presented in Table 15. Medicinal product no longer authorised

GM of fold increase The GMs of fold increase of MN titer post booster vaccination are presented in Table 16 (Adults) and Table 17 (Elderly). The GM of fold increase as measured by SRH assay is shown in Table 18. In  adults  aged  18  to  59  years,  the  highest  GM  fold  increase  of  MN  titer  (3.3)  was  observed  in  the 7.5µg A/Indonesia/05/2005 booster vaccine group when tested against the A/Indonesia/1205/05 strain. The GM fold increase in SRH area was 2.6 in the 7.5 µg A/Vietnam/1203/2004 dose group and 3.8 in the 7.5 µg A/Indonesia/05/2005 dose group. In elderly subjects, the GM fold increase in MN titer was lower  compared  to  adults.  The  GM  of  fold  increase  in  SRH  area  was  only  slightly  lower  than  the defined CPMP criterion (&gt;2.0) in the 7 .5 µg A/Indonesia/05/2005 dose group (2.0).

Fold increase as compared to Day 0. Fold increase as compared to Day 180. Seroconversion The  number  of  subjects  with  cross-strain  seroconversion  (defined  as  a  &gt;4  fold  increase  in  MN titer/50%  increase  in  haemolysis  area  21  days  after  booster  vaccination)  was  low  across  both  dose groups strains. This is most likely due to the higher percentage of subjects with pre-existing antibodies elicited  by  the  primary  vaccination  series  with  A/Vietnam/1203/2004 vaccine 6 months prior to the booster (Table 19, Table 20 and Table 21).

The study is being conducted in 2 parts:

- Frequency and severity of systemic reactions after the first and second vaccinations

Fold increase as compared to Day 0. Based on these data it can be concluded that a homologous or heterologous booster immunisation has no added value as regards higher seroconversion rates but might elicit stronger cross-reactive antibody responses. Generally the antibody responses following the homologous and heterologous booster are however less pronounced compared to study 810703 indicating a moderate anamnestic response. In summary the responses are comparable to what is expected for seasonal revaccination. Ancillary analyses · Supportive studies Study 810701 Study 810701 is an open-label Phase I/II study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of a Vero cell-derived, whole virus clade 2 H5N1 Influenza vaccine (strain A/Indonesia, 3.75µg and 7.5µg)  in  110  healthy  adult  males  and  females  aged  21  to  45  years.  This  multi-centre  study  is conducted in 4 centres in Hong Kong and Singapore. Subjects  were  randomized  1:1  to  receive  2  intramuscular  injections  of  the  whole  virion,  Vero  cellderived  influenza  vaccine  containing  either  3.75 μ g  or  7.5 μ g  H5N1  haemagglutinin  (HA)  antigen, strain A/Indonesia/05/2005, in a non-adjuvanted formulation on Day 0 and Day 21. · Part A was concluded 21(± 2) days after the second vaccination (Day 42 visit). These data are provided in the response document at day 121. · All subjects will be monitored until Day 180 (±14 days) after the first vaccination. After the last subject  has  completed  the  Day  180  visit,  a  final  clinical  study  report  including  all  safety  and immunogenicity data collected will be written. The primary endpoints for evaluation were: Medicinal product no longer authorised

- Number  of  subjects with antibody response to the vaccine strain (A/Indonesia/05/2005) associated  with  protection  21  days  after  the  second  vaccination  defined  as  titer  measured  by Microneutralisation (MN) test ≥ 1:20

Further  immunogenicity  endpoints  included  the  analysis  of  seroconversion,  GM  fold  increase  and GMT by MN assay and the evaluation by SRH assay.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Antibody  response  was  analyzed  for  all  subjects  vaccinated  with  data  available  after  the  first  and second vaccinations (ITT dataset). MN and SRH analyses were performed on 107 subjects for the first vaccination  (55  vaccinated  with  the  3.75 μ g  dose,  52  vaccinated  with  the  7.5 μ g  dose),  and  104 subjects after the second vaccination (52 vaccinated with the 3.75 μ g dose, 52 vaccinated with the 7.5 μ g dose).

## Antibody response against the homologous strain A/Indonesia:

The neutralising antibody responses following the 2 doses against the homologous strain A/Indonesia are summarised in Table 23.

Seroprotection rates (SRH area &gt;=25 mm 2 ) 21 days after 1 st /2 nd vaccination Seroconversion rates 21 days after the 1 st and 2 nd vaccination as compared to baseline Geometric Mean fold Increase measured 21 days after 1 st /2 nd vaccination as compared to baseline In summary, the results of study 810701 indicate again that no true dose-response relation exists. The responsiveness of  a  lower  dose  of  3.75µg  HA  strain  A/Indonesia  is  similar  to  a  dose  of  7.5µg  HA strain  A/Indonesia.  Moreover  the  SPRs,  SCRs  and  GMI  determined  by  MN  and  SRH  assay  are consistent with the results of main study 810601. However, it should be noted that subjects enrolled in study 810701 had no baseline neutralising antibody titres and only 1 subject was positive as measured by SRH assay. Cross-reactivity against A/Vietnam determined by MN The rate of subjects with reciprocal MN  titer ≥ 20 against a heterologous clade 1 strain (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) 21 days after the first and second vaccination is given in Table 25.

· Adverse events Special queried systemic and local adverse events were monitored by diary cards for 7 days after each vaccination. All adverse events were recorded for 21 days following each dose and for the time period 42 -180 days after first vaccination. For study 810601 all adverse events were reported for the time period 42 days after first vaccination for both age groups. Long-term 6-months follow-up data were provided during the procedure. Therefore the total number exposed is considered to be sufficient for a core  dossier  application  as  adverse  reactions  or  events  at  a  frequency  of  approximately  1%  are detectable. Study 810501 A total of 275 subjects received the first vaccination (on Day 0) and 257 subjects received the second vaccination (on Day 21) with the whole virion, Vero cell-derived influenza vaccine containing 3.75 μ g, 7.5 μ g, 15 μ g or 30 μ g H5N1 HA antigen/dose in an adjuvanted formulation with aluminium hydroxide, or 7.5 μ g or 15 μ g H5N1 HA antigen/dose in a non-adjuvanted formulation. The occurrence of fever with onset within 7 days after the 1 st and 2 nd vaccination is provided in Table 26 and Table 27.

Swelling Induration Redness Injection Site Pain Ecchymosis Fatigue Headache Sweating Muscle pain Joint pain Fever with onset later than Day 7 after vac. The analysis  of  the  primary  and  secondary  safety  endpoints  did  not  show  any  dose  dependency  or adjuvant effect, however, with respect to local reactions, there was a trend towards better tolerability in the absence of adjuvant. In the study group receiving 7.5 μ g non-adjuvanted vaccine, the probability of occurrence of systemic reactions (including fever) was 24.4% and 14.3% after the first and second vaccinations, respectively. Fever was reported in this group in 0.0% of subjects after the first and in 4.8% after the second vaccination. No fever with onset later than Day 7 after vaccination was reported. Systemic reactions (excluding fever) were reported in 28.4% of subjects after the first and in 20.6% of subjects  after  the  second  vaccination.  The  severity  of  these  reactions  after  the  first  and  second vaccinations was mild in all but 4 (1.5%) and 1 (0.4%) subjects who reported moderate reactions after the  first  and  second  vaccinations,  respectively.  Malaise  occurred  in  9.5%  of  subjects  after  the  first vaccination  and  in  6.6%  of  subjects  after  the  second  vaccination.  The  majority  of  cases  were  mild (8.4% and 6.2% after the first and second vaccination, respectively), with very few moderate cases reported.  Shivering  was  reported  less  frequently:  in  4.3%  of  subjects  after  the  first  and  in  2.7%  of subjects  after  the  second  vaccination.  The  most  frequently  reported  queried  symptoms  of  systemic reactions were headache, fatigue, and muscle pain. Medicinal product no longer authorised

All local reactions which occurred after the first and second vaccinations were mild in intensity and were  reported  in  22.5%  and  15.2%  of  subjects,  respectively.  Injection  site  pain  was  the  most frequently reported queried symptom of local reactions in all study groups. Among the other queried symptoms of local reactions (swelling, induration, erythema and ecchymosis) none occurred in more than a total of 4 subjects (0.0% to 4.4% of subjects per study group) after both the first and second vaccinations.  As  expected,  between  Day  42  and  180  (Part  B  of  the  study)  there  was  a  very  low probability of occurrence of related AEs. Only one subject reported non-serious systemic symptoms

(diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection 32 and 132 days after the second vaccination), which was judged as possibly related to study product.

## Study 810601

A total of 561 subjects (281 adults and 280 elderly) received the first vaccination and 539 subjects (269 adults and 270 elderly) received the second vaccination 21 days later with the inactivated whole virion, Vero cell-derived vaccine containing 7.5 μ g H5N1 HA antigen, strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004.

The probability of occurrence of malaise after the first vaccination was 6.4% in both age strata; after the second vaccination , 3.7% in adults, and 4.1% in elderly subjects. Malaise after the first vaccination in adults was reported mostly as mild (5.3%), 2 were moderate (0.7%), and 1 (0.4%) severe. The rates of malaise by severity were generally similar in elderly subjects (5.7% mild and 0.7% moderate), and none severe. After the second vaccination, mild or moderate malaise was reported in 6 (2.2%), and 4 adult  subjects  (1.5%),  respectively,  and  10  (3.7%)  and  1  elderly  subject  (0.4%),  respectively.  The probability  of  occurrence  of  shivering  after  the  first  vaccination  was  3.6%  in  adults  and  4.6%  in elderly; the rates were lower after the second vaccination: 1.1% and 1.9%, adult and elderly subjects, respectively. Reports of shivering were predominantly mild, with a few moderate cases reported, none were severe.

The probability  of  occurrence  of  systemic  reactions  (including  fever)  within  21  days  after  the  first vaccination was 22.8% in adults and 23.3% in elderly subjects. The majority of subjects reported no fever  within  7  days  after  the  first  and  second  vaccinations  in  both  age  strata.  After  the  first vaccination, the occurrence of fever was 2.2% in the group of adults, and 1.1% in the elderly. After the second vaccination,  the  occurrence  of  fever  within  7  days  after  vaccination  was  0.4%  and  0.7%  in adults and elderly. No fever case lasted more than 2 days. Of the few fever cases reported, most were mild. There was no severe fever in either age stratum after either vaccination. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Local reactions after the first vaccination occurred at a rate of 17.1% in adults aged 18-59 years, and 8.6% in subjects 60 years and older, and in 14.5% and 6.3% of subjects after the second vaccination, respectively. Most of the local reactions were mild after each vaccination (15.7% and 8.2% after the first, and 13.8% and 5.9% after the second vaccination, respectively).

The follow-up data to 6 months after the first vaccination for all subjects were available during the procedure. None of the 503 subjects experienced systemic reactions and new adverse reaction in the period between day 42 and day 180. All systemic symptoms or diagnosis of AEs reported between Day 42 and 180 were considered unrelated to vaccination.

•

Systemic  reactions  within  21  days  after  the  6-months  booster  dose  were  mostly  mild.  One  subject experienced  moderate  reactions  (chills,  nasopharyngitis,  arthralgia  and  headache)  in  the  group  of adults. There were no severe systemic reactions. Safety data following the 12 to 15 months booster vaccinations (Part C of study 810601) did not raise any additional concerns. · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events Study 810501 During the 42 day and 180 day follow-up of the study, no SAEs related to the vaccination, deaths or other significant AEs were reported. Study 810601 A  total  of  9  SAEs  were  reported  during  the  42  day  follow-up  of  the  study.  Eight  SAEs  were considered  unrelated  to  vaccination.  One  SAE  (malaria  tertiana  reactivation)  was  judged  related  to vaccination by the investigator. The subject has a history of malaria tertiana since August 2006 and experienced an episode of reactivation of malaria tertiana previously in November 2006. Within  21  days  after  the  6-month  booster  dose  three  subjects  reported  severe  AEs  (2  adults  and  1 elderly subject), who suffered from nasopharyngitis, uveitis and spinal stenosis. In  addition,  no  deaths,  no  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  associated  with  the  vaccines,  and  no unexpected AEs were noted following the 12 to 15 months booster vaccinations (Part C of the study). · Laboratory findings Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were tested in a subpopulation (N=51) in study 810601. There were no clinically significant increases in ALT. Slightly elevated ALT values were detected in 3 subjects. All elevated ALT values were assessed as not related to vaccination by an independent DMC and the responsible investigators. · Safety in special populations A  comparison  of  injection  site  reactions  between  the  two  age  strata  in  Study  810601  showed  that injection site pain was reported more often by the younger population than by the elderly. Joint pain and sweating was reported less often by the younger population than by the elderly.

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

810501 :  Two subjects stated adverse events experienced after the first vaccination as the reason for withdrawing  their  informed  consent.  These  AEs  were  non-serious  and  were  of  mild  or  moderate severity,  however,  they  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  the  vaccination  and included arthralgia, chills, eye discharge, fatigue, headache, hyperhidrosis, hypoesthesia, injection site

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

pain,  malaise,  myalgia,  generalized  pruritus  and  insomnia  for  one  subject  and  arthralgia,  myalgia, papular rash for another.

810601 :  One  subject  reported  an  AE  as  the  reason  for  withdrawal.  This  subject  experienced  severe malaise  and  mild  fatigue  3  days  after  the  first  vaccination  which  were  considered  to  be  probably related to vaccination and which lasted 7 days.

| Effects of vaccine on liver function                | Incidence followed for 6 months after the 2 vaccination.. • Investigation of ALT levels, as a marker of altered liver function, will be included in subgroups of Cohort 2 (immunocompromised patients) and Cohort 3 (chronically ill patients) of Study 810705 using mock-up H5N1 vaccine Further, in order to assess the risk of a potential negative effect of vaccination on liver functions in children, ALT investigation will also be included in a subset of the planned mock-up H5N1 vaccine paediatric Study 810706. • Observational cohort study (820901) will initially include patients at risk of influenza complication. Patients with a history of liver disease are included in the priority groups for vaccination and will be followed for safety after vaccination.

On 11 June 2009 the WHO declared Phase 6 of the influenza pandemic. Current estimates for the attack rate associated with the influenza A(H1N1)v virus over the first wave of  infection  vary  from  approximately  10-30  %  in  different  geographical  areas.  There  are  no established  criteria  for  classifying  pandemics  in  terms  of  severity.  The  perceived  severity  can  vary with geographical area, with sequential pandemic waves and in accordance with several other factors. Descriptions of severity based on factors such as rates of hospitalisation may be misleading due to different thresholds for this between countries and age groups.

The  development  of  Celvapan  was  based  on  the  guideline  on  dossier  structure  and  content  for pandemic  influenza  vaccine  marketing  authorisation  application  (CPMP/VEG/4717/03)  and  the guideline  on  submission  of  marketing  authorisation  applications  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccines through  the  centralised  procedure  (CPMP/VEG/4986/03).  The  core  dossier  procedure  allows  the insertion  of  the  pandemic  strain  A(H1N1)v  into  the  authorised  mock-up  vaccine  as  a  strain  change variation procedure.

This principle is based on the extrapolation of clinical safety and immunogenicity data obtained with the  mock-up  vaccine  (containing  H5N1  strains)  to  the  same  vaccine  construct  using  the  current influenza  A(H1N1)v  pandemic  strain.  It  is  expected  that  the  insertion  of  the  influenza  A(H1N1)v

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

strain  into  the  mock-up  vaccine  construct  would  result  in  a  vaccine  similarly  or  even  more immunogenic  than  the  H5N1  mock-up  version  and  with  a  similar  safety  profile  when  used  in  a comparable population.

The specific commitments that accompany the strain change include collection of data from ongoing and planned clinical studies,  which will provide safety and immunogenicity data.. These data will be submitted and reviewed on a rolling basis and updates to the Clinical Particulars in the SPC will be made as necessary.

Quality The  manufacture  of  the  A(H1N1)v  antigen  and  the  A(H1N1)v  formulated  vials  is  well  defined, controlled and is sufficiently validated. Adequate  in-process controls, release and shelf life specifications have been set in line with relevant requirements (e.g. Ph. Eur.). The same manufacturing strategy was employed for the A(H1N1) vaccine as previously established and approved for the Mockup  A(H5N1)  vaccine.  All  manufacturing  sites  are  in  compliance  with  current  GMP  requirements. Issues  pertaining  to  the  inactivation  process,  bacterial  contamination,  and  the  determination  of  the antigen content by SRD assay, which were initially raised as major concerns, have been addressed by the MAH. The MAH has committed to further address some minor outstanding issues as follow-up measure. Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology At  time  of  the  strain  variation  most  non-clinical  data  with  Celvapan  was  generated  with  vaccine constructs that included an influenza A (H5N1) strain. Two studies (challenge and immunogenicity) in mice with A(H1N1) vaccine have been assessed. Consistent  pharmacology  data  generated  with  (H5N1)  strains  has  been  generated  to  support  the potency of the vaccine, independent of the manufacturing scales and animal species tested, although a large  body of data are from mice. The pharmacological program was in line with the Guideline on 'core dossier approach to registration of pandemic influenza vaccines' (CPMP/VEG/4717/03). The non-clinical toxicological testing program comprised a literature-based risk assessment of Tween 80  (Polysorbate  80),  a  non-GLP  rabbit  pyrogenicity  study,  a  GLP  single-dose  toxicity  study  and  a GLP  pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  which  local  tolerance  assessment  was  included.  This program is considered to sufficiently meet the requirements of Regulatory Guideline on 'core dossier approach to registration of pandemic influenza vaccines' (CPMP/VEG/4717/03). Non-clinical safety data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, embryo-foetal and postnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period). The initial immunogenicity dose-finding study in mice with the A(H1N1) strain demonstrated that the vaccine adjuvanted or not with 0.3% aluminum hydroxide, was immunogenic in CD1 mice. A clear dose-dependent  antibody  response  was  demonstrated.  These  initial  data  presented  are  regarded  as preliminary. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In view of reproduction toxicity carried out with H5N1 antigen, based on the results of the studies with A/Indonesia/05/2005  and  the  A/Vietnam/1203/2004  candidate  vaccines,  it  can  be  concluded  that treatment of female CD rats with these Influenza vaccines on Days -42 and -14 before pairing and on Day 7 of gestation did not affect mating performance or fertility, embryo-fetal survival or growth or, pre- and post-natal survival and growth of the offspring or, adversely affect the pre- and post-natal development of the offspring up to 7 weeks of age.

The  serological  responses  to  the  vaccine  and  exposure  of  fetuses  to  specific  antibodies  were demonstrated.  According  to  the  data  presented,  no  vaccine-related  harmful  effects  were  seen  on mating performance or female fertility, embryo-foetal survival and pre- and post-natal development.

## Clinical

Most of the clinical data at time of the strain variation were generated with vaccine constructs that included an influenza A(H5N1) strain.

It is expected that the insertion of the influenza A(H1N1)v  strain into the mock-up vaccine construct does not have a substantial effect on immunogenicity and safety compared to the corresponding mockup vaccine when used in a comparable population.

Considerations for extrapolation of the clinical data include that the immunogenicity data available for the approved mock-up vaccines were generated using a strain to which the majority of subjects were immunologically naïve based on pre-vaccination testing for neutralising antibody and for antibody that inhibits haemagglutination. It is assumed that the safety of the H5N1 mock-up vaccine is predictive for the influenza A(H1N1)v strain  in  the  population  it  has  been  tested.  Preliminary  limited  safety  data  from  a  clinical  study investigating different H1N1 pandemic vaccine formulations in 387 healthy adult and elderly subjects were found to be acceptable. The safety profile is in general comparable with that observed for the H5N1  mock-up  vaccine.  However  rare  adverse  reactions  that  might  be  specific  to  the  influenza (H1N1)v strain can only be evaluated during very widespread usage. Currently there is no data with Celvapan in children, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients and other risk groups or specific populations available. Therefore in populations other than those in which it has been tested, data obtained with a mock-up vaccine  would  have  to  be  extrapolated  from  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  a  corresponding construct. Numerous safety, efficacy and effectiveness studies have been conducted with inactivated influenza vaccines since the 1960-ies in various age and risk categories, including children, the elderly, pregnant women and persons with underlying acute and chronic disease (Plotkin, Vaccines, Fourth Edition; 351 -  364).  In  particular,  early  studies  with  influenza  vaccines  were  performed  using  whole  virion preparations. Although clinical endpoints and outcomes were different in all these studies, immunogenicity was generally adequate and no specific safety signals were reported indicating that inactivated influenza vaccines based on whole virions do cause unacceptable adverse effects. In conclusion, decades of experience with various preparations of inactivated influenza virus antigens do not provide evidence that those vaccines are harmful for individual age and risk categories. These evidences can be extrapolated to Celvapan, in particular, since the antigen amount used (7.5 µg) in Celvapan is significantly lower compared to the antigen amount used in the clinical trials mentioned above (usually 45 µg). Direct and indirect evidence available for the time being suggest that Celvapan is safe and efficacious also in groups not having been clinically investigated. Data  from  ongoing  and  planned  clinical  trials  as  specified  in  the  agreed  pharmacovigilance/risk management  plan  using  the  Celvapan  vaccine  construct  with  the  current  pandemic  influenza A(H1N1)v  strain  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis.  These  studies  will  allow  to  obtain  safety, immunogenicity  and  efficacy  data  for  the  influenza  A(H1N1)v  vaccine.  The  SPC  will  be  updated accordingly as the CHMP considers necessary.

Clinical trials on protective efficacy for the mock-up vaccine were not possible as the strain causing the current pandemic as well as the subjects with a corresponding infection were not present at that time. Therefore a detailed characterisation of the immunological response has been performed.

Overall  approximately  850  subjects  (adults  and  elderly)  were  exposed  to  (H5N1)  strains  in  clinical studies.

In  the  dose-response  study  810501,  four  vaccine  formulations  adjuvanted  with  alum  (3.5µg,  7.5µg, 15µg and 30µg) and 2 non-adjuvanted vaccine formulations (7.5, and 15µg) were evaluated in healthy

adults of 18-45 years of age. Based on the MN and SRH assay using the homologous vaccine strain (A/Vietnam) the highest immune responses were achieved and all CHMP requirements were fulfilled following  the  first  and  second  immunisation  with  the  non-adjuvanted  7.5µg  vaccine  formulation. Moreover cross-neutralisation  experiments  indicate  a  high  responsiveness  for  the  original  prototype A/HongKong  strain  and  a  moderate  cross-neutralising  response  for  the  further  evolved  strain A/Indonesia. The neutralising antibody responses against all three virus strains persist over 6 months with low to moderate decline rates.

In the pivotal trial 810601 the immunogenicity of the 7.5µg vaccine was investigated in healthy adults of 18-59 years of age and elderly 60 years of age and older. Following two vaccinations and based on the  MN  assay  all  three  requirements  were  fulfilled  in  the  age  group  of  adults  and  2  out  of 3 requirements were met in the elderly. With regards to the group of adults a seroneutralisation rate of 72.5%, a seroconversion rate  of  60.8%  and  a  4.7  fold  GM  increase  was  achieved.  In  the  elderly  a seroneutralisation rate of 74.1%, a seroconversion rate of 26.7% and a 2.8 fold increase was obtained. The results of the MN assay were generally confirmed by the SRH assay. Following two vaccinations 2 out of 3 three CHMP requirements were fulfilled in adults and all three 3 requirements were met in the elderly. In the group of the adults a seroprotection rate of 63.3%, a seroconversion rate of 60.2% and  a  4.6  fold  GM  increase  was  achieved.  In  the  elderly  a  seroprotection  rate  of  67.7%,  a seroconversion rate of 62.4% and a 4.6 fold increase was obtained. Data on 6 months persistence of antibodies indicate a moderate decline in antibody responses. Similar results were obtained in study 810701, where adults between 21 and 45 years of age received 2 doses  of  3.75µg  HA  or  7.5µg  HA  of  strain  A/Indonesia/05/2005.  With  regard  to  the  MN  assay  all three  requirements  were  met  regardless  which  antigen  dose  were  administered.  Based  on  the  SRH assay  nearly  all  CHMP  criteria  were  fulfilled.  While  in  the  3.75µg  group  a  seroprotection  rate  of 71.2% was reached, it was slightly below the CHMP criterion for SPR in the 7.5µg group (69.2%). Based on the MN and SRH assay the immunogenicity results obtained with the non-adjuvanted 7.5µg vaccine formulation are consistent throughout the three clinical studies suggesting that the Vero cell derived, inactivated whole virion H5N1 vaccine is suitable immunogenic. Safety The safety data provided with the mock-up vaccine containing the (H5N1) strain does not raise any safety concerns as regards to frequency and nature of adverse events. The most commonly observed adverse reactions after administration of Celvapan were injection site pain, which was reported post dose 1 and 2. More rarely, local reactions such as injection site erythema and induration, as well as systemic reactions such as headache, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, chills, pharyngolaryngeal pain, pyrexia and arthralgia were reported after the first and second vaccination with the Vero cell-derived whole virion  H5N1  pandemic  vaccine.  Symptoms  normally  abated  without  treatment  after  a  few  days.  In general less systemic and local reactions were reported after the second vaccination compared to the first vaccination. The profile of adverse events after administration is not unusual and comparable to other licensed influenza vaccines.  Adverse reactions that might be specific to the influenza A(H1N1)v strain can only be evaluated during post-approval usage. Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management  plan,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  proposed  activities are adequate  and appropriate. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Preliminary analysis of safety data observed 21 days following the first vaccination of 387 adult and elderly subjects enrolled in a clinical trial investigating different H1N1 pandemic vaccine formulations was acceptable and the safety profile was found to be comparable with the safety profile reported for the H5N1 vaccine formulations. No safety issue was raised.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the SPC.

In  view  of  Risk  Management,  the  MAH  will  submit  on  a  monthly  basis  a  simplified  PSUR  on  all adverse  reactions  notified  by  patients  and  health  care  professionals.    The  Risk  Management  Plan

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

includes  additional  Pharmacovigilance  activities  to  address  important  potential  risks  and  important missing information. This includes the conduct of a study with at least 9,000 patients across different age  groups,  recruited  at  the  start  of  the  vaccination  campaign,  a  specific  monitoring  of  special populations such as pregnant women (through pregnancy registry in several EU countries), children and  immunocompromised  subjects,  and  the  monitoring  of  adverse  events  of  special  interest. Effectiveness studies developed and conducted in accordance with the standard protocols published by the ECDC will be performed.

· User consultation The MAH performed readability testing ('user consultation') and a satisfactory report has been provided with the initial MAA. Risk-benefit assessment Benefits The real benefits of Celvapan can only be assessed by its use during a pandemic. At present the benefit can only be evaluated based on detailed characterisation of immunological responses to vaccination with Celvapan containing the (H5N1) strains. Based on the MN and SRH assays the immunogenicity results obtained with the non-adjuvanted 7.5µg vaccine  formulation  containing  a  H5N1  strain  are  consistent  throughout  the  three  clinical  studies suggesting that the vaccine is suitably immunogenic. Extrapolation of data collected with (H5N1) strains to the influenza A(H1N1)v strain is considered adequate. Therefore  the  expected  benefit  of  Celvapan  is  to  provide  protection  against  clinically-apparent infection  and/or  possibly  against  development  of  severe  disease  in  case  of  an  influenza  A(H1N1)v 2009 infection. Risks Celvapan containing a H5N1 strain is commonly or very commonly associated with a range of local and systemic adverse reactions but these are not often of severe intensity and the safety profile would not preclude the use of the vaccine as described in the SPC. The  current  safety  database  is  considered  to  be  sufficient  to  describe  adverse  reactions  that  occur commonly in the population in the clinical trials. However, there are some adverse reactions known to be uncommonly and rarely associated with influenza vaccines and it is currently not possible to predict if  higher  rates  might  be  observed  with  Celvapan  (H1N1)v  compared  with,  for  example,  seasonal influenza vaccines. The specific commitments that accompany the strain change variations, including collection of data from the ongoing and planned clinical studies and as specified in the Risk Management Plans, will provide safety and immunogenicity data on a rolling basis Balance Medicinal product no longer authorised

Based on all  the  data  that  supported  approval  of  the  corresponding  mock-up  vaccine  together  with quality  data  specific  to  the  pandemic  influenza  A(H1N1)v  strain it  is  considered  that  in  the  current pandemic situation the benefits outweigh the risks that may be associated with the use of the vaccine in accordance with the SPC.

## Recommendation

On the basis of the available data for Celvapan A(H1N1)v which is limited primarily to quality data and the data of the initially authorised medicinal product Celvapan H5N1, the CHMP considered by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Celvapan for the prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation, in accordance with official guidance, was favourable. Therefore CHMP recommended  the  variation  to  the  marketing  authorisation  under  exceptional  circumstances  in accordance  with  Article  8  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  1085/2003  to  the  terms  of  the Marketing  Authorisation  until  specific  conditions  as  defined  in  Annex  II.C  (points  1  and  2)  are fulfilled.
