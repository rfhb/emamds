Appropriate medical resources for the treatment of severe infusion reactions should be available during necitumumab infusions. Availability of resuscitation equipment must be ensured.

## Posology

Portrazza is administered in addition to gemcitabine and cisplatin-based chemotherapy for up to 6 cycles of treatment followed by Portrazza as a single agent in patients whose disease has not progressed, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The recommended dose of Portrazza is 800 mg (flat dose) administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 3-week cycle. If a decreased infusion rate is indicated, the infusion duration should not exceed 2 hours.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients should be monitored during infusion for signs of infusion-related reactions (see section 4.4).

## Premedication

In patients who have experienced a previous Grade 1-2 hypersensitivity or infusion-related reaction to Portrazza, premedication with a corticosteroid and an antipyretic in addition to an antihistamine is recommended.

Prior to each necitumumab infusion, premedication for possible skin reactions must be considered (see section 4.4).

a Grade per NCI-CTCAE, Version 3.0 Special populations Paediatric population There is no relevant use of necitumumab in the paediatric population in the non-small cell lung cancer indication. Elderly No dose reductions other than those recommended for all patients are necessary (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Renal impairment No dose adjustments are required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). There are no data regarding necitumumab administration in patients with severe renal impairment. No dose reductions are recommended. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hepatic impairment

There are no data regarding necitumumab administration in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). No dose reductions are recommended.

## Method of administration

Portrazza is for intravenous use only. It is administered as an intravenous infusion over approximately 60 minutes via an infusion pump. Portrazza must not be administered as an intravenous bolus or push. In case of previous hypersensitivity or infusion-related reaction, recommendations for management of hypersensitivity/infusion-related reactions should be followed, as for Table 1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Only sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection should be used as a diluent. Portrazza infusions should not be administered or mixed with glucose solutions.

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Patients with a history of severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (see section 4.4).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Thromboembolic events Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) and arterial thromboembolic events (ATE), including fatal cases, were observed with necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin (see also section 4.8). Administration of necitumumab should be carefully considered in those patients with a history of thromboembolic events (such as pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, stroke) or preexisting risk factors for thromboembolic events (such as advanced age, patients with prolonged periods of immobilisation, severely hypovolemic patients, patients with acquired or inherited thrombophilic disorders). The relative risk of VTE or ATE was approximately three-fold higher in patients with a reported history of VTE or ATE. Necitumumab should not be administered to patients with multiple risk factors for thromboembolic events unless the benefits outweigh the risks to the patient. Thromboprophylaxis should be considered after careful assessment of a patient's risk factors (including the increased risk of serious bleeding in patients with tumour cavitation or tumour involvement of large central blood vessels). Patients and physicians should be aware of signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Patients should be instructed to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, arm or leg swelling. Discontinuation of necitumumab in patients who experience a VTE or ATE should be considered after a thorough benefit risk assessment for the individual patient. In a clinical trial in advanced non-squamous NSCLC, patients experienced an increased rate of serious thromboembolic events (including fatal events) in the necitumumab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin arm as compared to the pemetrexed and cisplatin arm (see also section 4.8). The addition of necitumumab did not improve the efficacy outcome over pemetrexed and cisplatin alone in advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Cardiorespiratory disorders Medicinal product no longer authorised

An increased frequency of cardiorespiratory arrest or sudden death was observed with necitumumab. Cardiorespiratory arrest or sudden death was reported in 2.8% (15/538) of patients treated with necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin compared to 0.6% (3/541) of patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Twelve of the fifteen patients died within 30 days of the last dose of necitumumab and had comorbid conditions including history of coronary artery disease (n=3), hypomagnesemia (n=4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=7), and hypertension (n=5). Eleven of the 12 patients had an unwitnessed death. Patients with significant coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction within 6 months, uncontrolled hypertension, and uncontrolled congestive heart failure were not enrolled in the pivotal study. The incremental risk of cardiopulmonary arrest or sudden death in patients with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias as compared to those without these comorbid conditions is not known.

## Hypersensitivity/infusion-related reactions

Hypersensitivity/infusion-related reactions (IRRs) were reported with necitumumab. The onset of events usually occurred after the first or second administration of necitumumab. Monitor patients during and following the infusion for signs of hypersensitivity and infusion-related reactions with

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

resuscitation equipment and appropriate medical resources readily available. In patients who have experienced a previous Grade 1 or 2 hypersensitivity or infusion related reaction to Portrazza, premedication with a corticosteroid and an antipyretic in addition to an antihistamine is recommended. For management and dose adjustments, see section 4.2.

## Skin reactions

Skin reactions were reported with necitumumab (see section 4.8). The onset of events occurred mainly during the first cycle of treatment. For management and dose adjustments, see section 4.2. Pre-emptive skin treatment including skin moisturiser, sun screen, topical steroid cream (1 % hydrocortisone) and an oral antibiotic (e.g. doxycycline) may be useful in the management of dermatologic reactions as clinically appropriate. Patients may be advised to apply moisturiser, sunscreen and topical steroid cream to face, hands, feet, neck, back and chest.

Electrolyte abnormalities Progressively decreasing serum magnesium levels occur frequently (81.3%) and may lead to severe Hypomagnesaemia (18.7%) (see also section 4.8). Hypomagnesaemia may reoccur at the same grade or worse after a dose delay. Patients should be carefully monitored for serum electrolytes, including serum magnesium, potassium, and calcium, prior to each necitumumab administration and after completion of necitumumab treatment, until within normal limits. Prompt electrolyte repletion is recommended, as appropriate. Infections In a phase 2 clinical trial investigating necitumumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin versus paclitaxel and carboplatin alone as the first-line therapy in patients with Stage IV metastatic squamous NSCLC, an increased rate of infections was observed early after start of treatment, which led to subsequent infectious complications such as pneumonia and/or sepsis.  A similar observation was made in a clinical trial investigating necitumumab in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin versus pemetrexed and cisplatin alone as the first-line therapy in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Special attention should be given to patients with clinical evidence of concomitant infectious conditions including early signs of active infections.  Treatment of any infection should be initiated according to local standards. Elderly No overall differences in efficacy between arms were observed in patients above 70 years of age. Cardiovascular comorbidities, performance status and the likely tolerability to chemotherapy with add-on necitumumab should therefore be thoroughly evaluated prior to the initiation of treatment in patients above 70 years of age. Women of childbearing potential/contraception in females Based on its mechanism of action and animal models where EGFR expression is disrupted, necitumumab may cause foetal harm or developmental anomalies. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on necitumumab. Effective contraception has to be used during necitumumab treatment and up to 3 months after last administration of necitumumab treatment. Contraceptive measures or abstinence are recommended (see section 4.6). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Sodium restricted diet

This medicinal product contains 76 mg sodium per dose. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

No drug-drug interactions were observed between Portrazza and gemcitabine/cisplatin. The pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine/cisplatin were not affected when co-administered with necitumumab

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and the pharmacokinetics of necitumumab were not affected when co-administered with gemcitabine/cisplatin.

No other formal interaction studies with necitumumab have been performed in humans.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Women of childbearing potential/contraception in females

Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on necitumumab and should be informed of the potential hazard to the pregnancy and foetus. Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during necitumumab treatment and up to 3 months after last administration of necitumumab treatment. Contraceptive measures or abstinence are recommended.

Pregnancy There are no data from the use of necitumumab in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with necitumumab. Based on animal models, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is involved in prenatal development and may be essential for normal organogenesis, proliferation, and differentiation in the developing embryo. Portrazza should not be used during pregnancy or in women not using effective contraception, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Breast-feeding It is unknown whether necitumumab is excreted in human milk. Excretion in milk and oral absorption is expected to be low. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Portrazza and for at least 4 months after the last dose. Fertility There are no data on the effect of necitumumab on human fertility. Animal studies to assess fertility directly have not been conducted (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Portrazza has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients experience treatment-related symptoms affecting their ability to concentrate and react, it is recommended that they do not drive or use machines until the effect subsides. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The most common serious adverse reactions (Grade ≥3) observed in necitumumab-treated patients are skin reactions (6.3 %) and venous thromboembolic events (4.3 %). The  most  common  adverse  reactions  were  skin  reactions,  venous  thromboembolic  events  and laboratory abnormalities (hypomagnesaemia and albumin-corrected hypocalcaemia).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) which were reported in patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer are listed below in MedDRA body system organ class, frequency and grade of severity. The following convention has been used for classification of frequency:

Very common ( ≥ 1/10) Common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10) Uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100) Rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000) Very rare ( &lt; 1/10,000)

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Within each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

The following table provides the frequency and severity of ADRs based on results from SQUIRE, a global, multicenter, two-arm, randomized Phase 3 study in adult patients with squamous NSCLC randomised to treatment with necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin or gemcitabine/cisplatin.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Skin reactions

Skin reactions were reported in approximately 78 % of patients and mainly presented as acneiform rash, dermatitis acneiform, dry skin, pruritus, skin fissures, paronychia and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome. Severe skin rections were reported in approximately 6 % of patients while 1.7 % of patients discontinued due to skin reactions. The majority of skin reactions developed during the first cycle of treatment and resolved within 17 weeks after onset  (see also section 4.4).

## Infusion-related reactions

Infusion-related reactions were reported in 1.5 % of patients and mainly present as chills, fever or dyspnoea. Severe infusion-related reactions were reported in 0.4 % of patients. The majority of infusion-related reactions developed after the first or second administration of necitumumab.

Toxicity in the elderly or in patients with ECOG PS 2 Clinically relevant toxicities with respect to the elderly and those patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score 2 (ECOG PS2) were similar to the overall population in patients receiving necitumumab plus chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine and cisplatin. Eyelash trichomegaly Isolated cases of Grade 1 trichomegaly have been reported in patients treated with necitumumab. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose There has been limited experience with necitumumab overdose in human clinical trials. The highest dose of necitumumab studied clinically in a human dose-escalation Phase 1 study is 1,000 mg once a week or once every other week. Adverse events observed included headache, vomiting and nausea and were consistent with the safety profile at the recommended dose. There is no known antidote for necitumumab overdose. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC22 Mechanism of action Medicinal product no longer authorised

Necitumumab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR) and blocks the ligand binding site, blocking activation by all known ligands and inhibiting relevant biological consequences in vitro . Activation of EGFR has been correlated with malignant progression, induction of angiogenesis and inhibition of apoptosis or cell death. In addition, necitumumab induces EGFR internalization and degradation in vitro . In vivo studies in cell line-derived xenograft models of human cancer, including non-small cell lung carcinoma, demonstrate that necitumumab has antitumor activity both in monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin.

## Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Overall, there was a low incidence of both treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralizing antibodies among necitumumab-treated patients, and no correlation with safety outcomes in these patients. There was no relationship between immunogenicity and IRRs or treatment emergent adverse events.

## Clinical efficacy

SQUIRE, a global, multicenter, two-arm, randomized study of Portrazza, was conducted in 1,093 patients with stage IV (American Joint Committee on Cancer Version 7) squamous NSCLC, including patients with ECOG PS2, who had received no prior anticancer  therapy for metastatic disease. Patients were randomised to receive first-line Portrazza at 800 mg plus chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine at 1,250 mg/m 2 and cisplatin at 75 mg/m 2 (Portrazza+GC Arm), or gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy alone (GC Arm). Portrazza and gemcitabine were administered on days 1 and 8 of each 3-week treatment cycle, and cisplatin was administered on day 1 of each 3-week treatment cycle. There was no premedication for Portrazza mandated by the study. Pre-emptive treatment for skin reaction was not permitted prior to the beginning of the second treatment cycle. Patients received a maximum of six cycles of chemotherapy in each arm; patients in the Portrazza+GC arm who had no progression continued to receive single-agent Portrazza until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) and the supportive efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS). Patients underwent radiographic assessment of disease status every six weeks, until radiographic documentation of progressive disease (PD). Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between arms. Median age was 62 (32-86), 83 % of patients were men; 83.5 % were Caucasian; and 91 % were smokers. The ECOG PS was 0 for 31.5 %, 1 for 59.7 %, and 2 for 9 % of patients; over 50 % had metastatic disease at more than 2 sites. In the Portrazza+GC arm, 51 % of patients continued with single-agent Portrazza after completing chemotherapy. Use of post-study systemic therapy was similar in the 2 arms (47.3 % in the Portrazza+GC arm and 44.7 % in the GC arm). Efficacy results are shown in Table 4. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In patients with detectable EGFR protein expression (indicated patient population), overall survival was statistically significantly improved in the Portrazza+GC Arm as compared to the GC Arm with an estimated reduction in risk of death of  21% (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.79 [0.69, 0.92]; p = 0.002) and a median OS of 11.7 months in the Portrazza+GC Arm and 10.0 months in the GC Arm.

Abbreviations:  C = cisplatin; G = gemcitabine; ITT = intent-to-treat. A pre-planned exploratory analysis performed after the primary analysis, determined clinical efficacy outcome according to the level of tumour EGFR protein expression. Of the ITT population, 982 patients (89.8%) were evaluable for an EGFR protein expression analysis by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using Dako PharmDx Kit. A tumour was considered to be EGFRexpressing if at least one stained cell could be identified. The large majority of patients (95.2% of evaluable patients; n = 935) had tumor samples expressing EGFR protein; 4.8% (n = 47) were not detectable for EGFR protein expression. There were no relevant differences in the distribution of demographics, disease characteristics, or the use of post-study systemic therapy between the subset of patients with detectable EGFR protein expression and the ITT population. Medicinal product no longer authorised

A statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival was also observed (HR = 0.84 [0.72, 0.97]; p = 0.018), with a median PFS of 5.7 months in the Portrazza+GC Arm and 5.5 months in the GC Arm.

In patients with detectable EGFR protein expression, there was no trend observed for increased efficacy with increasing levels of EGFR expression.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In patients with no detectable EGFR protein expression, no improvement in overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.52 [0.74, 3.12]) or progression free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.33 [0.65, 2.70] was observed.

In a phase 2 clinical trial investigating necitumumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin versus paclitaxel and carboplatin alone (106 versus 55 patients, 2:1 randomisation) as the first-line therapy in patients with Stage IV metastatic squamous NSCLC, a higher rate of death, including death due to infection, was observed for the necitumumab plus paclitaxel/carboplatin arm during the first 4 months (see also section 4.4), with a later trend towards improved survival after 4 months.  The overall survival hazard ratio [HR] was 0.83 [0.55, 1.52].

Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Portrazza in all subsets of the paediatric population in non-small cell lung cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Following the dose regimen of 800 mg necitumumab on day 1 and day 8 of a 21 day schedule, the geometric mean of necitumumab Cmin was 98.5 μg/mL (Coefficient of Variation 80 %) in serum from patients with squamous NSCLC after five cycles of treatment in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. Absorption Portrazza is administered as an intravenous infusion. There have been no studies performed with other routes of administration. Distribution Distribution of Portrazza follow a biphasic decline. Based on population pharmacokinetic approach (PopPK), the mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) for necitumumab was 6.97 L (CV 31 %). Elimination Necitumumab exhibits concentration-dependent clearance. Mean total systemic clearance (CLtot) at steady state following 800 mg on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21-day cycle was 0.014 l/hr (CV 39 %). This corresponds to a half-life of approximately 14 days. The predicted time to reach steady state was approximately 70 days. Special populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggested age, gender, and race had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of necitumumab, while CL and volume of distribution had a less than proportional positive correlation with body weight. Although modeling results suggest that the disposition of necitumumab was statistically dependent on body weight, simulations indicated that weight-based dosing would not significantly decrease PK variability. No dose adjustment is necessary for these subpopulations. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Elderly

Based on the results of the population pharamacokinetic analysis, there was no impact of age on necitumumab exposure.

## Renal impairment

No formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the PK of necitumumab. Based on the results of the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there was no impact of renal function as assessed by creatinine clearance [CrCl] on the pharmacokinetics of necitumumab.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

No formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of necitumumab. Based on the results of the population pharmacokinetic analysis, hepatic status (as assessed by alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase and total bilirubin) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of necitumumab.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Dose dependent reversible skin toxicity was observed in the 26-week monkey study. The skin effects were consistent with the known class effects of EGFR inhibitors.

<!-- image -->

Specific animal studies to test necitumumab for carcinogenic potential or potential to impair fertility have not been performed. The risk of fertility impairment is unknown. However, no adverse effects on male or female reproductive organs were observed in monkeys treated for 26 weeks with necitumumab. Human IgG1 is known to cross the placenta; therefore, necitumumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. No animal studies have been specifically conducted to evaluate the effect of necitumumab on reproduction and foetal development; however, based on its mechanism of action and animal models where EGFR expression is disrupted, necitumumab may cause foetal harm or developmental anomalies. 6.

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important information for you.

What is in this leaflet 1. What Portrazza is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you are given Portrazza 3. How you are given Portrazza 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Portrazza 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Portrazza is and what it is used for Portrazza contains the active substance necitumumab, which belongs to a group of substances called monoclonal antibodies. Necitumumab recognises and binds specifically to a protein on the surface of some cancer cells. The protein is known as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Other body proteins (called growth factors) can attach to the EGFR and stimulate the cancer cell to grow and divide. Necitumumab hinders other proteins from binding  to the EGFR and thus prevents the cancer cell from growth and division. Portrazza is used in combination with other anti-cancer medicines for the treatment of adults with certain type of lung cancer at an advanced stage (squamous non-small cell lung cancer), whose cancer cells have the EGFR protein on their surface. The anti-cancer medicines it is combined with are gemcitabine and cisplatin. 2.
