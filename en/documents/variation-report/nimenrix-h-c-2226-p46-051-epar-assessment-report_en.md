## 1. Introduction

On 7 December 2017, the MAH submitted a paediatric clinical study report in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. MEN-ACWY-TT-106 was an open-label, multi-centre study  to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity,  reactogenicity  and  safety  of  a  single  dose  of  MenACWY-TT vaccine (Nimenrix) administered at 6 years after vaccination at ~12-18 month of age with either HibMenC-TT vaccine  ( Menitorix )  or Hiberix (PRP-T)  and Meningitec (MenC-CRM197).  The  study  included follow-up to evaluate antibody persistence at 2 years.

The MAH (now Pfizer Limited) has reviewed the immunogenicity and safety results from MEN-ACWYTT-106  and  has  concluded  that  the  data  do  not  change  the  benefit-risk  profile  of  Nimenrix.  The immunogenicity and safety outcomes are in line with the approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Nimenrix and therefore no updates to the SmPC are proposed.

A short critical expert overview has been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

This submission provides the final CSR for the study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies

Nimenrix was developed specifically for use in children and adults. The same formulation and dose is used across the full age range approved but the regimen (number of doses) differs by age (see SmPC).

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The study was conducted at 7-8 centres in Australia between 2013 and 2017.

## 2.3.2. Clinical studies

## MenACWY-TT-106

The primary objective of the study was:

To  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  of  MenACWY-TT  vaccine  at  one  month  post-dose  in  terms  of  the percentages with a vaccine response (see definition below) based on rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBAMenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres.

Secondary immunogenicity objectives were:

At one month post-dose:

To evaluate the immunogenicity of a dose of Nimenrix based on percentages with rSBA-MenA, rSBAMenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY antibody titres ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 and on the GMTs;

To evaluate the percentages with anti-TT concentrations ≥ 0.1 IU/mL and GMCs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## At 2 years post-dose:

To evaluate antibody persistence based on percentages with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 and on the GMTs.

Eligible  subjects  were  to  be  aged  84  to  95  months  at  Visit  1  (see  figure  below)  and  had  to  have completed initial vaccination in study HIB-MENC-TT-016 as per protocol. Excluded were subjects with any  history  of  meningococcal  disease  and  previous  administration  of  any  non-study  meningococcal vaccine. There were 320 and 108 subjects in the HibMenC and Hib+MenCC groups, respectively, in the primary study and this open-label study planned to enrol ~240 subjects who were to be derived in a 3:1 ratio from the two treatment groups in HIB-MENC-TT-016 as follows:

HibMenC  group:  subjects  vaccinated  with  Hib-MenC-TT  + Priorix in  study  HIB-MENC-TT-016  and MenACWY-TT in study MENACWY-TT-106;

Hib+MCC group: subjects vaccinated with Meningitec + Hiberix + Priorix in  study  Hib-MenC-TT-016 and MenACWY-TT in study MENACWY-TT-106.

The overall design is summarised in the figure.

Figure 1 Study design overview

All subjects received one dose of Nimenrix. Blood samples were taken before vaccination and at one and 24 months after vaccination. The intervals allowed between study visits at which vaccination and sampling were performed are shown below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Table 1 Intervals between study visits

| Interval                | Optimal length of interval 1   | Allowed interval2   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| Date of birth →→Visit 1 | 7 years                        | 84-95 months        |
| Visit 1 →Visit 2        | 30 days                        | 21-48 days3         |
| Visit 1 →Visit 3        | 2 years                        | 2 years ± 9 weeks   |

2 Subjects were not eligible for inclusion in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity if they made the study visit outside this interval.

1 Whenever possible the investigator was to arrange study visits within this interval.

3For the safety evaluation an interval of 30 days was needed. If the subject had returned for Visit 2 prior to Day 30, their parents/LAR(s) had to take home the diary card, continue to record unsolicited safety information until Day 30 and then provide the card to the study site

A summary of the laboratory assays performed to assess the humoral immune response is provided below. For meningococcal responses rSBA titres were measured at the UK PHE laboratory.

There were 139 included in ATP cohort for immunogenicity at Month 73 and 133 were included in the ATP cohort for persistence at Year 2. The mean age at the time of vaccination (month 73) was 7 years with 44.6% female and 55.4% male subjects.

Vaccine responses exceeded 97% for all meningococcal serogroups at one month after Nimenrix. In each  case,  response  rates  were  lower  for  the  small  sub-groups  who  were  seropositive  at  prevaccination.

At one month after Nimenrix, at least 97.1% of subjects had rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 for each serogroup. In each sub-group defined by prior vaccination history the highest rSBA GMTs were observed for MenW and the lowest for MenA. The comparisons between the sub-groups suggested slightly lower responses at one month and/or at 2 years in the Hib+MCC group but the 95% CI overlapped. At 2 years postdose the lowest percentages with ≥1:8 or ≥1:128 occurred for rSBA-MenA.

All subjects had anti-T antibody concentration ≥ 0.1 IU/mL at one month post-dose in both sub-groups defined by prior vaccination.

During  the  4-day  (Days  0-3)  post-dose  follow-up  period  for  solicited  local  symptoms,  pain  was reported  slightly  less  often  in  the  Hib+MCC  sub-group  but  rates  for  redness  and  swelling  were comparable. Grade 3 pain was reported by one subject (0.8%) in the HibMenC sub-group and Grade 3 redness and swelling were reported by no more than 5.4% of subjects in the two sub-groups.

During  the  31-day  post-vaccination  period  at  least  one  unsolicited  AE  was  reported  by  30.3%  and 18.9% in  the  HibMenC  and  Hib+MCC  sub-groups,  respectively,  while  Grade  3  unsolicited  AEs  were reported by 6.7% and 5.4% (see table below). Unsolicited AEs assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination were reported by 6.7% of subjects in the HibMenC sub-group, one of which was Grade 3.

No SAEs or AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study vaccine  and/or study were reported. Also, there were no NOCIs or pIMDs reported.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Children  enrolled  into  MEN-ACWY-TT-106  had  received  either  Menitorix  (MenC-T  and  PRP-T)  or Meningitec  (MenC-CRM197)  plus  Hiberix  (PRP-T)  at  about  one  year  of  age.  At  7  years  of  age,  the proportions still seropositive for MenC were 19/104 (18%) in the Menitorix group and 5/34 (15%) in the Meningitec group. Some of these Australian children had naturally acquired antibody to MenA, W or Y but pre-vaccination seropositive rates were mostly &lt;20%.

For each meningococcal serotype, all children who were seronegative at 7 years of age had a vaccine response (as defined in the protocol) after a single dose of Nimenrix compared to about 80% for the smaller subsets of children who were seropositive at pre-vaccination.

For  MenC,  102/104  primed  with  Menitorix  and  34/35  primed  with  Meningitec  had  rSBA-MenC  titres ≥1:128 at one month after a dose of Nimenrix, with GMTs of 11,819 and 7420, respectively. The 95% CI around these GMTs overlapped and the imbalance in denominators should be noted. This difference in  rSBA-MenC titres persisted at  2  years  post-dose,  when  the  percentages  with  titres  ≥1:128  were 90% vs. 78.8% and the GMTs were 333 and 175 in respective priming groups. Whilst the differences between groups may not be clinically important (with 100% and 94% having titres at least 1:8 at 96 months), the findings would be in keeping with observations made in several previous studies in which the  same  or  different  conjugates  were  used  for  priming  and  boosting.  It  should  be  noted  that  the MAH's claim that Nimenrix 'boosted' the rSBA-MenC titres cannot be verified based solely on the data presented. However, several previous studies have conclusively demonstrated the ability of Nimenrix to boost rSBA-MenC titres regardless of the type of conjugate used for priming.

For MenA, W and Y the percentages with rSBA titres at the 1:8 and 1:128 cut-offs and the GMTs at one month and at 2 years post-dose were numerically higher in the group primed with Menitorix but all 95%  CI  overlapped.  It  is  difficult  to  comment  further  due  to  the  imbalance  in  numbers  and  the possibility that the results reflect just a few subjects with unusually low responses.

Between one month and 2 years post-dose, the largest drops in percentages with rSBA titres at least 1:8 or 1:128 were observed for MenA. This finding is in keeping with previous studies in which  SBA titres have declined more notably for MenA compared to the other serogroups. The hSBA titres were not estimated in this study. If they had been it would be expected that they would show even larger drops in titres vs. MenA compared to the rSBA data.

The safety profile of a single dose of Nimenrix at age 7 years was as expected. Although slightly higher total rates of solicited symptoms were reported in the sub-group primed with Menitorix, there was no excess of Grade 3 or related AEs in this sub-group.

## In conclusion

There results reported at up to 2 years after a dose of Nimenrix administered to 7-year-old children who  had  been  primed  with  a  meningococcal  serogroup  C  conjugate  vaccine  were  very  much  as expected. There were no issues raised by the safety data. There is no need to make any changes to the SmPC based on these results.
