Each single-use pre-filled pen contains 30 mg of nemolizumab per 0.49 ml dose following reconstitution.

Nemolizumab, a humanised monoclonal modified immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Powder and solvent for solution for injection

Powder for solution for injection: lyophilised white powder.

Solvent for solution for injection: A clear, colourless solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## Atopic dermatitis (AD)

Nemluvio is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in patients aged 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.

## Prurigo nodularis (PN)

Nemluvio is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with nemolizumab should be initiated and supervised by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of conditions for which nemolizumab is indicated.

## Posology

Atopic dermatitis (AD)

The recommended dose is:

- -An initial dose of 60 mg (two 30 mg injections), followed by 30 mg given every 4 weeks (Q4W)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -After 16 weeks of treatment, for patients who achieve clinical response, the recommended maintenance dose is 30 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W)

Nemolizumab can be used with or without topical corticosteroids (TCS). Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) may be used, but should be reserved for problem areas only, such as the face, neck, intertriginous and genital areas. Any use of topical therapies should be tapered and subsequently discontinued when the disease has sufficiently improved.

Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after 16 weeks of treatment for atopic dermatitis. Some patients with initial partial response may further improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks.

Once clinical response is achieved, the recommended maintenance dose of nemolizumab is 30 mg every 8 weeks.

## Prurigo nodularis (PN)

The recommended dose for patients weighing &lt; 90 kg is an initial dose of 60 mg (two 30 mg injections), followed by 30 mg given every 4 weeks (Q4W).

The recommended dose for patients weighing ≥ 90 kg is an initial dose of 60 mg dose (two 30 mg injections), followed by 60 mg given every 4 weeks (Q4W).

Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response on pruritus after 16 weeks of treatment for prurigo nodularis.

## Missed dose

If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, dosing should be resumed at the regular scheduled time.

## Special populations

## Elderly (≥ 65 years)

No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic and renal impairment

No dose adjustment is needed in patients with hepatic or renal impairment (see section 5.2).

## Paediatric population

## Atopic dermatitis

The safety and efficacy of nemolizumab in children less than 12 years of age and body weight &lt; 30 kg have not yet been established. No data are available.

## Prurigo nodularis

The safety and efficacy of nemolizumab in children less than 18 years of age have not been established. No data are available.

## Method of administration

## Subcutaneous use.

The subcutaneous injection should be administered into the front upper thighs or abdomen avoiding the 5 cm area around the navel. Injection into the upper arm should only be performed by a caregiver or healthcare professional.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For subsequent doses, it is recommended to rotate the injection site with each dose. Nemolizumab should not be injected into skin that is tender, inflamed, swollen, damaged or has bruises, scars or open wounds.

Nemolizumab is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional. A patient may selfinject nemolizumab or the patient's caregiver may administer nemolizumab if their healthcare professional determines that this is appropriate. Prior to first injection, patients and/or caregivers should be given proper training on the preparation and administration of nemolizumab according to the instructions for use at the end of the package leaflet.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## Hypersensitivity

Cases of type 1 hypersensitivity, including angioedema, have been reported. If a systemic hypersensitivity reaction (immediate or delayed) occurs, administration of nemolizumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated (see section 4.8).

## Worsening of asthma (including PEF decrease)

In the population of PN subjects with pre-existing asthma, a mild to moderate worsening of asthma (WOA) has been reported after initiation of nemolizumab. This was observed more frequently in patients weighing &gt; 90 kg who received 60 mg nemolizumab every 4 weeks compared to patients weighing &lt; 90 kg who received 30 mg nemolizumab every 4 weeks (see section 4.8).

Patients with an exacerbation of asthma requiring hospitalization in the preceding 12 months, patients with uncontrolled asthma during the preceding 3 months and patients with a current medical history of COPD and/or chronic bronchitis were excluded from clinical studies. No information on the efficacy or safety of nemolizumab in those patients is available.

## Vaccinations

It is recommended that patients complete all age-appropriate vaccinations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating treatment. Concurrent use of live vaccines in patients treated with nemolizumab should be avoided. It is unknown if administration of live vaccines during treatment will impact the safety or efficacy of these vaccines. No data are available on the response to non-live vaccines.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Live vaccines

The safety and efficacy of concurrent use of nemolizumab with live attenuated vaccines has not been studied. Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with nemolizumab (see section 4.4).

## Non-live vaccines

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The safety and efficacy of concurrent use of nemolizumab with non-live vaccines has not been studied (see section 4.4)

## Interactions with cytochrome P450

The effects of nemolizumab on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (CYP3A4/5 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), metoprolol (CYP2D6 substrate), and caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) were evaluated in a study in subjects with moderate to severe AD. No clinically significant changes in the exposure of CYP450 substrates were observed compared to prior to nemolizumab treatment. No dose adjustment is necessary.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There is a limited amount of data on the use of nemolizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of nemolizumab during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

No data are present on the excretion of nemolizumab in human milk. In humans, excretion of IgG antibodies in milk occurs during the first few days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon afterwards. Consequently, transfer of IgG antibodies to the newborns through milk, may happen during the first few days.  In this short period, a risk to the breastfed child cannot be excluded. Afterwards, nemolizumab could be used during breast-feeding if clinically needed.

## Fertility

Animal studies showed no impairment of fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Nemluvio has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions in atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis are type I hypersensitivity (1.1%; includes urticaria 1.0% and angioedema 0.1%) and injection site reactions (1.2%) (see section 4.4). Additional adverse reactions such as headache (7.0%), atopic dermatitis (4.6%), eczema (3.8%), eczema nummular (3.5%), superficial fungal infections (3.0%) and worsening of asthma (2.2%) were reported in prurigo nodularis.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Hypersensitivity

Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions (Ig-E mediated reactions), including mild urticaria and mild facial (peri-ocular) angioedema, were commonly observed in subjects treated with nemolizumab during the clinical studies. These reactions did not lead to treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4 ) .

## Headache

In patients with prurigo nodularis, headache was more frequently reported in patients treated with nemolizumab (7.0%) compared to patients treated with placebo. Headache was more frequently observed in female patients in both groups. In the nemolizumab group, headache was mostly mild or moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of treatment.

## Worsening of asthma

In the PN patients with pre-existing asthma (n=51), 8 (15.7%) patients experienced a worsening of asthma (WOA) after initiation of nemolizumab, 5 of whom had a body weight &gt; 90 kg and received 60 mg nemolizumab every 4 weeks. In the population of PN patients with pre-existing asthma, WOA was 3 times more frequent in patients with a body weight &gt; 90 kg who received 60 mg nemolizumab every 4 weeks than in patients with a body weight &lt; 90 kg who received 30 mg nemolizumab every 4 weeks.

The majority of WOA events occurred within the first two months of treatment initiation and all were reported as mild or moderate in severity. Most patients experienced a single event of WOA during treatment and the event resolved with standard of care asthma medications (inhalers) without the use of systemic steroids. None led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. The incidence of WOA did not increase with longer term exposure to nemolizumab (up to Week 52) in the PN open-label longterm extension study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Eczematous reactions

In patients with prurigo nodularis, eczematous reactions such as atopic dermatitis, eczema nummular or eczema were more frequently reported in nemolizumab-treated patients compared to patients treated with placebo: Atopic dermatitis (4.6%), eczema (3.8%) and eczema nummular (3.5%). These eczematous reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Atopic dermatitis led to nemolizumab discontinuation in 2 (0.5%) patients. Patients &gt; 65 years of age had a higher rate of eczematous reactions.

## Eosinophilia

Proportion of patients with clinically significant elevated eosinophils (&gt; 700 cells/mcL) was 10,2% in the AD population (in the initial period) and 5,5% in the PN population. Severe eosinophilia (&gt; 5000 cells/mcL) was not observed in AD nemolizumab-treated patients in the initial treatment period. Adverse reactions of eosinophilia were reported in 0.2% of AD patients treated with nemolizumab during the initial treatment period up to Week 16. All events in AD subjects were mild in intensity and not associated with clinical symptoms. No TEAE of eosinophilia led to discontinuation of treatment. Apart from one case of eosinophilic colitis in an AD subject with other atopic comorbidities, there were no other reports of eosinophilic disorders.

## Paediatric population

## Atopic dermatitis

## Adolescents (12 to 17 years of age)

The safety of nemolizumab was assessed in 176 paediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with moderateto-severe atopic dermatitis enrolled in the ARCADIA 1 and ARCADIA 2 studies. The safety profile of nemolizumab in these subjects through Week 16 was similar to the safety profile seen in adults with atopic dermatitis.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

There is no specific treatment for nemolizumab overdose. In the event of overdose, the patient should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment should be instituted immediately.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other dermatological preparations, agents for dermatitis, excluding corticosteroids, ATC code: D11AH12

## Mechanism of action

Nemolizumab is a humanised IgG2 monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-31 (IL-31) signalling by binding selectively to interleukin-31 receptor alpha (IL-31 RA). IL-31 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in pruritus, inflammation, epidermal dysregulation, and fibrosis. Nemolizumab inhibited IL-31-induced responses including the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In atopic dermatitis clinical studies, nemolizumab was found to modulate gene expression related to the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis, with a primary impact on immune system processes, by decreasing the inflammatory and proliferative profile of specific immune cells (T-cells and monocytes/macrophages) without leading to immunosuppression.

In prurigo nodularis clinical studies, nemolizumab was found to modulate molecular processes related to the pathophysiology of prurigo nodularis, with impact on pruritus, inflammation, epidermal differentiation and fibrosis.

## Pharmacodynamic effect

## Immunogenicity

Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were very commonly detected. No evidence of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was observed.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in atopic dermatitis

## Adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis

The efficacy and safety of nemolizumab with concomitant topical background therapy was evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal studies (ARCADIA 1 and ARCADIA 2) that enrolled a total of 1728 subjects 12 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis not adequately controlled by topical treatments. Disease severity was defined by an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 3 (moderate) and 4 (severe) in the overall assessment of atopic dermatitis, an Ecz ema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score of ≥ 16, a minimum body surface area (BSA) involvement of ≥ 10%, and a Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (PP NRS) score of ≥ 4.

Subjects in the studies received initial subcutaneous injections of either nemolizumab 60 mg, followed by 30 mg injections every 4 weeks (Q4W), or matching placebo. Concomitant low and/ or medium potency TCS and/or TCI were administered both in nemolizumab and placebo groups for at least 14 days prior to baseline and continued during the study. Based on disease activity, these concomitant therapies could be tapered and/or discontinued at investigator discretion.

After 16 weeks, subjects achieving either EASI-75 or IGA success continued into the study maintenance period for another 32 weeks to evaluate the maintenance of response achieved at Week 16. Nemolizumab responders were re-randomised to either nemolizumab 30 mg every 4 weeks, nemolizumab 30 mg every 8 weeks or placebo every 4 weeks (all groups continued background TCS/TCI). Subjects randomised to placebo in the initial treatment period who achieved the same clinical response at Week 16 continued to receive placebo every 4 weeks. Non-responders at Week 16, subjects who lost clinical response during the maintenance period and subjects who completed maintenance period had the opportunity to enrol into the open-label study (ARCADIA LTE) and receive treatment with nemolizumab 30 mg every 4 weeks up to 200 weeks.

## Endpoints

Both ARCADIA 1 and ARCADIA 2 assessed the primary endpoints of:

- Proportion of subjects with an IGA success (defined as an IGA of 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear] and a ≥ 2 -point reduction from baseline) at Week 16
- Proportion of subjects with EASI75 (≥ 75% improvement in EASI from baseline) at Week 16

Key secondary endpoints included PP NRS improvement ≥4 from baseline at Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 16, PP NRS &lt; 2 at Week 4 and Week 16, Sleep Disturbance Numeric Rating Scale (SD NRS) improvement ≥ 4 from baseline at Week 16, subjects with both EASI-75 and PP NRS improvement ≥ 4 from baseline at Week 16, and subjects with both IGA success and PP NRS improvement ≥ 4 from baseline at Week 16.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Baseline characteristics

In these studies, at baseline, 51.0% of subjects were male, 79.9% were White, and the mean weight was 75.0 kg. The mean age was 34.1 years, 15.4% of subjects were adolescents (12-17 years) and 5.3% were 65 years of age or older. 70% of subjects had a baseline IGA score of 3 (moderate AD), and 30% of subjects had a baseline IGA score of 4 (severe AD). The mean (SD) baseline EASI score was 27.5 (10.5), the baseline weekly average (SD) PP NRS was 7.1 (1.5) (severe itch) and baseline weekly average (SD) SD NRS was 5.8 (2.2). Overall, 63.3% of subjects received other previous systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis.

## Clinical response

## ARCADIA 1 and ARCADIA 2 - Adults and Adolescents - induction period, Week 0 to Week 16

Nemolizumab was statistically significantly superior to placebo with respect to skin-related coprimary endpoints IGA success and EASI-75 over 16 weeks (Table 2). Results for both co-primary endpoints were consistent in the severe pruritus population (baseline PP NRS ≥ 7).

In patients with a body weight ≥ 90kg, in a post-hoc analysis in each of the pivotal studies there was no difference in anti-inflammatory response (IGA 0 or 1 and EASI 75) at Week 16 between nemolizumab and placebo arms, though the effect was observed in reducing pruritus (PP NRS).

The Sleep Disturbance Numeric Rating Scale (SD NRS) is a daily scale used by the subjects to report the degree of their sleep loss related to atopic dermatitis. A significant improvement in sleep disturbance was observed at Week 16 when compared to placebo (Table 4). Results were consistent in the severe pruritus population (baseline PP NRS ≥ 7).

## Clinical efficacy and safety in adults with prurigo nodularis

The efficacy and safety of nemolizumab as monotherapy was evaluated in two randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled pivotal studies (OLYMPIA 1 and OLYMPIA 2) that enrolled a total of 560 subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis.  Disease severity was defined using an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) in the overall assessment of prurigo nodularis nodules on a severity scale of 0 to 4. Subjects enrolled in these two studies had an IGA score ≥ 3, severe pruritus as defined by a weekly average of the pe ak pruritus numeric rating scale (PPNRS) score of ≥ 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, and greater than or equal to 20 nodular lesions. OLYMPIA 1 and OLYMPIA 2 assessed the effect of nemolizumab monotherapy on the signs and symptoms of prurigo nodularis, targeting improvement in skin lesions and pruritus over 16 weeks. OLYMPIA 1 had a 24-week treatment period and OLYMPIA 2 a 16-week treatment period.

In the nemolizumab treatment group, subjects weighing less than 90 kg received subcutaneous injections of nemolizumab 60 mg (2 injections of 30 mg) at Week 0, followed by 30 mg injections every 4 weeks, and subjects weighing 90 kg or more received subcutaneous injections of nemolizumab 60 mg (2 injections of 30 mg) at Week 0 and every 4 weeks.

## Endpoints

Both OLYMPIA 1 and OLYMPIA 2 assessed the same two primary endpoints:

- Proportion of subjects with an improvement of ≥ 4 from baseline in Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (PP NRS) at Week 16
- Proportion of subjects with an IGA success (defined as an IGA of 0 [Clear] or 1 [Almost Clear], and a ≥ 2 -point improvement from baseline) at Week 16

Key secondary endpoints included PP NRS improvement ≥ 4 from baseline at Week 4, PP NRS &lt; 2 at Week 4 and Week 16, Sleep Disturbance Numeric Rating Scale (SD NRS) improvement ≥ 4 from baseline at Week 4 and 16.

## Baseline characteristics

In these studies, at baseline, 59.6% of subjects were female, 81.4% were white, the mean weight was 82.6 kg, the mean age was 55.2 years and 25.4% of subjects were older than 65 years of age. The baseline weekly average PP NRS score was a mean (SD) of 8.4 (0.9). Fifty-eight (58) % of subjects had a baseline IGA score of 3 (moderate PN) and 42% of subjects had a baseline IGA of 4 (severe PN).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

## Absorption

Following an initial subcutaneous dose of 60 mg in patients with AD or PN, the population PK estimated mean (SD) peak concentration (Cmax) was 6.7 (2.20) µg/mL by approximately 6 days post dose.

Following multiple doses in subjects with atopic dermatitis, the population PK estimated mean (SD) steady-state trough concentrations of nemolizumab were 2.63 (1.27) µg/mL for 30 mg administered Q4W and 0.74 (0.44) µg/mL for 30 mg administered Q8W.

Following multiple doses in subjects with prurigo nodularis, the population PK estimated mean (SD) steady-state trough concentrations of nemolizumab 3.04 (1.23) µg/mL in patients with body weight &lt; 90 kg for 30 mg administered Q4W; and 3.66 (1.63) µg/mL in patients with body weight ≥ 90 kg for 60 mg administered Q4W.

In both atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis population, steady state concentrations of nemolizumab were achieved by week 4 after a 60 mg loading dose and by week 12 without a loading dose.

A loading dose is proposed for subjects with PN with body weight &lt; 90 kg. However, for subjects with body weight ≥ 90 kg no loading dose is proposed because the 60 mg dose was sufficient to achieve similar steady-state concentrations of nemolizumab as the 30 mg dose (with 60 mg loading dose) after the second dose (at Week 8).

## Distribution

Based on a population PK analysis, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was 7.67 L.

## Biotransformation

Specific metabolism studies were not conducted because nemolizumab is a protein. Nemolizumab is expected to be metabolised into small peptides by catabolic pathways.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elimination

Nemolizumab is expected to be degraded in the same manner as endogenous IgG. In the population PK analysis, the terminal elimination half-life (SD) of nemolizumab was estimated to be 18.9 (4.96) days and apparent systemic clearance (Cl/F) was estimated to be 0.26 L/day.

## Linearity/non-linearity

After a single dose, nemolizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with exposures increasing in dose-proportional manner between 0.03 and 3 mg/kg.

After multiple doses, nemolizumab systemic exposure increased in an approximately doseproportional manner across the SC dose range up to 30 mg. There was a slight decrease in bioavailability by 9% with the 60 mg SC dose.

## Special populations

## Gender, age and ethnicity

Gender, age (range 12 to 85 years for AD, and 18 to 84 years for PN), and ethnicity did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of nemolizumab.

## Hepatic impairment

Nemolizumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant hepatic elimination. No clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of nemolizumab. Mild to moderate hepatic impairment was not found to affect the PK of nemolizumab determined by population PK analysis. No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

## Renal impairment

Nemolizumab, as a monoclonal antibody, is not expected to undergo significant renal elimination. No clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of nemolizumab. Population PK analysis did not identify mild or moderate renal impairment as having a clinically meaningful influence on the systemic exposure of nemolizumab. Very limited data are available in patients with severe renal impairment.

## Body weight

Nemolizumab exposure was lower in subjects with higher body weight.

## Atopic dermatitis

The difference in systemic exposure due to body weight had no clinically meaningful impact on efficacy. Dose adjustment based on body weight is not needed (see section 4.2).

## Prurigo nodularis

The variability in systemic exposure due to body weight had a clinically meaningful impact on skin lesion efficacy as assessed by IGA response but not on pruritus improvement and does require dose adjustment in subjects with PN (see section 4.2).

## Paediatric population

## Atopic dermatitis

In the population PK analysis, no clinically relevant difference in the pharmacokinetics of nemolizumab was estimated in paediatric subjects 12-17 years of age compared to adults. Dose adjustment in this population is not recommended.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology and repeated dose toxicity.

The mutagenic potential of nemolizumab has not been evaluated; however monoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes.

Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with nemolizumab. Evaluation of the available evidence related to IL-31 inhibition and animal toxicology data does not suggest carcinogenic potential.

No effects on fertility parameters were observed in sexually mature cynomolgous monkeys after a long-term subcutaneous treatment with nemolizumab. In the group of dams treated with 25 mg/kg of nemolizumab every two weeks from early organogenesis to delivery, a slight increase in the incidence of offspring death was observed during the early postnatal period. The dams exposures (AUC) were 43- or 34-fold higher than human exposure at maximum recommended human dose in AD or PN patients respectively. A relation of this finding to nemolizumab cannot be excluded.

Nemluvio contains the active substance nemolizumab, a monoclonal antibody (a specialised protein that recognises and attaches to a specific target).

Nemluvio is used in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older to treat moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (also known as atopic eczema, when the skin is itchy, red and dry). It can be used when patients can be treated with systemic treatments (a medicine given by mouth or injection).

Nemluvio is also used in adults to treat moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis (PN), also known as chronic nodular prurigo (CNPG), a long-term skin condition associated with a rash causing itchy bumps . It is used when patients can be treated with systemic treatments.

Nemolizumab, the active substance in Nemluvio, blocks the action of a protein called interleukin (IL)31. IL-31 plays a major role in the skin inflammation and itching seen in people with atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis. By blocking IL-31, this medicine can reduce these symptoms .
