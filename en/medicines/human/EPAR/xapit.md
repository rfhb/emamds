## Overview

On 22 March 2002, the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation for the whole European Union to Pharmacia Europe EEIG, for Xapit (parecoxib), indicated for the short-term treatment of postoperative pain.

Xapit was not marketed anywhere in the European Union. On 23 January 2004, the Marketing Authorisation Holder notified the European Commission of its decision to voluntarily withdraw the Marketing Authorisation for Xapit as there are no plans to market this product in the future. It should be noted that there are still two Community Marketing Authorisations valid throughout the European Union for medicinal products containing parecoxib, i.e., Dynastat and Rayzon.

On 2 March 2004, the European Commission adopted the decision withdrawing the Marketing Authorisation for the medicinal product for human use Xapit. Pursuant to this decision, the European Public Assessment Report for Xapit has been removed from this website.
