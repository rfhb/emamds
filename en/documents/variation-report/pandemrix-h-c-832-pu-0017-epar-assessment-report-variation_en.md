## 2. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 2.1. Introduction

An influenza pandemic is a global outbreak of influenza disease that occurs when a type A influenza strain to which a high proportion of the world's population is immunologically naïve emerges. In April 2009, a new strain of human influenza A(H1N1)v was identified and characterised. On 11 June 2009 the WHO  declared  Phase  6  of  the influenza pandemic.  The  declaration reflected sustained transmission of the virus from person to person in several WHO regions. WHO and other international agencies are calling the disease pandemic (H1N1)v 2009 .  For the virus the nomenclature influenza A(H1N1)v (where v indicates variant) has been chosen.

The attack rate for the A(H1N1)v virus strain is expected to be higher than for recently circulating seasonal strains of influenza because of the lower levels of pre-existing immunity in the population. Current estimates for the attack rate associated with the influenza A(H1N1)v virus over the first major wave of infection in 2009-10 vary from approximately 10-30 % in different geographical areas. As a result,  the  actual  numbers  of  clinically  apparent  infections,  cases  that  require  hospitalisation  and deaths  in  the  pandemic  period  is  expected  to  be  higher  than  in  recent  years  for  seasonal  influenza. These estimates may change (upwards or downwards) during the course of the pandemic. So far in this pandemic there has been a marked under-representation of infections in people over 65 years of age. In Europe, the median age has been 25 years in those who acquired the infection during travel  and  13  years  in  those  infected  within  the  EU.  Nearly  80%  of  cases  have  been  in  individuals under 30 years of age. Deaths have occurred in previously healthy subjects as well as in those with underlying  conditions  or  pregnancy  that  would  predispose  them  to  complications  of  influenza.  For more  information  about  the  known  clinical  features  of  the  disease  caused  by  influenza  A(H1N1)v virus please see the updated Risk Assessment report from ECDC under: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/Documents/0908\\_Influenza\\_AH1N1\\_Risk\\_Assessment.pdf Specific guidance has been developed for the fast track assessment procedure for pandemic influenza vaccines 2 , which can only be used once WHO/EU have officially declared the pandemic (WHO Phase 6). The procedure involves the submission and evaluation of a core pandemic dossier during the interpandemic period that is based on a mock-up vaccine, followed by a fast track assessment of the data for replacing the antigens from the strain used to manufacture the mock-up vaccine with antigens from a recommended pandemic strain as a variation to the MAA. The approval of a core dossier followed by a strain change variation is based on a Proof of Principle approach by which safety and immunogenicity data are generated with mock-up vaccines containing subtypes of influenza A to which the majority of the population is naïve. These principles are based on: ¾ The immune responses to a specific mock-up vaccine containing a strain to which subjects within a specific age range were immunologically naïve are expected to predict responses to the  same  vaccine  construct  containing  an  alternative  strain  of  the  same  subtype  or  an alternative subtype of influenza A in a comparable population.

- ¾ The safety data generated with a specific mock-up vaccine in clinical studies are expected to predict the safety profile observed with the same vaccine construct containing an alternative strain  of  the  same  subtype  or  an  alternative  subtype  of  influenza  A  in  a  comparable population.

Guideline on Dossier Structure and Content for Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Marketing Authorisations Application (CPMP/VEG/4717/03).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

On  the  basis  of  these  assumptions  the  mock-up/core  dossier  construct  allows  for  insertion  of  the pandemic strain into a vaccine construct based on all the data obtained with the corresponding mockup  vaccine  together  with  specific  data  relating  to  the  pandemic  strain.  This  approach  rests  on  the premise  that  the  final  pandemic  vaccine  is  produced  in  the  same  way  (i.e.  with  regards  to  the formulation,  manufacturing  process  and  control  methods)  as  approved  for  the  mock-up  vaccine. Therefore the strain change variation contains mainly the quality data that are new and relevant for the pandemic influenza vaccine virus.

GlaxoSmithKline  Biologicals  received  a  Marketing  Authorisation  (core  pandemic  dossier)  for  the mock-up vaccine of Pandemrix in line with the above mentioned guidelines. The mock-up vaccine is a split virion inactivated influenza vaccine containing antigen from H5N1 (NIBRG-14), which is a strain derived  by  reverse  genetics  from  the  influenza  virus  A/Vietnam/1194/2004.  The  final  formulation contains 3.75 µg haemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 ml dose adjuvanted with AS03. Pandemrix is indicated for  prophylaxis  of  influenza  in  an  officially  declared  pandemic  situation  and  for  use  in  accordance with official guidance.

The first clinical data on the final formulation of Pandemrix A(H1N1)v (i.e. with the antigen content as  specified  for  the  mock-up  vaccine  and  in  the  strain  change  variation)  will  be  available  by  midOctober 2009 and will come from adults aged 18-60 years. Data from subjects aged &gt; 60 years and from children and adolescents will follow at intervals. Submission of these data at specific time points is  included  in  the  Specific  Obligations  agreed  for  Pandemrix  containing  antigen  from  influenza A(H1N1)v. All data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. These ongoing and planned studies will provide safety,  immunogenicity and effectiveness data for Pandemrix influenza A(H1N1)v vaccine. The Pandemrix SPC summarises the existing clinical data. The Clinical Particulars will be updated as new data are submitted and reviewed.

On 22 September 2009 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals applied for a variation to change the strain used for manufacture of Pandemrix to A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)v. The strain used has been officially recommended by WHO and CHMP for the manufacture of vaccines during the current pandemic. Pandemrix is based on the proposed new strain A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (X-179A), which  complies  with  the  WHO 3 and  CHMP 4 recommendations  for  the  emergent  novel  A(H1N1)v influenza  vaccine  composition.  In  support  of  the  strain  change  to  A/California/07/2009  (H1N1)v, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals submitted quality data in accordance with the quality requirements for a novel influenza A(H1N1)v vaccine, the Guideline On Dossier Structure And Content For Pandemic Influenza  Vaccine  Marketing  Authorisation (CPMP/VEG/4717/03  Rev.  1)  and EMEA  fast  track procedure for community human influenza inactivated vaccines annual strain(s) (CHMP/BWP/99698/07). The same manufacturing process, with the exceptions of strain dependant parameter,  and  safety  precautions  were  applied  to  the  production  of  H5N1  and  A(H1N1)v,  which includes the release and shelf-life specifications. The MAH provided quality data in support of this variation  to  demonstrate  that  the  vaccine  containing  A/California/7/2009  (H1N1)v  like  strain  (X179A) is comparable, from the quality point of view, to the Mock-up containing  H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004. The  non-clinical  data  and  most  of  the  clinical  data  available  at  time  of  the  strain  variation  were generated  with  vaccine  constructs  that  included  an  influenza  A  H5N1  strain.  The  clinical  data  all pertained to use of H5N1 influenza strains. The first clinical data from an investigational formulation (with  a  higher  amount  of  antigen  but  otherwise  manufactured  as  for  the  mock-up  vaccine)  of Pandemrix including the A(H1N1)v strain were provided by the MAH on 09 September 2009 and are described and discussed in this report.

Pandemrix is a split virion inactivated influenza vaccine. The mock-up final formulation contains 3.75 µg haemagglutinin (HA) of A/VietNam/1194/2004 NIBRG-14 (H5N1) per 0.5 ml dose adjuvanted by AS03. The mock-up reference virus is A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) NIBRG-14 which was developed using reverse  genetics.  The  reassortment  strain  combines  the  H5  and  N1  segments  to  the  PR8  strain backbone.  In addition the H5 was engineered to eliminate the polybasic stretch of amino-acids at the HA cleavage site that is responsible for high virulence of the original strains.The virus is propagated in fertilised hens' eggs. The  mock-up  vaccine  consists  of  a  suspension  vial  with  the  H5N1  antigen  and  an  oil-in-water emulsion vial with the AS03 adjuvant, which are mixed extemporaneously. Thiomersal, 10 μ g/ml (5 µg per dose), is added because of the multi-dose presentation. Each 0.5 ml dose of vaccine has the following composition: Active Ingredient: 3.75 µg HA Adjuvant: Squalene Alpha-tocopherol Polysorbate 80 Other Ingredients: Octoxynol 10 Sodium chloride Disodium phosphate Potassium dihydrogen phosphate Potassium chloride Magnesium chloride Thiomersal Water for injections Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Active Substance

## · Manufacture

A  master  and  working  seed  were  prepared  from  the  NIBRG-14  reference  virus,  received  from  the WHO Reference centre (NIBSC, UK). The manufacturing process for the monovalent bulks is similar to  the  manufacturing  process  for  the  monovalent  bulks  of  the  licensed  product  Fluarix  (seasonal influenza virus) and can be divided into four main parts:

- Propagation of the working seed in fertilised hen's eggs, harvesting and pooling of infected allantoic fluids
- Purification of the whole virus bulk
- Splitting of the monovalent with sodium deoxycholate
- Inactivation  of  the  monovalent  split  virus  using  sodium  deoxycholate  and  formaldehyde, followed by ultrafiltration and sterile filtration

## · Stability

The process parameters are generally derived from the Fluarix process. Where needed these have been specifically determined for this H5N1 strain. · Control of Materials The  following  starting  materials  used  in  the  production  of  the  monovalent  bulk  are  of  biological origin:  influenza  seed  virus,  eggs  and  sodium  deoxycholate  (derived  from  bovine  bile).  The  H5N1 working seed is derived from the A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 (H5N1) NIBRG-14 vaccine virus strain. The testing of the virus and the eggs is the same as for Fluarix.  Sufficient detailed information has been  provided  on  the  control  and  source  of  these  starting  materials.  The  genetic  stability  of  the A/VietNam/1194/2004 (H5N1) NIBRG-14 obtained through Reverse Genetics has been satisfactorily addressed. · Process validation Critical  steps  of  the  drug  substance  production  process  have  been  identified  and  are  sufficiently controlled.  Process consistency has been demonstrated on three commercial scale batches. Inactivation  studies  performed  on  different  H5N1  strains  have  demonstrated  that  the  proposed inactivation method (Sodium deoxycholate and formaldehyde) results in complete inactivation. Based on experience with Fluarix, the ability of the manufacturing process to inactivate avian leucosis and mycoplasma has been demonstrated. · Characterisation and specifications The  structure  of  the  inactivated  split  monovalent  bulks  was  studied  by  transmission  electron microscopy and confirmed the predominance of disrupted particles after splitting. Controls  include  HA  content,  neuraminidase  identity,  sterility  tests,  tests  for  residual  infectious viruses, residual sodium deoxycholate and test for disrupted virus particles (not routine) and are in line with Ph.Eur. monograph &lt;0158&gt;. All analytical methods have been appropriately validated. The  monovalent  bulks  are  filled  and  stored  in  10  l  glass  Type  I  containers  with  polypropylene closures.

## Medicinal Product (H5N1 vial)

## · Pharmaceutical Development

Developmental  changes  implemented  since  the  first  clinical  studies  have  been  stated  and  clinical studies have provided reassurance of product remaining comparable.

## · Manufacture of the Product

Manufacture for the antigen component consists of formulation of the final bulk with the excipients at SSW (Germany), transport from SSW (Germany) to GSK Biols (Belgium: Rixensart or Wavre sites and Canada: Quebec site for filling into final containers and then finally labelling and packaging at GSK Biols (Wavre).

Antigen  bulk  received  is  sterile.  Bioburden  is  adequately  controlled  throughout  the  manufacturing process. The sterile filtered H5N1 monovalent bulk (SSW, Dresden) and non-sterile excipients, are sterilised in-line, just prior to entering the mixing tank (SSW, Dresden).  The resultant bulk is then transported in validated containers, initially to GSK Wavre for cold storage, and then for filling at GSK Rixensart or  GSK  Wavre  or  GSK  Quebec.  Formulation  of  final  formulated  bulk  and  subsequent  filling  into transport  containers,  and  later,  pooling  of  transported  HDPE  containers  into  the  filling  tank  and subsequent filling is conducted under aseptic conditions. Stability data have been submitted to support the maximum storage period of the formulated bulk filling into bulk transport containers (30 days) and in the filling tanks (14days). · Product Specification Compliance with the product specifications has been shown on three batches representative of the final formulation and commercial scale manufacture Specifications for excipients and analytical procedures are in line with the Ph.Eur.  Controls of final bulks (sterility, HA, total protein, residual ovalbumin, thiomersal, residual formaldehyde and residual sucrose) and final containers (sterility, bacterial endotoxins, pH, volume, thiomersal and HA) of the antigen vial are acceptable (Ph.Eur. or in line with Fluarix). Methods are either in line with Ph.Eur. or are validated.  Specificity in presence of thiomersal has been demonstrated. HA  content,  sterility,  thiomersal  content,  endotoxin  content,  pH  and  description,  formaldehyde, ovalbumin  and  protein  content  are  measured  as  part  of  the  stability  studies.  Test  methods  and specifications are identical to those at release. The proposed shelf life (i.e. 24 months) is accepted on basis of the updated stability results provided by the MAH. An overage of 10 % HA will be applied at formulation of the commercials lots and supporting data and satisfactory justification have been provided.

Developmental changes implemented since the first clinical studies have been stated and non-clinical and clinical studies have provided reassurance of product remaining comparable.

## · Manufacture of the AS03 adjuvant vial

Formulation of the AS03 adjuvant consists of the preparation of the bulk (formation of O/W emulsion using high shear and pressure homogenisation) followed by filling into glass vials.  Process parameters are  identified.    No  routine  in-process  tests  are  conducted.    Bioburden  is  adequately  controlled throughout the manufacturing process.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Specifications of the AS03 adjuvant

With the exception of squalene, all excipients are described and controlled in line with the Ph.Eur. Adequate  quality  control  of  squalene  is  performed  by  the  supplier  and  by  GSK  (according  to  an internal GSK monograph which is in line with the Ph.Eur. monograph for squalane).

Emulsion bulk and AS03 final containers are tested at release for Description, Identity and Content of adjuvant components (polysorbate 80, α -tocopherol and squalene), pH, Endotoxin content, Sterility, Particle size, Polydispersity index and Volume (final containers only).

Tests  for  sterility  and  bacterial  endotoxins  are  performed  in  line  with  the  Ph.Eur.  and  tests  for polysorbate 80, α -tocopherol and squalene are validated.  The method used for particle size analysis and associated system suitability measurements is acceptable.

· Stability of the AS03 adjuvant Data provided from the stability studies for the bulk emulsion support the shelf life of 2 years.  For final AS03 container lots a shelf-life of 36 months has been approved. Medicinal Product (mixed H5N1 and AS03 vial) At the time of extemporaneous dispensing, adjuvant is added to antigen vial. Data from 'withdrawable'  volume  studies  conducted  to  support  the  required  overfill  for  both  antigen  and adjuvant  vials  is  provided.    Information  on  long  term  storage  (1  week)  of  mixed  AS03  adjuvanted H5N1 is also provided. Preservative  efficacy  of  thiomersal  concentration  after  mixing  the  content  of  the  antigen  container with AS03 adjuvant has been shown in line with Ph.Eur. Sufficient compatibility/stability data has been provided in the dossier. SDS PAGE and Western blot analysis performed show that profiles of the adjuvanted formulation are comparable to the non-adjuvanted  formulation  and  remain  unchanged  after  a  period  of  24  hours  at 25°C.  Interaction between antigen and adjuvant has been shown to be limited by various biophysical methods Uniformity of dose has been demonstrated for the 10-dose product. In addition, non-clinical studies have shown similar immune responses were observed when antigen and adjuvant were administered separately (one hour apart at the same site, or simultaneously in 2 separate syringes in the same area) or after administration of pre-mixed antigen and adjuvant. Therefore, it is accepted that there is no need to control antigen/adjuvant interaction for this product. Sufficient  evidence  has  been  provided  that  there  is  little/no  effect  of  the  reconstitution  conditions (mixing time and conditions) on the essential characteristics of the antigen/adjuvant combination. The proposed in-use shelf life of 24 hours is considered justified based on stability/characterisation data provided. 2.2.2 Pandemic Strain Variation (A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (X179A) Medicinal product no longer authorised

With regard to the quality requirements for a novel influenza A(H1N1)v vaccine, the Guideline On Dossier Structure And Content For Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Marketing Authorisation (CPMP/VEG/4717/03  Rev.  1)  and EMEA  fast  track  procedure  for  community  human  influenza inactivated  vaccines  annual  strain(s) (CHMP/BWP/99698/07)  are  applicable.  The  same  quality requirements and safety precautions apply to production of H5N1 and A(H1N1)v.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The proposed influenza strain for Pandemrix is: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (X-179A). This vaccine strain complies with the WHO 5 and CHMP 6 recommendations for the emergent novel A(H1N1)v influenza vaccine composition and therefore is accepted.

The MAH provided quality data in support of this variation to ensure that the manufacture of the drug substance and drug product are appropriately controlled. Adequate release and shelf-life specifications have been set.

## Active substance

The reference virus described in the current MAA is A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v NYMC X-179A. This  strain  has  been  developed  by  the  NYMC  using  classical  genetic  reassortion.  The  reassortant strain  combines  the  HA,  NA  and  PB1  genes  of  A/California/7/2009  (H1N1)v,  to  the  PR8  strain backbone.

The manufacturing process for A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v like strain (X-179A) monovalent bulks is  the  same as the manufacturing process for A/Vietnam (H5N1) monovalent bulks (i.e. thiomersalfree monovalent bulk manufacturing process. Reference is made to the type II variation EMEA/H/C/000832/II/0010, positive opinion dated June, 25th 2009), with the exceptions of straindependant  parameters.  This  is  also  the  process  used  and  approved  to  produce  the  monobulks  of seasonal strains, used in Fluarix . Information is presented on the source and passage level history of the primary seed virus as well as on the preparation and qualification of the working seed virus lots for the strain. Unlike for H5N1 A/Indonesia and A/Vietnam, the A(H1N1)v strain has been produced using classical reassortment  on  eggs  rather  than  being  attenuated  by  reverse  genetics.    The  master  seed  has  been shown to be sterile and free from avian and human mycoplasmas in line with Ph.Eur 2.6.7.  HA and NA identity for the master and working seeds have been confirmed.  The specifications and methods for the master and working seed are in line with that already approved for Pandemrix H5N1. Data on the results of safety tests in ferrets for the primary seed have been provided. Eggs  used  for  establishing  seeds  are  SPF.    The  master  seed  prepared  by  GSK  corresponds  to E7/E1/E1.  Commercial A(H1N1)v monobulks have been prepared with this master seed and also with working seeds derived from the master seed with up to 2 additional passages (i.e. up to E7/E1/E3). Commercial  production  occurs  with  one  additional  passage  from  the  working  seed.    Adequate supporting data for suitability of the master and working seeds are provided. The MAH  has adequately demonstrated inactivation (sodium deoxycholate (NaDoc) and formaldehyde) for the proposed strain and data are comparable to that seen for A/Indonesia H5N1. Splitting  has  been  validated  for  three  monovalent  bulk  lots  using  TEM  and  by  analysis  of  sucrose gradient profiles for protein, HA and phospholipid partition for lots produced directly from the master seed. The SRD method has been satisfactorily requalified using intended antigen and antisera. The MAH has  demonstrated  that  the  method  is  precise  at  15µg/mL  (100%  concentration),  and  down  to  25%. Sufficient assay validation data is provided to assure acceptable performance of SRD assay to quantify HA content in the monovalent bulk and as such also of the drug product. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Batch analysis results are provided for four commercial monovalent lots (produced using the strainadapted process); produced at Building G and Building A/B using the master seed (using (E7/E1/E1). Batch  analytical  data  are  also  provided  for  lots  produced  from  the  working  seeds  (E7/E1/E2  and E7/E1/E3). All batches demonstrate that registered specifications for Pandemrix are met.

Data  generated  on  A/H5N1  strains  are  submitted  as  supportive  data  for  the  stability  of  the  drug substance (monovalent bulks). An acceptable confirmatory stability plan for the proposed A/California (H1N1)v strain monobulks has been provided.

Real-time, real-temperature stability data are presented for up to two months for the four monovalent bulks  produced  from  the  master  seed.  Overall,  the  stability  of  the  HA  content  during  the  period evaluated is satisfactory.  The approved shelf-life for H5N1 monobulks is 18 months and this can be applied to the A(H1N1)v strain. The MAH commits to report any unexpected results generated during the  ongoing  stabilities  studies,  in  case  of  a  confirmed  out-of-specification  or  unexpected  trend  not supporting the registered shelf-life.

The approved specifications for final bulk and drug product have not been changed.

The  A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v  like strain (X-179A)  final bulks and final containers are respectively  formulated  and  filled  as  approved  for  the  H5N1  final  bulks  and  final  containers  of Pandemrix  H5N1.  The  same  control  processes  as  for  Pandemrix  H5N1  are  applied  to  the  antigen component of the MAH's A/California (H1N1)v influenza vaccine adjuvanted with AS03.  The SRD method used for analysis of final bulks and final containers is the same as that used at the level of the monovalent  bulks.    QC  release  data  for  the  A/California  (H1N1)v  final  bulks  and  final  containers presented conform to the specifications approved and in force for the antigen component of Pandemrix H5N1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Compatibility  of  the  split  inactivated  A/California  (H1N1)v  antigen  with  the  AS03  adjuvant  is demonstrated  for  the  A(H1N1)v  clinical  lot  being  used  in  10  trials  across  Europe,  throughout  the vaccine's in-use shelf life of 24 hours, as approved for Pandemrix.  Results demonstrate the integrity of the HA antigen and the AS03 adjuvant upon formulation of the adjuvanted A(H1N1)v vaccine.

Stability  data  after  storage  for  one  month  at  2-8°C  are  also  available  for  3  lots  of  final  vaccine produced  from  the  master  seed.    Preliminary  accelerated  stability  data  for  A(H1N1)v  A/California final  containers  stored  at  30°C  ±  3°C  show  a  drop  in  HA  content  during  the  first  week  of  storage, though  this  was  also  seen  with  H5N1  lots  and  is  not  representative  for  stability  under  long-term conditions.  The confirmatory long-term stability program will cover 60 months storage at 5°C ± 3°C. The  MAH  is  proposing  an  alignment  to  the  shelf-life  approved  for  the  antigen  and  the  adjuvant components of Pandemrix H5N1 (i.e. 24 months shelf-life at 2-8°C for the final antigen containers and 36  months  at  2-8°C  for  the  adjuvant),  since  the  vaccine  composition  is  unchanged  apart  form  the vaccine strain.  This is accepted.

Overall, the information presented in Modules 2.3 and 3 was considered in accordance with the abovementioned guidelines and therefore acceptable. 2.3 Non-clinical aspects Introduction Preclinical  development  of  Pandemrix  was  generally  in  agreement  with  current  guidelines.  The antigen is produced in hen's eggs using the same process as that is applied to the MAH's own Fluarix brand of seasonal influenza vaccine.  This was approved in 1992 and over 200 million doses have been manufactured.  As advised in regulatory guidance documents, preclinical testing with Fluarix can be used to support this application, based on the similarity of manufacture. No new non-clinical studies with A(H1N1)v were submitted at the time of the strain variation. GLP The safety studies included in the dossier were all compliant with GLP. Pharmacology · Primary pharmacodynamics Primary pharmacodynamic properties were investigated in mice, pigs and ferrets. The studies demonstrate the ability of the AS03 adjuvant to augment immunological responses to the vaccine in mice and pigs.  The data from the pig study show a statistically significant effect of dose of adjuvant in one of the three tested influenza strains, the B/Shangdong strain. A non-significant doseresponse effect might be suggested with the A/Panama strain. Efficacy of the vaccine was tested in a challenge test in ferrets.  Survival data are compelling in that, where a sufficient dose of antigen was used, protection from a lethal challenge was obtained. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Consistent changes in serological and pathological parameters were detected and it can be concluded that the vaccine provided protection from virus-associated pathological changes.

The  SPC  statements  adequately  reflect  that As  no  administration  around  implantation  phase  of  the  embryos  was  performed,  the  use  of  AS03adjuvanted vaccine in early pregnancy was considered not directly supported by the study.  The MAH has  agreed  to  conduct  a  study  where  the  vaccine  will  be  given  to  pregnant  animals,  early  in  their pregnancy.  The  MAH  argues  that  the  adjuvant  is  not  expected  to  have  adverse  effects  on  early pregnancy  primarily  because  the  innate  immune  response  is  local  to  the  site  of  injection  and  on injection of the adjuvanted vaccine, there is no systemic cytokine response detectable.  However, the effect of adjuv e animal  studies  did  not  indicate  harmful  effects  with  respect  to  fertility,  pregnancy  or  embryofetal development.

In neonates, the reflex development was unimpaired, but  among offspring from dams treated with AS03 13 offspring from 7 litters did not show the air righting reflect before day 21 of age and this effect may be related to treatment.  However, AS03 did not affect the re examination of the offspring.  This is considered a suitable study to assess the reproductive toxicity of the vaccine. Medicinal product no longer authorised

H5N1-012 was an open, randomised study in healthy adults aged 18-60 years. The data were provided support the possibility of administering one dose of Pandemrix after primary immunisation with one to or  two  doses  of  the  same  vaccine  formulation  except  that  the  H5N1  antigen  was  derived  from  a different clade of the virus.

5N1-015 was a continuation (boosting phase) of the dose-finding study 007. Boosting in study 015 H occurred  at  approximately  14  months  after  the  two  priming  doses.  The  data  from  this  study  are described separately below since there was an additional group.

5N1-010 was an open label study that compared administration of two single or two double doses of H vaccine  on  Day  0  and  on  Day  21  in  subjects  aged  61  years  and  above.  The  comparative  groups received single or double doses of non-adjuvanted vaccine of the same HA content.

5N1-009 (-022/023) enrolled children aged from 3-9 years to receive two doses at Day 0 and Day 21 tigen content as  slightly  higher  than  that  in  the  final  vaccine  because  a  preliminary  method  for  estimating  the content had been used. The data were limited to HI responses at 21 days after a single dose.

## Studies with the H5N1 mock-up vaccine submitted before approval of the core dossier

Studies H5N1-002 and -007 enrolled healthy males and females aged 18 to 60 years while study 008 also enrolled subjects aged &gt; 60 years. Study groups were as in the table above.

In study 007 immunogenicity  (HI)  and  safety  were  co-primary  objectives.  The  randomisation algorithm used a minimisation procedure accounting for centre and age and subjects were stratified according to age (18-30 years old or 31 to 60 years old). The target sample size was 400 (i.e. 50 for each of the eight groups) to provide 360 evaluable subjects.

In study 008 the primary objective was to evaluate the safety of a 15 μ g/AS03 candidate vaccine but immunogenicity  was  evaluated  in  a  subset.  The  randomisation  algorithm  used  a  minimisation procedure accounting for centre and age and employed three strata (18-30, 31-60 and &gt; 60 years). There was a 3:1 allocation ratio in favour of the candidate vaccine. The sample size was calculated at 5052 subjects to provide 4800 evaluable taking into account a 5% dropout rate. This number was to include 4526 subjects aged between 18-60 years and 526 aged 61 years or above. In study 002 the primary objective was to demonstrate the consistency of the HI immune response elicited by four lot groups derived from mixing of 2 lots of HA and 2 lots of AS03. The target sample size was 1090 enrolled subjects (four groups of 218 subjects plus two control groups of 109 subjects that received unadjuvanted HA) in order to reach 980 evaluable subjects. Studies were observer-blinded due to differences in the appearances of the vaccines. Study personnel who  vaccinated  the  subjects  were  not  involved  in  the  evaluation  of  endpoints  and  access  to  the vaccines was restricted to the person(s) in charge of accountability, preparation and administration. The following populations were defined: o Total Vaccinated cohort: all vaccinated subjects for whom data were available. o According-To-Protocol  (ATP)  for  safety:  all  vaccinated  with  sufficient  safety  data  for analysis. o ATP for immunogenicity: all evaluable subjects with immunogenicity data available. Immunogenicity Results H5N1-007 This study was initiated at a single site in Belgium (Ghent) in March 2006. There were 400 subjects enrolled, with 49-51 randomised to each dose/adjuvant group. Of these 400, 399 were evaluable for safety and 394 met the criteria for the ATP immunogenicity analysis. Pre-vaccination, nine subjects were seropositive for HI antibody to  A/Vietnam/1194/2004 but only three were seroprotected. The 70% threshold for the SPR was not reached in any group after one dose. After two doses the 70% threshold was exceeded in all four adjuvanted formulation groups (range 84 96%) but in none of the non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. Medicinal product no longer authorised

After the second vaccination with all adjuvanted formulations and with non-adjuvanted formulations containing  30  or  15  µg  HA  the  SCFs  exceeded  2.5  but  ranged  from  27.9  to  60.5  for  adjuvanted vaccines compared to a maximum value of only 3.9 among non-adjuvanted formulations. After  both  the  first  and  second  vaccinations  the  SCR  rates  were  significantly  superior  in  groups vaccinated with adjuvanted formulations. There was no significant difference in the post-vaccination anti-HA antibody titre between the four groups that received adjuvanted formulations. For each dose of HA, a significant difference was detected between the adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted groups. SPRs to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 for the adjuvanted vaccine groups at D180 ranged from 54 - 64 %. In the 3.8 μ g HA +AS03 group the seroprotection rates were 84% at D42 and 54% at D180 (see below).

Day 180 SCFs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were reduced compared to values obtained at Day 42 in both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. In the 3.8 μ g/AS03 vaccine group the SCFs were 27.9 at D42 and 4.4 at D180. Pre-vaccination, between one fifth and one third per group already had NA titres of at least 1:28 while 10 to 25% per group had titres ≥ 1:40 and 2 to 10% had titres ≥ 1:80. GMTs increased significantly after the first and second vaccinations with adjuvanted formulations. At D42 most subjects in the adjuvanted groups had NA titres above these two cut-offs (i.e. 97.9% 100%  at  1:40  and  91.5%  -  100%  at  1:80).  Similarly,  seroconversion  rates  were  higher  in  groups vaccinated  with  adjuvanted  formulations.  An  HA  dose  effect  was  detected  in  the  non-adjuvanted groups only.

At D180 all except one of the subjects from the adjuvanted groups were seropositive for NA to the vaccine strain and 98% were seropositive in the group that received the 3.8 µg HA + AS03 vaccine.

HI  and  NA  titres  were  also  assessed  against  heterologous  H5N1  strains  (i.e.  H5N1  viruses  of  a different clade to the vaccine strain) to assess cross-protection. Pre-vaccination, no subject was seropositive (HI titre ≥ 10) for A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) i.e. a clade 2 sub-clade 1 strain. o By D42 HI GMTs approximately doubled in the adjuvanted formulation groups and the number of seropositive subjects increased significantly to reach 26.5 to 48% per group. D42 SCFs ranged from  2.0  to  2.8.  The  percentage  of  vaccinees  that  seroconverted  after  the  second  vaccination ranged from 20% to 32% per group. o After both the first and second vaccinations with non-adjuvanted formulations, the seroconversion factors were equal to 1.0 and no subjects seroconverted. o At D180 seropositivity rates for anti-HA against the A/Indonesia/5/2005 strain were ≤ 10% for both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccine groups and seroprotection rates were all ≤ 6%. Cross-reactivity was assessed against two additional H5N1 drifted clade 2 strains -A/Anhui/01/2005/subclade  3  and  A/Turkey/Turkey/1/2005  -  NIBRG23/subclade  2.  Assays  were performed on sera from a subset of 40 subjects who received 3.8 μ g HA with or without AS03. o No  subject  was  seropositive  based  on  HI  for  either  strain  before  the  first  dose.  Adjuvanted vaccine mediated a significant increase in GMT at D42 against both strains, although the absolute titres were low, and 55% - 65% were seropositive at this time point. o At  D42,  HI  seroconversion  and  seroprotection  rates  in  the  adjuvanted  group  were  both  35% against  A/Anhui/01/2005  and  60%  against  A/Turkey/Turkey/1/2005  but  rates  were ≤ 5%  by D180.  In  the  adjuvanted  vaccine  group  the  D42  seroconversion  factors  were  3.4  and  4.7  for respective strains. For NA against A/Indonesia/5/05 (H5N1) 0-8.3% in 7/8 groups were seropositive with respect to this strain  pre-vaccination  but  the  rate  was  21.3%  (10/47)  in  the  7.5/AS03  group.  At  least  88%  were seropositive  after  two  doses  and  79  -  83%  had  a  titre ≥ 1:40  while  46  -  58%  had ≥ 1:80. Seroconversion rates increased significantly (up to 63-77%) after the second vaccination. Medicinal product no longer authorised

For the 3.8 μ g HA + AS03 vaccine  the  rates  were  87.5%  at  D42  and  82%  at  D180.  There  was  no  antigen  dose  effect  in  the adjuvanted groups for seropositivity rates, GMTs or seroconversion rates. NA assays performed against A/Anhui/01/2005/subclade 3 and A/Turkey/Turkey/1/2005 -NIBRG23/subclade 2 showed that 0-4 subjects per group had detectable antibody before vaccination. By D42 1-2 subjects in the non-adjuvanted groups had become seropositive but none met the criteria for  seroconversion  and  there  was  no  change  in  GMTs.  The  adjuvanted  vaccine  elicited  significant increases  in  GMTs  after  the  first  and  second  doses.  At  D42  all  subjects  were  seropositive  for  NA against these strains and 75% and 85% had seroconverted against A/Anhui/01/2005 and A/Turkey/Turkey/1/2005,  respectively.  At  D180  all  except  one  subject  in  the  adjuvanted  groups remained  seropositive  for  both  strains  and  60%  and  70%  still  met  the  seroconversion  criterion although GMTs had declined by about one third.

Pre-vaccination  frequencies  of  influenza-specific  CD4  T-cells  were  similar  across  groups.  On stimulation with split A/Vietnam/1194/2004 frequencies of influenza-specific CD4 T-cells significantly increased in all groups after the first vaccination but essentially remained unchanged after the second dose. This lack of detectable increment after the second dose might have occurred because the sample was taken after the peak response occurred. The frequencies of influenza-specific CD4 Tcells  were  higher  in  adjuvanted  compared  with  non-adjuvanted  formulation  groups.  No  significant effect of antigen dose was detected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

At D180 frequencies of influenza-specific CD4 T-cells remained high compared to the pre-vaccination levels. Values were higher after vaccination with the AS03 adjuvanted compared to non-adjuvanted formulations. Individual differences between D180 and D0 in CD4 responses showed a statistically significant  difference  between  adjuvanted  and  non-adjuvanted  groups  for  both  3.8 μ g  and  7.5 μ g formulations for all types of cytokines except IFN γ .

The pre-vaccination frequency of influenza-specific CD8 T-cells was essentially similar in all groups. No significant effect of vaccination was observed on the frequency of influenza-specific CD8 T-cells at D42 or at D180 whatever the formulation received.

The 3.8 µg HA/AS03 formulation induced a cross-reactive CD4+ T cell response to the heterologous clade 2 H5N1 A/Indonesia/05/05 strain that was similar to that against the vaccine strain. The response to  both strains was higher in the adjuvanted vaccine group at the same HA level. There was also a limited CD4+ T cell response to the heterologous split virions H3N2 New-York (NY) and H1N1 New Caledonia  (NC).  It  is  not  known  whether  the  cross-recognised  domains  belong  to  the  split  virion backbone (PR8) and/or represent conserved T cell epitopes on haemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase proteins. T-cell cross-reactivity against pools of peptides derived from the HA of the vaccine strain, the  H5N1  drifted  clade  2  subclade  1  A/Indonesia/5/2005  and  the  Anhui  clade  2  subclade  3 (A/Anhui/01/2005) strain showed a weak response with respect to each strain in the non-adjuvanted group. The adjuvanted vaccine elicited a significant increase in the response against HA peptides from A/Vietnam, A/Indonesia and A/Anhui. H5N1- 008 (and extension to D180 as study 011) Thus study was initiated at 41 sites in seven countries (6 EU MS plus Russia) in May 2006. There were  5075  subjects  enrolled  of  which  5071  subjects  were  vaccinated  and  4904  completed  to  D51. Immunogenicity was assessed up to D180 in a subset of the total enrolled. Pre-vaccination  0-2.5%  of  subjects  aged  &lt;  60  years  but  10-18%  aged  &gt;  60  years  were  already seropositive according to HI titres. Due to the baseline seropositivity rates the data shown below refer only to subjects who were initially seronegative. In  adults  aged  between  18  and  60  years,  the  SPR  against  the  vaccine  strain  exceeded  the  70% threshold  after  the  second  vaccination.  In  adults  aged  &gt;  60  years,  the  60%  threshold  was  exceeded after the first vaccination (61.4%). In both age strata SPRs reached 91.4% at D42. In both age-strata the SCFs exceeded the relevant CHMP thresholds after the first dose of 15µg/AS03. After the second dose the SCFs significantly increased in both age-strata but the increment and the final GMT were higher in adults aged between 18 and 60 years than in those aged &gt; 60 years. There were no appreciable changes in GMTs after Fluarix was given in either age group.

At  D180  58%  of  those  aged  &lt;  60  years  and  79%  aged  &gt;  60  years  in  the  group  that  had  received 15µg/AS03 were seroprotected. The SPR at D180 was the same (58%) for the 18-30 and 31-60 years groups. In contrast only 2% of those aged &lt; 60 and 18% of those &gt; 60 years who had been primed with Fluarix were seroprotected at D180. The SCRs were 57% and 74% for the younger and older age groups, respectively, who had received 15µg/AS03 compared to 2% and 9% in the control group. The corresponding SCFs were 5.2 and 8.3 compared to 1.1 and 1.5 in the control group.

H5N1 = H5N1 15µg HA + AS03 Fluarix = Fluarix/Placebo at the 2 nd  dose In subjects aged 18 to 60 years 45.0% in the H5N1/AS03 group (21.4% with a titre of at least 1:80) and  44.7%  in  the  Fluarix  group  (27.7%  with  at  least  1:80)  were  seropositive  for  NA  against A/Vietnam at baseline. NA GMTs in H5N1/AS03 recipients peaked at Day 42 (827.8) and then declined to 134.9 at Day 180. Within the Fluarix group, there was also a significant increase in GMTs from pre-dose to 21 days after the first and second vaccinations but values were much lower (&gt;10-fold difference). At Day 180 there was still a 4-fold difference between groups. Correspondingly at Day 180 98.6 % of subjects from the H5N1/AS03 group were still seropositive for NA compared to 44.2% in the Fluarix/placebo group. At Day 21, 83.2% of subjects had seroconverted in the H5N1/AS03 group compared to 38.3% in the Fluarix group. The SCR showed a further significant increase at Day 42 in the H5N1/AS03 group to reach 92.1% compared to 29.8% in the Fluarix group (29.8% at Day 42). At D180 the SCRs were 58 % and 16% in respective groups. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the age group &gt; 60 years the majority (82% and 91% per group) were already seropositive for NA to  the  vaccine  strain  at  baseline.  The  percentages  with  pre-vaccination  titres ≥ 1:40  or ≥ 1:80  were similar between the 15 µg HA/AS03 and the Fluarix control group (i.e. 69.5% and 67.3% at 1:40, with 44.6% and 40.0% at 1:80). After a single dose of the adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine all except one subject was seropositive. After a second dose there were further and significant increments in GMT and SCR. In the 15 µg HA/AS03 group the percentages with ≥ 1:40 and ≥ 1:80 at D21 were 99.4% and 93.8%, respectively. At D42 these  percentages were 100% and 99.4%. At D21 and D42 there was a statistically higher immune response in the 15 µg HA/AS03 group.

## H5N1-002 (and extension study 030 to D180 + boosting)

The  study  was  initiated  on  24  March  2007  in  four  SE  Asian  countries.  There  were  1206  subjects enrolled into the study and 1190 completed primary immunisation.

Consistency among the four adjuvanted vaccine lots based on pre-defined criteria applied to D42 HI data was demonstrated. GMTs for anti-HA antibody were very similar between the four adjuvanted groups on D0, D21 and D42 for the homologous vaccine strain and were also similar between groups but much lower against A/Indonesia/5/2005. Results for the two non-adjuvanted groups were similar to  each  other  but  showed  a  very  small  anti-HA  response  to  the  vaccine  strain  and  no  discernible response to the heterologous strain.

Before vaccination 17 - 20% of subjects were seropositive for NA against the vaccine strain while 5 11% of subjects were seropositive for NA against  A/Indonesia/2005. For the individual adjuvanted groups the percentages with titres ≥ 1:28 at D42 ranged from 98-100% for the vaccine strain and 92100% for the heterologous strain. In contrast, percentages with titres ≥ 1:28 at  D42 in the two nonadjuvanted groups were 42% and 54% for the vaccine strain and 17% and 11% for the heterologous strain.

For  the  pooled  adjuvanted  vaccine  groups  the  D42  seroconversion  rate  was  96%  for  the  H5N1 A/Vietnam strain and 91.4% for A/Indonesia/2005.

Seropositivity rates and GMTs for NA at D0 and D42 (ATP cohort for immunogenicity)

The extension study 030 involved the administration of one or two doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing A/Indonesia/05/2005 to subjects aged 19-61 years who had received two doses of AS03adjuvanted (HN-AS03) or non-adjuvanted (HN-DIL) A/Vietnam vaccine, respectively, in study 002. The pre-dose data from Month 6 allowed for an assessment of antibody persistence. Of 1181 subjects that entered study 030, 509 (265 from the original HN-AS03 group and 236 from the original HN-DIL group) were to be boosted and 672 (all from HN-AS03 group) were not boosted. HI titres were measured at Month 6 and then at 21 days after the first dose (i.e. M6 + 21D). In the HNDIL group, which received two doses of adjuvanted A/Indonesia vaccine in study 030, an additional sample was obtained at 21 days after the second dose (i.e. M6 + 42D). At Month 6 all HI GMTs had dropped compared to day 42 of study 002. Seropositivity rates were higher in the HN-AS03 group (62.1%  for  A/Vietnam  and  18.4%  for  A/Indonesia)  than  in  the  HN-DIL  group  (9.2%  and  1.3%, respectively).

At M6 + 21D the GMTs had increased markedly and were significantly higher in the HN-AS03 group (397.4 for A/Vietnam and 321.3 for A/Indonesia) compared to the HN-DIL group (30.1 and 24.8). At 21 days after a second dose in the HN-DIL group there was a further increment in GMT against both strains.

After a single dose the SCRs in the HN-AS03 group exceeded 40% against each strain (96.1% for A/Vietnam and 94.9% for A/Indonesia) and the HN-DIL group (48.5% and 46.3%). The &gt; 2.5 SCF threshold was exceeded at day 21 against each strain in the HN-AS03 group (74.0 and 63.8) and the HN-DIL group (5.3 and 4.9). The &gt; 70% SPR threshold was exceeded at day 21 against each strain in the  HN-AS03  group  (96.5%  for  A/Vietnam  and  94.9%  for  A/Indonesia).  The  SPR  threshold  was exceeded only after a second dose in the HN-DIL group (78.9% and 82.9%, respectively).

Comparison of results with adjuvanted vaccine in studies 002, 007 and 008 In subjects aged 18-60 years the HI titres against the vaccine strain tended to be higher for the 924 subjects tested in study 002 with final production lots compared to the 50 tested in study 007 with preliminary manufactured vaccine. On comparing study 002 with the results for the 15 µg HA/AS03 vaccine used in study 008 the GMT and SCF were higher (95% CI do not overlap) in 008 but the SCRs and SPRs were comparable despite the difference in HA content. The D21 and D42 data from each study showed that two doses of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine were needed to meet all three CHMP criteria with respect to HI antibody against the vaccine strain.

The HI SPRs against the vaccine strain in subjects aged 18-60 years at D180 were 54% after priming with  3.8  µg/AS03  in  study  007  compared  to  58%  primed  with  15 μ g/AS03  in  study  008.  The respective HI GMTs at D180 were 23.3 and 27.2. These data suggested no advantage for the higher HA dose.  In  study  002  the  HI  seropositivity  rate  in  the  HN-AS03  group  at  D180  were  62.1%  for A/Vietnam and 18.4% for A/Indonesia and 40% were seroprotected with respect to the vaccine strain. The  D42  NA  response  against  the  vaccine  strain  was  similar  between  002  and  007  (all  95%  CI overlap). At least 98% were seropositive with respect to the vaccine strain while the seropositivity rate with respect to the heterologous strain was numerically higher in 002. The SCRs were numerically or (borderline) significantly greater with respect to homologous and heterologous strains, respectively, in study  002.  However,  the  GMTs  were  the  same  between  studies  for  each  of  the  homologous  and heterologous strains and about 4-fold higher for the former than for the latter strain. NA against vaccine strain and H5N1 A/Indonesia/5/2005 in adults aged 18-60 years in H5N1-002 and H5N1-007 (ATP immunogenicity cohort) Overall the data from these studies indicated that for H5N1 mock-up vaccine two doses of Pandemrix were needed to meet the CHMP criteria for HI antibody. The addition of the AS03 adjuvant greatly enhanced  the  antibody  responses  for  HI  and  NA  against  the  vaccine  strain  and  drifted  variants  of H5N1 regardless of baseline serostatus. In the dose-finding study the addition of adjuvant indicated that the lowest dose tested was satisfactory, allowing for an antigen-sparing approach. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## S tudies with the H5N1 mock-up vaccine submitted post authorisation

## H5N1- 012

This  was  an  open,  randomised  study  conducted  in  Germany  with  eight  parallel  groups  of  healthy adults aged 18-60 years. The study examined the possibility of administering one dose of Pandemrix after primary immunisation with the same vaccine containing H5N1 antigen from a different clade of the same influenza subtype.

Eight groups were vaccinated (VT=A/Vietnam; IN=A/Indonesia):

Four groups primed with a single dose at D0

- VT/IN/6Mo · VT/IN/12Mo Four groups primed with 2 doses at D0 and D21 · 2VT/VT/6Mo   = two VT doses for priming and one VT booster at Month 6. · 2VT/VT/12Mo = two VT doses for priming and one VT booster at Month 12 · 2VT/IN/6Mo = two VT doses for priming and one IN booster at Month 6. · 2VT/IN/12Mo = two VT doses for priming and one IN booster at Month 12. The study enrolled 512 subjects aged 18-60 years (63 to 66 per group) and all were vaccinated. At prevaccination  no  subject  was  seropositive  with  respect  to  HI  antibody  against  A/Indonesia  and  0-2 subjects per group were seropositive with respect to A/Vietnam. The data available were reported up to Month 6 boosting doses; data on boosting at one year will follow. · At Day 21, GMTs for H5N1 HI antibodies against the homologous strain A/Vietnam were higher (15.8 - 33.6) than against the A/Indonesia strain (5.3 - 6.8). At Day 42 in the groups that received two primary doses the GMTs increased significantly against homologous and heterologous strains (178.3 - 289.1 and 18.4 - 28.0, respectively). At Month 6, the GMTs against the homologous strain in the four groups primed with a single dose were 9.7 - 13.2 and those for the heterologous strain were 5.3 - 5.7. Corresponding GMTs for the four groups primed with two doses were 24.0 - 38.4 and 6.5 - 10.2. · The D21 SCRs against A/Vietnam exceeded 40% in 5/8 groups (max 60%) while all SCRs were &lt; 10% against A/Indonesia. At Day 42 the SCRs against homologous virus in the groups primed with two doses were 89.6% - 93.2 % and also exceeded 40% against the heterologous strain (41.5 % - 54.5 %). At Month 6 a SCR &gt;40 % was only maintained against homologous virus and only in groups that had received two primary doses (47.1 % - 67.3 %). · At Day 21, the &gt;2.5 SCF threshold was met for all groups against the homologous strain (3.1 6.5) but no group met the criterion for A/Indonesia. At Day 42 the &gt;2.5 SCF threshold was met in the four groups primed with two doses against homologous virus (34.4 - 49.2) and for A/Indonesia (3.7 - 5.6). At Month 6 the &gt;2.5 SCF threshold was still met by groups primed with two doses against A/Vietnam (4.6 and 7.5). No group met the criterion for A/Indonesia. Medicinal product no longer authorised
- The pre-vaccination SPRs ranged from 0-4.2% to both homologous and heterologous strains. At Day 21, SPRs were between 30.9 % - 60.0 % against A/Vietnam but only from 0.0 % - 8.6 % against A/Indonesia. SPRs in the four groups primed with one dose of VT were all &lt; 50%. At Day 42,  SPRs  were  from  89.6  %  -  93.2  %  against  A/Vietnam  but  only  41.5  %  -  54.5  %  against A/Indonesia in groups primed with two doses. At Month 6 SPRs against A/Vietnam were 47.1% 69.2% in groups primed with two doses but only 14.3% - 25.5% in groups primed with a single dose. Corresponding rates for A/Indonesia were 2.0 % -13.5 % and 0.0 % -1.8 %, respectively.

In the four groups that received a booster dose with VT or IN vaccine at Month 6 the results at Month 6 + 21 days showed that the response against A/Indonesia was significantly higher for the two groups boosted  with  IN  vaccine  (GMTs  303.4  -  392.9)  compared  with  the  two  groups  boosted  with  VT

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vaccine  (GMTs  92.4  -  127.7).  In  contrast  the  response  against  A/Vietnam  was  not  significantly different between groups.

The SPRs at Month 6 + 21 days were 85.4 % - 98.1 % and there were only marginal increases in seropositivity rates for all groups compared to Month 6 + 7 days. The SCRs against A/Vietnam and A/Indonesia were high at Month 6 + 21 days (83.3 % - 98.1 %). SPRs exceeded 70% to both strains in all groups. The SCFs exceeded 2.5 in all groups against A/Vietnam and A/Indonesia. Responses were very good even at 7 days post-boost but tended to be higher by 21 days after the dose was given.

Analyses  by  age  groups  indicated  generally  higher  responses  for  most  parameters  in  those  aged  &lt; 30 years compared to those aged &gt; 30 years at D42 and after a booster dose. There was less or no appreciable difference between subgroups aged 31-45 and 46-60 years.

The four groups that had been primed with non-adjuvanted vaccine received two doses of adjuvanted vaccine containing A/Indonesia/05/2005 at D0 and D21 of study 015. The booster dose consisted of 3.8 μ g HA regardless of the dose received for priming and blood samples were obtained at Days 0, 7, 14, 21, 35 and 42.

In this adult German population the pre-vaccination NA seropositivity rates against A/Vietnam ranged from 20- 33% but GMTs were ≤ 22.  Similarly, against A/Indonesia the baseline seropositivity rates ranged from 4.2% to 14.3% and GMTs were ≤ 20. At Day 42 the groups primed with two doses of VT vaccine showed increases in GMTs against both strains but the increment was greater for NA against the homologous strain. At Month 6, the GMTs were  similar  to  or  within  4-fold  the  baseline  GMTs.  At  Month  6  +  21  days  the  GMTs  against A/Indonesia were significantly (about 2-fold) higher in the groups boosted with IN vaccine compared to the groups boosted with VT vaccine. After one dose of VT vaccine the Day 21 SCR were from 50.0% to 71.4 % against A/Vietnam and from 9.1% to 36.4% against A/Indonesia. After two doses the Day 42 SCRs ranged from 91.5% to 95.5%  against  A/Vietnam  and  from  66.7%  to  73.7%  against  A/Indonesia.  At  Month  6  the seroconversion rates had dropped in all groups but were higher in groups primed with two doses than in groups primed with one dose. The  study  showed  that  two  doses  of  AS03-adjuvanted  vaccine  given  6  months  apart  elicited comparable immune responses after the second dose to two doses given 21 days apart. The potential advantage of a 2+1 regimen (i.e. D0, D21 and then a third dose later on) over a 1+1 regimen (i.e. a dose at D0 and a second dose later on) was that a higher level of protection might be expected between the second and third doses of a 2+1 regimen compared to the interval between doses in a 1+1 regimen. Study H5N1-015 This  was  the  boosting  phase  of  the  dose-finding  study  007.  Boosting  occurred  at  approximately 14 months  after  the  two  priming  doses.  Data  were  reported  at  day  21  post-boost  and  also  at  day 180 after boosting. The  four  dose  groups  that  had  been  primed  with  adjuvanted  vaccine  received  a  single  dose  of adjuvanted  vaccine  containing  A/Indonesia/05/2005.  The  booster  dose  consisted  of  3.8 μ g  HA regardless of the dose received for priming (i.e. 3.8, 7.5, 15 or 30 µg HA + AS03 adjuvant). Blood samples were obtained at Days 0, 7, 14 and 21 after the booster. Medicinal product no longer authorised

An additional control group (no previous doses of H5N1 vaccine) was enrolled into this study. This group received two doses of the same adjuvanted vaccine containing A/Indonesia/05/2005 as used for boosting  the  eight  groups  derived  from  study  007.  Doses  were  given  at  D0  and  D21  and  blood samples were obtained at D42.

The boosting phase enrolled 350 subjects 19-61 years of age (35 to 50 subjects per group).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the main analysis concerning the group primed with 3.8 μ g HA + AS03 the CHMP criteria were each exceeded at 21 days following the booster for HI responses to the booster homologous strain i.e. A/Indonesia. The HI responses to a single dose of IN vaccine strongly suggested that these subjects had been primed for A/Indonesia by vaccination 14 months earlier with two doses of VT vaccine.

- o At D0 in study 015 GMTs against A/Indonesia and against A/Vietnam were all low (&lt;10).
- o At Day 7 there were significant increases in GMTs against A/Indonesia in all except the control group with actual GMTs that were highest in the groups that had been primed with adjuvanted vaccine (118.5 to 193.3).
- o At Day 21 the GMTs against A/Indonesia were significantly higher in the four groups primed with adjuvanted vaccine (208.4 - 429.5) compared to those primed with non-adjuvanted vaccine and controls (31 - 77). There were no significant differences between the four dose groups primed with adjuvanted vaccine and no significant differences between the four dose groups primed with non-adjuvanted  vaccine. Therefore, priming with adjuvanted vaccine was  considered the important factor and not the HA dose administered.

The SCF against A/Indonesia was &gt; 2.5 in all previously vaccinated groups by day 7. The criterion was also exceeded at Day 14 in the Control group (2.7) and then increased greatly to 88.6 at Day 42. In  contrast  the  D42  SCF in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA without AS03 was about 10.Against A/Vietnam the &gt; 2.5 criterion was met in all primed groups at day 7 and at Day 28 in the Control group (6.3). SCFs for the group primed with 3.8 µg + AS03 (21.0 - 42.5) were significantly higher than for the corresponding non-adjuvanted dose group (3.7 - 10.3) and the Control group (1.1 - 6.5) at all time points.

The GMT against A/Indonesia in the Control group at Day 42 (443) was significantly higher than the  values  observed  at  Day  42  for  the  four  groups  that  had  been  primed  with  non-adjuvanted vaccine (54.3 - 141.4). This unexpected finding was not considered relevant for use of the MAH's adjuvanted vaccine but could have implications for interchangeability of vaccines in a pandemic situation. At  Day  7,  the  increases  in  GMTs  against  A/Vietnam  after  a  single  dose  of  adjuvanted  vaccine containing  A/Indonesia  were  significant  for  the  groups  primed  with  A/Vietnam  3.8  µg  HA  with  or without AS03. The actual GMT at day 7 was much higher in the former group (176.8 versus 20.8, respectively) and GMTs in this group remained higher at Day 14 (343.7) and Day 21 (352.8). The GMT reached  58.3  at  Day  42  (i.e.  21  days  after  the  second  dose)  in  the  group  primed  with  nonadjuvanted  vaccine.  The  GMT  for  the  control  group  began  to  rise  after  the  second  dose  to  reach 27.1 to  31.7  from  Day  28  up  to  Day  42.  In  line  with  the  low  GMTs  at  D0  of  study  015  the seropositivity rates for A/Indonesia were low (&lt; 10%) before the booster dose. SCRs against  A/Indonesia  exceeded  40%  at  Day  7  for  the  four  groups  that  had  been  primed  with adjuvanted vaccine (84.2 - 93.9 %) and in three groups primed with non-adjuvanted vaccine (44.7 % 60.7 %). The SCR at Day 7 was 35.3% in the group that had been primed with 3.8 µg HA without AS03 but reached 64.7% by day 14. The Control group achieved a SCR &gt; 40% at Day 21 (59.2 %) and by Day 42 the rate had reached 98.0 %. This compares with a SCR at D42 of about 64% in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA without AS03.Against A/Vietnam the SCR was 81.6% at Day 7 for the group primed with 3.8 µg + AS03 while the corresponding dose group primed with non-adjuvanted vaccine exceeded 40% at Day 14 (61.8 %). The threshold was only reached by the Control group after the second dose (Day 28 rate = 59.2 %). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The SPRs against A/Indonesia were all 0-3% at D0. The rate exceeded 70% in the four groups primed with adjuvanted vaccine by Day 7 (84.2 % - 93.9 %). The threshold was reached at Day 14 for groups primed with 7.5 µg HA alone (73.7 %) and 30 µg HA alone (75.0 %), at Day 35 for the group primed with 15 µg alone (71.9 %) and at Day 28 for the Control group (100%). The threshold was not reached for  the  group  primed  with  3.8  µg  alone  at  any  time-point.  SPRs  against  A/Vietnam  were  low  at D0 (0 % - 10.3 %) but had increased significantly by Day 7 in the groups primed with 3.8 µg HA with or without AS03.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A  significant  increase  in  SPR  was  observed  on  Day  28  in  the  Control  group.  However,  a SPR &gt; 70% was reached only in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA + AS03 (84.2 % at Day 7 and 89.7 % at Day 21).

NA titres were measured against A/Indonesia/05/2005 in the groups primed with 3.8 µg HA with or without AS03 and in the Control group. The D0 GMT was significantly higher in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA + AS03 (157.8) than in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA alone (47.0) and the Control group (19.9). At D21 significant increases in GMTs occurred in all groups to reach 3708.9, 692.4 and 307.3 in respective groups. At D42 there was a significant increase in GMT in the Control group only (to 1606.4). The actual GMT was higher than that (933.1) in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA alone and the 95% CI only just overlapped. This finding mirrors the unexpected HI findings noted above. All subjects in the group primed with 3.8 µg HA + AS03 were seropositive at Day 0 and 92% had a titre ≥ 1:80 compared to 35% in the group primed with non-adjuvanted HA and 6.1% of controls. All subjects  in  the  three  groups  were  seropositive  by  Day  21,  at  which  time  all  had  titres ≥ 1:80. Seroconversion rates for NA were all above 85.0 % and did not differ significantly between groups after one vaccination dose.

At Day 180 after the booster doses were given the HI results against A/Indonesia showed: · GMTs for the H5N1 AD groups (42.1 - 82.5) were higher than those observed for the H5N1 nonAD (17.6- 24.3) and Control groups (17.8). . · SCRs for the H5N1 AD groups (50.0 % - 75.0%) were higher than those observed for the H5N1 non-AD (30.0 %- 41.7%) and Control groups (32.6%). The &gt;40% SCR threshold was exceeded in all H5N1 AD groups and in the H5N1 15µg and H5N1 30 µg groups. · SPRs for the H5N1 AD groups (50.0 % - 75.8%) were higher than those observed for the H5N1 non-AD  (30.0%-  41.7%)  and  Control  groups  (32.6%).  The  &gt;70%  SPR  threshold  was  only maintained in the H5N1 7.5AD and H5N1 30AD groups. · SCFs  &gt;2.5  were  maintained  in  all  groups  but  were  markedly  higher  in  the  H5N1  AD  groups (7.9-15) compared to H5N1 non-AD (3.3-4.9) and Control (3.6) groups. The HI antibody titres against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were measured at D180 only in the H5N1 3.8, H5N1 3.8AD and control groups. The GMT for group H5N1 3.8AD (192.8) was higher than those for the H5N1 3.8 (27.5) and Control groups (7.8). The SCR for group H5N1 3.8AD (78.9%) was higher than those for the H5N1 3.8 (51.4%) and Control (6.5%) groups. Thus the &gt;40% SCR threshold was exceeded in the H5N1 3.8AD and H5N1 3.8 groups. The SPR for group H5N1 3.8AD (84.6%) was higher than those for the H5N1 3.8 (51.4%) and Control (6.5%) groups. Thus the &gt;70% SPR threshold was only exceeded in the H5N1 3.8AD group. The SCF threshold was exceeded in the H5N1 3.8 (4.9) and H5N1 3.8AD (21.6) groups but not in the Control group (1.5).Neutralising antibody titres were measured  at  D180  against  A/Indonesia/05/2005  in  the  H5N1  3.8AD,  H5N1  3.8  and  Control groups.The GMT observed for the H5N1 3.8AD (1422.2) group was higher than that observed for the H5N1 3.8 (502.3) and Control (751.3) groups. The SCRs for groups H5N1 3.8 and H5N1 3.8AD were 78.4%-82.9% and were lower than the SCR observed in the Control group (95.7%). The  results  from  this  boosting  phase  supported  the  conclusions  of  study  012  in  supporting  the administration of a single dose of IN vaccine to subjects who previously received one or two doses of VT vaccine.

## H5N1-010

This open label study compared administration of two single or two double doses on D0 and on D21 to subjects aged 61 years and above. Double doses were given as two injections of the licensed vaccine i.e .  one  injection  into  each  arm.  The  comparative  groups  received  single  or  double  doses  of  nonadjuvanted vaccine of the same HA content. Randomisation was 3:1 for adjuvanted:non-adjuvanted vaccine regardless of the HA dose.

The  study  planned  to  enrol  480  subjects  aged  61  years  and  above  (no  upper  age  limit).  At randomisation  subjects  in  each  group  were  stratified  by  age  group:  61-65  years,  66-70  years  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

&gt;70 years with the allocation ratio 1:1:1. The number of subjects was low in each of the age strata above 71 years of age. The study actually enrolled 437 subjects 61-89 years of age.

All subjects not previously vaccinated with an influenza vaccine for the 2006-2007 season received Fluarix (a split virion, inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine) at least 3 weeks before D0 in order to help standardise any effect of prior seasonal influenza vaccination on responses to H5N1 vaccine.

Prior to vaccination, 151/395 (38.2%) subjects were seropositive for HI antibody against A/Vietnam/1194/2004  but  only  8/395  (2%)  subjects  were  seropositive  against  A/Indonesia/5/2005. Pre-vaccination GMTs were low (8.8-11.3 and 5.0-5.2 against respective strains).

The GMTs against A/Vietnam increased significantly in the adjuvanted groups at D21 (50.0-69.4) and at D42 (126.8-237.3) but there were only small increments in the non-adjuvanted groups. At D42 the GMT was significantly higher in the 7.5 µg HA + AS03 group compared to the 3.8 µg HA + AS03 group.

SCFs exceeded 2.0 against A/Vietnam in three of the four groups at D21 and by all groups at D42. Values  were  higher  in  the  adjuvanted  vaccine  groups  and  significantly  higher  in  the  7.5  µg HA + AS03 group compared to the 3.8 µg HA + AS03 group. The threshold was only reached against A/Indonesia in the  adjuvanted  groups  at  D42  and  again  there  was  an  advantage  for  the  higher  HA dose. When analysed according to initial serostatus to A/Vietnam, the threshold was reached by all groups at D42 except in the initially seropositive subset that received non-adjuvanted 3.8 µg HA.

The GMTs against A/Indonesia increased significantly compared to Day 0 after each vaccination dose only in the adjuvanted groups. At D42 the GMT and the seropositivity rate were significantly higher in the 7.5 µg HA + AS03 group compared to the 3.8 µg HA + AS03 group. Based  on  GMTs  a  clear  adjuvant  effect  was  demonstrated  at  D42  for  HI  responses  in  the  single injection  and  double  injection  groups  against  A/Vietnam  and  A/Indonesia.  There  was  also  a  dose effect between the two adjuvanted groups at D42 for HI responses to both strains. In contrast there was no  significant  dose  effect  between  the  two  non-adjuvanted  groups.  By  D180  the  GMT  values  had decreased  compared  to  Day  42  but  were  higher  in  the  adjuvanted  vaccine  groups  although  the difference  was  notable  only  for  antibody  against  A/Vietnam.  In  addition,  the  GMT  for  HI  against A/Vietnam was higher in the group that had received a double dose of vaccine at each of D0 and D21 although the 95% CI overlapped. The  SCR  against  A/Vietnam  was  &gt;30%  in  the  two  adjuvanted  vaccine  groups  at  D21  (45.4%  and 52.4%) and increased significantly again at D42 (72.4% and 88.3%) with an advantage in the 7.5 µg HA + AS03 group  compared  to  the  3.8  µg  HA  +  AS03  group.  The  30%  SCR  threshold  was  not reached  in  the  non-adjuvanted  groups.  Against  A/Indonesia  the  threshold  was  reached  only  in  the group that received 7.5 µg HA  + AS03 and only at D42. A higher response against A/Vietnam/194/2004 was also observed in the adjuvanted groups at Day 180. The CHMP criteria for SCR was met in the 3.8/AS and 7.5/AS groups at D180. In contrast there was no dose effect between the two non-adjuvanted groups. Since 38% of subjects in this older population were seropositive against A/Vietnam at D0 the SCRs were analysed according to baseline serostatus. The SCR was &gt;30% in the adjuvanted vaccine groups at  D21  (44.4%  and  55.8%)  regardless  of  the  pre-vaccination  immune  status.  The  SCR  increased significantly further (to reach 73.3% and 94.6%) at D42 for subjects in the adjuvanted vaccine groups who were seronegative to A/Vietnam before vaccination and was significantly higher in the group that received  the  double  dose.  In  the  non-adjuvanted  groups  the  30%  threshold  was  only  reached  by initially seropositive subjects in the double dose group at D42. Medicinal product no longer authorised

As for SCR, higher responses were observed against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the adjuvanted groups. The CHMP criteria for SCF was still met in the 3.8/AS and 7.5/AS groups at D180. In contrast there was no dose effect between the two non-adjuvanted groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SPRs  were  &gt;60%  against  A/Vietnam  at  D21  in  both  adjuvanted  groups  (61.2%  and  62.1%)  with further  significant  increases  at  D42  (83.6%  and  95.9%).  The  threshold  was  not  met  in  the  nonadjuvanted groups. The SPRs against A/Indonesia were low at D21 in the adjuvanted groups (3.3% 9.0%) and increased to 23% - 41% at D42.

In the initially seropositive subset there were significant increases in SPRs at D21 in the adjuvanted groups  and  the  double  dose  non-adjuvanted  group  (85.5%,  82.7%  and  68.8%,  respectively).  In  the single  dose  non-adjuvanted  group  the  rate  reached  42.9%.  There  were  only  modest  increments between  D21  and  D42  in  these  groups.  In  the  initially  seronegative  subset  the  D21  SPRs  were 14.3%-50.5%. At D42 the threshold was reached in the two adjuvanted vaccine groups (73.3% and 94.6%)  and  the  rate  was  significantly  higher  in  the  7.5 µg  HA  +  AS03  group  compared  to  the 3.8 µg HA + AS03 group.

The  additional  data  on  HI  and  NA  at  D180  from  H5N1-010  showed  a  continued  advantage  for adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted vaccine and a numerical advantage for a double dose of adjuvanted vaccine  versus  a  single  dose  based  on  application  of  the  CHMP  criteria  to  the  HI  data  and  on comparison of NA data generated in a subset. However, the SCR and SCF criteria were still met in both adjuvanted dose groups and the only appreciable difference was that the double dose group still met (just) the SPR criterion while the single dose group did not.

At  Day  180,  the  criterion  for  SPR  for  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  was  met  for  the  7.5/AS  group (69.5% compared to 52.9% in the single dose group). The criterion was not met in the non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. Neutralising antibody titres were measured at D0 and D42 against A/Indonesia/5/2005 only and in a subset of subjects from the adjuvanted groups. In this older population a high proportion of subjects were already seropositive for NA to A/Indonesia before vaccination (65.5% and 58.5%). Nevertheless at  D42  the  rates  had  increased  to  94.3%  and  100%).  The  D0  GMTs  were  similar  and  increased significantly at D42 as shown below. The 7.5 µg HA + AS03 group showed a higher GMT and greater percentage with titres of 1:40 and 1:80 compared to the 3.8 µg HA + AS03 group. The NA response against A/Indonesia/5/2005 observed six months after the primary vaccination series paralleled the HI responses in the adjuvanted groups. Overall the study showed a trend of increased seropositivity with age against A/Vietnam/1194/2004, especially for subjects aged above 80 years where about 60% of subjects were seropositive by HI at baseline  in  each  treatment  group,  noting  that  the  denominators  were  small.  In  contrast  the  prevaccination  seropositivity  rates  for  HI  against  A/Indonesia/05/2005  were  negligible  across  the different groups and no effect of age was evident. There was also a trend to lower immune responses as  age  increased  and  those  subjects  aged  &gt;  80  years  who  were  seronegative  before  vaccination required tow double doses to reach the CHMP criteria. However, numbers are very small. The study demonstrated overall that 3.8 µg HA + AS03 administered at D0 and again at D21 elicited HI antibody responses directed  against  homologous  virus  at  D42  that  met  the  three  CHMP  criteria applicable to subjects aged &gt; 60 years and also met the criteria applicable to subjects aged from 18-60 years. In addition, all three criteria were met at D42 regardless of baseline serostatus and two were met at D21 in the subset that was seronegative at baseline (the exception was the SPR). However, the data obtained at D42 indicated a numerical advantage for administration of two doses at D0 and another two doses at D21 when compared to the recommended regimen. This overall advantage for double doses was mainly driven by results in the previously seronegative sub-population. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## H5N1-009(-022/-023)

This  open  label  study  conducted  in  Spain  provided  immunogenicity  and  safety  data  of  Pandemrix (H5N1) administered as a two-dose primary series (0, 21 days) to children aged 3-9 years. The study was divided into three parts as shown below:

Subjects from each group were enrolled sequentially into the two age strata (6-9 years and then 3-5 years) with the ratio 1:1. Prior exposure to seasonal influenza vaccine was not an exclusion criterion but subjects were expected not to receive seasonal influenza vaccine during the planned duration of the study (to Month 24).

- o In Phase A randomisation was to half the adult dose (1.9 µg of HA) + half the AS03 or to Fluarix
- o In Phase B and Phase C randomisation was to (allocation ratio 3:1) full HA/half AS03 (Phase B) or to the adult dose (Phase C) with a Fluarix control group.

In the Fluarix group no subject seroconverted for HI  antibody  to  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  or A/Indonesia/05/2005 and no subject was seroprotected.

The study enrolled 405 subjects of which 388 completed to D42. Phase A The pre-vaccination HI GMTs for A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 were &lt;1:10 and so seropositivity  rates  were  zero.  On  Day  21,  the  GMTs  against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  strain  were slightly  increased  in  the  Half  HA/Half  AS03  group  in  both  age  strata  and  then  increased  markedly after the second dose (540.3 for 6-9 years; 392.7 for 3-5 years). A similar pattern but lower response was  seen  against  A/Indonesia/05/2005  (60.8  for  6-9  years;  53.5  for  3-5  years).  Increments  in seropositivity  rates  followed  the  GMTs  for  the  AS03  vaccine  group  but  in  the  control  group  the seropositivity  rates  against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  and  A/Indonesia/05/2005  strains  were  zero  at  all time points. In the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine group ¾ By Day 42 the SCRs and the SPRs against the vaccine strain were 95.9% to 100% while SCRs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 were 71.4% to 74.4 %. The ≥ 70% threshold for the lower bound of the  95%  CI  for  seroprotection  as  defined  in  the  CBER  Guidance  was  only  met  for  HI  against A/Vietnam/1194/2004. ¾ On  Day  42  the  SCFs  against  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  were  78.5  and  108.1  while  SCFs  against A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain were 10.7 and 12.2.

On Day 42 the NA GMTs against the A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the Half HA/Half AS03 group had reached  1155.1  in  the  6-9  years  age  stratum  and  1044.4  in  the  3-5  years  age  stratum,  whereas  the increase from baseline in the control group was very small (104.5 for 6-9 years; 158.4 for 3-5 years). The NA seropositivity rates against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the Half HA/Half AS03 group increased to 90.7% in the 6-9 years age stratum and to 91.7% in the 3-5 years age stratum on Day 21, with nonoverlapping CIs (when compared with Day 0). All subjects in the Half HA/Half AS03 group were seropositive for NA at D42. In the control group, the seropositivity rates for NA against the vaccine strain on Days 21 and 42 were within the same range (78.6% - 80.0%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

On Day 21 there were no significant differences between the Half HA/Half AS03 and control groups or between the age strata within each group for NA SCRs against the vaccine strain (range 65.1% 67.4% for Half HA/Half AS03 group and 42.9% - 71.4% for control group). On Day 42 the NA SCR against the vaccine strain in the Half HA/Half AS03 group had reached 100% in the 6-9 years age stratum and 95.6% in the 3-5 years age stratum. In contrast there was no further increment in SCRs in the control group after a second dose of Fluarix.

## Phase B

The pre-vaccination HI GMTs for antibody against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 were &lt;1:10 in all vaccine groups and age strata except for one subject in the 3-5 years cohort. Thus seropositivity rates were 0.0% to 2.4%. By Day 42 GMTs for HI against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in the AS03 vaccine group were 615.8 for 6-9 years and 678.1 for 3-5 years age groups and reached 64.9 to 73.7  against  A/Indonesia  but  were  still  below  the  cut-off  value  in  the  control  group.  Seropositivity rates followed the same pattern as the GMTs.

In the control group, the seropositivity rates against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 were zero at all time points except for one subject who was seropositive after the first Fluarix dose. All corresponding GMTs were low or below the cut-off value.

In the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine group: On Day 42 the SCRs and SPRs against the vaccine strain had reached 97.8% for subjects aged 6-9 years  and  97.6%  for  subjects  aged  3-5  years.  SCRs  and  SPRs  against  A/Indonesia/05/2005  had increased to 68.9% and 76.2% in respective age groups. The ≥ 70% threshold for the lower bound of the  95%  CI  for  seroprotection  as  defined  in  the  CBER  Guidance  was  met  for  HI  against A/Vietnam/1194/2004. At Day 42 the SCFs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were 123.2 for 6-9 years and 132.3 for 3-5 years. The increments in SCFs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain were relatively modest (13.0 and 14.7). In the Fluarix group: No subject  seroconverted  for  HI  antibody  to  A/Vietnam/1194/2004  or  A/Indonesia/05/2005  and  no subject was seroprotected. The pre-vaccination NA GMTs were ≥ 1:28 and were 25.6 to 65.5 while baseline seropositivity rates ranged from 47.1% to 78.6%. On Day 42 GMTs exceeded 1500 in the AS03 group but there was a negligible increase in the control group. The seropositivity rates and seroconversion rates followed the same pattern as the GMTs. Phase C The pre-vaccination GMTs for HI antibody against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Indonesia/05/2005 were &lt;1:10 regardless of age stratum or vaccine group and so seropositivity rates were zero. Day 21 HI GMTs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were slightly increased in the AS03 vaccine group in both age strata  and  by  Day  42  they  had  reached  883.5 for  6-9  years  and  956.4  for  3-5  years.  HI  GMTs against A/Indonesia/05/2005 in the AS03 group were also much higher at D42 (92.5 for 6-9 years; 167.9 for 3-5 years) compared with D21. Corresponding seropositivity rates followed a similar pattern and by D42 all subjects in both age strata were seropositive against A/Vietnam while rates against A/Indonesia/05/2005 had reached 83.7% in the 6-9 years age stratum and 95.5% in the 3-5 years age stratum.

## In the AS03 vaccine group:

By Day 42 SCRs and SPRs were 100% for both age strata against A/Vietnam and 79.1% to 95.5% against A/Indonesia. The ≥ 70% threshold for the lower bound of the 95% CI for seroprotection as defined in the CBER Guidance was met for HI antibody against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 in both age strata  and  was  met  against  A/Indonesia/05/2005  in  the  3-5  year  age  stratum.  On  Day  42  the  SCFs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 were 176.7 and 191.3 compared to 18.5 and 33.6 against A/Indonesia/05/2005.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## In the Fluarix group:

No subject seroconverted for HI against either strain and none was seroprotected with the exception of one subject with a response to A/Vietnam/1194/2004 on Day 21 only.

Pre-vaccination NA GMTs were ≥ 1:28 and were generally comparable between the age strata (range 25.6 to 37.3). Despite the low GMTs, the baseline seropositivity rates ranged from 30.8% to 46.7%. By Day 42 NA GMTs against A/Vietnam/1194/2004 increased about 10-fold in the AS03 group in both age strata and all children were seropositive whereas there was no further increase in GMTs in the control group and the seropositivity rates ranged from 61.5% to 87.5%. The seroconversion rates also showed the marked differences between AS03 and control for both age strata.

Comparison between the three formulations at D42 There was a trend for higher HI GMTs and SCFs against both strains and a higher NA GMT against the vaccine strain with the formulations tested in Phases C and B compared to Phase A. The immune response  tended  to  be  higher  in  Phase  C  when  compared  with  Phase  B.  When  comparing  the formulation used in Phase C or in Phase B with that used in Phase A the difference between A and C was marked whereas the difference between A and B was much less apparent. There were advantages for C over B for HI and NA GMTs and for HI responses to A/Indonesia. NA was not assessed against A/Indonesia. Immunogenicity data at Month 6 By Month 6 the HI GMTS had fallen but were still at least 6-fold higher  than  the  pre-vaccination GMTs in the groups that had received AS03 vaccines. In the Fluarix groups in each Part of the study there was no difference between the D0 and the Month 6 HI seropositivity rates and GMTs against either A/Vietnam or A/Indonesia in 3-5 year-olds or 6-9 year-olds. Therefore there was no evidence of any  augmentation  of  the  HI  immune  response  as  a  result  of  intervening  natural  exposure  to  crossreacting antigens between D42 and Month 6. Against A/Vietnam the SPRs at Month 6 in children who received the adult dose vaccine in Part C of the study were 82.8% for 3-5 year-olds and 78% for 6-9 year-olds. These rates compare with 56% and 63.6%  in  respective  age  groups  who  received  the  half/half  vaccine  in  Part  A  and  with  70.2%  and 68.9% who received full dose HA and half AS03 in Part B. The 95% CI overlap between Parts A, B and C within each age stratum. The results for the other parameters shown follow a similar pattern. Against the heterologous A/Indonesia strain 69% of children aged 3 to 5 years who had received the adult dose were seroprotected at Month 6 compared to 6.0% from Part A and 48.9% from Part B of the study. Corresponding rates in children aged 6 to 9 years were 61% versus 4.5% and 26.7%. NA was assessed against A/Vietnam at Month 6 in Part A of the study (i.e. half adult dose versus Fluarix). In the AS03 vaccine group the NA GMTs dropped to a similar degree in both age strata so that, as at D42 (GMTs 1026 and 1111), the actual GMTs at D180 were comparable for children aged 3-5 years and 6-9 years (776 and 759). At Month 6 all children who had received the AS03 vaccine had NA titres of at least 1:80. However, in the Fluarix group the GMTs increased between D42 and D180. In the younger age group (3-5 years) the increment was small (from 166 to 200) but is none the less remarkable since a drop in GMT would usually have been expected. In the older age group (6-9 years) the increase was by 6-fold (from 75 at D42 to 482 at D180). These results suggest that natural exposure to cross-reacting antigens had occurred in the interim period. As a result the seroconversion rates in the 6-9 year-olds at Month 6 were 95% for the AS03 group and 93% for the Fluarix group. Also, all children aged 6-9 years who received Fluarix had NA titres of at least 1:80 at Month 6, while the corresponding rate in the 3-5 year-olds was 80%. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Additionally, NA against the heterologous A/Indonesia strain was measured up to 12 months in the Part A of the study (i.e. half adult dose versus Fluarix). NA titres of at least 1/80 in the 3-5 years age group were observed in 97.8% at Day 42, 89.6% at Month 6 and 87.2% at Month 12, Corresponding rates in the 6-9 years age group were  97.6% at Day 42, 90.0% at Month 6 and 82.9% at Month 12.

In Parts A, B and C of study 009 (-22/023) in children aged 3-9 years the D42 HI immune response parameters  (SCR,  SPR,  SCF)  did  not  clearly  distinguish  any  one  of  the  three  formulations  tested. However, the administration of a higher HA dose and, especially, the full adult dose, demonstrated advantages in terms of several HI and NA immune parameters. In particular, use of the adult dose gave improved HI responses to the heterologous strain and much higher NA GMTs.

At Month 6 the HI data showed a clear advantage for the full adult dose in terms of persistence of vaccine-homologous and especially vaccine-heterologous HI immune responses.

However, the NA data from Part A of the study against A/Vietnam and A/Indonesia showed that all in this dose group still had titres of at least 1:80 against A/Vietnam at 6 months and &gt;80% against A/Indonesia at Month 12. These results were contrary to the HI data. On the basis of the D42 HI data and the Month 6 and 12 NA data, taken together with the relative safety profile of the three dose groups (see below) the CHMP considered that the SPC should recommend that half the adult dose (i.e.  two doses of 0.25 ml) should be administered to children aged from 6 months to 9 years until such time that data in children with the H1N1v vaccine become available.

Study with a preliminary version of Pandemrix A(H1N1)v An abridged report on the data from study H1N1-021 was submitted during the Rolling Review of the data for Pandemrix A(H1N1)v. This observer-blinded study is ongoing in three centres in Germany to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity  of a two-dose schedule of the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like  candidate  vaccine  adjuvanted  with  AS03  in  adults  aged  18  to  60  years.  The  study compares the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine to a non adjuvanted vaccine containing 15 μ g  HA  from  the same strain. Subjects were randomised (1:1) to one of the two study groups and stratified by age: between 18 and 40 years inclusive, above 41 to 50 years inclusive and above 51 to 60 years inclusive (ratio 2:1:1). The data were reported after administration of the first dose of study vaccine i.e. blood samples taken at 21 days after the first dose. At  the  time  the  clinical  material  was  produced,  the  antigen  bulk  was  formulated  based  on  HPLC measurements prior to availability of the official SRD reagents.  Subsequently, it was determined that the actual HA content of one vaccine dose was 5.25 μ g instead of 3.75 μ g (i.e. an increase of 40%); likewise, the non adjuvanted dose was 21 μ g. The study enrolled 130 subjects and they all received the first dose of vaccine. Before the vaccination, the percentage of seropositive subjects was higher in younger age stratum (44.6% in the 18-40 years group and 29% in 51-60 years). The proportion of subjects seropositive before vaccination did not differ between group A (H1N1 AS03 adjuvanted vaccine) and group B (H1N1 plain vaccine).

At Day 21 the HI SCR observed in the H1N1 +AS03 group was 98.4%. SCF and SPR were 41.4 and 98.4%, respectively.  In the H1N1 group, the SCR was 95.5%, the SCF was 41.4 and the SPR was 97.0%.    The  CHMP  criteria  were  met  in  both  age  strata  (18-40  years  and  41-60  years)  with  no appreciable differences between the age strata.

The  HI  immune  responses  observed  at  Day  21  were  comparable  between  treatment  groups,  which demonstrated the antigen-sparing capacity of the AS03A-adjuvanted vaccine.

While the preliminary results from this study, which did not use final formulation vaccine, need to be viewed with some caution the responses to a single dose of unadjuvanted vaccine are very comparable

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with those now reported from several other companies with similar products. The comparison between the two vaccine groups at D21 demonstrates the antigen-sparing effect of the AS03 adjuvant.

The contrast between the post-dose 1 results of this study and all the data obtained with the H5N1 mock-up vaccine is stark but is in line with observations made by other manufacturers. It is clear that the  response to a single dose of A(H1N1)v vaccine is very different and markedly higher than was ever observed with the corresponding H5N1 constructs.

This phenomenon is observed regardless of prior vaccination and suggests that there is some natural priming with respect to the pandemic strain as a result of natural exposure to cross-reacting antigens at least in adults. Very early data reported from the US with a different vaccine suggest that the same situation may apply to adolescents although it remains possible for this vaccine two doses are needed for children aged &lt; 11-12 years.

The CHMP considered that it was important to include these preliminary data in the SPC to indicate that  a  single  dose  may  be  sufficient  in  adults.  Confirmatory  data  from  ongoing  studies  with  final formulation  pandemic vaccine are awaited. For now, results after a single dose in adults cannot be extrapolated to children. Definitive data are needed from ongoing studies to establish if a single dose could be sufficient in adolescents and in younger children. Clinical safety This section will first describe the safety data available before approval of the core dossier application and then the additional safety data from studies reviewed after first approval. In general all studies involved recording of solicited symptoms during the 7-day follow-up period after each  dose  together  with  any  analgesics  and/or  antipyretics  taken.  Unsolicited  symptoms  occurring during a 21-day follow-up period after the first vaccination and 30 days after the second one were also recorded in the CRF. · Patient exposure Overall,  4,002  healthy  subjects  (minimum  age  18  years)  were  exposed  to  H5N1  AS03  adjuvanted vaccine in studies 007 and 008 i.e. total across all doses. More than 3800 of these subjects received an HA dose ≥ 15 µg i.e. at least 4-fold the HA dose in the intended marketed formulation. Another 961 subjects aged 18-60 years received at least one dose of Third series 3.8 μ g/AS03 vaccine in study 002 and were included in the safety evaluation. Additional numbers have been exposed in studies reported after first approval of the core dossier as detailed below. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## · Adverse events

## H5N1-007

The incidence of symptoms, and in particular local symptoms, was higher in the groups vaccinated with adjuvanted formulations. No significant effect of the antigen dose or consistent trend by dose was observed on the overall incidence of symptoms among the adjuvanted vaccines.

In contrast, the incidences of severe symptoms were low and variable across groups with no obvious dose trends. However, the highest rates were seen with one or more of the adjuvanted formulations.

## Solicited severe AEs within 7 days overall by subject

Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local symptom in all groups (e.g. 86% in the 3.8 µg/AS03 group). The incidence was significantly higher in groups given adjuvanted vaccines (8692% after dose 1 and 69-80% after dose 2 compared to 28-50% and 22-40% after respective doses in the groups given non-adjuvanted vaccines). There was also a trend for higher incidences of swelling and redness in groups with adjuvanted vaccines and the rate of induration was significantly higher in adjuvanted groups. However, severe swelling, redness and induration were all reported at low rates. The most frequently reported general symptoms were fatigue and headache. For all of the solicited general symptoms there was at least a trend for higher incidence in groups that received adjuvanted vaccines. For example, myalgia reported as being vaccine-related was reported for 10-20% in the nonadjuvanted vaccine groups but 36-44.9% with adjuvanted vaccines. Fever was reported with a very low incidence in all groups and no fever above 39°C was reported. Lymphadenopathy followed administration of 7.5 µg HA (3 cases), 15 µg HA (3 cases) and 30 µg HA (1 case) adjuvanted vaccines. Six of these 7 cases were considered to be related to vaccination. No reports  of  local  lymph  node  swelling  were  of  grade  3  severity  and  all  subjects  recovered  without sequelae. H5N1-008 The highest incidence of any severe symptom after vaccination with 15 µg/AS03 vaccine (16.3%) was reported by subjects aged 18 to 60 years after the first dose. After the first injection, severe symptoms were  reported  more  frequently  in  subjects  aged  18-60  years  than  in  those  &gt;  60  years  but  after  the second injection  there  was  little  difference  between  the  age  strata.  Severe  symptoms  were  reported with a significantly lower incidence in subjects vaccinated with Fluarix and placebo. Among solicited local symptoms pain was the most frequently reported AE in both treatment groups and age strata but was reported with a significantly higher incidence in subjects vaccinated with 15 µg/AS03 than  in  subjects  vaccinated  with  Fluarix  or  placebo.  Pain  was  predominantly  reported  by subjects aged between 18 and 60 years. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In  both  vaccine  groups  subjects  aged  18  -  60  years  more  frequently  reported  unsolicited  symptoms than  those  aged  &gt;  60  years.  The  most  common  symptoms  were  injection  site  pruritus  and  warmth, influenza like illness and related symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhoea, nausea). There were 95 AE reports coded as the MedDRA preferred terms lymphadenopathy, lymph node pain or lymphadenitis,  of  which  84/95  occurred  in  the  15µg/AS03  group.  These  subjects  were  more  likely than others to report other general symptoms. Based on the MAH's assessment from D51 to D180 there were 16 subjects in the 15µg/AS03 group and three in the Fluarix group who reported 17 and 3 unsolicited symptoms, respectively, classified as new onset chronic diseases (NOCD). There was no clear disease pattern identified. Summary of new onset chronic diseases (GSK assessment) reported (Total vaccinated cohort) HN AS03 = H5N1 15µg HA + AS03, Fluarix = Fluarix/ (Placebo at the 2 nd  dose) s18     = 18-60 years, s61     = 61-120 years * Symptoms reported by a subject after a given dose and classified by the same Preferred Term are counted once Also, 64 subjects in the 15µg/AS03 group and 14 in the Fluarix group reported 75 and 17 unsolicited symptoms, respectively, classified as medically significant conditions.

## H5N1-002

There  were  no  consistent  differences  in  AEs  reported  in  this  study  with  final  formulation  vaccine compared to those reported with the 3.8 µg/AS03 vaccine used in study 007.

The next table shows the incidence of solicited local symptoms over the 7-day follow-up period after vaccination overall by subject. Subjects in the adjuvanted groups frequently reported pain, swelling and redness with generally similar rates across the four groups. Rates were much lower in the nonadjuvanted vaccine groups in which no grade 3 local symptoms were reported.

Unsolicited symptoms were reported by 383 subjects with rates across all six groups in the range 2835%.  The  most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  symptoms  tended  to  be  associated  with  likely intercurrent  illnesses  affecting  the  respiratory  and  gastrointestinal  tracts  and  so  were  very  varied  in nature.

For  solicited  general  symptoms  myalgia  and  fatigue  were  reported  frequently  by  subjects  in  the adjuvanted vaccine groups (myalgia in &gt; 60% in adjuvanted groups but 20-30% in non-adjuvanted; fatigue in 50-60% compared to 30-40%). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  incidence  of  all  and  Grade  3  (severe)  solicited  and  unsolicited  symptoms  reported  during  the 7-day  post-vaccination  period  did  not  differ  significantly  between  groups  after  the  first  and  second priming doses or the Month 6 booster. In addition, there does not appear to be any consistent pattern for  higher  or  lower  rates  of  symptoms  with  sequential  doses  or  between  VT  and  IN  booster  doses. Similar findings applied for all and Grade 3 symptoms considered causally related to vaccine. Pain at

the injection site was the most frequently reported solicited symptom in all groups (80.7 % to 89.4 % overall per dose; Grade 3 symptoms 2.6% to 7.8 % overall per dose).

The most commonly reported solicited general adverse event (AEs) following the booster dose (i.e. dose 2 or 3) were myalgia (36.1% - 46.8% after the last primary dose and 49.1% - 62.1% after the booster dose), headache (27.3% - 40.3% and 38.6 % - 48.3 %) and fatigue (34.4 % - 43.8 % and 40.4 % - 51.7 %). No significant difference in the incidence of grade 3 solicited general symptoms was observed between the primary and booster doses.

## H5N1-015

The  incidences  of  all  and  Grade  3,  considered  related  and  unrelated  solicited  and  unsolicited symptoms reported during the 7-day post-vaccination period did not differ significantly between the nine groups (i.e. eight previously primed with adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted vaccine and the Control group) after the first  dose  or  between  the  five  groups  that  received  a  second  dose.  The  majority  of local and general symptoms were considered to be related to vaccination in all study groups.Rates for local symptoms (very predominantly due to the incidence of injection site pain) were higher than for general  symptoms.Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported solicited symptom. While there  was  no  significant  difference  between  the  groups  the  rates  in  the  groups  primed  with  nonadjuvanted vaccine and the Control group ranged from 77.8 % to 89.9 % overall per dose compared to 88.9 % to 97.2 % in the groups primed with adjuvanted vaccine. Grade 3 pain occurred in 0.0 % to 3.0 % overall per dose and in 0.0 % to 2.8 % in respective priming groups. The  additional  information  from  studies  H5N1-012  and  -015  did  not  raise  any  new  issues  for  the safety profile of AS03-adjuvanted vaccine containing either A/Vietnam or A/Indonesia. No consistent pattern for higher or lower rates of symptoms with sequential doses or between VT and IN booster doses could be observed. Similar findings applied for all and Grade 3 symptoms considered causally related to vaccine. In these studies pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported solicited symptom in all groups. The most commonly reported solicited general AEs following booster doses  also  showed  a  similar  pattern  to  that  described  previously  after  the  first  and  second  priming doses with A/Vietnam vaccine. In  this  study  the  numbers  of  unsolicited  AEs  reported  were  higher  in  the  groups  primed  with  nonadjuvanted  vaccine  compared  to  those  primed  with  adjuvanted  vaccine.  The  highest  numbers  of reports  came  from  the  Control  group.  A  review  of  the  detailed  data  suggested  that  much  of  the difference might reflect higher rates of reporting headache in the groups primed with non-adjuvanted vaccine and the Control group. In answers to list of questions the MAH justified that the observation made reflected an imbalanced number of vaccine administrations between groups and the duration of the  respective  follow-up  periods.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  data  should  not  be  interpreted  as indicating high rates of reporting headache in the groups primed with non-adjuvanted vaccine and in the Control group.

The  incidence  of  symptoms,  and  especially  local  symptoms,  was  higher  in  groups  that  received adjuvanted  vaccine  compared  to  those  given  non-adjuvanted  vaccine.  There  were  also  more  local solicited symptoms causally related to vaccination in the adjuvanted groups than the non-adjuvanted groups following each dose and overall. Subjects in the non-adjuvanted groups reported more general than  local  symptoms  whereas  the  reverse  reporting  pattern  applied  in  the  two  adjuvanted  vaccine groups.  However,  there  were  few  Grade  3  local  and  general  solicited  symptoms  reported  and  no significant difference in reporting of grade 3 symptoms was observed between groups.

Rates of reporting local symptoms of pain, redness and swelling were significantly higher in the 3.8 µg  HA  +  AS03  group  than  in  the  3.8  µg  HA  alone  group.  Pain  and  redness  also  occurred  at  a significantly higher rate in the group given 7.5 µg HA + AS03 compared to the group that received 7.5 µg HA alone. Between the adjuvanted groups the effect of dose of HA on rates of local symptoms was not consistent although slightly higher rates of pain and redness were seen in the double dose group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Up to D51 there were no Grade 3 local solicited symptoms reported in the non-adjuvanted groups and there  were  only  three  subjects  with  grade  3  local  solicited  symptoms  in  the  adjuvanted  groups  (all were in the 7.5 µg HA + AS03 group; 2 with Grade 3 pain, 1 with grade 3 redness).

Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local symptom in the adjuvanted vaccine groups after each administration, followed by redness, swelling, induration and ecchymosis. However, there  was  no  consistent  increase  in  the  incidence  of  local  solicited  symptoms  of  any  type  or  grade between Dose 1 and Dose 2. Furthermore, it was noted that:

- z Fatigue was the most frequently reported general symptom in the adjuvanted vaccine groups (12.9% to 17.3% compared to 7-8% in the non-adjuvanted vaccine groups) but rates of Grade 3 fatigue were &lt; 2%.

z Headache was reported in 10.8% to 14.4% compared to 2-7% in respective groups but the rates for Grade 3 headache were &lt; 1%. z Myalgia was also more frequently reported in the adjuvanted vaccine groups (8.6% to 11.5% compared to 4-5%) but rates of Grade 3 myalgia were &lt; 1.5%. z Rates  of  other  general  symptoms,  including  fever,  were  low  but  usually  higher  in  the adjuvanted vaccine groups. z In general, the results of the biochemical analysis were within the normal range except that up to 28.2% showed elevated blood urea nitrogen values. Overall, there were no new concerns or unexpected findings in the safety data obtained from this older population.  As expected from previous studies in younger adults the incidence of symptoms (local in particular) was higher in the adjuvanted vaccine groups than in the non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. The  effect  of  dose  was  not  detectable.  There  were  no  new  concerns  or  unexpected  findings  in  the safety data obtained from this older population up to D180. H5N1-009 (022/023) Phase A In the 6-9 years age stratum, the overall incidence of AEs by subject was 96.1% in the AS03 group and  88.9%  in  the  control  group.  The  incidences  of  general  symptoms  were  comparable  between vaccine groups but local symptoms occurred more often in the AS03 group. There was no increased reactogenicity in either vaccine group after the second dose compared with the first dose. In  the 3-5  years age  stratum,  AE  rates  were  generally  lower  than  in  older  children.  Incidences  of general symptoms per subject were comparable between vaccine groups but rates of local symptoms per subject were higher in the AS03 group. There was no increased reactogenicity in either vaccine group after the second dose compared with the first dose. The incidence of grade 3 AEs was generally low with no difference between the vaccine groups in older children but with rates of 13.7% versus zero in children aged 3-5 years. The incidence of AEs with  causal  relationship  to  the  vaccination  in  the  subjects  aged  6-9  years  was  94.1%  in  the  Half HA/Half AS03 group compared with 83.3% in the control subjects. However, rates were comparable among subjects aged 3-5 years (66.7% and 61.1%). Medicinal product no longer authorised

In the 6-9 year-olds the rates of pain were 61% for Fluarix and 76.5% for AS03 vaccine after the first dose (none and 5.9% with Grade 3) but were comparable after the second dose (none and 4% with Grade 3). In the 3-5 year-olds the rates of pain were higher with AS03 vaccine after both doses but very few had Grade 3 pain.

Rates of solicited general symptoms per subject as shown below were not markedly different between vaccine groups in the 6-9 years age stratum. The rate of any fever (&gt; 37.5°C) after dose 1 of AS03 vaccine was 5.9% but no subject had Grade 3 fever (&gt; 39°C) and no subject in the Fluarix group had any fever. The rates for any fever after the second dose were 16.7% for Fluarix and 10.2% for AS03

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

vaccine while rates for Grade 3 fever were 5.6% and zero. The per-dose rates for any antipyretic use were 8% in both vaccine groups with per subject rates of 17% and 14% in respective groups.

In the 3-5 years age stratum rates of solicited general symptoms per subject were higher than in the control group. The rate of any fever after dose 1 of AS03 vaccine was 9.8% but 3.9% had Grade 3 fever (&gt; 39°C). The corresponding rates after the second dose were 6% and zero. No subjects in the Fluarix group had fever after either dose. The per-dose rates of taking any antipyretic were 9% for Fluarix and 19% for AS03 vaccine, with per subject rates of 17% and 35%.

Unsolicited  AEs  reported  up  to  51  days  after  the  first  vaccination  showed  no  particular  signal  or clinical pattern in any vaccine group.

Phase B In  both  age  strata  the  overall  incidence  incidences  of  AEs  and  rates  of  local  and  general  AEs  by subject  were  higher  in  the  AS03  vaccine  group  than  in  the  control  group.  There  was  no  increased reactogenicity  in  either  vaccine  group  after  the  second  vaccination  when  compared  with  the  first vaccination. There were more Grade 3 AEs in subjects aged 6-9 years in the AS03 group (8.2%) when compared with the control group (0.0%). Similarly, the incidence of Grade 3 AEs in subjects aged 3-5 years was higher in the AS03 group (11.8%) when compared with the control group (5.9%), mainly driven by a higher incidence of Grade 3 local symptoms. The incidence of AEs with causal relationship to the vaccination in the subjects aged 6-9 years was 75.5% in the AS03 vaccine group compared with 58.8% in the control subjects. Also, among subjects aged 3-5 years the incidence of AEs assessed as causally related to the vaccination was 70.6% in the AS03 vaccine group and 35.3% in the control group. Solicited  local  symptoms  per  subject  (see  graph  below)  did  not  show  marked  differences  between AS03 and control except for pain at the injection site.

In the 6-9 years age stratum the incidences per subject of solicited general symptoms were generally higher in the AS03 vaccine group but rates for Grade 3 symptoms were low. The rates of any fever (&gt; 37.5°C) after dose 1 were zero for Fluarix and 2% for AS03 vaccine and no subject had Grade 3 fever (&gt;  39°C).  The  corresponding  rates  after  the  second  dose  were  zero  and  6.4%  for  any  fever  in respective vaccine groups and zero and 2.1% had Grade 3 fever.

In both age strata the incidences of unsolicited AEs were comparable but higher in the younger subjects. Grade 3 AEs and AEs assessed as causally related to the vaccination were infrequent. One subject in the Full HA/ ½ AS03 group experienced an AE leading to premature discontinuation. Please see the separate AR on possible auto-immune diseases in vaccinees. Phase C In the both age strata the incidences of local and general AEs were higher in the AS03 group. The incidence of Grade 3 AEs in subjects aged 6-9 years was higher in the AS03 group (18.4%) when compared with the control group (5.6%). The incidence of Grade 3 AEs in subjects aged 3-5 years was also higher in the AS03 group (22.4%) when compared with the control group (0.0%) but did not seem to be driven by the incidence of local Grade 3 symptoms.

The incidence of AEs with causal relationship to the vaccination in the subjects aged 6-9 years was 93.9% in the AS03 vaccine group and 94.4% in the control group compared to 79.6% and 41.2% in respective groups in the younger age cohort.

Pain was the predominant solicited local symptom in both age strata and vaccine groups. Rates of pain were not higher after the second dose in either age stratum.

Redness and swelling were also reported with a higher incidence in the AS03 group irrespective of age stratum. In the 3-5 years age stratum there was a trend for a higher incidence of induration, redness and  pain  upon  re-vaccination  but  this  was  not  observed  in  the  6-9  years  age  stratum  and  was  not observed  in  either  stratum  with  the  control  vaccine.  The  majority  of  these  events  were  Grade  1  in intensity, and there were few isolated Grade 3 cases in the AS03 group (none in the control group). Among 6-9 year-olds  rates  of  general  solicited  symptoms  were  higher  with  AS03  vaccine  and  the incidence of fever, headache, myalgia, shivering and sweating tended to be higher after Dose 2. Rates of  fever  after  dose  1  were  zero  in  the  Fluarix  group  and  12.2%  in  the  AS03  group  (1/6  of  these subjects  [2%  overall]  had  Grade  3  fever).  After  the  second  dose  rates  for  any  fever  were  zero  and 32.7% in respective vaccine groups (6/16 of these subjects [12% overall] had Grade 3 fever). These numbers give rates for fever overall/dose of zero for Fluarix and 22.4% for AS03 vaccine (7/22 of these doses [7% overall] being associated with Grade 3 fever). The per dose rates for any antipyretic use  were  14%  and  43%  in  respective  vaccine  groups  with  per  subject  rates  of  22%  and  65%  in respective groups.

In the 3-5 years age stratum solicited general symptoms predominated in the AS03 group (range 8.2% - 36.7%) when compared with the control group (range 0.0% - 5.9%). After dose 1 the rates for any fever were zero in the Fluarix group and 8.2% in the AS03 group (3/4 of these subjects [6% overall] had  Grade  3  fever).  After  dose  2  the  fever  rates  were  zero  and  31.3%  (2/15  [4%  overall]  of  these subjects had Grade 3 fever) in respective vaccine groups. These numbers give overall/dose rates for fever  of  zero  for  Fluarix  and  19.6%  for  AS03  vaccine  (5/19  of  these  doses  [5%  overall]  being associated  with  Grade  3  fever).  Within  this  period  the  per  dose  rates  of  taking  any  antipyretic (regardless  of  the  reason  for  use)  in  the  3-5  year-olds  were  15%  for  Fluarix  and  31%  for  AS03 vaccine, with per subject rates of 24% and 51%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The incidence of unsolicited AEs was 55.1% in the AS03 group and 33.3% in the control group in the 6-9 years age stratum. There were very few Grade 3 unsolicited AEs and unsolicited AEs assessed as causally  related  to  the  vaccination  were  infrequent.  In  the  3-5  years  stratum  the  incidence  of unsolicited AEs was 53.1% in the AS03 group and 47.1% in the control group. Few subjects reported Grade 3 unsolicited AEs in the AS03 group (6.1%) and there were none in the control group. The incidence of unsolicited AEs assessed as causally related to the vaccination was 18.4% in the AS03 group compared to zero in the control group.

In study H5N1 009 (-022/023), the differences between H5N1/AS03 and control vaccines for general and  local  symptoms  and  unsolicited  AEs  were  most  marked  in  Phase  C  when  the  adult  dose  was administered.

As  expected  from  the  adult  studies,  the  data  indicated  higher  rates  in  the  AS03  groups  for  local symptoms, which mainly concerned pain although rates of other symptoms were also usually higher. However, as in adults, the rates of Grade 3 pain have generally been low and were 6-10% with the full adult dose. In Phase A there was a higher rate of fever in the AS03 group in the younger age cohort only. In Phase B general symptoms occurred more often in the AS03 group in both age strata. The most common symptoms in the 6-9 years age stratum were headache and myalgia whereas in the 3-5 years age stratum the most common were irritability and fever (but rates of Grade 3 symptoms were ≤ 2%). In Phase C solicited general symptoms (the most common being headache and fever in the 6-9 yearolds, and fever and irritability in the 3-5 year-olds) were much more frequently observed in the AS03 group when compared with the control group. The incidence of Grade 3 solicited symptoms was low except for a higher incidence of Grade 3 fever (10-14% overall per subject in the two age strata) and Grade 3 loss of appetite (only 3-5 year-olds) in the AS03 group. When comparing the age strata, a higher incidence of unsolicited AEs was observed in the subjects aged 3-5 years irrespective of vaccine group. In Phase C, the occurrence of unsolicited AEs in the 6-9 year-olds was higher in the AS03 group than in the control group, while there was no difference in the incidence of unsolicited AEs between the vaccine groups in the 3-5 year-olds. The additional safety data collected up to Month 6 raised no new concerns. H1N1-021 Only  safety  data  after  the  first  dose  of  vaccine  have  been  provided.  The  incidences  of  local  and systemic  reactions  to  Pandemrix  A(H1N1)v  were  very  similar  to  those  reported  with  the  mock-up vaccine H5N1. There was no case of fever after the first dose. The incidence of grade 3 symptoms (unsolicited and solicited) was low: 4.7%. · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events Medicinal product no longer authorised

In study  H5N1-007 there  were  no  deaths  or  non-fatal  SAEs  up  to  D51.  From  D51  to  D180  seven subjects reported a SAE, ranging from 0-2 per dose group but none was considered to be related to vaccination.

In study H5N1-008 there were 11/3802 (0.3%) subjects in the 15µg/AS03 vaccine group and 6/1269 (0.5%) in the Fluarix/placebo group who reported SAEs. All SAEs were considered as not related to vaccination by the investigator and all resolved. There were no deaths.

Between  D51  and  D180  3.8%  of  those  aged  &gt;  60  years  in  the  15µg/AS03  group  reported  a  SAE compared to 3.9% in this age group from the Fluarix group. Rates in subjects aged 18-60 years were 0.8% and 0.9% in the two vaccine groups. There was no discernible pattern in SAEs observed. In the 15µg/AS03 vaccine group none of the SAEs seemed likely to be in any way related to vaccination based on nature or date of onset.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In study H5N1-002 there were seven subjects who reported SAEs during the study. Review of these SAEs indicates that none was related to vaccine. One subject died but this was unrelated to vaccine.

In study H5N1-012 six subjects reported seven SAEs up to the data lock point of which six were are resolved  and  one  was  fatal.  Non-fatal  SAEs  included  concussion,  uterine  neoplasm,  aggravation  of cervico-brachial  syndrome, cerebral infarction  and hemiparesis and uterine polyp requiring surgery. No SAEs were considered to be related to vaccination and one was reported during the 30-day followup post-vaccination period (after the second primary dose).

In  study H5N1-015 eight  subjects  (2  in  adjuvanted  groups,  3  in  non-adjuvanted  groups  and  3  in control group) reported 9 SAEs between Day 0 and Day 180. There were no deaths. None of these reported SAEs were assessed by the investigator as causally related to the vaccination. In study H5N1-010 ,  there were 5 SAEs reported by 4 subjects up to the initial D51 data lock point. These  were  clearly  intercurrent  illnesses  unrelated  to  vaccination,  none  was  fatal  and  all  were resolved. SAEs were reported between Day 52 and Day 180. During this period 13 subjects reported a total of 13 SAEs up to the data lock point. Of these SAEs; two were unresolved, six were resolved and five were fatal. The five fatalities concerned a cerebrovascular accident (2), congestive cardiac failure (2) and ventricular fibrillation. Overall (from D0 onwards) 18 SAEs were reported by 16 subjects in this  study.  There  were  eight  non-fatal  adverse  events  during  the  extended  safety  follow-up  period. None of these SAEs were assessed by the investigators as related to the vaccination. In study H5N1-009 (-022/-23), no SAEs or deaths have been reported in phases A and B. In Phase C one subject in the AS03 group developed an AE of uveitis for which subsequent details specified a unilateral anterior chamber uveitis at 8 days after the second dose of the H5N1 vaccine, which was considered to have a potential causal relationship to vaccination. One subject in the AS03 group was hospitalised for gastroenteritis but the event was considered not related to vaccination and resolved after  two  days.  There  were  no  AEs  leading  to  premature  discontinuation  in  Phase  C  and  no  deaths were reported. There were two cases of auto-immune hepatitis (AIH) reported (in one of these the diagnosis was not confirmed)  across  the  studies  preformed  with  AS03-adjuvanted  H5N1  vaccines,  including  HA manufactured in Dresden as for Pandemrix and in Quebec in a version of the vaccine that is not yet approved. The full review of the cases of possible AIH suggested that in each instance this was likely an  underlying  disorder  present  before  immunisation.  There  was  no  evidence  that  vaccination exacerbated the AIH in these patients. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Subsequently there was a full review of other cases of hepatic events reported so far from all of the studies conducted with AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 and seasonal influenza vaccines. There is currently no evidence  to  indicate  these  cases  were  AIH  and  alternative  causes  for  the  hepatic  events  existed. Therefore,  there  is  currently  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  AS03-adjuvanted  vaccines  are  causally associated  with  development  of  AIH  or  other  autoimmune  disorders.  However,  the  MAH  and  the CHMP will keep these issues under close review during the post-marketing period.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

There are no data on co-administration of Pandemrix with other vaccines.

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

There were no discontinuations due to AEs in study 007.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  008  three  subjects  who  received  15µg/AS03  vaccine  dropped  out  due  to  SAEs  assessed  as  not related  to  vaccination.  In  addition,  22  subjects  reported  non  serious  AEs  that  led  to  premature discontinuation from the study. Of these 21 were from the 15µg/AS03 group (9 by day 21) and there was only one withdrawal from the Fluarix group (by Day 42). After review the MAH concluded that there was an excess of AEs associated with withdrawal in the adjuvanted vaccine group but no pattern of AEs associated with withdrawals could be discerned.

In study 002 the only early discontinuation was due to the death that was unrelated to vaccine.

2.6 Product Information Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, changes to the SPC/Annex II/labelling/PL  were  implemented  and  details  of  the  changes  can  be  found  in  the  final  approved product information attached to this report. 2.7 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation Clinical Context In April 2009, a new strain of human influenza A(H1N1)v was identified and characterised. On 11 June 2009 the WHO declared an influenza pandemic. Current estimates for the attack rate associated with the influenza A(H1N1)v virus over the first wave of  infection  vary  from  approximately  10-30  %  in  different  geographical  areas.  There  are  no established  criteria  for  classifying  pandemics  in  terms  of  severity.  The  perceived  severity  can  vary with geographical area, with sequential pandemic waves and in accordance with several other factors. Descriptions of severity based on factors such as rates of hospitalisation may be misleading due to different thresholds for this between countries and age groups. The  development  of  Pandemrix  was  based  on  the  guideline  on  dossier  structure  and  content  for pandemic  influenza  vaccine  marketing  authorisation  applications  (CPMP/VEG/4717/03)  and  the guideline  on  submission  of  marketing  authorisation  applications  for  pandemic  influenza  vaccines through  the  centralised  procedure  (CPMP/VEG/4986/03).  The  core  dossier  procedure  allows  the insertion  of  the  pandemic  strain  A(H1N1)v  into  the  authorised  mock-up  vaccine  as  a  strain  change variation procedure. This principle is based on the extrapolation of the extensive clinical safety and immunogenicity data obtained with the mock-up vaccine (containing H5N1 strains) to the same vaccine construct using the current influenza A(H1N1)v pandemic strain. That is, on an expectation that insertion of the influenza A(H1N1)v  strain into the mock-up vaccine construct would result in a vaccine similarly or even more immunogenic  than  the  H5N1  mock-up  version  and  with  a  similar  safety  profile  when  used  in  a comparable population (i.e. in terms of immunological naivety, health status and age group). Medicinal product no longer authorised

The specific commitments that accompany the strain change variation include collection of data from ongoing and planned clinical studies, which will provide safety and immunogenicity data. These data will be submitted and reviewed on a rolling basis and updates to the Clinical Particulars in the SPC will be made as necessary.

The  MAH  reported  preliminary  clinical  data  following  administration  of  a  single  dose  of  AS03adjuvanted A(H1N1)v vaccine (with a slightly higher HA content than will be included in Pandemrix) to healthy adults aged from 18-60 years before the strain change variation was approved. These data indicated that in contrast to the H5N1 mock-up vaccine a single dose of A(H1N1)v vaccine might be sufficient in this population. These preliminary data were in keeping with results reported concurrently

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

by  several  other  manufacturers  worldwide  with  a  variety  of  A(H1N1)v  vaccine  constructs  and  in different populations. The CHMP considered that these data were potentially very important and they were  taken  into  consideration  when  drafting  the  SPC.  The  SPC  will  be  updated  as  soon  as confirmatory  data  on  responses  to  a  single  dose  of  Pandemrix  A(H1N1)v  become  available.  In addition, data obtained from different age groups will be added as appropriate.

## Quality

The manufacture of the A(H1N1)v antigen, the A(H1N1)v formulated vial and the AS03 (adjuvant) vial  is  appropriately  controlled.    Adequate  in-process  controls,  release  and  shelf  life  specifications have been set in line with relevant requirements (e.g. Ph.Eur.). The relevant quality data generated in the mock-up licence can be considered supportive for this pandemic strain change licence.  Supporting quality  data  required  specifically  for  the  strain  change  have  been  provided  and  satisfactorily demonstrate the quality of the vaccine.

While it was expected that the insertion of the influenza A(H1N1)v strain into the mock-up vaccine construct of Pandemrix would not have a substantial effect on immune responses the preliminary data from study H1N1-021 have indicated that a single dose might be sufficient to elicit immune responses considered  to  be  potentially  protective  at  least  in  healthy  adults  aged  18-60  years.  These  findings contrasted with the consistent data from the H5N1 studies that indicated the need for two doses in all age groups tested so far. The difference most likely relates to a considerable degree of priming of the immune systems  of  subjects  to  one  or  more  antigens  in  the  A(H1N1)v  vaccine  as  a  result  of  past natural  exposure  to  cross-reacting  viruses  and/or  seasonal  influenza  vaccines  containing  strains  that elicited cross-reacting antibody to the final pandemic strain.

Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology At  time  of  the  strain  variation  all  non-clinical  data  with  Pandemrix  was  generated  with  vaccine constructs that included influenza A (H5N1) strains. The ability  to  induce  protection  against  homologous  and  heterologous  vaccine  strains  was  assessed non-clinically using ferret challenge models. Of animals receiving adjuvanted vaccine 87% and 96% were protected against the lethal homologous or heterologous challenge, respectively. Viral shedding into the upper respiratory tract was also reduced in vaccinated animals relative to controls, suggesting a reduced risk of viral transmission. In the unadjuvanted control group, as well as in the adjuvant only control group, all animals died or had to be euthanized as they were moribund, three to four days after the start of challenge. Non-clinical safety data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, embryo-foetal and postnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period). As  no  administration  around  implantation  phase  of  the  embryos  was  performed,  the  use  of  AS03adjuvanted vaccine in early pregnancy was not studied. The MAH agreed to conduct a study in which the vaccine will be given to pregnant animals during early pregnancy. Animal studies did not indicate harmful effects with respect to fertility, pregnancy or embryofetal development. This is reflected in the SPC. Clinical Medicinal product no longer authorised

Further data will be available shortly in different age groups that may confirm the initial findings and indicate whether a single dose might also be sufficient in the elderly and in children and adolescents. Meanwhile it is stated that two doses are preferred in adults aged 18-60 years although a single dose may be sufficient. It is also stated that two doses are currently recommended for the elderly and for children aged from 6 months to 17 years. If the apparently satisfactory responses in adults aged 18-60 years reflect natural priming and/or previous seasonal vaccination it may be that the elderly are also

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

well-primed although their immune responses could also be subject to effects of immunosenescence so a single dose might not be enough.

The data available with the H5N1 mock-up vaccine in children are currently limited to the age group 3-9 years. These data are insufficient to determine whether children should receive the adult dose or less then (e.g. half) the adult dose to achieve optimal immune responses. However, even the half adult dose of H5N1 vaccine appeared to elicit satisfactory immune responses (with the caveat that even less is  known  about  the  correlation  between  antibody  levels  and  protection  in  children  than  in  adults) although  there  were  some  advantages  in  terms  of  antibody  to  drifted  variants  with  the  adult  dose. Therefore, and taking into account also the differences in reactogenicity between the adult and half adult dose in this age group, the SPC states that if vaccination is considered to be necessary then two vaccinations with the half adult dose may be sufficient.

In view of Risk Management, the MAH will submit on a monthly basis a simplified PSUR on all adverse reactions notified by patients and health care professionals.  The Risk Management Plan includes additional Pharmacovigilance activities to address important potential risks and important missing information. This includes the conduct of a study with at least 9,000 patients across different age groups, recruited at the start of the vaccination campaign, a specific monitoring of special populations such as pregnant women (through pregnancy registry in several EU countries), children and immunocompromised subjects, and the monitoring of adverse events of special interest. Effectiveness studies developed and conducted in accordance with the standard protocols published by the ECDC will be performed.

In the absence of specific data and based mainly on experience with seasonal influenza vaccines the SPC suggests that the adult dose may be considered for children and adolescents aged 10-17 years for whom vaccination is thought to be necessary. In children aged 6 months up to 3 years it is suggested that the recommendations made for 3-9 year-olds may be appropriate. Due to the lack of experience in the use of influenza vaccines in children aged &lt; 6 months there is no dose recommendation made at present. Specific data will be obtained in this age group at a later date. There are no clinical data available with this vaccine in pregnant women. Non-clinical studies with regard to female fertility, embryo-foetal and postnatal toxicity (up to the end of  the  lactation  period)  were  conducted  in  rats with  the  Pandemrix  mock-up vaccine containing the AS03 adjuvant. There was no cause for concern identified in this study despite no data are available on administration around the implantation phase of the embryos. Serological studies exploring the immunogenicity suggest that antibody response to influenza vaccine is similar in pregnant women and non-pregnant women. Therefore it is expected that Pandemrix will be  adequately  immunogenic  in  pregnant  women.  Although  currently  available  safety  data  are  very limited,  non-clinical  data  with  the  current  vaccines/adjuvants  and  experience  from  other  types  of vaccines  (both  non-adjuvanted  and  adjuvanted)  do  not  raise  concerns  with  respect  to  use  during pregnancy. Furthermore, vaccine safety in pregnant women and effectiveness will be closely monitored, as part of the RMP.  Observational studies using established pregnancy registries are planned. There are insufficient safety data at present to evaluate the A(H1N1)v vaccine but the expectation is that  the  safety  profile  will  be  similar  to  that  described  for  the  H5N1  mock-up  vaccine.  The  safety database  observed  with  the  H5N1  constructs  has  been  reflected  in  the  Summary  of  Product Characteristics. Adverse reactions that might be specific to the influenza A(H1N1)v strain can only be evaluated during post-approval usage. Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities are adequate and appropriate. Data from ongoing and planned clinical trials as specified in the specific obligations for Pandemrix A(H1N1)v will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. These studies will provide safety, immunogenicity and effectiveness data for the influenza A(H1N1)v vaccine. The SPC will be updated accordingly as the CHMP considers necessary.

Further  to  the  approval  of  the  initial  MAA,  the  MAH  submitted  results  of  user  testing  which  were assessed within variation II-06 adopted on 10 July 2009.

## Risk-benefit assessment

## Benefits

The  real  benefits  of  Pandemrix  A(H1N1)v  can  only  be  assessed  by  its  use  during  a  pandemic.  At present  the  benefit  can  only  be  evaluated  based  on  detailed  characterisation  of  immunological responses to vaccination with the mock-up version of Pandemrix (i.e. containing H5N1 strains) plus the limited data available from administration of a single dose of A(H1N1)v vaccine to healthy adults aged 18-60 years.

On  the  basis  of  a  reasonable  assumption  that  the  safety  of  the  A(H1N1)v  vaccine  should  be comparable to that of the mock-up vaccine the anticipated safety profile would not preclude the use of the vaccine as currently described in the SPC. However, it remains possible that the data generated with mock-up H5N1 vaccine cannot entirely predict the safety profile of Pandemrix A(H1N1)v since there  remains  a  possibility  of  adverse  reactions  associated  with  the  pandemic  influenza  strain.  The specific  commitments include collection  of  safety,  immunogenicity  and  effectiveness  data  from  the ongoing and planned clinical studies.

After  two  doses  administered  21  days  apart  the  H5N1  vaccine  has  been  shown  to  be  suitably immunogenic in the populations in which it has been tested. There are no data on the use of the mockup vaccine in subjects aged 10-17 years or subjects aged &lt; 3 years. Based on data in children aged 3-9 years it would be expected that the adult dose would be immunogenic in children aged 10-17 years but it may be that half the adult dose could be sufficient. The data in children aged 3-9 years suggest that half  the  adult  dose  may  be  sufficient  for  those  aged  from  6  months  to  9  years.  The  dose recommendations will be updated as soon as data on use of Pandemrix A(H1N1)v vaccine in various age groups become available from the ongoing clinical studies. The additional data with Pandemrix A(H1N1)v suggest that adults aged 18-60 years may require only a  single  dose  to  achieve  immediate  levels  of  potentially  protective  antibody.  These  data  are insufficient to predict whether a similar consideration will apply to the elderly and to subjects aged &lt; 18 years for the time being. Based on the data with H5N1 vaccine and the available data with A(H1N1)v vaccine the expected benefit  of  Pandemrix  is  to  provide  some  protection  against  clinically-apparent  infection  due  to A(H1N1)v. Risks The mock-up H5N1 vaccine was commonly or very commonly associated with a range of local and systemic adverse reactions but these were not often of severe intensity. The current safety database with H5N1 vaccine is considered to be sufficient to describe adverse reactions that occur uncommonly and  to  give  an  indication  of  any  rare  events  in  the  population  it  has  been  tested.  There  are  some adverse reactions known to be very rarely associated with influenza vaccines and it is currently not possible to predict if higher rates might be observed with Pandemrix A(H1N1)v compared with, for example, seasonal influenza vaccines.

## Balance

Based on all the quality safety and efficacy data that supported approval of Pandemrix H5N1 mock-up vaccine  together  with  quality  and  very  preliminary  clinical  data  specific  to  the  pandemic  influenza A(H1N1)v strain it is considered that in the current pandemic situation the benefits outweigh the risks that may be associated with the use of the vaccine in accordance with the SPC.

## Recommendation

On the basis of the available data for Pandemrix A(H1N1)v which is limited primarily to quality data and the data of the initially authorised medicinal product Pandemrix H5N1, the CHMP considered by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Pandemrix A(H1N1)v for the prophylaxis of influenza in an officially declared pandemic situation, in accordance with official guidance, was favourable. Therefore CHMP recommended the variation to the marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances in accordance  with  Article  8  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  1085/2003  to  the  terms  of  the Marketing  Authorisation  until  specific  conditions  as  defined  in  Annex  II.C  (points  1  and  2)  are fulfilled.
