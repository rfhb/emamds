## I. RECOMMENDATION

The MAH has fulfilled its obligations towards article 45 of the of the paediatric regulation EC/1901/2006, and as such this FUM can be considered fulfilled and grantable.

## II. INTRODUCTION

Levetiracetam  (LEV),  a  pyrrolidone  derivative,  is  an  antiepileptic  drug  (AED)  structurally unrelated to any other known AED. The exact way in which levetiracetam works is still unclear but it seems to interfere with a protein called the synaptic vesicle protein 2A, which is found in the space between nerves (synapses) and stops the release of chemical messengers between nerve cells. This helps to stabilise electrical activity in the brain and prevent seizures.

The product is used to treat partial onset seizures (fits) with or without secondary generalization, or as an adjunctive therapy in patients suffering from:

-  partial onset seizures with or without generalisation in patients from four years of age
-  myoclonic seizures (short, shock-like jerks of a muscle or group of muscles) in patients from 12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy
-  primary  generalised  tonic-clonic  seizures  (major  fits,  including  loss  of  consciousness)  in patients from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (the type of epilepsy that is thought to have a genetic cause)

Keppra (levetiracetam) is available in the European Union as 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 mg tablets, 100 mg/mL oral solution, and 5 mg/5mL concentrate for solution for infusion.µ

## III. TYPE OF APPLICATION

In  the  frame  of  the  article  45  of  the  paediatric  regulation  EC/1901/2006,  UCB  provided  in January 2008 a listing with all submitted and not yet submitted paediatric clinical data on the medicinal  products  registered  by  UCB  or  its  affiliates  in  the  Union.  In  December  2008,  UCB provided  the  EMEA  with  the  actual  data  listed  previously  as  having  never  been  submitted  by UCB to the Competent Authority in the frame of a paediatric filing. This assessment concerns the overview of these studies.

## IV. SUBMITTED STUDIES

The MAH submitted 8 studies, see table 1, in compliance with the requisite of art. 45. Neither of these  studies  had  investigations  in  paediatric  patients  as  an  objective,  but  some  of  the participating subjects were under the age of 18 at time of inclusion. As such they were protocol deviators. In the frame of compliance with art. 45 EC/1901/2006, the MAH only focused on these subjects.  The  safety  data  pertaining  to  those  patients  have  been  extracted  from  the  total population, with the aim of investigating if any new safety signal would be observed, that would alter the known benefit/risk in paediatric patients. Since those data only include a few patients per trial under the age of 18 years, The MAH argued that no relevant information on efficacy in children/adolescents can be derived from those reports.

CHMP comment: Agreed

Bridging Study Of L059 (Levetiracetam) In Patients With Epilepsy By Double Blind Method

## V. BIOPHARMACEUTICS

There was no new paediatric data to report in any of the above studies.

## CHMP comment:

Agreed

## VI. PHARMACOLOGY

There was no new paediatric data to report in any of the above studies.

## CHMP comment:

## Agreed

## VII. EFFICACY

Due to the low number of patients below the age of 18 in each trial no relevant information could be  gleamed  from  the  reports.  The  MAH  therefore  makes  reference  to  the  registered  data evidencing efficacy in paediatric patients.

## CHMP comment:

The MAH's sentiment regarding the fact that due to the low number  of paediatric subjects  in each study comprehensive paediatric efficacy conclusions could not be drawn is corroborated.

## VIII. SAFETY

In order to assess the safety signals in &lt;18y olds, events seen in each of the studies in table 1 will be presented together with a summary of the study's characteristics.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Follow-Up Trial Evaluating The Longterm Safety Of Levetiracetam (1000 To 3000 Mg/Day B.I.D.) And Carbamazepine (400 To 1200 Mg/Day Oral B.I.D.), Used As Monotherapy In Subjects (16 Years) Coming From The N01061 Trial

This study was a multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group monotherapy long-term follow-up trial. The  main  objectives  were  to  allow  the  subjects  having  benefited  from  levetiracetam  or carbamazepine monotherapy in study N01061 to remain on the same investigational product, to ensure blindness of N01061 treatment identity until N01061 database lock and to continue to assess the safety of LEV as per adverse event reporting.

Subjects included in the trial were to be 16 years or older and newly diagnosed with epilepsy (partial  onset  seizures  with  clear  focal  origin  or  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  without  clear focal origin) and had to be previous participants of the double-blind monotherapy study N01061.

In total 335 (of which 171 took levetiracetam) subjects entered the follow-up study. 6 subjects of the LEV and 6 subjects of the CBZ groups were below 18 years of age (mean age equal to 16.9 and 16.6 respectively). Male representation was 66.7% and 16.7% in both groups respectively.

In each group three of the sub-18 subjects reported an adverse event. Two subjects in the LEV group and one in the CBZ group reported a drug-related AE (see table 2). No AEs leading to premature discontinuation or SAEs were reported at all.

Table 2: Drug related AEs reported by &lt;18 year old subjects in both treatment groups

| LEV   |  One patient each reported: diarrhoea, ligament sprain, weight increased (ADR)  Two patients each reported: upper respiratory tract infection, headache, pharyngolaryngeal pain.   |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CBZ   |  One patient each reported: eye allergy, influenza, hockey injury, lymphocyte count decreased (ADR), headache, acne (ADR)                                                           |

## 2.  A  Phase  Iv  -  Pharmacovigilance  Study  Of  Keppra(R)  Greece  -  S.K.A.T.E.:  Safety  Of Keppra(R) As Adjunctive Therapy In Epilepsy

This trial was a multi-center, Phase IV pharmacovigilance therapeutic use study. The trial was stopped one year after the recruitment of the first subject. The aim of this trial was to further assess the safety of Keppra, to assess the optimal dose in daily clinical practice and to evaluate the efficacy of Keppra in community-based practice.

Subjects received levetiracetam in a mean daily dose of 1382.1 mg (SD = 257.7 mg) and the median duration of exposure over that period was 99 days.

35  Caucasian  subjects  entered  the  study  of  which  one  was  a  female  patient  aged  17  at  the study's  start.  She  received  2000  mg  of  Keppra  per  day.  She  reported  a  non-serious  mood alteration NOS, assessed as unlikely related to study drug, which resolved in 17 days after LEV dose reduction.

3.  A  Korean  Open-Label,  Multi-Center,  Community-Based  Trial  Assessing  The  Efficacy  And Safety Of Levetiracetam As Adjunctive Therapy In Adult Subjects With Uncontrolled Partial Epilepsy For Bridging Purpose With A Similar Study On Caucasian Epileptic Subjects

This  trial  was  a  multi-center,  open-label,  add-on  study  without  control  group  which  had  as objectives the evaluation of levetiracetam efficacy in community-based epileptic population with partial onset seizures and to obtain further information about optimal dose in daily practice and the further evaluation of the safety and the tolerability of levetiracetam in a broad population of epileptic subjects and confirm the favorable safety of the drug found during clinical development. The drug was administered at doses ranging from 1000 mg/day to 3000 mg/day and the study lasted between 16 and 22 weeks for each participant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One  patient  below  18  years  was  in  accordance  with  the  inclusion  criteria  of  having  epilepsy experiencing  partial  seizure,  whether  or  not  secondarily  generalized,  that  were  classifiable according to the International Classification of Epileptic Seizure and having at least three and no more than forty-two partial seizures over a 3-month historical baseline, while taking at least one but no more than two concomitant marketed antiepileptic drugs at stable dose. The subject was a 17 years old female patient receiving 1000 mg of Keppra per day. She experienced no AEs.

4. A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Study: 16-Week Evaluation Of The Efficacy And Safety Of Levetiracetam (Lev) As Add-on Therapy In Adults And Adolescents Older Than 16 Years Suffering From Partial Seizures

The  objective  of  this  double  blind,  randomized  (1:1),  placebo-controlled,  multicenter,  parallel group study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Keppra when used as an add-on therapy in adult and adolescent Chinese subjects older than 16 years. The study period covered 20 weeks and included a retrospective historical baseline, randomization, the 16-week treatment period  and  either  down  titration  for  up  to  four  weeks  or  a  switch  to  long-term  Levetiracetam therapy.

Thirteen patients in the levetiracetam group and nine in the placebo group were younger than 18 years (mean ages were 15.8 and 16.3 respectively), and fulfilled the inclusion criteria of having epilepsy with partial onset seizures (classifiable according to the ILAE classification of epileptic seizures) and having had at least eight partial seizures with or without secondary generalization (type  IA,  IB  or  IC)  during  the  8-  week  historical  baseline  period.  Neither  of  them  had  been exposed to more than two classical stable AEDs before the selection visit. None of the subjects reported any AEs during the course of the study.

5. K.E.E.P.E.R. (Keppra Epilepsy Evaluation Of Patient Time To Response). A Phase Iv, OpenLabel, Multi-Center, Community-Based Trial Studying The Safety And Efficacy Of Levetiracetam As Add-On Therapy In Adult Patients With Treatment-Resistant, Partial-Onset Epilepsy

This open-label multicenter study aimed to gather additional data on the safety and tolerability of the administration of LEV used as an add-on therapy in patients with partial onset seizures in community-based  practices,  and  to  measure  the  seizure  reduction  effect  at  the  protocoldetermined final doses (up to 3,000 mg/day).

Subjects underwent a 16 weeks treatment period, including four weeks of dose adjustment and a  12  week  period  receiving  the  target  dose.  After  completion  of  the  study,  patients  could continue to receive levetiracetam by conversion to prescription. For purposes of evaluation, the patient's  dose  remained  stable  after  Visit  3  unless,  in  the  investigator's  opinion,  a  dosage modification was clinically necessary to achieve maximum benefit or was of medical concern.

Twenty-one patients in the levetiracetam group were &lt;18 years (mean age = 16.5). They were about  equally  distributed  in  gender  and  66.7%  were  of  Caucasian  descent.  Nine  of  these patients  (or  42.9%)  reported  at  least  one  adverse  event.  Drug  related  adverse  events  were observed in 8 patients (38.1%). In two subjects (9.5%) 3 adverse events leading to premature discontinuation  were  observed:  one  patient  reported  gastrointestinal  distress  with  nausea  and vomiting while the other reported increased seizure activity. None were serious adverse events.

## 6. Anwendung Der In Deutschland Zugelassenen Keppra(R) - Tabletten Als Zusatzbehandlung Bei Erwachsenen Patienten Mit Fokalen Epilepsien

In  this  observational  study,  meant  to  gather  data  relating  to  the  efficacy,  tolerability  and undesirable effects of Keppra, thirty-four patients were younger than 18 years (mean age was 14.6  years).  15  of  the  subjects  were  males.  The  product  dose  was  at  study  start  on  average 1052.8 mg, at the intermediate visit it was 1844.4 mg and at study end 2270.3 mg. The minimum treatment duration was 3 months.

Three of the under eighteen subjects reported at least one AE. 2 of them suffered from asthenia, one from convulsions and one from pneumonia (which was a SAE).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 7.  A  Phase  IV,  Open-Label,  Multi-Center  Community-Based  Trial  Studying  The  Safety  And Efficacy  Of  Keppra.  As  Adjunctive  Therapy  In  Adult  Patients  With  Uncontrolled  Partial Epilepsy. S.K.A.T.E.: Safety Of Keppra. As Adjunctive Therapy In Epilepsy

This multi-center open-label uncontrolled trial, focusing on the add-on therapeutic use of Keppra, aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Keppra in community-based practice and to further assess its safety. Furthermore, the optimal dose in daily clinical practice within the dose range 1000-3000 mg was to be assessed. Subjects, who were to be 16 years or older and experiencing partial (secondarily generalized) ICES classifiable seizure, would be treated for sixteen to twenty-two weeks. Participants also had to have at least one and no more than fourteen partial seizures per month as averaged over a 3-month historical baseline, and be taking at least one but no more than two concomitant marketed AEDs at stable dose.

The treatment consisted of a starting dose of 1000 mg/day for every subject. Over the first 4 weeks,  this  dose  could  be  increased  by  1000  mg/day  every  2  weeks  depending  on  the investigators' assessment of seizure control and tolerability, up to a maximum of 3000 mg/day.

In  total  42  participating  subjects  were  younger  than  18  years  with  a  mean  age  of  16.2  years. 40.5%  of  the  subjects  were  male,  while  those  of  Caucasian  descent  made  up  83.3%  of  the group. Seventeen patients (40.5%) reported at least one AE, and 38.1% reported a drug related AE. Three patients (7.1%) prematurely discontinued the study due to adverse events (somnolence, aggression and mental disorder). The latter was also a serious adverse event.

## 8. Bridging Study Of L059 (Levetiracetam) In Patients With Epilepsy By Double Blind Method

This trial (multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study with 3 parallel groups) was meant to evaluate the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam in treatment of refractory epileptic patients with partial onset seizures in the Japanese population, whom were being treated with one to three standard anti-epileptic drugs.

Patients were to receive either 1000 mg/day, 3000 mg/day or placebo in addition to their normal AEDs. Study medication was up-titrated during a 4-week titration period to reach the target daily dosage  that  was  maintained  during  a  12-week  evaluation  period.  Afterwards  subjects  went through either a 4-week withdrawal (down-titration) or a 6-week transition period to next followup study N01020.

Patients deemed fit for inclusion had to experience simple and/or complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization, and have a minimum of twelve partial seizures during the 12-week baseline period with at least 2 seizures every four weeks.

Amongst the study population were eleven subjects &lt;18 Years. Three were part of the placebo group, two of the LEV 1000 mg group and six of the 3000 mg group. The mean ages in each group were 16.3, 17.0 and 16.0 respectively. Nine patients were of male gender.

All patients reported at least one adverse event, 2 patients of the levetiracetam 3000 mg group reported drug related adverse events: Blood alkaline phosphatase increased and Urinary occult blood positive in one patient each. None of the adverse events led to early discontinuation; one patient reported a serious adverse event in the placebo group: pneumonia NOS.

## IX. CONCLUSION

The  MAH  presented  additional  data  on  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  levetiracetam  on  125 patients below the age of 18 years which were on a regime of levetiracetam at doses between 1000 and 3000 mg/day. The exposure durations ranged from sixteen weeks to one year.

In  total  fifty-one  patients  (or  41%)  reported  at  least  one  AE.  28  patients  (22%)  reported  AEs which were considered to be drug-related.

No  unknown  types  of  adverse  event  were  uncovered  during  the  study  review,  as  most  were nervous  system  or  psychiatric  disorders.  All  AEs  had  already  been  reported  in  previously submitted clinical trials and are listed in levetiracetam Summary of Product Characteristics.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In  conclusion,  since  also  those  patients  cannot  be  taken  into  account  for  the  evaluation  of efficacy,  the  MAH  considers  that  there  is  no  change  in  levetiracetam's  registered  risk-benefit assessment in  paediatric  patients  based  upon  this  additional  set  of  data  collected  in  children younger than 18 years.

## X. CHMP CONCLUSION

The  MAH's  conclusions  are  corroborated.  None  of  the  submitted  studies  seem  to  indicate apparent problems in subjects &lt;18 years of age. One should of course keep in mind that this conclusion is based on rather limited data.

It is thus the CHMP opinion that the MAH can be considered to have fulfilled its obligations with regard to article 45 of the paediatric regulation EC/1901/2006. As a result, the present FUM can be can be considered as fulfilled.
