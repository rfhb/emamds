On  10  October  1996,  the  EMEA  approved  the  variation.  This variation required amendments to be incorporated in the relevant sections of the Commission Decision. The respective Commission Decision was issued on 9 November 1996. 2. The change of the manufacturing site for the labelling of the powder for oral solution. On 16 October  1996,  the  EMEA  approved  the  variation.  This  variation  did  not  require  any amendments to the Commission Decision, as amended. 3. The  change  of  the  batch  size  of  the  finished  product  for  Zerit  15  mg  capsules.  On 7  November  1996,  the  EMEA  approved  the  variation.

On 17  October  1996,  the  CPMP  agreed  on  the  wording  to  be  implemented  into  the  SPC  and adopted the opinion on the type II variation. The respective Commission Decision was issued on 3 February 1997. · On 16 January 1997, the MAH submitted in parallel three applications for a type II variation, in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95.

The update of the SPC with additional data for the prescribing physician for patients with end-stage renal disease 3. The update of the SPC related to the carcinogenic potential of Zerit following the finalisation of the studies. The CPMP considered these variations acceptable and agreed on the wording to be introduced into  the  appropriate  sections  of  the  SPC  and  reflected  into  the  PL.  The  CPMP  adopted  on 16 April 1997 an opinion on the three type II variations. The respective Commission Decision was issued on 28 July 1997. · On 17 July 1997, the MAH submitted an application for a type II variation, in accordance with Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95.

The CPMP considered this variation acceptable and agreed on the wording to be introduced into the appropriate sections of the SPC. The CPMP adopted  on  24 September  1997  an  opinion  on  the  type  II  variation,  and  the  respective Commission Decision was issued on 12 December 1997.
