## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Concentrate for solution for infusion.

Clear and colourless solution.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

<!-- image -->

Removab is indicated for the intraperitoneal treatment of malignant ascites in adults with EpCAM-positive carcinomas where standard therapy is not available or no longer feasible.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Removab must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of anti-neoplastic medicinal products.

## Posology

Prior to the intraperitoneal infusion, pre-medication with analgesic / antipyretic / non-steroidal antiphlogistic medicinal products is recommended (see section 4.4).

Removab dosing schedule comprises the following four intraperitoneal infusions:

1 st dose

2 nd dose

20 micrograms on day 3

3 rd dose

50 micrograms on day 7

4 th dose

150 micrograms on day 10

10 micrograms on day 0 Medicinal product no longer authorised

Removab has to be administered as constant rate intraperitoneal infusion with an infusion time of at least 3 hours. In clinical studies infusion times of 3 hours and 6 hours were investigated. For the first of the four doses an infusion time of 6 hours may be considered depending on the patient's health condition.

An interval of at least two infusion free calendar days must elapse between infusion days. The interval between the infusion days can be prolonged in case of relevant adverse reactions. The overall treatment period should not exceed 20 days.

## Monitoring

Adequate monitoring of the patient after end of Removab infusion is recommended. In the pivotal study patients were monitored for 24 h after each infusion.

Special populations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

Patients with hepatic impairment of a higher severity grade than moderate and / or with more than 70% of the liver metastasised and / or portal vein thrombosis / obstruction have not been investigated. Treatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of benefit / risk (see section 4.4).

## Renal impairment

Patients with renal impairment of a higher severity grade than mild have not been investigated. Treatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of benefit / risk (see section 4.4).

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of Removab in the paediatric population in the granted indication.

## Method of administration

## Removab must be administered as an intraperitoneal infusion only .

Removab must not be administered by intraperitoneal bolus or by any other route of administration. For information on the perfusion system to be used see section 4.4.

Precautions to be taken before administering the medicinal product Before administration of Removab the concentrate for solution for infusion is diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. The diluted Removab solution for infusion is administered intraperitoneally as constant rate infusion using an adequate pump system.

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Hypersensitivity to murine (rat and / or mouse) proteins.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Removab must not be administered as a bolus or by any route other than intraperitoneally.

## Cytokine release related symptoms

As release of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic cytokines is initiated by the binding of catumaxomab to immune and tumour cells, cytokine release related clinical symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting and chills have been very commonly reported during and after the Removab administration (see section 4.8). Dyspnoea and hypo-/ hypertension are commonly observed. In the clinical studies in patients with malignant ascites, 1,000 mg paracetamol intravenously was routinely administered prior to Removab infusion for pain and pyrexia control. Despite this premedication, patients experienced the adverse reactions described above with an intensity of up to grade 3, according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the US National Cancer Institute, version 3.0. Other or additional standard pre-medication with analgesic / antipyretic / nonsteroidal antiphlogistic medicinal products is recommended.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), which may also occur commonly due to the mechanism of action of catumaxomab, develops, in general, within 24 hours after Removab infusion, showing symptoms of fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea and leucocytosis (see section 4.8). Standard therapy or premedication, e.g. analgesic / antipyretic / nonsteroidal antiphlogistic is appropriate to limit the risk.

## Abdominal pain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Abdominal pain was commonly reported as an adverse reaction. This transient effect is considered partially a consequence of the intraperitoneal route of administration.

## Performance status and BMI

A solid performance status expressed as Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 17 (to be assessed after drainage of ascites fluid) and Karnofsky Index &gt; 60 is required prior to Removab therapy.

## Acute infections

In presence of factors interfering with the immune system, in particular acute infections, the administration of Removab is not recommended.

## Ascites drainage

Appropriate medical management of ascites drainage is a prerequisite for Removab treatment in order to assure stable circulatory and renal functions. This must at least include ascites drainage until stop of spontaneous flow or symptom relief, and, if appropriate, supportive replacement therapy with crystalloids and / or colloids.

Patients with hemodynamic insufficiency, oedema or hypoproteinaemia Blood volume, blood protein, blood pressure, pulse and renal function should be assessed before each Removab infusion. Conditions such as hypovolaemia, hypoproteinaemia, hypotension, circulatory decompensation and acute renal impairment must be resolved prior to each Removab infusion. Hepatic impairment or portal vein thrombosis / obstruction Patients with hepatic impairment of a higher severity grade than moderate and / or with more than 70% of the liver metastasised and / or portal vein thrombosis / obstruction have not been investigated. Treatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of benefit / risk. Renal impairment Patients with renal impairment of a higher severity grade than mild have not been investigated. Treatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of benefit / risk. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Medicinal product no longer authorised

Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of catumaxomab in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Removab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether catumaxomab/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue / abstain from Removab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

No data on the effect of catumaxomab on fertility are available.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Removab has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients experiencing infusion-related symptoms should be advised not to drive and use machines until symptoms abate.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Adverse reactions are derived from an integrated safety analysis including 12 clinical studies. 728 patients received catumaxomab intraperitoneally, 293 patients as 6 hour - and 435 patients as 3 hour infusions.

The overall safety profile of Removab is characterised by cytokine-release related symptoms and gastrointestinal reactions.

Cytokine-release related reactions: SIRS a potentially life-threatening combination of tachycardia, fever and/or dyspnoea, can develop within 24 hours after a catumaxomab infusion and resolves under symptomatic treatment. Other cytokine-release related reactions such as fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting are very commonly reported reactions in intensity of CTCAE grade 1 and 2 (US National Cancer Institute, version 4.0). These symptoms reflect the mechanism of action of catumaxomab and are in general fully reversible.

Gastrointestinal reactions like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are very common and occur mostly with CTCAE grade 1 or 2, but were also observed in higher grades, and respond to adequate symptomatic treatment.

The safety profile of catumaxomab using a 3h versus a 6h infusion time is in general comparable in regards to nature, frequency and severity.  An increased frequency of some adverse reactions was seen in relation to 3h administration including chills and hypotension (grades 1 / 2), diarrhoea (all grades) and fatigue (grade 1 / 2).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

In Table 1, adverse reactions are listed by organ class. Frequency groupings are defined as follows: very common ( ≥ 1/10), common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100).

Common Uncommon General disorders and administration site conditions Very common Common Uncommon * were also reported as serious adverse reactions underlined: see section 'Description of selected adverse reactions' Description of selected adverse reactions The following definitions of CTCAE criteria of the US National Cancer Institute (version 4.0) apply: CTCAE grade 1 = mild, CTCAE grade 2 = moderate, CTCAE grade 3 = severe, CTCAE grade 4 = life-threatening Cytokine release related symptoms with higher intensities In 5.1% of patients pyrexia reached an intensity of CTCAE grade 3 as it was the case with cytokine release syndrome (1.0%), chills (0.8%), nausea (3.4%), vomiting (4.4%), dyspnoea (1.6%) and hypo/hypertension (2.1% / 0.8%). In one patient (0.1%) dyspnoea and in 3 patients (0.4%) hypotension was reported in CTCAE grade 4 intensity.  Symptoms of pain and pyrexia can be ameliorated or avoided by pre-medication (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)

In 3.8% of the patients symptoms of SIRS were observed within 24 hours after catumaxomab infusion. In three patients (0.4%) an intensity of CTCAE grade 4 was observed. These reactions resolved under symptomatic treatment.

## Abdominal pain

In 43.7% of patients abdominal pain was reported as an adverse reaction reaching grade 3 in 8.2 % of patients, but it resolved under symptomatic treatment.

## Hepatic enzymes

Transient increase in hepatic enzymes was commonly observed after the administration of Removab. In general, the changes in laboratory parameters were not clinically relevant and mostly returned to baseline after end of treatment.

Only in case of clinically relevant or persisting increase further diagnostics or therapy should be considered.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No case of overdose has been reported. Patients receiving a higher than recommended dose of catumaxomab experienced more severe (grade 3) adverse reactions.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC09 Mechanism of action Catumaxomab is a trifunctional rat-mouse hybrid monoclonal antibody that is specifically directed against the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and the CD3 antigen. The EpCAM antigen is overexpressed on most carcinomas (Table 2). CD3 is expressed on mature T-cells as a component of the T-cell receptor. A third functional binding site in the Fc-region of catumaxomab enables interaction with accessory immune cells via Fc γ receptors. Due to catumaxomab's binding properties, tumour cells, T-cells and accessory immune cells come in close proximity. Thereby, a concerted immunoreaction against tumour cells is induced which includes different mechanisms of action such as T-cell activation, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and phagocytosis. This results in destruction of tumour cells. Table 2 EpCAM expression in most relevant ascites causing cancer types Ovarian Gastric Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pharmacodynamic effects

The anti-tumour activity of catumaxomab has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo . Effective catumaxomab-mediated killing of tumour cells in vitro was observed for target cells with low and high expression of the EpCAM antigen, independent of the primary tumour type. The in vivo anti-tumour activity of catumaxomab was confirmed in an immunologically compromised mouse model of ovarian carcinoma, where tumour development was delayed by an intraperitoneal treatment with catumaxomab and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of catumaxomab was demonstrated in two phase III clinical studies. Patients of nonCaucasian origin have not been included in these clinical studies.

## IP-REM-AC-01

A pivotal, two-arm, randomised, open-label, phase II/III clinical trial in 258 patients with symptomatic malignant ascites due to EpCAM-positive carcinomas of whom 170 were randomised to catumaxomab treatment. This study compared paracentesis plus catumaxomab versus paracentesis alone (control).

Catumaxomab was applied in patients where standard therapy was not available or no longer feasible and who had a Karnofsky performance status of at least 60. Catumaxomab was administered as four intraperitoneal infusions with increased doses of 10, 20, 50 and 150 micrograms on day 0, 3, 7 and 10, respectively (see section 4.2). In the pivotal study IP-REM-AC-01 98.1% of patients were hospitalised for a median of 11 days.

In this study, the primary efficacy endpoint was puncture-free survival, which was a composite endpoint defined as the time to first need for therapeutic ascites puncture or death, whichever occurred first. The results for puncture-free survival and time to first need for therapeutic ascites puncture in terms of medians and hazard ratios are presented in Table 3. Kaplan Meier estimates for time to first need for therapeutic ascites puncture are given in Figure 1.

The efficacy of the treatment with paracentesis and catumaxomab in patients with malignant ascites due to EpCAM-positive carcinomas was statistically significantly superior to that with paracentesis alone in terms of puncture-free survival and time to first need for therapeutic ascites puncture.

After completion of the study, patients were further observed until the end of their lifetime to assess overall survival (Table 4).

Altogether 45 out of 88 (51%) patients in the control arm crossed-over to achieve active treatment with catumaxomab.

## IP-CAT-AC-03

This confirmatory two-arm, randomized, open label, phase IIIb study in 219 epithelial cancer patients with symptomatic malignant ascites requiring therapeutic ascites puncture investigated treatment with catumaxomab plus 25 mg prednisolone premedication vs. catumaxomab alone. Catumaxomab was administered as four 3-hour constant-rate i.p. infusions in doses of 10, 20, 50 and 150 micrograms on day 0, 3, 7 and 10, respectively, in both groups. The patient population was comparable to the pivotal study.

In order to assess the impact of prednisolone premedication on safety and efficacy the primary safety endpoint 'composite safety score' and the co-primary efficacy endpoint 'puncture-free survival' were investigated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The composite safety score evaluated the frequency and severity of the main known adverse reactions pyrexia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain in both treatment groups. Administration of prednisolone as premedication did not result in a reduction of these adverse reactions.

The primary efficacy endpoint, puncture-free survival, was a composite endpoint defined as the time to first need for therapeutic ascites puncture or death, whichever occurred first (identical to the pivotal study).

## Immunogenicity

The induction of human anti-murine (rat and / or mouse) antibodies (HAMAs/HARAs) is an intrinsic effect of murine monoclonal antibodies. Current data on catumaxomab derived from the pivotal study show that only 5.6% of patients (7/124 patients) were HAMA positive before the 4th infusion. HAMAs were present in 94% of patients one month after the last catumaxomab infusion. No hypersensitivity reactions were observed.

Patients who developed HAMAs 8 days after catumaxomab treatment showed better clinical outcome, as measured by puncture-free survival, time to next puncture and overall survival, compared with HAMA-negative patients.

In a feasibility study evaluating a second i.p. infusion cycle consisting of 10, 20, 50 and 150 micrograms of catumaxomab in 8 patients with malignant ascites due to carcinoma (IP-CAT-AC-04)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ADA was detectable in all available ascites and plasma samples at screening. The patients remained ADA positive during treatment phase and follow-up. Despite pre-existing ADA values all patients received all 4 catumaxomab infusions. The median puncture-free survival time was 47.5 days, median time to first therapeutic puncture 60.0 days and median overall survival 406.5 days. All patients experienced symptoms related to catumaxomab mode of action with a safety profile comparable in nature to the first i.p. treatment cycle. No hypersensitivity reactions were observed.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Pharmacokinetics of catumaxomab during and after four intraperitoneal infusions of 10, 20, 50 and 150 micrograms catumaxomab were investigated in 13 patients with symptomatic malignant ascites due to EpCAM-positive carcinomas.

The variability between subjects was high. The geometric mean plasma Cmax was approximately 0.5 ng/ml (range 0 to 2.3), and the geometric mean plasma AUC was approximately 1.7 day* ng/ml (range &lt; LLOQ (lower limit of quantification) to 13.5). The geometric mean apparent terminal plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) was approximately 2.5 days (range 0.7 to 17).

Catumaxomab was detectable in the ascites fluid and in plasma. The concentrations increased with the number of infusions and the doses applied in most patients. Plasma levels tended to decline after achieving a maximum after each dose.

## Special populations

No studies have been conducted.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Administration of catumaxomab in animal models did not result in any signs of abnormal or drug-related acute toxicity or signs of local intolerance at the injection/infusion site. However, these findings are of limited value due to the high species-specificity of catumaxomab.

Repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been performed.

## Method of administration

The catheter for intraperitoneal administration should be placed under ultrasound guidance by a physician experienced in intraperitoneal administration procedures. The catheter is used for ascites drainage and infusion of diluted Removab and sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. It is recommended that the catheter remains in the abdominal cavity during the entire treatment period. It can be removed the day after the last infusion.

Prior to each Removab administration the ascites fluid must be drained until stop of spontaneous flow or symptom relief (see section 4.4). Subsequently, prior to each Removab administration 500 ml

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection shall be infused to support distribution of the antibody in the abdominal cavity.

Removab must be administered intraperitoneally over an infusion time of at least 3 hours via a constant infusion pump system as described below:

- The 50 ml syringe containing the diluted Removab solution for infusion is installed in the precision pump.
- The connected perfusion tubing equipment of the precision pump is prefilled with the diluted Removab solution for infusion. A perfusion tubing of an inner diameter of 1 mm and a length of 150 cm must be used.
- The perfusion tubing is connected to the Y-connection.
- Parallel to each Removab application 250 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection are infused via an infusion valve / Y connection in the perfusion lead of the catheter.
- The pump speed is adjusted according to the volume to be administered and the scheduled infusion time.
- When the 50 ml syringe containing the diluted Removab solution for infusion is empty it is replaced with a 50 ml syringe containing 20 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection until the end of the scheduled infusion time to clear the dead volume in the perfusion lead (approximately 2 ml) under unchanged conditions. The remaining sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection can be discarded.
- The catheter is kept closed until the next infusion.
- The day after the last infusion a drainage of ascites until stop of spontaneous flow is performed. Subsequently, the catheter can be removed.

1 st dose

2 nd dose

20 micrograms on day 3

3 rd dose

50 micrograms on day 7

4 th dose

150 micrograms on day 10

10 micrograms on day 0 Medicinal product no longer authorised

Removab has to be administered as constant rate intraperitoneal infusion with an infusion time of at least 3 hours. In clinical studies infusion times of 3 hours and 6 hours were investigated. For the first of the four doses an infusion time of 6 hours may be considered depending on the patient's health condition.

An interval of at least two infusion free calendar days must elapse between infusion days. The interval between the infusion days can be prolonged in case of relevant adverse reactions. The overall treatment period should not exceed 20 days.

## Monitoring

Adequate monitoring of the patient after end of Removab infusion is recommended. In the pivotal study patients were monitored for 24 h after each infusion.

## Special populations

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

Patients with hepatic impairment of a higher severity grade than moderate and / or with more than 70% of the liver metastasised and / or portal vein thrombosis / obstruction have not been investigated. Treatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of benefit / risk (see section 4.4).

## Renal impairment

Patients with renal impairment of a higher severity grade than mild have not been investigated. Treatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of benefit / risk (see section 4.4).

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of Removab in the paediatric population in the granted indication.

## Method of administration

## Removab must be administered as an intraperitoneal infusion only .

Removab must not be administered by intraperitoneal bolus or by any other route of administration. For information on the perfusion system to be used see section 4.4.

## Precautions to be taken before administering the medicinal product

Before administration of Removab the concentrate for solution for infusion is diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. The diluted Removab solution for infusion is administered intraperitoneally as constant rate infusion using an adequate pump system.

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Hypersensitivity to murine (rat and / or mouse) proteins.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Removab must not be administered as a bolus or by any route other than intraperitoneally.

## Cytokine release related symptoms

As release of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic cytokines is initiated by the binding of catumaxomab to immune and tumour cells, cytokine release related clinical symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting and chills have been very commonly reported during and after the Removab administration (see section 4.8). Dyspnoea and hypo-/ hypertension are commonly observed. In the clinical studies in patients with malignant ascites, 1,000 mg paracetamol intravenously was routinely administered prior to Removab infusion for pain and pyrexia control. Despite this premedication, patients experienced the adverse reactions described above with an intensity of up to grade 3, according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the US National Cancer Institute, version 3.0. Other or additional standard pre-medication with analgesic / antipyretic / nonsteroidal antiphlogistic medicinal products is recommended.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), which may also occur commonly due to the mechanism of action of catumaxomab, develops, in general, within 24 hours after Removab infusion, showing symptoms of fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea and leucocytosis (see section 4.8). Standard therapy or premedication, e.g. analgesic / antipyretic / nonsteroidal antiphlogistic is appropriate to limit the risk.

## Abdominal pain

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Abdominal pain was commonly reported as an adverse reaction. This transient effect is considered partially a consequence of the intraperitoneal route of administration.

## Performance status and BMI

A solid performance status expressed as Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 17 (to be assessed after drainage of ascites fluid) and Karnofsky Index &gt; 60 is required prior to Removab therapy.

## Acute infections

In presence of factors interfering with the immune system, in particular acute infections, the administration of Removab is not recommended.

## Ascites drainage

Appropriate medical management of ascites drainage is a prerequisite for Removab treatment in order to assure stable circulatory and renal functions. This must at least include ascites drainage until stop of spontaneous flow or symptom relief, and, if appropriate, supportive replacement therapy with crystalloids and / or colloids.

Patients with hemodynamic insufficiency, oedema or hypoproteinaemia Blood volume, blood protein, blood pressure, pulse and renal function should be assessed before each Removab infusion. Conditions such as hypovolaemia, hypoproteinaemia, hypotension, circulatory decompensation and acute renal impairment must be resolved prior to each Removab infusion. Hepatic impairment or portal vein thrombosis / obstruction Patients with hepatic impairment of a higher severity grade than moderate and / or with more than 70% of the liver metastasised and / or portal vein thrombosis / obstruction have not been investigated. Treatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of benefit / risk. Renal impairment Patients with renal impairment of a higher severity grade than mild have not been investigated. Treatment of these patients with Removab should only be considered after a thorough evaluation of benefit / risk. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of catumaxomab in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Removab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether catumaxomab/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue / abstain from Removab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

No data on the effect of catumaxomab on fertility are available.

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Removab has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients experiencing infusion-related symptoms should be advised not to drive and use machines until symptoms abate.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

Adverse reactions are derived from an integrated safety analysis including 12 clinical studies. 728 patients received catumaxomab intraperitoneally, 293 patients as 6 hour - and 435 patients as 3 hour infusions.

The overall safety profile of Removab is characterised by cytokine-release related symptoms and gastrointestinal reactions.

Cytokine-release related reactions: SIRS a potentially life-threatening combination of tachycardia, fever and/or dyspnoea, can develop within 24 hours after a catumaxomab infusion and resolves under symptomatic treatment. Other cytokine-release related reactions such as fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting are very commonly reported reactions in intensity of CTCAE grade 1 and 2 (US National Cancer Institute, version 4.0). These symptoms reflect the mechanism of action of catumaxomab and are in general fully reversible.

Gastrointestinal reactions like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are very common and occur mostly with CTCAE grade 1 or 2, but were also observed in higher grades, and respond to adequate symptomatic treatment.

The safety profile of catumaxomab using a 3h versus a 6h infusion time is in general comparable in regards to nature, frequency and severity.  An increased frequency of some adverse reactions was seen in relation to 3h administration including chills and hypotension (grades 1 / 2), diarrhoea (all grades) and fatigue (grade 1 / 2).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

In Table 1, adverse reactions are listed by organ class. Frequency groupings are defined as follows: very common ( ≥ 1/10), common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100).

Common Uncommon General disorders and administration site conditions Very common Common Uncommon * were also reported as serious adverse reactions underlined: see section 'Description of selected adverse reactions' Description of selected adverse reactions The following definitions of CTCAE criteria of the US National Cancer Institute (version 4.0) apply: CTCAE grade 1 = mild, CTCAE grade 2 = moderate, CTCAE grade 3 = severe, CTCAE grade 4 = life-threatening Cytokine release related symptoms with higher intensities In 5.1% of patients pyrexia reached an intensity of CTCAE grade 3 as it was the case with cytokine release syndrome (1.0%), chills (0.8%), nausea (3.4%), vomiting (4.4%), dyspnoea (1.6%) and hypo/hypertension (2.1% / 0.8%). In one patient (0.1%) dyspnoea and in 3 patients (0.4%) hypotension was reported in CTCAE grade 4 intensity.  Symptoms of pain and pyrexia can be ameliorated or avoided by pre-medication (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)

In 3.8% of the patients symptoms of SIRS were observed within 24 hours after catumaxomab infusion. In three patients (0.4%) an intensity of CTCAE grade 4 was observed. These reactions resolved under symptomatic treatment.

## Abdominal pain

In 43.7% of patients abdominal pain was reported as an adverse reaction reaching grade 3 in 8.2 % of patients, but it resolved under symptomatic treatment.

## Hepatic enzymes

Transient increase in hepatic enzymes was commonly observed after the administration of Removab. In general, the changes in laboratory parameters were not clinically relevant and mostly returned to baseline after end of treatment.

Only in case of clinically relevant or persisting increase further diagnostics or therapy should be considered.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No case of overdose has been reported. Patients receiving a higher than recommended dose of catumaxomab experienced more severe (grade 3) adverse reactions.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01XC09 Mechanism of action Catumaxomab is a trifunctional rat-mouse hybrid monoclonal antibody that is specifically directed against the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and the CD3 antigen. The EpCAM antigen is overexpressed on most carcinomas (Table 2). CD3 is expressed on mature T-cells as a component of the T-cell receptor. A third functional binding site in the Fc-region of catumaxomab enables interaction with accessory immune cells via Fc γ receptors. Due to catumaxomab's binding properties, tumour cells, T-cells and accessory immune cells come in close proximity. Thereby, a concerted immunoreaction against tumour cells is induced which includes different mechanisms of action such as T-cell activation, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and phagocytosis. This results in destruction of tumour cells. Table 2 EpCAM expression in most relevant ascites causing cancer types Ovarian Gastric Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Pharmacodynamic effects

The anti-tumour activity of catumaxomab has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo . Effective catumaxomab-mediated killing of tumour cells in vitro was observed for target cells with low and high expression of the EpCAM antigen, independent of the primary tumour type. The in vivo anti-tumour activity of catumaxomab was confirmed in an immunologically compromised mouse model of ovarian carcinoma, where tumour development was delayed by an intraperitoneal treatment with catumaxomab and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

## Clinical efficacy

The efficacy of catumaxomab was demonstrated in two phase III clinical studies. Patients of nonCaucasian origin have not been included in these clinical studies.

## IP-REM-AC-01

A pivotal, two-arm, randomised, open-label, phase II/III clinical trial in 258 patients with symptomatic malignant ascites due to EpCAM-positive carcinomas of whom 170 were randomised to catumaxomab treatment. This study compared paracentesis plus catumaxomab versus paracentesis alone (control).

Catumaxomab was applied in patients where standard therapy was not available or no longer feasible and who had a Karnofsky performance status of at least 60. Catumaxomab was administered as four intraperitoneal infusions with increased doses of 10, 20, 50 and 150 micrograms on day 0, 3, 7 and 10, respectively (see section 4.2). In the pivotal study IP-REM-AC-01 98.1% of patients were hospitalised for a median of 11 days.

In this study, the primary efficacy endpoint was puncture-free survival, which was a composite endpoint defined as the time to first need for therapeutic ascites puncture or death, whichever occurred first. The results for puncture-free survival and time to first need for therapeutic ascites puncture in terms of medians and hazard ratios are presented in Table 3. Kaplan Meier estimates for time to first need for therapeutic ascites puncture are given in Figure 1.

The efficacy of the treatment with paracentesis and catumaxomab in patients with malignant ascites due to EpCAM-positive carcinomas was statistically significantly superior to that with paracentesis alone in terms of puncture-free survival and time to first need for therapeutic ascites puncture.

After completion of the study, patients were further observed until the end of their lifetime to assess overall survival (Table 4).

Altogether 45 out of 88 (51%) patients in the control arm crossed-over to achieve active treatment with catumaxomab.

## IP-CAT-AC-03

This confirmatory two-arm, randomized, open label, phase IIIb study in 219 epithelial cancer patients with symptomatic malignant ascites requiring therapeutic ascites puncture investigated treatment with catumaxomab plus 25 mg prednisolone premedication vs. catumaxomab alone. Catumaxomab was administered as four 3-hour constant-rate i.p. infusions in doses of 10, 20, 50 and 150 micrograms on day 0, 3, 7 and 10, respectively, in both groups. The patient population was comparable to the pivotal study.

In order to assess the impact of prednisolone premedication on safety and efficacy the primary safety endpoint 'composite safety score' and the co-primary efficacy endpoint 'puncture-free survival' were investigated.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The composite safety score evaluated the frequency and severity of the main known adverse reactions pyrexia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain in both treatment groups. Administration of prednisolone as premedication did not result in a reduction of these adverse reactions.

The primary efficacy endpoint, puncture-free survival, was a composite endpoint defined as the time to first need for therapeutic ascites puncture or death, whichever occurred first (identical to the pivotal study).

## Immunogenicity

The induction of human anti-murine (rat and / or mouse) antibodies (HAMAs/HARAs) is an intrinsic effect of murine monoclonal antibodies. Current data on catumaxomab derived from the pivotal study show that only 5.6% of patients (7/124 patients) were HAMA positive before the 4th infusion. HAMAs were present in 94% of patients one month after the last catumaxomab infusion. No hypersensitivity reactions were observed.

Patients who developed HAMAs 8 days after catumaxomab treatment showed better clinical outcome, as measured by puncture-free survival, time to next puncture and overall survival, compared with HAMA-negative patients.

In a feasibility study evaluating a second i.p. infusion cycle consisting of 10, 20, 50 and 150 micrograms of catumaxomab in 8 patients with malignant ascites due to carcinoma (IP-CAT-AC-04)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ADA was detectable in all available ascites and plasma samples at screening. The patients remained ADA positive during treatment phase and follow-up. Despite pre-existing ADA values all patients received all 4 catumaxomab infusions. The median puncture-free survival time was 47.5 days, median time to first therapeutic puncture 60.0 days and median overall survival 406.5 days. All patients experienced symptoms related to catumaxomab mode of action with a safety profile comparable in nature to the first i.p. treatment cycle. No hypersensitivity reactions were observed.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Pharmacokinetics of catumaxomab during and after four intraperitoneal infusions of 10, 20, 50 and 150 micrograms catumaxomab were investigated in 13 patients with symptomatic malignant ascites due to EpCAM-positive carcinomas.

The variability between subjects was high. The geometric mean plasma Cmax was approximately 0.5 ng/ml (range 0 to 2.3), and the geometric mean plasma AUC was approximately 1.7 day* ng/ml (range &lt; LLOQ (lower limit of quantification) to 13.5). The geometric mean apparent terminal plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) was approximately 2.5 days (range 0.7 to 17).

Catumaxomab was detectable in the ascites fluid and in plasma. The concentrations increased with the number of infusions and the doses applied in most patients. Plasma levels tended to decline after achieving a maximum after each dose.

## Special populations

No studies have been conducted.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Administration of catumaxomab in animal models did not result in any signs of abnormal or drug-related acute toxicity or signs of local intolerance at the injection/infusion site. However, these findings are of limited value due to the high species-specificity of catumaxomab.

Repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been performed.

## Method of administration

The catheter for intraperitoneal administration should be placed under ultrasound guidance by a physician experienced in intraperitoneal administration procedures. The catheter is used for ascites drainage and infusion of diluted Removab and sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection. It is recommended that the catheter remains in the abdominal cavity during the entire treatment period. It can be removed the day after the last infusion.

Prior to each Removab administration the ascites fluid must be drained until stop of spontaneous flow or symptom relief (see section 4.4). Subsequently, prior to each Removab administration 500 ml

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection shall be infused to support distribution of the antibody in the abdominal cavity.

Removab must be administered intraperitoneally over an infusion time of at least 3 hours via a constant infusion pump system as described below:

- The 50 ml syringe containing the diluted Removab solution for infusion is installed in the precision pump.
- The connected perfusion tubing equipment of the precision pump is prefilled with the diluted Removab solution for infusion. A perfusion tubing of an inner diameter of 1 mm and a length of 150 cm must be used.
- The perfusion tubing is connected to the Y-connection.
- Parallel to each Removab application 250 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection are infused via an infusion valve / Y connection in the perfusion lead of the catheter.
- The pump speed is adjusted according to the volume to be administered and the scheduled infusion time.
- When the 50 ml syringe containing the diluted Removab solution for infusion is empty it is replaced with a 50 ml syringe containing 20 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection until the end of the scheduled infusion time to clear the dead volume in the perfusion lead (approximately 2 ml) under unchanged conditions. The remaining sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection can be discarded.
- The catheter is kept closed until the next infusion.
- The day after the last infusion a drainage of ascites until stop of spontaneous flow is performed. Subsequently, the catheter can be removed.

## 1. What Removab is and what it is used for

<!-- image -->

Removab contains the active substance catumaxomab, a monoclonal antibody. It recognises a protein on the surface of cancer cells and recruits immune cells to destroy them.

Removab is used to treat malignant ascites, when standard treatment is not available or no longer feasible. Malignant ascites is an accumulation of fluid in the abdominal space (peritoneal cavity) resulting from certain types of cancer.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Removab

## Do not use Removab

- -if you are allergic to catumaxomab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)

Medicinal product no longer authorised

- -if you are allergic to murine proteins (from rat and / or mouse)

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Removab. It is important to tell your doctor if you have any of the following:

- -undrained fluid in your abdominal cavity
- -cold hands and feet, light headedness, difficulty passing urine, increased heart rate, and weakness (symptoms of low blood volume)
- -weight gain, weakness, shortness of breath and fluid retention (symptoms of low blood protein levels)
- -feeling dizzy and faint (symptoms of low blood pressure)
- -problems with your heart and circulation
- -kidney or liver problems
- -an infection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Before you start using Removab your doctor will check your:

- -Body Mass Index (BMI), which depends on your height and weight
- -Karnofsky Index, a measure of your general performance status.

You are required to have a BMI above 17 (after drainage of the ascites fluid) and a Karnofsky Index above 60 to use this medicine.

Infusion-related side effects and abdominal pain are very common (see section 4). You will be given other medicines to reduce fever, pain or inflammation caused by Removab (see section 3).

## Children and adolescents

Removab should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.

## Other medicines and Removab

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.You should not use Removab if you are pregnant unless clearly necessary.

## Driving and using machines

If you experience side effects such as dizziness or chills during or after administration, you should not drive or use machines until they disappear.

## 3. How to use Removab

You will be given Removab under the supervision of a doctor experienced in treating cancer. After the Removab infusion you will be observed as decided by your doctor.

Before starting and during treatment, you will be given other medicines to reduce fever, pain or inflammation caused by Removab.

Removab is given as 4 intraperitoneal infusions with increasing dose (10, 20, 50 and 150 micrograms), separated at least by 2 infusion-free calendar days (for example you will receive infusion on day 0, 3, 7, 10). The infusion must be administered at constant rate with duration time of at least 3 hours. The overall treatment period should not exceed 20 days.

A catheter will be placed in your abdominal space (intraperitoneal) for the whole treatment period, until the day after your last infusion.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The most common serious side effects of Removab are infusion-related side effects and side effects related to the gastrointestinal system (stomach and gut).

## Infusion-related side effects

During and after infusion with Removab more than 1 in 10 patients (very common) will probably experience infusion-related side effects. The most common infusion-related side effects, which are mostly mild to moderate, are fever, chills, feeling sick and vomiting.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

If such symptoms occur, please inform your doctor as soon as possible . Your doctor may consider reducing the infusion rate of Removab or giving you additional treatment to reduce these symptoms.

A complex of symptoms including very fast heartbeat, fever and shortness of breath can develop in up to 4 out of 100 patients. These symptoms occur mainly within 24 hours after a Removab infusion and can become life-threatening, but can be treated well with additional therapy.

If such symptoms occur, speak to a doctor immediately , as these side effects require immediate attention and treatment.

## Side effects related to the gastrointestinal system

Gastrointestinal reactions like abdominal pain, feeling sick, vomiting and diarrhoea occur in more than 1 in 10 patients (very common), but are mostly mild to moderate and respond well to additional treatment.

If such symptoms occur, please inform your doctor as soon as possible . Your doctor may consider reducing the infusion rate of Removab or giving you additional treatment to reduce these symptoms.

## · Grounds for one additional renewal

Based upon the data that have become available since the granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance of Removab remains positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely monitored for the following reasons:

- Uncertainty in the knowledge about the rare unfavourable effects since the safety database is still very limited due to the low number of patients treated with Removab.

Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Removab, which requires the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time.
