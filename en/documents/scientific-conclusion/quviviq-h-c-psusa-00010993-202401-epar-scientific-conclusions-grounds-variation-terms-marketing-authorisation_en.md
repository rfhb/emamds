## Annex IV

Scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for daridorexant, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on hypersensitivity, abnormal dreams, nightmares and somnambulism from spontaneous and solicited reports including in some cases a close temporal relationship, a positive dechallenge and/or re-challenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between daridorexant and hypersensitivity (including rash, urticaria) and abnormal dreams, nightmares and somnambulism is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing daridorexant should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for daridorexant the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing daridorexant is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
