## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for alogliptin, alogliptin / metformin, alogliptin / pioglitazone, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of available data on bullous pemphigoid and interstitial nephritis from the literature and spontaneous reports, a close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between alogliptin and bullous pemphigoid and interstitial nephritis is at least a reasonable possibility/established. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing alogliptin, alogliptin / metformin, alogliptin / pioglitazone should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for alogliptin, alogliptin / metformin, alogliptin / pioglitazone the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing alogliptin, alogliptin / metformin, alogliptin / pioglitazone is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
