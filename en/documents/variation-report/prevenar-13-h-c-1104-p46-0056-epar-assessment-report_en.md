## Clinical study

Protocol B1851037: Final 1- and 2-Year Report: A Phase 4, Open-label Trial Describing the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of the 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Preterm Compared to Term Infants;

## Description

## Methods

## Objectives

Primary Objectives:

- To describe the pneumococcal  immune  response induced by pneumococcal 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) when measured 1 month after the infant series in preterm infants compared to term infants ( ≥ 37 weeks of gestation)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- To evaluate the safety profile of 13vPnC administered at 2, 3, 4, and 12 months of age to preterm  and  term  infants,  as  measured  by  the  incidence  rates  of  local  reactions,  systemic events, and adverse events (AEs)

Secondary Objective: The secondary objective of this study was to describe the pneumococcal immune response  induced  by  13vPnC  when  measured  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose  in  preterm  infants compared to term infants ( ≥ 37 weeks of gestation).

## Exploratory Objectives:

- To describe the pneumococcal immune response induced by 13vPnC when measured 1 month after the infant series in the following preterm infant subgroups:
- o Born  at  more  than  or  equal  to  32  weeks  and  less  than  37  weeks  of  gestation  (32 ≤ gestational age [GA] &lt;37)
- o Born at more than or equal to 29 weeks and less than 32 weeks of gestation (29 ≤ GA &lt;32)
- o Born at less than 29 weeks of gestation (GA &lt;29)
- To describe the pneumococcal immune response induced by 13vPnC when measured before and 1 month after the toddler dose in the following preterm infant subgroups:
- o Born at more than or equal to 32 weeks and less than 37 weeks of gestation (32 ≤ GA &lt;37)
- o Born at more than or equal to 29 weeks and less than 32 weeks of gestation (29 ≤ GA &lt;32)
- o Born at less than 29 weeks of gestation (GA &lt;29)

## Study design

This  was  a  multicenter,  Phase  4,  open-label,  2-arm,  parallel-group  study  to  assess  the  safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 13vPnC in preterm infants compared to term infants ( ≥ 37 weeks of gestation) receiving 13vPnC at 2, 3, 4, and 12 months of age. This was a post-authorization safety study carried out in response to a request from the European Medicines Agency.

## Treatments

No vaccinations were given during the study period covered by this report.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Immunogenicity  Evaluations:  Blood  samples  were  obtained,  according  to  the  subject's  weight,  at  1 month after the third dose of the infant series (Visit 4, at approximately 5 months of age), just before the toddler dose (Visit 5, at approximately 12 months of age), 1 month after the toddler dose (Visit 6, at  approximately  13  months  of  age),  the  1-year  follow-up  (Visit  7,  at  approximately  24  months  of age), and the 2-year follow-up (Visit 8, at approximately 36 months of age). A total volume of up to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

approximately 5 mL to 25 mL of blood (depending on the subject's weight) was collected during the study.

Serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations to the 13 pneumococcal serotypes in 13vPnC were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in all subjects for each blood sample and expressed as micrograms per milliliter ( μ g/mL).

Assays of serum OPA elicited by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes were performed for all subjects where sufficient sera was available, and the results were reported as OPA titers.

Safety  Evaluations:  AEs  were  collected  and  recorded  on  the  case  report  form  based  on  ancillary information on the electronic diary, clinical evaluation during a study visit, and verbal questioning of the parent or legal guardian about the child ' s health since the last visit. AEs were collected from the signing of the informed consent to Visit 4 and from Visit 5 to Visit 6, and for 24 hours after Visits 7 and 8. All serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded from the signing of the informed consent to Visit 6 and for 24 hours after Visits 7 and 8, and were to be reported at any time an investigator became aware. When a subject withdrew from the study due to an SAE, the SAE was reported in accordance with  the  reporting  requirements.  For  SAEs,  the  active  reporting  period  to  Pfizer  or  its  designated representative began at the time that the subject ' s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) provided informed consent, which was obtained prior to the subject ' s participation in the study, ie, prior to undergoing any study-related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including Visit 6 but no  less  than  28  calendar  days  after  the  last  administration  of  the  investigational  product.  If  an investigator was made aware of any SAE occurring any time after the active reporting period, it was to be  promptly  reported.  Local  reactions  and  systemic  events  were  not  applicable  to  the  study  period covered by this report.

## Statistical Methods

Immunogenicity analyses were performed for 2 populations, the evaluable and all-available immunogenicity populations. The primary immunogenicity population was the evaluable immunogenicity population.

The primary endpoint for each of the pneumococcal serotypes was the proportion of subjects achieving a serotype-specific IgG concentration ≥ 0.35 μ g/mL measured 1 month after the infant series. Within each group, geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of the pneumococcal IgG antibody were calculated for each visit at which blood was drawn.

Additionally, the geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) in antibody concentration (post-vaccination/prevaccination) were summarized by geometric means and confidence interval (CI), and also computed using  the  logarithmically  transformed  assay  results  at  appropriate  time  points,  for  all  groups.  Only subjects with both pre- and post-vaccination results were included in the derivation of GMFRs.

Comparisons  between  Groups  1  and  2  were  constructed  using  geometric  mean  ratios  and  95%  CI following the infant series, prior to the toddler dose, after the toddler dose, and at each persistence time point as data permitted. The OPA data were similarly analysed.

Subgroup  data  in  Group  1  was  descriptively  summarized  by  subgroup,  but  no  formal  comparisons between subgroups were constructed.

The safety populations included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of 13vPnC, and who had a safety observation during the follow-up period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Immunogenicity:

For each of the pneumococcal serotypes, the proportion of the subjects achieving IgG concentration ≥ 0.35 μ g/mL measured 1 month after the infant series was calculated along with an exact, 2-sided 95%  CI.  The  difference  in  the  proportion  between  the  2  groups  was  computed  along  with  exact, unconditional,  2-sided  95%  CI,  with  the  standardized  test  statistics  and  gamma=0.000001.  In addition, the ratio of the GMCs of the 2 groups with 2-sided 95% CI was calculated for each serotype.

For  the  assay  results  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose,  immunogenicity  analyses  were  performed similarly.  In  addition,  the  serotype-specific  fold  rise  in  antibody  concentration  from  the  pre-toddler dose  to  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose  was  derived  for  each  subject  and  summarized  using  GMFR along with 2-sided 95% CI. The 2 groups were compared by computing the ratio of the GMFR along with 2-sided 95% CI.

For the 3 subgroups in Group 1 (32 ≤ GA &lt;37 weeks, 29 ≤ GA  &lt;32 weeks, and GA &lt;29 weeks), the above descriptive statistics were summarized by subgroup following the infant series and the toddler dose.

Serum  OPA  was  described  by  geometric  mean  titer  (GMT)  along  with  2-sided  95%  CI  for  each serotype.  The  OPA  results  following  the  infant  series  and  the  toddler  dose  and  at  1  and  2  years following the toddler dose were analysed in the same manner as IgG concentration.

Proportions  of  the  subjects  achieving  OPA  titers ≥ lower  limit  of  quantitation  (LLOQ)  were  derived. Proportions  were  compared  between  groups  in  a  manner  similar  to  what  was  done  for  the  IgG proportions.

Reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) are presented graphically by group for each serotypespecific pneumococcal IgG antibody concentration and for OPA titers. The RCDCs for each group plot pre-  and  post-vaccination  IgGs  on  the  same  graph  where  appropriate,  distinguishable  by  symbol and/or line style choice. Separate plots were generated for the subgroups in Group 1.

## Safety:

The  safety  endpoints  were  AEs,  local  reactions,  and  systemic  events  including  fever,  and  use  of antipyretic medications to treat and prevent symptoms. AEs were categorized according to the Medical Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  and  were  summarized  by  vaccine  group  for  each  pneumococcal conjugate  vaccination  separately.  All  summaries  showed,  by  vaccine  group,  the  number,  and  the percentage  of  subjects  experiencing  at  least  1  event  and  the  number  of  events.  SAEs  were summarized for the infant series and toddler dose, rather than for each vaccination separately.

Comparisons between Groups 1 and 2 were constructed using Fisher ' s exact test for proportions and 95% CIs. Proportions were also derived for the subgroup data from Group 1, but no formal comparison between subgroups was constructed.

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

Subject Disposition and Demography: Of the 200 subjects enrolled in the study, 176 subjects (88.0%) completed the 1-year follow-up after the toddler dose visit and 161 subjects (80.5%) completed the 2year follow-up after the toddler dose visit.  Twenty  (20)  subjects  (10.0%)  were  withdrawn  from  the study before the 1-year follow-up:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

16 subjects (8.0%) were no longer willing to participate in the study (7 subjects in Group 1 and 9 subjects  in  Group  2)  and  4  subjects  (2.0%)  in  Group  1  were  lost  to  follow-up.  An  additional  15 subjects (7.5%) were withdrawn from the study before the 2-year follow-up: 11 subjects (5.5%) were no longer willing to participate in the study (5 subjects in Group 1 and 6 subjects in Group 2) and 4 subjects (2.0%) no longer met eligibility criteria (2 subjects in Group 1 and 2 subjects in Group 2).

For the evaluable 1-year follow-up immunogenicity population, subjects in Groups 1 and 2 were similar with  respect  to  race,  sex,  and  age  at  Dose  1.  All  subjects  were  white  and  there  were  more  male (55.0%) than female (45.0%) subjects enrolled in Group 1, while there were more female (58.8%) than male (41.3%) subjects enrolled in Group 2. The mean age at Dose 1 was 1.8 months for Group 1 and 1.6 months for Group 2. The mean GA was 30.8 weeks for Group 1 and 39.4 weeks for Group 2. The mean birth weight was 1.5 kg for Group 1 and 3.3 kg for Group 2.

For the evaluable 2-year follow-up immunogenicity population, subjects in Groups 1 and 2 were similar with respect to race, sex, and age at Dose 1. Subjects in Groups 1 and 2 were similar with respect to race, sex, and age at Dose 1. The gender distribution, mean age at Dose 1, mean GA, and mean birth weight were all similar to the evaluable 1-year follow-up immunogenicity population for both groups.

## Immunogenicity results

## Pneumococcal IgG Response

Pneumococcal IgG GMCs for each time point and the ratio of GMCs between groups are presented for the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population  in  Table  11.  The  results  1  month  after  the  infant  series, before the toddler dose, and 1 month after the toddler dose were presented in the primary-analysis report; they are shown again here to provide a frame of reference for the results at the 1- and 2-year follow-up.

Preterm Infant Subgroups (Groups 1A, 1B, and 1C)

Pneumococcal IgG GMCs for each time point were presented for the preterm infant subgroups of the evaluable immunogenicity population. In summary, at the 1- and 2-year follow-up, for all serotypes, there were no discernible patterns in GMCs across the preterm infant subgroups based on GA. For all serotypes, there was a pattern of decline of GMCs from 1 month after the toddler dose to the 1-year follow-up. For the majority of serotypes, GMCs remained higher than or similar to those before the toddler dose.

CHMP's comment: The three groups were children born 32 ≤GA &lt;37 wks, 29 ≤GA &lt;32 and GA ≤29 wks. As in the primary report for this study (infant and boster dose) it is noted that the first subgroup generally had numerically higher IgG GMC compared to the other groups, but the differences were not statistically differences (overlapping 95% CI).

## Pneumococcal IgG Concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL

The proportion of subjects in the evaluable immunogenicity population with a residual pneumococcal IgG concentration ≥0.35 μ g/mL at the 1-year follow-up was numerically lower for subjects in Group 1 compared to Group 2 for all serotypes and statistically significantly lower (upper limit of 95% CI for the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

difference  &lt;0)  for  6  of  13  serotypes  (3,  4,  9V,  18C,  19A,  and  23F).  At  the  2-year  follow-up,  the proportion  of  subjects  in  the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population  with  IgG  concentrations  ≥0.35 μg/mL  was  numerically  lower  for  subjects  in  Group  1  compared  to  Group  2  for  all  serotypes  and statistically significantly lower (upper limit of 95% CI for the difference &lt;0) for 3 serotypes (18C, 19A, and 23F).

A comparison of the Group 1 and Group 2 pneumococcal OPA GMTs at each time point, along with ratios, is presented for the evaluable immunogenicity population in Table 13. For all serotypes, GMTs at the 1- and 2-year follow-up were generally numerically higher than or similar to those before the toddler dose and numerically lower than those 1 month after the toddler dose. At the 1-year follow-up, Group 1 had significantly lower GMTs compared to Group 2 for serotypes 6A, 18C, 19A, and 23F (the upper  limit  of  the  95%  CI  ratios  of  the  GMTs  were  &lt;1.0).  At  the  2-year  follow-up,  Group  1  had significantly lower GMTs compared to Group 2 for serotypes 5 and 19A (the upper limit of the 95% CI ratios of the GMTs were &lt;1.0).

## Preterm Infant Subgroups (Groups 1A, 1B, and 1C)

GMTs  at  each  time  point  were  presented  for  the  preterm  infant  subgroups  of  the  evaluable immunogenicity population  (data  not  shown  in  this  AR).  For  the  3  preterm  infant  subgroups,  there were no discernible patterns in GMTs across the preterm infant subgroups based on GA at the 1- and 2-year  follow-up.  GMTs  at  the  1-  and  2-year  follow-up  were  generally  numerically  higher  than  or similar to those before the toddler dose and numerically lower than those 1 month after the toddler dose for all serotypes.

CHMP's comment: As for the IgG GMCs it is noted that the first subgroup generally had numerically higher IgG GMC compared to the other groups, but the differences were not statistically differences (overlapping 95% CI).

## OPA Titer ≥LLOQ

The  proportion  of  subjects  of  the  evaluable  immunogenicity  population  who  had  pneumococcal  OPA antibody titers ≥LLOQ at the 1-year follow-up was numerically lower for subjects in Group 1 compared to Group 2 for the majority of serotypes and statistically significantly lower (upper limit of 95% CI &lt;0) for serotypes 6A, 18C, 19A, and 23F.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This trend was also observed at the 2-year follow-up, with the addition that OPA antibody titers ≥LLOQ was also statistically significantly lower (upper limit of 95% CI &lt;0) for serotype 5 as well.

There were no discernible patterns in the proportion of subjects who had OPA antibody titres ≥LLOQ among  preterm  infant  subgroups  based  on  GA  for  the  evaluable  and  all-available  immunogenicity populations at the 1-year follow-up and at the 2-year follow-up.

## MAH Immunogenicity conclusions

This  study  assessed  the  immunogenicity  of  13vPnC  in  preterm  infants  compared  to  term  infants receiving 13vPnC at 2, 3, 4, and 12 months of age. During the vaccination phase, which was detailed in the primary-analysis report, the immune responses to 13vPnC were lower for preterm infants than for term infants after both the infant series and toddler dose. This report evaluated the persistence of antibody responses at the 1- and 2-year follow-up among former preterm (Group 1) and term (Group 2)  infants,  in  the  absence  of  any  additional  13vPnC  vaccination.  The  differences  in  the  immune responses  between  former  preterm  and  term  infants  persisted  through  2  years  after  the  last vaccination.

At  the  1-  and  2-year  follow-up,  in  both  groups,  GMCs  for  all  serotypes  were,  with  few  exceptions, numerically higher than or similar to those before the toddler dose; and were numerically lower than those 1 month after the toddler dose. These findings were consistent with decay of antibody from the booster response after the toddler dose.

At both the 1- and 2-year follow-up, the Group 1/Group 2 GMC ratios were &lt;1.0 for all 13 serotypes, and the difference was statistically significant for the majority of serotypes.

There were no discernible patterns in GMCs across the preterm infant subgroups based on GA at the 1and 2-year follow-up.

At the 1- and 2-year follow-up, the proportion of subjects in the evaluable immunogenicity population with a residual pneumococcal IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL was lower for Group 1 than Group 2 for all serotypes.

Fewer differences in OPA GMTs between groups were apparent than in IgG GMCs. At the 1-year followup, Group 1 had significantly lower GMTs compared with Group 2 for serotypes 6A, 18C, 19A, and 23F. At the 2-year follow-up, Group 1 had significantly lower GMTs compared with Group 2 for serotypes 5 and 19A.

For the 3 preterm infant subgroups, there were no discernible patterns in GMTs across the preterm infant subgroups based on GA at the 1- and 2-year follow-up.

At both the 1- and 2-year follow-up, the proportion of subjects who had a pneumococcal OPA antibody titer  ≥LLOQ was numerically lower for Group 1 compared to Group 2 for the majority of serotypes. There were no discernible patterns in the proportion of subjects who had OPA antibody titers ≥LLOQ among preterm infant subgroups based on GA.

CHMP's comment: The results of this long-term follow-up are in agreement with the primary phase of the study. It is not surprising that the lower titres seen after the primary and booster dose in pre-term infants  compared to full term infants remain lower at one and 2 years after the booster dose. It is somewhat reassuring that the differences were generally smaller when looking at functional immune responses, i.e. OPA responses between the two groups.

## Safety results

At the 1-year follow-up, SAEs overall were reported for similar proportions of subjects in Group 1 (13 subjects, 13.1%) and in Group 2 (8 subjects, 8.2%) (p=0.357). Infections and infestations (including pneumonia, bronchitis and respiratory tract infection) were among the most common SAEs, and were reported for significantly more subjects in Group 1 (12 subjects, 12.1%) than in Group 2 (3 subjects, 3.1%) (p=0.029).

At the 2-year follow-up, SAEs were reported for similar proportions of subjects in Group 1 (6 subjects, 6.8%)  and  in  Group  2  (8  subjects,  9.1%).  Infections  and  infestations,  the  most  common  SAE  by system organ class (SOC), were reported for a similar proportion of subjects in Group 1 (3 subjects, 3.4%) and Group 2 (4 subjects, 4.5%).

None of the AEs reported at the 1- and 2-year follow-up were considered related to the investigational product. No subjects were withdrawn from the study for safety-related reasons and no deaths were reported during the study period covered in this report.

## Discussion on clinical aspects

The results of this 2-year follow up of vaccination of preterm infants compared to full-term infants are in agreement with the results of the primary phase of the study, as evaluated in type II variation II76. The pre-term infants have lower IgG GMCs to the majority of serotypes at 1 and 2 years after the booster dose compared to the full-term infants, and to a lesser degree also lower OPA titres. When looking at subgroups of pre-term infants, the group with the highest gestational age (GA) at birth had consistently higher immune responses compared to the two groups with lower GA, but there were no consistent differences between these two latter groups. Thus, it is possible that the immune responses vary according to GA, but the data presented in this study do not provide clear evidence for this. The data  support  the  conclusions  drawn  in  variation  II76,  i.e.  preterm  infants  generally  had  lower responses than the full term infants, but the responses were still considered adequate to provide a significant benefit for these children. Thus, the rapporteur does not consider it necessary to update the SPC to include these new data which were very much as expected.

The safety r the MAH should provide the assessment of immune response against HPV antigens from study V59P40 when available.

Results from this follow-up study do not cause any new safety concerns.
