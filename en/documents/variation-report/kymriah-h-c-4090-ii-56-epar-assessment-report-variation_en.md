Update of sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update efficacy and safety information in paediatric population based on study CCTL019C2202, a phase II, single arm, multi-center open label trial to determine the safety and efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (BIANCA).

The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

## 2. Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance

In the current variation application, the MAH has submitted the primary analysis results of paediatric study CCTL019C2202 (C2202), which was conducted in compliance with PIP EMEA-001654-PIP02-17M01. The MAH considers that the submitted study results do not support a paediatric indication. The aim of this application is to update the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1 to include the primary analysis results from study C2202. Study C2202 is the only clinical measure of this PIP, which is one of two opened PIPs for Kymriah. The PDCO issued a positive outcome for the final compliance check of EMEA-001654-PIP0217-M01 on 24-June-2022.

Study C2202 is a phase II, single arm, multi-centre open-label trial to determine the safety and efficacy of  tisagenlecleucel  in  paediatric  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  mature  B-cell  non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The primary endpoint of the study was overall response rate (ORR) as determined by local investigator assessment, and important secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

This interim analysis covered 33 patients infused with tisagenlecleucel. One enrolled patient died prior to infusion. The efficacy analysis set (EAS) consisted of 24 patients &lt;18 years of age, and four patients ≥ 18 and &lt;25 years of age. The patients enrolled had relatively advanced disease, with 87.9% at Stage III/IV  at  baseline,  a  median  of  2  lines  of  prior  therapy,  18.2%  with  prior  haematopoietic  stem  cell transplant (HSCT), a high proportion of refractory patients (30.3%), and 54.5% with Burkitt lymphoma. The  data  cutoff  date  (DCO)  for  the  analysis  was  10-Oct-2021,  and  the  median  time  between tisagenlecleucel infusion and DCO was 16.1 months.

At the time of the DCO, the primary endpoint, ORR, was 32.1% (9/28 subjects) (95% CI: 15.9, 52.4), with 7.1% achieving complete response (CR) and 25% achieving partial response (PR) as best overall response  (BOR).  Subgroup  analysis  suggested  a  trend  towards  lower  ORR  in  subjects  with  Burkitt lymphoma (20%) versus other histologies (46.1%). ORR in the DLBCL subgroup was 37.5%, and the two patients achieving CR in the EAS had DLBCL.

At the time of DCO, median DOR in subjects who achieved a BOR of CR/PR was not reached due to short follow up (2.4 months). Of 9 responders, 3 subjects had an event prior to DCO, 3 subjects were censored

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

due to new antineoplastic therapy or HSCT, and 3 subjects were censored due to ongoing without event. As of the DCO date, median PFS was 2.5 months (95% CI: 1.1, 2.9) while median OS was 11.4 months (95% CI: 3.4, NE). Fourteen subjects, including three subjects with a BOR of PR in the EAS, had died at the time of the DCO.

Considering the single arm nature of study C2202, the limited number of patients included in the trial, and  the  relatively  short  follow-up  duration,  the  primary  analysis  results  of  study  C2202  should  be interpreted  with  caution.  Particularly,  there  is  uncertainty  regarding  the  estimates  of  time-to-event endpoints.  In  addition,  39.4%  of  subjects  received  subsequent  anti-neoplastic  medications  after tisagenlecleucel infusion, adding further uncertainty to the estimates of secondary endpoints.

The primary endpoint result in study C2202 may seem to be somewhat in line with, although numerically lower, than the ORR obtained in the adult DLBCL patients enrolled in the pivotal study C2201. In the pivotal study, ORR was 53.0% (95%CI: 43.5, 62.4) and CRR was 39.1%. The numerically lower ORR observed in study C2202 may partly be explained by the patient population enrolled, having had an advanced stage of disease and with a high proportion of patients with Burkitt lymphoma, known to have a  poor  prognosis.  However,  a  comparison  between  the  two  above-mentioned  studies  should  be interpreted with great caution, considering the substantial differences in the study populations, as well as the above-mentioned uncertainties and limitations of study C2202.

Overall, the primary analysis results from study C2202 suggest modest efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in the r/r paediatric mature B-cell NHL population in terms of ORR, with potentially greater efficacy in some patient subgroups with histologies other than Burkitt lymphoma, including DLBCL. Nonetheless, in the absence of an estimate for median DOR, the clinical relevance of the observed ORR cannot be assessed. Further, the available data are insufficient to ascertain which histological subgroups may derive clinically meaningful  benefit  from  tisagenlecleucel  treatment.  In  conclusion,  given  particularly  the  limited enrolment, the single arm nature of the study, and the small histological subgroups, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the clinical relevance of the observed ORR in the overall the r/r paediatric mature B-cell NHL population or in specific histological subgroups.

The overall safety results were consistent with the existing safety profile of tisagenlecleucel, and no new safety findings were observed within the study. However, it is of note that the study population is limited.

Despite the limitations of the study C2202, inclusion of a short description of the study and its results in the SmPC section 5.1 is supported. Considering the high unmet medical need for paediatric patients with r/r mature B-cell NHL, this information may be useful for the prescribers. Due to the single-arm nature of the study, the treatment effect on time-to-event outcomes such as PFS and OS cannot be isolated. Moreover, in the current study these estimates were based on very few patients, and thus additionally hampered by uncertainty. Therefore, the inclusion of PFS and OS outcomes in the SmPC is not endorsed.

The PI has been updated by the MAH according to the CAT/CHMP comments in the RSI. The proposed updates to the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1, and PL section 2 are considered acceptable.

The benefit-risk balance of Kymriah remains positive.

Paediatric  and  young  adult  patients  up  to  and  including  25  years  of  age  with  B  cell  acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse.

Adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy.

Adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy.

Tisagenlecleucel is a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based gene therapy product that contains autologous genetically modified T-cells. The product is manufactured from the patient's own peripheral blood T-cells, which are transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral vector that encodes a CAR directed against human CD19 on the surface of B-cells. The CAR is comprised of a murine single chain antibody  fragment  that  recognises  CD19  and  is  fused  to  intracellular  signalling  domains  from  the costimulatory receptor 4-1BB (CD137) and the T-cell receptor associated CD3 zeta complex. The CD3 zeta component is critical for initiating T-cell activation and anti-tumour activity, while 4-1BB enhances the activation, expansion, and persistence of tisagenlecleucel. Upon binding to CD19 expressing cells, the CAR transmits a signal promoting T-cell activation, expansion, and acquisition of effector functions of tisagenlecleucel, such as cytotoxicity and elimination of CD19 expressing target cells. This allows the genetically  modified  T-cells  to  specifically  target  and  destroy  CD19-positive  malignant  B-cells  in  an antigen dependent, but major histocompatibility complex (MHC) independent manner.

The clinical efficacy and safety data presented in the initial marketing authorisation (MA) application for the DLBCL indication were obtained from the open-label, multi-center, single-arm phase 2 study C2201 in adult patients with r/r DLBCL.

This  type  II  variation,  category  C.I.4,  corresponds  to  the  submission  of  paediatric  study  results performed in compliance with paediatric investigation plan (PIP) Kymriah EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01. Study CCTL019C2202 (C2202) is the only clinical measure of this PIP, which is one of two opened PIPs for Kymriah. Study C2202 (BIANCA) is a phase II, single arm, multi-center open label trial to determine the safety and efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

The MAH considers that the submitted study results do not support a paediatric indication. The aim of the current application is to update the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1 to include the primary analysis results from study C2202 with DCO date of 10-Oct-2021. No updated RMP is proposed with this application. The PDCO issued a positive outcome for the final compliance check of EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01 on 24June-2022.

## 6. Clinical Pharmacology aspects

## 6.1 Methods - analysis of data submitted

Title: A  Phase  II,  single  arm,  multi-center,  open-label  trial  to  determine  the  safety  and  efficacy  of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (BIANCA)

Secondary objectives (Table 8) included:

to characterise the in vivo cellular kinetics (levels, expansion, persistence) of tisagenlecleucel cells into target tissues (blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, CSF, and other tissues if available) as measured by qPCR in relation to safety and efficacy; and to  characterise  the  presence  of  pre-existing  and  treatment  induced  immunogenicity  and  impact  on cellular kinetics and response.

Exploratory endpoints included cellular kinetic parameters by use of tocilizumab and by CRS grade.

Dose: Tisagenlecleucel was given as a single IV infusion. There was no clinical experience on dosing paediatric  subjects  with  B-cell  NHL  with  tisagenlecleucel  prior  to  conducting  Study C2202 .  The recommended dose was based on experience gained from studies in paediatric and young adult subjects with r/r ALL (studies B2202 and B2205J ). Based on the totality of the evidence from dose-safety, doseefficacy, and exposure-response analyses, and the positive benefit-risk observed across the broad range of doses administered, subjects received one of two possible dose ranges determined by the subject's weight during the leukapheresis visit or at baseline:

Subjects ≤ 50 kg: 0.2 to 5 x 10 6  CAR-positive viable T cells per kg body weight Subjects &gt; 50 kg: 0.1 to 2.5 x 10 8  CAR-positive viable T cells.

It was planned to enroll approximately 35 subjects ( ≤25 years, ≥ 6kg) with an aim to infuse at least 26 evaluable subjects (comprising at least 18 paediatric subjects &lt;18 years) with aggressive r/r B-cell NHL (Burkitt lymphoma, DLBCL, PMBCL and GZL).

## Assessor's comment:

Study C2202 is the sole clinical study in an agreed paediatric investigational plan (PIP) (EMEA-001654PIP02-17, EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01) concerning tisagenlecleucel treatment in paediatrics&lt;18 years and ≥6kg with CD19+ r/r mature B-cell NHL. The overall study design is in line with the agreed PIP. The selected doses in study C2202 were identical to the approved dose range for paediatric and young adult B-cell ALL. Clinical pharmacology results are described in the Clinical overview (Module 2.5) only, and no update of Summary of Clinical pharmacology (Module 2.7.2) has been provided.

Peripheral  blood  samples  were  used  to  assess  tisagenlecleucel  cellular  kinetics  using  qPCR.  Flow cytometry methods were used to determine CAR-positive cell levels. Humoral and cellular immunogenicity were also assessed. According to the Applicant, study C2202 was conducted in full compliance with current Good Clinical Practices.

## Analytical Methods

Assays  utilised  for  various  PK  assessments  included  qPCR  and  flow  cytometric  analysis  to  detect tisagenlecleucel-positive  cells  in  peripheral  blood,  bone  marrow,  and/or  CSF,  as  well  as  assays  for determination of rituximab and tocilizumab are summarised below.

## Assessor's comment:

Bioanalytical  reports  (within  study  validation)  have  been  provided.  The  validity  of  the  bioanalytical methods has been assessed previously.

## Pharmacokinetic data analysis

According to the MAH, the cellular kinetic samples were collected in all participants at the visits defined in  the  protocol  assessment  schedule  (Table  below).  Peripheral  blood  samples  were  used  to  assess

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics using qPCR. Flow cytometry methods were used to determine CARpositive cell  levels.  Humoral  and  cellular  immunogenicity were also assessed. PK samples were also obtained  for  tocilizumab  PK  in  tocilizumab-treated  subjects  with  CRS  as  well  as  baseline  rituximab concentrations in subjects who received rituximab prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion.

Table 2. Assessment Schedule (Study C2202 protocol, selected parts of Table 8-1)

<!-- image -->

Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the total viable cell count infused, the total infused CARpositive viable T cells, and the total infused weight-adjusted CAR-positive viable T cells.

The  cellular  kinetic  analysis  data  set  (CKAS)  consisted  of  all  subjects  who  received  an  infusion  of tisagenlecleucel (FAS) who also provided at least one valid cellular kinetic concentration. Tisagenlecleucel concentrations  in  peripheral  blood,  bone  marrow,  and  CSF,  if  available,  were  listed,  graphed,  and summarised by time points as assessed by qPCR for the CAR transgene levels and for CAR-positive viable cells by flow cytometry for CD3+, CD3+/CD4+, and CD3+/CD8+ cells (exploratory only).

Cellular  kinetic  parameters  (Table  2),  along  with  other  relevant  cellular  kinetic  parameters,  were estimated if feasible, from the individual concentration versus time profiles using a non-compartmental approach within the modeling program Phoenix® (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA) and reported by best overall  response  (BOR)  category  and  additionally  by  maximum  CRS  grade,  use  of  tocilizumab,  and tisagenlecleucel  treatment-induced  or  -boosted  anti-tisagenlecleucel  antibodies.  Tocilizumab  PK  was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

summarised by time point and by maximum CRS grade for the TPAS ( i.e. all subjects who took at least one dose of tocilizumab and provided at least one tocilizumab PK concentration).

B cell levels over time will be summarised according to rituximab concentration divided into suitable categories. Graphical analysis and summary statistics may be used to explore the relationship between B cells, transgene persistence and clinical response.

| Tlast                      | The time of last observed quantifiable concentration in peripheral blood (days)                                                          |

The estimation of Tlast is influenced by multiple factors such as duration of follow up and limit of quantification which may impact these conclusions, and longer persistence is anticipated with longer follow-up.

## Assessor's comment:

The  MAH  has  used  standard  non-compartmental  analyses  (NCA)  to  describe  cellular  kinetics  of tisagenlecleucel in patients with r/r DLBCL in study C2202 , which is acceptable.

Immunogenicity is further addressed in the efficacy sections below.

## 6.2 Results

## Demographics

Thirty-three subjects (29 patients [86.8%] aged &lt; 18 years) provided an evaluable cellular kinetic profile and were included in the CKAS. Six subjects (15.8%, all aged &lt;18 years) received at least one dose of tocilizumab  and  were  included  in  the  tocilizumab  PK  analysis  set  (TPAS).  The  median  time  from leukapheresis to tisagenlecleucel infusion was 62.0 days (range: 39 to 125 days). For further details on study population, see the efficacy section.

## Dose

An overview of administered doses in given in Table 15. For subjects weighing &gt;50 kg the median (range) administered dose of tisagenlecleucel was 1.26x10 8  CAR-positive viable T cells (0.30 to 2.38x10 8 ). For subjects weighing ≤50 kg the median (range) dose was 1.90x10 6  cells/kg (0.40 to 7.30x10 6  cells/kg). All patients, except for one, received tisagenlecleucel within the targeted dose range.

Similar doses were administered in the paediatric subgroup. However, for the patients &gt;50kg, subjects ≥18 years were infused with a higher median dose (1.5; range: 0.7 to 2.1x10 8  cells) than subjects &lt;18 years of age (1.18; range: 0.3 to 2.38 x10 8  cells). Similarly, for the patients ≤ 50 kg, subjects ≥ 18 years were infused with a higher median dose (2.40x10 6  cells/kg, N=1) than 1.70 for subjects &lt;18 years of age (range: 0.4 to 7.30x10 6  cells/kg).

## Pharmacokinetic results

## Cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel transgene levels by qPCR in peripheral blood, based on disease response

Following infusion, tisagenlecleucel typically exhibits an initial rapid expansion phase achieving maximal expansion (Cmax) followed by a bi-exponential decline (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Geometric mean and arithmetic mean (SD) concentration-time profiles for tisagenlecleucel (CKAS), by best overall response (C2202 CSR, Figure 14.2-9.1)

<!-- image -->

Cellular PK parameters by best overall response are presented in Table 4. Overall, similar exposure of CAR  T  cells  between  responders  and  non-responders  were  observed.  To  note,  the  inter-individual variability associated with the parameters were high. The Tmax was approximately 13 days in responders (n=12) and non-responders (n=17), and ~11 days in the subject with unknown response. CAR-positive viable T cells demonstrated persistence (Tlast) of the tisagenlecleucel transgene for up to a maximum of 562 days in responders and a maximum of 357 days in non-responders. Similarly, the geometric mean T1/2 was longer in responders compared to non-responders.

The maximal expansion values in three of four subjects (two responders and two non-responders) who were ≥ 18 years of age were within the range of values observed from overall population (n=3; 941-

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

14043 copies/ μ g of genomic DNA), while for one subject the reliable estimate of Cmax could not be derived.

## Assessor's comment:

The MAH has provided descriptive cellular kinetics data obtained in PIP study C2202 from 29 paediatric and four young adult patients with B-cell NHL. The administered doses were within the dose ranges approved for treatment of B-cell ALL in paediatric and young adult patients. Results are reported for the total CKAS ( i.e. including also the four adults).

The geometric mean Cmax was higher in responders (CR/PR, N=12) than non-responders (SD and PD, N=19) based on BOR after tisagenlecleucel infusion. The geometric mean AUC0-28d was similar between

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

responders and  non-responders. CAR-positive viable T cells demonstrated  persistence of the tisagenlecleucel transgene for a maximum of 562 days in responders and 357 days in non-responders. Observed AUC0-28d and Cmax were comparable to that described for adult r/r DLBCL patients (study C2201 ), with slightly shorter Tmax in adults (~13d vs ~9d, respectively).

Any differences observed should be interpreted with caution due to high inter-individual variability and overlapping expansion ranges observed between responders and non-responders. Tlast and t1/2 (reflecting persistence) should not be directly compared between treatment groups and indications because both are dependent on the time of data cut of/follow up period.

## Pharmacokinetic parameters by use of tocilizumab and CRS grade

Exploratory endpoints included cellular kinetic parameters by use of tocilizumab (Table 5) and by CRS grade (Table 6). Considering the high inter-individual variability and overlapping expansion ranges, any exposure differences should be interpreted with caution.

The geometric mean Cmax was approximately 2-fold higher when tocilizumab was administered for management of CRS (n=10) compared to the expansion in subjects who did not receive tocilizumab (n=20). (Table 5). Subjects that experienced CRS generally have greater expansion and generally these patients require tocilizumab. Therefore, the higher expansion following tocilizumab cannot be directly attributed to the use of tocilizumab. Transgene continues to expand and persist following tocilizumab infusion.

The geometric mean Cmax in subjects with grade 1/2 CRS (n=17) was approximately 3-fold higher than the patients with no CRS (n=10) (Table 6). To note, only three patients experienced ≥ grade 3 CRS, therefore, the cellular kinetic parameters in this category with subjects that either did not experience CRS or low-grade CRS (grade 1 or 2) cannot be compared.

Scatter plots (not shown) for net response Geometric mean CAR T cells expansion was similar between responders and non-responders and persistence of CAR T cells was observed for up to 562 days.

## Assessor's comment:

Higher expansion (Cmax and AUC0-28d) of CAR-positive viable T cells was seen in patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 CRS, relative to patients not experiencing CRS. Only three patients experienced grade≥3 CRS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Higher expansion (Cmax and AUC0-28d) of CAR-positive viable T cells was seen in patients who required tocilizumab to treat CRS. CAR T-cell activation is accompanied by extensive release of toxic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, hence patients with higher expansion could be prone to develop treatmentrequiring CRS. Hence, the true influence of tocilizumab on expansion cannot be ascertained directly since, the observation may have been confounded as tocilizumab is given for CRS treatment and CRS is associated with higher expansion.

## 6.3 Discussion

The cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel in 29 paediatric and four young adult patients with CD19+ r/r mature B-cell NHL and who have relapsed following one or more therapies (study C2202 , EMEA-001654PIP02-17-M01), have been described. The geometric mean Cmax was higher in responders (CR/PR, N=12) than  non-responders  (SD  and  PD,  N=19)  based  on  BOR  after  tisagenlecleucel  infusion.  The geometric mean AUC0-28d was similar between responders and non-responders. Longer persistence was observed in responders vs. non-responders, however, the measures of persistence (Tlast and t1/2) should not be directly compared because they are both dependent on the time of data cut of/follow up period.

Observed AUC0-28d and Cmax were comparable to that described for adult r/r DLBCL patients (study C2201 ), with slightly shorter Tmax in adults.

The impact of CRS and tocilizumab on cellular kinetics were assessed using cellular kinetic parameters determined from NCA. Higher expansion of CAR-positive viable T cells was seen in patients experiencing grade 1-2 CRS, relative to patients not experiencing CRS. Higher expansion CAR-positive viable T cells was also seen in patients who required tocilizumab to treat CRS. Importantly, CAR T-cell activation is accompanied by extensive release of toxic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, hence patients with higher expansion could be prone to develop treatment-requiring CRS. Consequently, the true influence of  tocilizumab  on  expansion  cannot  be  ascertained  directly  since,  the  observation  may  have  been confounded as tocilizumab is given for CRS treatment and CRS is associated with higher expansion.

The  proposed  update  of  the  SmPC  section  4.2  Paediatric  population  is  supported.  No  changes  are proposed in section 5.2 which is acceptable.

a) Aggressive B-cell NHL subtypes (Burkitt lymphoma, DLBCL, PMBCL, GZL), in addition, FL subjects may also have been treated; age ≤ 25 years; r/r to 1 or more lines of prior therapies . b) Previous leukapheresis collection or during screening. c) Administered as applicable: fludarabine (30 mg/m2 IV daily for 4 days) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 IV daily for 2 days starting with the first dose of fludarabine). d) Subjects that discontinued treatment and follow-up phase early (post-infusion but prior to M24 visit) continued in Annual Follow-up or Survival Follow-up until End of Study (until all subjects who received tisagenlecleucel completed 2 years of post-treatment phase or discontinued early). e) Conducted under a separate destination protocol

## Figure 2. Study Design, C2202

The  study  had  the  following  phases:  Consent,  Screening,  Pre-treatment,  Treatment  and  Follow-up( Figure 2). Screening began after signing the IRB/EC-approved study ICF. Leukapheresis material was either collected after signing informed consent or was historical non-mobilized leukapheresis material collected at an appropriately certified leukapheresis centre and was of acceptable quality. Enrolment was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

defined as the point at which a subject met all inclusion/exclusion criteria and the subject's leukapheresis material was received at a Novartis manufacturing facility and accepted for manufacturing.

In the Pre-treatment phase, the subject could undergo optional bridging therapy of investigator's choice as needed, and lymphodepleting chemotherapy completed 2-14 days before tisagenlecleucel infusion. Pre-treatment  began  at  enrolment  until  Day-1  (pre-infusion  visit)  and  included  manufacturing  of tisagenlecleucel. Tisagenlecleucel cell product was prepared and released by the manufacturing facility to the study site approximately 4-6 weeks after manufacturing commenced, provided all required safety and quality release criteria had been met.

The Treatment and Follow-up Phase included tisagenlecleucel infusion (Day 1) and safety and efficacy follow-up until all subjects completed 24 months on study or discontinued early. For the purpose of close safety  monitoring  of  subjects,  in  particular  those  with  aggressive  disease  subtypes,  and  for  safely onboarding new sites, a staggered approach was utilized at each site for the first 3 subjects. A mandatory 14-day waiting period had to elapse between infusing the first and second and between the second and third subjects. After the third subject at a site had been infused, subjects could be infused at the site without staggering. The same staggering approach was applied at the study level for subjects diagnosed with Burkitt leukemia. Efficacy and safety assessments were performed at regular intervals until end of study. Efficacy assessments were based on International Pediatric Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Response Criteria  (Sandlund  et  al.,  2015).  The  latest  efficacy  assessment  after  bridging  therapy  and  prior  to infusion was to be used as baseline.

Both a primary and final analysis were planned. The primary analysis was based on all evaluable subjects with aggressive r/r B-cell NHL and was conducted when all evaluable subjects with aggressive r/r B-cell NHL had been infused and followed for at least 6 months from study Day 1 or discontinued early as well as at least 50% of those subjects having a follow-up of at least 9 months from tisagenlecleucel infusion or early discontinuation. The final analysis is to be conducted once all subjects complete the study.

The end of study (EOS) was defined as when all subjects complete the protocol-defined 2-year Treatment and Follow-up  phase  (i.e.,  last  subject  last  Month  24  Visit)  and/or  discontinue  early.  After  EOS,  all subjects are to be asked to continue in a post-study long-term follow-up under a separate destination protocol (CCTL019A2205B), for up to 15 years post-infusion.

## 7.1.2 Study Participants

The target patient population participating in the study included male and female, pediatric patients (&lt; 18 years of age, weighing at least 6 kg), adolescent and young adult patients ( ≤ 25 years of age) with CD19+ r/r  mature  B-cell  NHL,  including  broad  histological  aggressive  subtypes  based  on  the  WHO classification (Swerdlow et al., 2016), such as Burkitt lymphoma, DLBCL, PMBCL, GZL, and FL who had relapsed after 1 or more prior therapies or were primary refractory (had not achieved a CR or PR after the first line of therapy). Patients who had progressed after prior allogeneic and autologous HSCT were allowed to participate in the study.

Protocol  Amendment  1  introduced  some  major  changes  with  regards  to  the  study  population  (see Conduct of the Study for more details):

Allowing  for  inclusion  of  subjects  with  Burkitt  leukemia  who  either  have  measurable  disease  by radiological criteria or bone marrow involvement &gt; 25% (modification of inclusion criteria 2 and 5)

Increasing subject age from &lt; 18 to ≤ 25 years (modification of inclusion criteria 3)

Removing absolute lymphocyte count and CD3+ T cell count requirements (modification of inclusion criteria 7)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Key Inclusion Criteria:

Histologically confirmed (local evaluation) mature B-cell NHL including the following subtypes; Burkitt Lymphoma and Burkitt Leukemia (L3 B-cell ALL) (Burkitt lymphoma), DLBCL, PMBCL, GZL,  and  FL.  Patients  with  B-cell  NHL  associated  with  Nijmegen  breakage  syndrome  were allowed.

Sufficient  formalin-fixed,  paraffin-embedded  tumor  sample  must  have  been  available  for correlative analysis. A recent tumor sample obtained for the study must have been submitted; however, if  not  clinically  feasible,  an  archival  biopsy  from  the  most  recent  relapse  or  other historical  sample  may  have  been  submitted  instead.  Excisional  biopsies  should  have  been submitted wherever possible, or if not possible, a core needle biopsy. Fine needle aspiration was not suitable.

Patient ≤ 25 years of age and weighing at least 6 kg at the time of screening

Patients who had relapsed after 1 or more prior therapies (including allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant) or were primary refractory (had not achieved a CR or PR after the first line of therapy)

Had measurable disease by radiological criteria at the time of screening. Patients with Burkitt leukemia who did not meet radiological criteria must have had bone marrow involvement of &gt; 25%.

Karnofsky (age ≥ 16 years) or Lansky (age &lt; 16 years) performance status ≥ 60.

Adequate bone marrow reserve without transfusion and organ function.

Had leukapheresis material of non-mobilised cells accepted for manufacturing (assessment and shipping took place after documented confirmation of all other eligibility criteria was received).

## Key Exclusion Criteria:

Prior anti-CD19, engineered T cell, or gene therapy

Allogenic HSCT &lt; 3 months prior to screening and ≤ 4 months prior to infusion

Presence of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD in patients who received prior allogenic HSCT

Prior  diagnosis  of  malignancy  other  than  study  indication  and  not  disease-free  for  5  years, including B-cell NHL in the content of PTLD-associated lymphomas

Clinically significant infection

Active  neurological  autoimmune  or  inflammatory  disorders  (e.g.,  Guillain-Barre  syndrome, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)

Active CNS involvement by malignancy. However, patients with history of CNS disease that had been effectively treated were eligible.

Concomitant genetic syndromes associated with bone marrow failure status, except for Down syndrome

## 7.1.3 Treatments

## Bridging therapy

While awaiting completion of tisagenlecleucel product manufacturing, subjects who needed additional (bridging)  therapy  to  control  their  disease,  based  on  the  extent  of  the  disease  burden  and  per investigator's discretion, may have received appropriate treatment. It was recommended that bridging therapy should have been completed 2 weeks prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion.

## Lymphodepleting therapy

Prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, each subject was to undergo lymphodepletion, unless the subject had a  significant  cytopenia  (e.g.,  WBC  &lt;  1000  cells/μL,  absolute  lymphocyte  count &lt;  200/μL)  or  any

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

condition that, in the investigator's opinion, precluded lymphodepletion. The preferred regimen was as follows:

## Fludarabine (30 mg/m 2  IV daily for 4 days)

Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m 2  IV daily for 2 days starting with the first dose of fludarabine)

If the subject had a history of grade 4 hemorrhagic cystitis with cyclophosphamide or of resistance to a cyclophosphamide-containing regimen, then the following regimen was recommended:

## Cytarabine (500 mg/m 2  IV daily for 2 days)

Etoposide (150 mg/m 2  IV daily for 3 days starting with the first dose of cytarabine)

## Investigational drug (Tisagenlecleucel)

Tisagenlecleucel was administered as a single IV infusion, after optional bridging and LD chemotherapy. The proposed dose range of tisagenlecleucel was based on weight at the time of leukapheresis:

## Subjects ≤ 50 kg: 0.2 to 5 x 10 6  CAR-positive viable T cells per kg body weight

Subjects &gt; 50 kg: 0.1 to 2.5 x 10 8  CAR-positive viable T cells.

## Concomitant treatment

Clinically  significant  prescription  and  nonprescription  medication,  excluding  vitamins,  herbal  and nutritional supplements, procedure-related (inpatient or outpatient) medications and therapy taken by the subject during the 30 days prior to screening through end of study was recorded. During selected study  phases,  concomitant  medication  collection  was  modified  to  capture  tisagenlecleucel-related toxicity, severity, interventions, and response/resolution following intervention.

## Medication restrictions prior to leukapheresis

To stabilise the disease prior to leukapheresis, subjects could receive therapeutic doses of steroids or low-dose daily chemotherapy for up to 1 week. Both treatments must have been stopped &gt; 72 hours prior to leukapheresis.

## Medication restrictions prior to and post-tisagenlecleucel infusion

The following medications or therapies were restricted in study C2202: Steroids or other immunosuppressant  drugs,  antibodies  (including  anti-CD20  therapy),  CNS  disease  prophylaxis  or intrathecal therapy, radiation therapy, live vaccines, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, antiproliferative therapies other than lymphodepletion (including low dose daily or weekly maintenance chemotherapy), short-acting drugs used to treat primary disease, and GVHD therapies.

Disease characterization at baseline and evaluation of efficacy during the study relied on the following:

Imaging,  either:  PET-CT  with  diagnostic  CT,  PET-CT  with  non-diagnostic  CT  +  dedicated diagnostic CT, or dedicated FDG PET with dedicated diagnostic CT Bone marrow biopsy or aspirate CSF cytology

Physical examination findings/cytology/biopsy evaluation

Efficacy evaluations were based on the International Pediatric NHL Response Criteria (Sandlund et al 2015). The latest efficacy assessment after bridging therapy and prior to infusion was used as baseline.

## 7.1.5 Sample Size

It was planned to enroll approximately 35 subjects, with an aim to infuse at least 26 evaluable subjects with aggressive r/r B-cell NHL (Burkitt lymphoma, DLBCL, PMBCL and GZL) for the primary ORR analysis. Evaluable subjects are subjects with measurable disease at baseline, where baseline was defined as the disease  assessment  prior  to  infusion  and  after  any  optional  bridging  chemotherapy.  The  primary objective of the study was to estimate response rate and therefore the sample size was not based on

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

power calculation. In addition, due to the expansion of the permitted age range of patients enrolled (PIP EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01, EMA decision P/0323/2019) it was also specified in amendment 1 that at least 18 subjects evaluable for the primary endpoint should be &lt; 18 years. There was no pre-specified target for the number of FL subjects to be treated because it was an extremely rare and indolent disease. However, enrolment in this subtype was open until at least 26 subjects, including at least 18 paediatric subjects, with the aggressive subtypes for primary analysis had been treated.

## 7.1.6 Statistical Methods

## General Information on Data Analysis

All analyses were performed by Novartis Oncology Biostatistics and Statistical Programming personnel or designated CRO.

## Analysis Sets

Screened set: all subjects who signed ICF and were screened

Enrolled set: A subject was defined as enrolled when the patient met all inclusion/exclusion criteria and leukapheresis material was received and accepted for manufacturing

EAS: all subjects with aggressive r/r B-cell NHL who received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel and had measurable disease at baseline

FAS and safety set: all subjects who received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel

CKAS: subjects in the FAS who provided at least 1 valid cellular kinetic concentration

TPAS:  all  subjects  who  took  at  least  1  dose  of  tocilizumab  and  provided  at  least  1  tocilizumab  PK concentration

## Primary endpoint

The primary efficacy analysis was based on all evaluable subjects with aggressive r/r B-cell NHL and measurable disease at baseline. The analysis was to be conducted when all these subjects had been infused and followed for at least 6 months from study Day 1 or discontinued early as well as at least 50% of those subjects having a follow-up of at least 9 months.

A subject was considered to have a BOR of CR if they had CR, as overall disease response for at least 1 of the assessments. A subject had a BOR of PR if at least 1 overall response of PR was available and the subject would not have qualified for CR. A subject had a BOR of MR if at least 1 overall disease response of MR was available and the subject would not have qualified for CR or PR. A BOR of NR was declared when at least 1 NR assessment was available earliest at 4 weeks after tisagenlecleucel infusion and the subject would not have qualified for CR, PR, or MR. A subject had a BOR of PD if the PD was observed &lt; 28 weeks after tisagenlecleucel infusion and the subject would not have qualified for CR, PR, MR, or NR. If a subject would not have qualified for CR, PR, MR, NR, or PD, then their BOR was Unknown. Subjects who were of unknown clinical response were treated as non-responders.

The ORR along with the 95% exact Clopper-Pearson CIs was summarized in subjects with aggressive r/r B-cell NHL in the EAS.

Sensitivity analyses were also performed for the primary endpoint. In particular, the primary analysis was also performed on the Enrolled Set and FAS using the same methodology. Subgroup analyses of the primary  endpoint  were  also  performed  if  at  least  5  subjects  were  present  in  each  subgroup,  for parameters  such  as  age,  gender,  race,  ethnicity,  disease  subtypes,  prior  response  status,  stage  of disease at BL, use of prior rituximab, prognostic factors, autologous HSCT, surgery before infusion.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Secondary endpoints

No formal hypothesis testing was planned for the secondary efficacy endpoints DOR, EFS, RFS, PFS, and OS.  Kaplan-Meier  (KM)  analyses  were  only  performed  if  at  least  1  event  was  observed;  otherwise, descriptive analyses were used.

For DOR, in case a subject did not have progression or death due to underlying cancer prior to DCO, DOR was censored at the date of the last adequate response assessment (not missing or unknown) on or  prior  to  the  earliest  censoring  event  (ongoing,  LTFU,  withdrew  consent,  new  anticancer  therapy including HSCT). Distribution of DOR was estimated using the KM method in which death due to reason other than underlying cancer was censored. For HSCT, the date of HSCT was considered the censoring date.

For  EFS,  subjects  were  censored  at  the  date  of  the  last  adequate  response  assessment  (where not missing or unknown) on or prior to the earliest censoring event: ongoing without event, LTFU, withdrawal of consent, or received an HSCT. The distribution function of EFS was estimated using the KM method.

For RFS, subjects were censored at the last date RFS was not missing or unknown, with censoring events including:  ongoing  without  event,  LTFU,  withdrawal  of  consent,  or  received  new  anticancer  therapy including  HSCT.  The  distribution  function  of  RFS  was  estimated  using  the  KM  method.  A  sensitivity analyses excluding HSCT as a censoring reason was performed using the same methodology.

For PFS, censoring was performed at the date of the last adequate response assessment that was not missing or unknown on or prior to the earliest censoring event (ongoing without event, LTFU, withdrawal of consent, new anticancer therapy including HSCT). PFS was estimated using the KM method.

For OS, in case a subject was not known to have died at the DCO date, the subject was censored at the last contact date, which was defined at the latest date the subject was known to be alive. The censoring reason could be ongoing without event or LTFU. Subjects were considered as LTFU if the time between their last contact date and the analysis cutoff date was ≥ 105 days. The distribution function of OS was estimated using the KM  method. As a sensitivity analysis, OS was also summarized censoring for HSCT.

## Exploratory variables

## Biomarkers

The FAS was used for all biomarker analyses including all subjects with available biomarker data, except where  assessment  of  associations  of  biomarker  and  safety  data  were  made  using  the  safety  set. Depending on the availability of data, specific data parameters could have been summarized or listed. Biomarkers analysed included: CD19 expression, B-, T-, and NK-cell levels, and cytokine levels as well as other soluble immune factors.

## Feasibility to collect T cells from paediatric B-cell NHL subjects and manufacture tisagenlecleucel product

The number of leukapheresis attempts on study for each subject to obtain an acceptable leukapheresis material was summarised.

## 7.2 Results

## 7.2.1 Participant Flow

The primary analysis was based on data collected from study C2202 up to the DCO date of 10-Oct-2021. An interim study database lock for this analysis was performed on 24-Dec-2021. At the time of the DCO, 38 subjects with r/r B-cell NHL had been screened. Four of these subjects could not be enrolled due to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

screen failure (n=3) and technical problems (n=1). Thus, at the DCO, 34 subjects (89.5%) were enrolled, with  33  subjects  (97.1%)  infused  and  1  subject  (2.9%)  who  discontinued  treatment  prior  to tisagenlecleucel infusion due to death. 17 of the 33 (51.5%) infused subjects had ongoing follow-up at the time of DCO and 16 subjects (48.5 %) discontinued treatment and primary follow-up due to death.

The median time from enrolment to tisagenlecleucel infusion was 35.0 days (range: 7 to 62 days). The minimum of 7 days was observed for 3 subjects: 1 subject who was re-screened and 2 subjects who had their leukapheresis material accepted for manufacturing earlier, but only confirmed enrolment in the study 7 days prior to receiving infusion of tisagenlecleucel.  The  median  time  from  leukapheresis  to tisagenlecleucel infusion was 62.0 days (range: 39 to 125 days). Median time between tisagenlecleucel infusion and DCO date was 16.1 months (range: 6.1 to 29.6 months). Similar results were observed in the subgroup of subjects aged &lt; 18 years.

## Assessor's comment:

The protocol was amended once, on 14-Jan-2020, to align with PDCO-approved modification of PIP EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01 (EMA decision P/0323/2019). The changes implemented in this amendment concerned updates of the inclusion criteria to allow patients between 18 and 25 years of age as well as patients with Burkitt leukaemia and are considered acceptable.

A total of eight subjects (24%) experienced protocol deviations (Table 12). Notably, one patient received more than one infusion of tisagenlecleucel, and one patient received a dose above the target dose range.

## Assessor's comment:

The FAS consisted mostly of subjects with Burkitt lymphoma (54.5%, 18/33) or DLBCL (30.3%, 10/33) (Table 15). No subjects with FL were enrolled in the study, despite having been included in the inclusion criteria. The population enrolled in the study had a relatively advanced stage of disease, reflective of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

r/r mature B-cell NHL population defined by the inclusion criteria. In the FAS, 87.9% (29/33 subjects) had Stage III/IV at baseline, subjects had a median of 2 (range: 1 to 3) lines of prior therapy, 18.2% (6/33 subjects) had received prior HSCT. In addition, there was a significant proportion of refractory patients (30.3% refractory and 15.2% primary refractory), as well as a high proportion of the more aggressive B-cell NHL subtype of Burkitt lymphoma. Overall, the above-mentioned disease characteristics  and  subtypes  indicate  a  poor  prognosis.  Similar  characteristics  were  observed  in  the subgroup of subjects aged &lt;18 years.

In pivotal study C2201, the adult patients with DLBCL also had advanced disease, with 76.5% with stage III/IV disease, a median of 3 lines of prior therapy, 48.7% who had received SCT, and 54.8% who were refractory to the last line of therapy in the infused set. A key difference between the enrolled populations the current study and the pivotal study in adults is the inclusion of histological subtypes beyond DLBCL in study C2202.

[1] The target dose range was 0.2 to 5.0 x106 autologous CAR-positive viable T cells per kg body weight (for subjects ≤ 50 kg), or 0.1 to 2.5 x108 autologous CAR-positive viable T cells (for subjects &gt; 50 kg). Only the first tisagenlecleucel infusion was presented for each subject. The weight for manufacturing was calculated by dividing the total infused CAR-positive  viable  T  cell  count  (10^8)  by  the  infused  CAR-positive  viable  T  cells  count  per  kg  (106/kg)  and multiplying by 100. If one of the cell counts was missing the last non-missing weight prior to infusion from vital signs was used as weight for manufacturing. According to their weight for manufacturing, all subjects were assigned to either the ≤ 50 kg or the &gt; 50 kg group. The infused cell count was calculated by multiplying the appropriate cell count with the Actual Percent Volume Infused/100. The total over all bags was calculated by subject and visit.

## Prior therapies

All 33 infused subjects received prior antineoplastic therapy with a median of 2 (range: 1 to 3) prior lines  of  therapy.  The  most  commonly  used  prior  therapy  (&gt;  50%  of  subjects)  were:  rituximab  (33 subjects; 100%), cyclophosphamide (32 subjects; 97.0%), vincristine (29 subjects; 87.9%), cytarabine or  doxorubicin  (28  subjects;  84.8%),  etoposide  (26  subjects;  78.8%),  methotrexate  (25  subjects; 75.8%) and ifosfamide (19 subjects; 57.6%). 18.1% (6/33 subjects) received prior autologous HSCT transplants. The median time to last HSCT prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion was 4.3 months (range: 1.4 to 9.6 months). One subject received prior radiotherapy directed at the abdominal region and the reason was missing. Nine subjects (27.3%) received surgery prior to enrolment in the study. Similar results were observed in the subgroup of subjects aged &lt; 18 years.

## Bridging therapies

Bridging chemotherapies were administered to 32 of 34 (94.1%) enrolled subjects. The most common bridging therapies ( ≥ 50% of all subjects) were rituximab (22 subjects; 64.7%), carboplatin (18 subjects; 52.9%),  ifosfamide  (18  subjects;  52.9%)  and  etoposide  (17  subjects;  50.0%).  One  of  34  enrolled subjects received surgery and 5 of 34 subjects received radiotherapy after tisagenlecleucel infusion. Similar results were observed in the subgroup of subjects aged &lt; 18 years.

## Concomitant therapy

Concomitant therapy was used by all 33 subjects who received an infusion. The most commonly used (&gt; 50% of subjects) concomitant medications were paracetamol (24 subjects; 72.7%), bactrim (21 subjects; 63.6%), and ondansetron (18 subjects; 54.5%). New antineoplastic medications were used by 13  subjects  (39.4%)  after  tisagenlecleucel  infusion.  The  most  commonly  used  new  antineoplastic medications  were  carboplatin,  dexamethasone,  ifosfamide,  methotrexate,  and  rituximab  (4  subjects each; 12.1%). Six of 33 subjects received surgery and 9 of 33 subjects received radiotherapy after tisagenlecleucel infusion. Four subjects (12.1%) received HSCT after receiving tisagenlecleucel infusion and after relapse. Two subjects (6.1%) received HSCT with an unknown remission status. Similar results were observed in the subgroup of subjects aged &lt; 18 years.

## Lymphodepleting chemotherapy

Lymphodepleting  chemotherapies  were  administered  to  32  of  34  enrolled  subjects  (94.1%).  The lymphodepleting chemotherapies used were fludarabine/cyclophosphamide in combination (32 subjects; 94.1%) and cytarabine/etoposide in combination (1 subject; 2.9%).

## Assessor's comment:

There was no formal dose finding study for the intended population. Therefore, the same dose regimen as the previously approved paediatric dose for ALL indication was intended to be administered to the NHL population. 97% of subjects received a tisagenlecleucel dose within the target dose range while 3% (one  subject)  received  a  dose  above  the  target  dose  range  (Table  15).  The  median  infused tisagenlecleucel dose was 1.26x10 8  (range: 0.30 -2.38x10 8  cells) CAR-positive viable T cells for subjects &gt; 50 kg, and 1.90x10 6  (range: 0.40-7.30x10 6  cells/kg) CAR-positive viable T cells per kg for subjects ≤ 50kg. Slight differences were observed in the doses administered to subjects ≥ 18 years and &lt; 18 years of age in both weight categories, with subjects ≥ 18 years of age administered a somewhat higher median dose.

In  the  FAS,  subjects  had  received  a  median  of  2  (range:  1-3)  prior  therapies,  with  18.1%  having previously received an autologous HSCT. 94.1% (32/34 enrolled subjects) received bridging therapy, while 94.1% (32/34 enrolled subjects) received LD. The high proportion of patients that required bridging therapy is likely reflective of rapid progressive disease.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

After tisagenlecleucel infusion, 39.4% of subjects received subsequent antineoplastic therapy, including 18.1%  (6/33  subjects)  receiving  surgery  and  27.3%  (9/33  subjects)  receiving  radiotherapy.  While 12.1% (4/33 subjects) received HSCT after tisagenlecleucel infusion and relapse, 6.1% (2/33 subjects) received  HSCT  with  unknown  remission  status.  Though  start  of  new  antineoplastic  therapy  was considered a censoring event for endpoints DOR, RFS and PFS, this should nonetheless be considered when interpreting efficacy results.

## Assessor's comment:

Of the enrolled population, 86.8% (33/34 subjects) were treated with tisagenlecleucel and constituted the FAS (Table 16). Of these, five patients were excluded to form the efficacy analysis set (EAS, n=28). 4 subjects were excluded due to a CR to bridging therapy and 1 subject for having the baseline scan performed prior to the end of bridging therapy. In the EAS, 24 patients were &lt;18 years of age. The analysis  sets  are  quite  limited  in  terms  of  number  of  subjects  included,  especially  considering  the different histologies represented, although this can be understood in light of the rarity of the condition.

## Assessor's comment:

At the DCO for this primary analysis (10-Oct-2021), the ORR was 32.1% (9/28 subjects) (95% CI: 15.9, 52.4) in the EAS, with 7.1% (2/28 subjects) achieving CR as BOR and 25.0% (7/28 subjects) achieving PR as BOR (The primary efficacy analysis results obtained from study C2202 with DCO date of 10-Oct2021 are presented in Table 17 and Table 18.

Table 18). In subjects &lt; 18 years of age, the ORR was similar.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Supportive analyses (Table 19) showed a slightly higher ORR (36.4%, 95%CI: 20.4, 54.9) in the FAS (n=33), which included patients who had achieved a CR after bridging therapy and prior to infusion, compared to the EAS, mostly due to a trend towards higher CR. This is in line with that has been observed in other studies with tisagenlecleucel, and might be due to response to bridging therapy correlating with less advanced patients, with better responses to therapy overall. The enrolled set (n=34) had a similar ORR to the FAS.

The ORR observed in study C2202 appears to be numerically lower than that observed for adult patients with DLBCL in the pivotal study C2201, where ORR was found to be 54.5% (95%CI: 44.2, 64.6), with a CRR of 41.4% and a PRR of 13.1% in the infused set (n=115). Due to inclusion of patients with other disease subtypes with poorer prognosis (such as BL) in study C2202, the patient population is not directly comparable to the adult population in study C2201, which consisted of only patients with DLBCL. In addition, the number of patients included in study C2202 was limited to 28 patients in the EAS, despite inclusion of several disease subtypes beyond DLBCL.

The subgroup analysis showed a substantially lower ORR in subjects with Burkitt lymphoma (20%, 3/15 subjects), compared to those with histologies other than Burkitt lymphoma (46.1%, 6/13 subjects). In the DLBCL subjects (EAS), the ORR was 37.5% (3/8 subjects), with 2 subjects achieving CR as BOR. These findings may suggest that the overall ORR observed in study C2202 is negatively influenced by the inclusion of patients with Burkitt lymphoma, who are known to have a poorer prognosis. Literature data suggest that paediatric and young adult patients with Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia have a poor prognosis, with an 8-year OS of 28%, compared with 50% in patients with DLBCL (Burkhardt et al., 2021).

Prior autologous HSCT did not appear to have a large effect on ORR, with subjects with prior autologous HSCT exhibiting an ORR of 40% (2/5 subjects), and patients without prior HSCT exhibiting an ORR of 30.4% (7/23). Failure of, or ineligibility for HSCT was not necessary for inclusion in the study. There were no responders among subjects with prior surgery (n=7 subjects), possibly reflecting a subgroup of patients with more advanced disease. Similar results were observed in the subgroup of subjects aged &lt; 18 years.

Considering the single arm nature of study C2202, the limited number of patients included in the trial, and  relatively  short  follow-up  duration,  the  results  from  the  primary  analysis,  including  subgroup analyses, should be interpreted with caution. Although an ORR of 32% indicates that some paediatric patients may have achieved a therapeutical benefit, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the efficacy in the mature B-cell NHL population or in the subtypes of disease.

## Secondary Efficacy Results

## Duration of Response

Nine subjects received a BOR of CR or PR (n=9) (Table 20). The median follow-up in these subjects after response was relatively short (2.4 months) and the median DOR was not estimable. 3 subjects (33.3%) who achieved a BOR of CR or PR reported relapse or died due to underlying disease prior to the DCO (10-Oct-2021).

## Figure 10. Kaplan-Meier Plot of OS (EAS)

As a sensitivity analysis, censoring for HSCT resulted in a similar median OS of 11.4 months (95% CI: 3.4, NE). Similar results were observed in the subgroup of subjects aged &lt; 18 years.

## Assessor's comment:

Due to the limitations of the study C2202, including the single-arm nature of the trial, the limited number of patients and relatively short follow-up duration, there is uncertainty regarding the secondary efficacy outcomes, particularly the time-to-event endpoints such as PFS and OS.

In study C2202, the median DOR was not estimable due to a short follow-up (2.4 months) after response in the nine subjects with a BOR of CR or PR (Table 20). In these nine responders, 3 subjects had events and 3 subjects were censored due to new antineoplastic therapy or HSCT and 3 subjects were censored due to ongoing without event. Due to the limited number of responders and most of these patients censored at the time of analysis, the data on duration of response are immature and difficult to assess. Thus, it remains unclear whether there is a clinically meaningful remission in responding patients.

Of note, in study C2201, median DOR was not reached (10.0, NE) at the latest DCO, while median PFS was 2.9 months (95% CI: 2.3, 5.2) and median OS was 11.1 months (95% CI: 6.6, 23 .9).

A total of 14 subjects, including 3 subjects with a BOR of PR in the EAS had died at the time of DCO. This finding seems to reflect the expected poor prognosis for the enrolled patient population. In the study of Burkhardt et al. (2021), 8-year OS was estimated to be 34% in paediatric and young adult patients with CD19+ r/r mature B-cell NHL, 28% in those with Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, and 50% in patients with DLBCL.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Exploratory Endpoints

## Antigen (CD19) and other protein expression in baseline tumor biopsies

CD19  baseline  expression  was  evaluated  in  tumor  biopsy  samples  via  immunohistochemistry  and correlated with clinical response parameters. In addition, immunohistochemistry was used to measure the expression levels of proteins Ki67, CD3, CD10, CD20, PAX5, BCL2, and BCL6. No tumor markers investigated clearly correlated with BOR or response outcomes.

## B, T, and NK cell levels

The  levels  of  B  cells  (CD3-CD19+),  T  cells  (CD3+,  CD3+CD4+,  and  CD3+CD8+),  and  NK  cells (CD16+CD56+) were investigated. The longitudinal analysis of the selected immune cell subset levels did  not  show  noticeable  differences  at  any  time  points  in  responders  (CR/PR)  as  compared  to  nonresponders (MR/NR/PD).

## Inflammatory markers and cytokines

Summary of key inflammatory markers and cytokine parameters (e.g., IL-6, IL-10, interferon gamma, C-reactive protein, ferritin, etc.) was provided by subject and maximum CRS grade at baseline. Higher C-reactive protein levels were found in subjects with grade ½ CRS as compared to subjects with grade ¾/5  CRS.  However,  very  limited  number  of  subjects  in  the  grade  ¾/5  CRS  group  (n=1)  must  be considered when interpreting these results. Overall, non-noticeable differences were observed in any of the 3 CRS groups (none, grade ½, grade ¾/5) for all remaining cytokines.

## Apheresis attempts

One subject  (2.6%)  experienced  technical  problems  related  to  manufacturing  and  did  not  complete screening.  No  other  subjects  discontinued  due  to  technical  issues  prior  to  tisagenlecleucel  infusion. Leukapheresis was attempted in all enrolled subjects with a majority of subjects (31 subjects; 91.2%) requiring only 1 leukapheresis attempt during the study.

## Health resource utilisation

The majority of subjects (25/33 subjects; 75.8%) were hospitalized during tisagenlecleucel infusion. None of the other 8 subjects required hospitalization at infusion or within 3 days after infusion. The total number  of  hospitalizations  was  typi cally  ≤  1  (25/33  subjects),  with  a  mean duration  of  each hospitalization lasting 13.24 days (range: 2.0-61.0 days) and a mean total hospitalization duration of 22.2 days (range: 2-85 days).

## Immunogenicity

Anti-tisagenlecleucel antibodies at baseline were observed in 28 subjects (84.8%) and at anytime postbaseline  in  32  subjects  (97.0%).  For  1  subject,  the  baseline  anti-mCAR19  antibody  status  was  not available.  Pre-existing  immunogenicity  does  not  seem  to  have  any  impact  on  exposure.  Treatmentinduced or boosted anti-mCAR19 antibodies were observed in 10 of 33 subjects in the CKAS, while 21 subjects did not show induced or boosted response and 2 subjects had an unknown antibody status. Considering high inter-individual variability associated with the parameters and similar Cmax values, no apparent relationship was observed between anti-mCAR19 antibody response and expansion of CAR T cells.  The  preexisting  antibodies,  i.e.  at  enrolment,  or  maximum  fold  change  from  baseline  to  postinfusion were not associated with any impact on clinical response.

Cellular responses to mCART peptides were measured pre-infusion (enrolment) and post-tisagenlecleucel infusion by BOR. In general, cellular immunogenicity responses were consistent and remained low (&lt;1%)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for most subjects throughout the study, indicating that cellular immunogenicity does not fluctuate over time.

## 7.3 Discussion

In  this  variation  application,  the  primary  analysis  results  of  study  C2202  (BIANCA)  conducted  in compliance with paediatric investigation plan (PIP) EMEA-001654-PIP02-17-M01 were submitted. Study C2202 is the only clinical measure of this PIP, which is one of two opened PIPs for Kymriah. Based on the submitted data, the MAH proposed to update the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1 to include the primary analysis results from study C2202. The MAH considers that the submitted study results do not support a paediatric indication.

Study C2202 (BIANCA) is a phase II, single arm, multicenter open-label trial to determine the safety and efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory mature B-cell nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The overall study design of C2202 is in line with the agreed PIP EMEA-001654PIP02-17-M01.  The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  was  ORR  as  determined  by  local  investigator assessment and important secondary endpoints included DOR, PFS and OS.

The primary efficacy analysis of study C2202, based on all evaluable subjects with mature B-cell r/r NHL and measurable disease at baseline, was conducted when those subjects had been infused and followed for at least 6 months from study Day 1 or discontinued early, as well as at least 50% of those subjects having a follow-up of at least 9 months. The DCO for the analysis was 10-Oct-2021, and the median time  between  tisagenlecleucel  infusion  and  DCO  was  16.1  months  (range:  6.1  -29.6).  In  total,  38 subjects were screened for the study, and 34 subjects were enrolled. The efficacy analysis set (EAS) consisted of 24 patients &lt;18 years of age, and 4 patients ≥1 8 and &lt;25 years of age. The paediatric population enrolled in the study had relatively advanced disease, with 87.9% (29/33 subjects) at Stage III/IV at baseline, a median of 2 (range: 1 to 3) lines of prior therapy, 18.2% (6/33 subjects) having received prior HSCT, a significant proportion of refractory patients (30.3% refractory and 15.2% primary refractory), as well as a high proportion of the more aggressive B-cell NHL subtype of Burkitt lymphoma (18 subjects; 54.5%). The enrolled patient population is representative of paediatric and young adult patients with mature B-cell r/r NHL, who have a highly aggressive disease, indicating a poor prognosis.

There was no formal dose finding study for the NHL population. Therefore, the same dose regimen as the previously approved paediatric dose for the ALL indication was administered in study C2202. Subjects weighing &gt; 50 kg received a median of 1.26x10 8  ((range: 0.30 -2.38x10 8  cells) CAR-positive viable T cells, while subjects weighing ≤ 50 kg received a median of 1.90x10 6  (range: 0.40-7.30x10 6  cells/kg) CAR-positive viable T cells per kg. This was within the target dose range (0.2-5x10 6  CAR-positive viable T cells/kg for subjects ≤ 50 kg, 0.1-2.5 x 10 8  CAR-positive viable T cells for subjects &gt; 50 kg) for 97.0% of subjects, with one subject (3.0%) administered a dose above the target dose range.

## Primary endpoint analysis

At the time of the DCO, the primary endpoint, ORR, was 32.1% (9/28 subjects) (95% CI: 15.9, 52.4), with  7.1%  (2/28  subjects)  achieving  CR  as  BOR,  and  25%  (7/28  subjects)  achieving  PR  as  BOR. Subgroup analyses suggested a trend for higher ORR in subjects with histologies other than Burkitt lymphoma (46.1%, 6/13 subjects vs 20%, 3/15 subjects). In the DLBCL subjects in the EAS, the ORR was 37.5% (3/8 subjects), with 2 subjects achieving CR as BOR. There was also a trend for higher ORR in subjects with serum LDH ≤ UNL (4/8 subjects, 50.0%) than &gt; UNL (5/19 subjects, 26.3%). Prior autologous HSCT did not appear to have a large effect on ORR, with subjects with prior autologous HSCT exhibiting an ORR of 40% (2/5 subjects), and patients without prior HSCT exhibiting an ORR of 30.4% (7/23).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of note, in the pivotal study C2201 on adult patients with DLBCL, the ORR was 54.5% (95%CI: 44.2, 64.6), with a CRR of 41.4% and a PRR of 13.1% in the infused set (n=115). However, as the patient population in this study is substantially different from the study C2202 due to inclusion of different disease subtypes, ORR results cannot be directly compared.

## Secondary endpoint analyses

At the DCO, median DOR in subjects who achieved a BOR of CR/PR was not reached due to short duration of follow up (2.4 months). Of the nine responders, 3 subjects had events, 3 subjects were censored due to new antineoplastic therapy or HSCT, and 3 subjects were censored due to ongoing without event. Median EFS was 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.1, 2.8), with an estimated event-free probability of 13.4% (95% CI: 3.8, 29.0) at Month 12. Median RFS was not estimable, with an estimated RFS probability of 62.5% (95% CI: 22.9, 86.1) at Month 9. Median PFS was 2.5 months (95% CI: 1.1, 2.9), with an estimated PFS probability of 22.7% (95% CI: 8.9, 40.3) at Month 12. As of the DCO, median OS was 11.4 months (95% CI: 3.4, NE). A total of 14 subjects, including 3 subjects with BOR of PR in the EAS, had died at the time of the DCO. The two patients with a BOR of CR were both lost to follow-up, thus it is not known whether these patients have died. The observed high mortality is in accordance with the expected poor prognosis for the r/r NHL population. In the study of Burkhardt et al. (2021), 8-year OS was estimated to be 34% in paediatric and young adult patients with CD19+ r/r mature B-cell NHL, 28% in those with Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, and 50% in patients with DLBCL.

Due to the limitations of the study C2202, including the limited number of patients and relatively short follow-up  duration  as  well  as  the  single  arm  nature  of  the  trial,  there  is  uncertainty  regarding  the estimates of secondary efficacy outcomes. Further, no estimate of median DOR in responders could be derived from the available data. In addition, 39.4% of subjects received subsequent anti-neoplastic medications after tisagenlecleucel infusion, adding further uncertainty to the estimates of secondary endpoints, although it was included as a censoring event for DOR, RFS and PFS.

## Overall assessment

Considering the limitations of the study, including the single-arm nature of the trial, the limited number of patients and the relatively short follow-up, the primary analysis results of study C2202 should be interpreted with caution. Although an ORR of 32.1% indicates that some patients may have achieved clinical benefit, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the clinical relevance of the observed efficacy in the mature B-cell r/r NHL population or in the histological subtypes. In addition, due to the limited number of  responders and most of these patients censored at the time of analysis, the data on duration of response are immature and difficult to assess. Thus, it remains unclear whether there is a clinically meaningful remission in responding patients.

As stated above, subgroup analysis suggests that patients with Burkitt lymphoma had a lower response rate, likely contributing to the modest ORR estimate in the current study. Of note, a trend for higher ORR  was  observed  in  patients  with  DLBCL,  as  well  as  in  those  with  histologies  other  than  Burkitt lymphoma. These findings seem to be in line with literature data suggesting that paediatric and young adult patients with Burkitt lymphoma/leukaemia in general have a poor prognosis, with an 8-year OS of 28%, compared with 50% in patients with DLBCL (Burkhardt et al., 2021). Despite these trends in ORR between subgroups, as well as overall study results indicating that some patients achieved benefit in terms of CR/PR, the available data are insufficient to ascertain which subgroups may derive clinically meaningful benefit from tisagenlecleucel treatment.

Although there are several limitations of the study C2202, inclusion of a short description of the study and its results in SmPC section 5.1 is supported and is in line with SmPC guidelines for the inclusion of information regarding paediatric studies. Considering the high unmet medical need for paediatric patients with r/r mature B-cell NHL, this information may be useful for the prescribers. However, due to the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

single-arm nature of the study, the treatment effect on time-to-event outcomes such as PFS and OS cannot be isolated. Moreover, in the current study these estimates were based on very few patients, and thus additionally hampered by uncertainty. Therefore, the inclusion of PFS and OS outcomes in the SmPC is not endorsed.

The PI has been updated by the MAH according to the CAT/CHMP comments in the RSI. The proposed updates to the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1, and PL section 2 are considered acceptable.

## 8. Clinical Safety aspects

## 8.1 Methods - analysis of data submitted

Study C2202 (BIANCA) was a Phase II, single-arm, multicenter, open-label study to determine the safety and efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric and young adult subjects (≤ 25 years) with CD19+relapsed or refractory (r/r) mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), who have relapsed after one or more prior  therapies  or  have  primary  refractory  disease.  The  study  was  part  of  an  agreed  Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP).

The evaluation of safety is based on data from 33 subjects infused with tisagenlecleucel.  Study design and  treatment  exposure  are  described  in  the  efficacy  section  above  (refer  to  page  19  and  22 respectively).  Study  treatments  included  bridging  and/or  lymphodepleting  therapy  (if  given)  and tisagenlecleucel (investigational drug).

Safety was monitored closely in the first 1 month following tisagenlecleucel infusion and then every 3 months  during  the  first  year  of  post-tisagenlecleucel  infusion,  followed  by  semi-annual  assessment during the second year and annually thereafter until the end of study. During the annual Follow-up phase of the study following Month 12 post-tisagenlecleucel infusions, only protocol-defined adverse events (AEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were collected.

Safety was monitored by physical examination, vital signs, physical development, performance status, assessing immunogenicity against tisagenlecleucel, and lab abnormalities, as well as collecting adverse events  at  every  visit.  Reporting  of  AEs  was  based  on  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) version 24.1 and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The grading of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was based on protocol-specific grading scales.

Important identified and potential risks associated with tisagenlecleucel infusion are outlined in the EU RMP v 4.1 (dated 12-Jan-2022). The list of AESIs and their MedDRA search criteria to identify AEs potentially reflective of AESIs were updated on a regular basis at the program level in the electronic Case Retrieval Strategy form. In addition, post-marketing data from PSUR 6 (reporting period 13-Feb2021-12-Aug-2021, data-lock point [DLP] 12-Aug-2021) are provided.

## 8.2 Results

## Adverse events

Regardless of study drug relationship, all subjects (100%) infused with tisagenlecleucel experienced at least 1 AE at any time after tisagenlecleucel infusion. The most commonly reported system organ class (SOC) of any grade at any time after tisagenlecleucel infusion (&gt;50%) were immune system disorders (75.8%), blood and  lymphatic system disorders (63.6%), gastrointestinal disorders (63.6%), investigations  (63.6%),  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (60.6%)  and  nervous system disorders (57.6%).

decreased (21.2%), platelet count decreased (18.2%), leukopenia (15.2%), abdominal pain (12.1%) and febrile neutropenia (12.1%).

A proper comparative assessment of the different age-groups cannot be done since there are only 4 subjects aged &lt;18 years.

AEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel were reported in 84.8% of subjects. The most commonly reported treatment-related SOC (&gt; 20%) of any grade at any time after tisagenlecleucel infusion were immune system disorders (72.7%), investigations (39.4%), nervous system disorders (33.3%), general disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (30.3%),  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders,  and gastrointestinal disorders (27.3% each). The most commonly reported Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related SOCs  were  investigations  (30.3%)  and  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (24.2%).  Treatmentrelated AEs at any time post-tisagenlecleucel administration by PT are presented in Table 26.

Numbers (n) represent counts of subjects. A subject with multiple severity grades for the same preferred term was only counted with the maximum grade, a subject with multiple AEs was only counted with the maximum grade in the 'Number of subjects with at least one event' row.

## Assessor's comment:

The most commonly reported (&gt;20%) treatment-related AEs of any grade by PT were CRS (69.7%), pyrexia (27.3%) and neutrophil count decreased (21.2%).

Grade ≥ 3 events suspected to be related to treatment at any time after tisagenlecleucel infusion were reported in 72.7% of subjects. The most commonly reported (&gt;5%) AEs ≥ Grade 3 were neutrophil count decreased (21.2%), white blood cell count decreased (12.1%), CRS, platelet count decreased, and anaemia (9.1% each).

Overall, the frequencies of treatment-related AEs are in line with what has previously been reported in the pivotal clinical B-cell ALL study CCTL019B2202 (n=79).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A proper comparative assessment of the different age-groups cannot be done as there are only 4 subjects aged &lt;18 years.

## Time of onset

AEs were reported primarily within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, and the incidence of AEs substantially decreased after this time period. The most frequently reported treatment emergent AEs of any grade within 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion were CRS (66.7%), pyrexia (36.4%), vomiting (30.3%), anaemia (27.3%), nausea (21.2%), neutropenia (21.2%), and neutrophil count decreased (21.2%).  The  most  frequently reported  ≥ grade  3  AEs  within  8  weeks  post-tisagenlecleucel  were anaemia, neutropenia (21.2% each), neutrophil count decreased (18.2%), WBC decreased (18.2%) and leukopenia (15.2%). The most frequently reported treatment emergent AEs &gt;8 weeks to 1 year post first  tisagenlecleucel  infusion  were  pyrexia  (16.7%),  blood  creatinine  increased,  neutrophil  count decreased, and headache (10.0% each).

## Deaths

Deaths at any time post-tisagenlecleucel infusion are presented in Table 27. Table 27. Deaths at any time post-tisagenlecleucel infusion by primary system organ class, preferred term, and age group (Safety set)One (1) subject (3%) died within 30 days of tisagenlecleucel infusion and 45.5% of subjects died more than 30 days post-infusion.

## Assessor's comment:

Death at any time post-tisagenlecleucel infusion was reported in 48.5% of subjects and the majority (42.4%) died due to study indication. Two subjects (6.1%) died due to AEs; 1 was due to pseudomonas infection (D219) and 1 was due to respiratory failure (D134). Neither of these were considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment, which seems reasonable.

## Serious Adverse events (SAEs)

The majority of subjects (75.8%) were hospitalized during tisagenlecleucel infusion. The mean average duration of each hospitalization lasted 13.2 days (range: 2.0-61.0 days) and a mean total hospitalization duration was 22.2 days (range: 2-85 days).  Regardless of study drug relationship, 69.7% of subjects infused with tisagenlecleucel experienced at least 1 SAE during the study. The most commonly reported

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SAEs by SOC (&gt;20%) of any grade at any time after tisagenlecleucel infusion were general disorders and administration site conditions (21.2%) and immune system disorders (27.3%). The most commonly reported SAEs (&gt;10%) by PT were CRS (all grades: 24.2%, Grade ≥ 3: 3.0%) and pyrexia (all grades: 18.2%, Grade ≥ 3: 3.0%).

Serious adverse events at any time post-tisagenlecleucel administration suspected to be related to study drug are presented in Table 28.

## Assessor's comment:

SAEs suspected to be related to study drug were experienced by 42.4% of subjects. The most commonly reported SAEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel by SOC (&gt; 10%) of any grade at any time after  tisagenlecleucel  infusion  were  immune  system  disorders  (27.3%),  nervous  system  disorders (15.2%),  and  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (12.1%).  The  most  commonly reported SAEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel by PT (&gt; 5%) of any grade were CRS (24.2%), pyrexia (12.1%), and seizures (6.1%). These are consistent with the nature of SAEs reported in previous tisagenlecleucel studies across indications.

One (1) subject had a ≥ G rade 3 CRS event. None of the subjects experienced a ≥ Grade 3 event of pyrexia or seizure.

## Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) based on important identified risks

## Cytokine release syndrome

Of all the subjects (100%) infused with tisagenlecleucel, CRS was experienced by 69.7% subjects (Table 30).  The  majority  of  subjects  experienced  grade ≤ 2  CRS.  Four  subjects  (17.4%)  had  concurrent infections and four subjects (17.4%) were admitted to the ICU. Tocilizumab was administered to 30.4% of subjects, with the majority (17.4%) receiving only 1 dose. Subjects &lt;18 years had higher incidence of CRS than those ≥ 18 years; however due to the small number of subjects ≥ 18 years old (n=4), no conclusion could be drawn. When analyzed by disease response (best overall response), CRS appeared to be less prominent when subjects had attained a complete or partial response.

In all cases, the median time to onset of CRS was 8 days (95% CI: 6, 27) after tisagenlecleucel infusion. The median time to resolution of CRS was 5 days (95% CI: 3, 8) after onset of CRS. The majority, 95.7% of subjects, had CRS resolved with an estimated resolved probability of 60.9% (95% CI: 42.0, 80.1) on Day 7 and 100% at Day 14.

## Neurological events

Of all the subjects (100%) infused with tisagenlecleucel, serious neurological adverse reactions were experienced by 27.3% (n=9) of subjects with 15.2% of them experiencing Grade ≥ 3 events (Table 30).

The median time to onset of first neurological event was 8.0 days (range: 3 to 48 days), with a median duration of 9 days (range: 1 to 21 days) for the first neurological event.  The majority of neurological events (in 70% of the subject with neurological events) were considered as resolved and the median time to resolution of neurological events was 10.5 days (95% CI 1.0, NE).

## Hematopoietic cytopenias

Hematopoietic cytopenias are commonly reported following CAR T-cell infusion, with Grade 3 events being frequently reported.

Of the 33 subjects infused with tisagenlecleucel any time, 75.8% of subjects had hematopoietic cytopenia AEs, of which 72.7% of the subjects had events that were Grade ≥ 3 (Table 30). Hematopoietic cytopenic AEs (any grade, based on AE CRF) particularly platelet count decreased (24.2%), anaemia (30.3%), neutrophil count decreased (27.3%) and white blood cell count decreased (21.2%) were among the most frequently reported AEs in the study.

At month 3, the resolution probability of cytopenic AEs was 42.9% of subjects with white blood cell (WBC)  decreased;  71.4%  of  subjects  with  neutrophil  count  decreased  and  100%  of  subjects  with anaemia.

At  month  6,  the  resolution  probability  of  cytopenic  AEs  was  85.7%  of  subjects  with  neutrophils decreased; 66.7% of subjects with lymphocytes decreased and 100% of subjects with anaemia and WBC.

## Infections

Infections (within 8 weeks post tisagenlecleucel infusion) were reported in 15.2% of subjects, with sepsis reported in 2 subjects (6.1%) and other infection events reported in 1 subject (3.0%) each. Grade ≥ 3 infections were reported in 9.1% of the subjects.

Infections (at any time since tisagenlecleucel infusion) were reported in 30.3% of subjects, with myelitis and sepsis reported in 2 subjects each (6.1% each) and the other infection events reported in 1 subject (3.0%) each. Grade ≥ 3 infections were reported in 15.2% of subjects (Table 30).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Prolonged depletion of normal B cells or agammaglobulinemia

Agammaglobulinemia was reported in 15.2% of the subjects, with hypogammaglobulinemia in 3 (9.1%) subjects and B-cell aplasia and blood IgG abnormal in 1 subject (3.0%) each. Of these, 1 subject (3.0%) had a grade 3 event of hypogammaglobulinemia (Table 30).

## Assessor's comment:

Regardless of relationship to tisagenlecleucel, AESI based on important identified risks of tisagenlecleucel were experienced by 97.0% of subjects, with 78.8% having experienced a ≥ Grade 3 event.

The most frequently reported AESIs by group term were haematological disorders including cytopenias (75.8%, ≥ Grade 3: 72.7%), CRS (69.7%, ≥ Grade 3: 15.2%), infections (30.3%, ≥ Grade 3: 15.2%), serious neurological adverse reactions (27.3%, ≥ Grade 3: 15.2%), prolonged depletion of normal B cells or agammaglobul inemia (15.2%, ≥ Grade 3: 3%).

## Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) based on important potential risks

AESIs at any time post-tisagenlecleucel infusion based on important potential risks, regardless of study drug relationship, are presented in Table 30.

most frequently reported PT (any grade) was hypogammaglobulinemia (9.1%, n=3); the other events were reported in 2 (6.1%) or 1 (3.0%) subjects.

## Clinical laboratory evaluations

Local clinical laboratory parameters collected in Study C2202 included haematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, coagulation, pregnancy screening, viral serologies, and cerebrospinal fluid testing. Central clinical laboratory parameters collected included CD19 testing, tumour clonal typing, tisagenlecleucel pharmacokinetics, bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, B-cell and T-cell levels, replication competent lentivirus (vesicular  stomatitis  virus  glycoprotein),  cytokines,  immunogenicity,  tumor  clonal  typing,  gene expression and whole exome analysis and peripheral blood molecular characterization.

## Haematology

Haematology  parameters  are  presented  in  Table  31.  The  majority  of  subjects  had  their  cytopenias resolved by month 3/6 post-tisagenlecleucel infusion.

Subjects were counted only for the worst grade observed post-baseline. Baseline was defined as the most current assessment on or prior to the date of first tisagenlecleucel infusion. n = number of subjects with worst post-baseline Grade 1-4; m= number of subjects with baseline Grade 0-2 lab result; s = number of subjects with Grade 0-2 lab result at baseline and shifted to Grade 3-4 post-baseline.

## Liver enzymes

At  any  time  post-tisagenlecleucel  infusion,  30.3%  experienced  ALT  or  AST  &gt;  3xULN  and  12.1%  of subjects experienced total bilirubin &gt; 2xULN. No subjects experienced a fatal hepatic event and in the majority of cases, ALT, AST, and total bilirubin elevations resolved.

## Assessor's comment:

All  subjects  had  a  post-baseline  haematology  laboratory  abnormality,  and  93.9%  of  subjects  had baseline grade 0 to 2 laboratory parameters that worsened post-baseline to grade 3 to 4. The most common baseline grade 0 to 2 biochemistry laboratory parameters that worsened postbaseline to grade 3 to 4 were: decreased potassium (16.1%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (15.6%), increased alanine aminotransferase (15.2%), and increased bilirubin (12.1%).

## 8.3 Discussion

The safety profile of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric and young adult subjects with CD19+ r/r mature Bcell  NHL,  including  Burkitt  lymphoma,  appears  to  be  consistent  with  other  tisagenlecleucel  studies, although it is of note that the sample size is small (n=33).

AEs suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel were reported in 84.8% of subjects. The most commonly reported (&gt;20%) AEs regardless of treatment were, by PT, CRS (69.7%), pyrexia (45.5%), vomiting (36.4%),  anaemia  (30.3%),  neutrophil  count  decreased  (27.3%),  headache,  nausea,  platelet  count decreased (24.2% each) and neutropenia and white blood cell count decreased (21.2% each).

Overall, 100% of subjects had Grade ≥ 3 AEs. The most commonly reported Grade ≥ 3 AEs by PT were neutrophil count decreased (27.3%), anaemia (24.2%), and neutropenia and white blood cell count decreased (21.2% each).

About half of the subjects (48.5%, n=16) died during the study, most of them (42.4%) due to study indication. Two subjects died due to AEs which were considered as unrelated to study treatment by the Investigator, which seems plausible.

Regardless of relationship to tisagenlecleucel, 69.7% of subjects experienced at least 1 SAE during the study. The most commonly reported SAEs (&gt; 10%) by PT were CRS (24.2%) and pyrexia (18.2%). The most commonly reported SAEs (&gt; 5%) suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel by PT were cytokine release syndrome (24.2%), pyrexia (12.1%), and seizures (6.1%).

Regardless of relationship to study treatment, AESIs  based  on  important identified risks of tisagenlecleucel  were  experienced  by  97.0%  of  subjects  ( ≥ Grade  3:  78.8%).  The  most  frequently reported AESIs by group term were haematological disorders including cytopenias (75.8%, ≥ Grade 3: 72.7%), CRS (69.7%, ≥ Grade 3: 15.2%), infections (30.3%, ≥ Grade 3: 15.2%), serious neurological adverse reactions (27.3%, ≥ Grade 3: 15.2%), prolonged depletion of normal B cells or agammaglobulinemia  (15.2 %,  ≥ Grade  3:  3%).  AESIs  based  on  important  potential  risks  of tisagenlecleucel  were  observed  in  33.3%  (12%  experiencing  a ≥ Grade  3  event)  of  subjects,  with hypogammaglobulinemia being the most frequently reported AESI by PT (9.1%, n=3).

Overall,  the  safety  results  in  this  patient  population  were  in  line  with  the  known  safety  profile  of tisagenlecleucel, although it is of note that the study population is small. No new safety signals were observed and therefore no safety-related update to the approved Kymriah SmPC is deemed necessary.

## 9. PRAC advice

Not applicable

## 10. Changes to the Product Information

As a result of this variation, sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated to reflect the primary analysis results from study C2202. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly.

The proposed revisions to SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1, and PL section 2 in the MAH response to the RSI, are considered acceptable. Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

## 11. Request for supplementary information

## 11.2 Other concerns

## Clinical aspects

## SmPC/PL

The MAH is requested to update the SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1, and PL section 2 according to the comments in the attached PI.

## 12. MS comments on the CAT Rapporteur's preliminary Assessment Report

Comments to the CAT Rapporteur's preliminary Assessment Report dated 30-May-2022 were received from Member State (MS) 1 and MS2.

## MS1 comments

MS1 fully endorsed the CAT Rapporteur's assessment and had no further comments.

## MS2 comments

Overall, MS2 agreed with the CAT Rapporteur's assessment and SmPC comments, and supported the inclusion  of  paediatric  data  in  r/r  mature  B-cell  NHL  in  the  SmPC.  MS2  raised  some  specific  issues concerning the SmPC, detailed below.

In section 4.2, MS2 proposed to add the statement 'Kymriah is not recommended for use in children and adolescents with B-cell lymphomas as efficacy has not been established' to clarify that Kymriah is not indicated for paediatric patients with B-cell lymphomas.

Further, in section 4.2, MS2 proposed to adjust the age range in the current text '…the safety and efficacy of Kymriah in children and adolescents below 18 years of age are described in section 5.1….' so that it reflects that 4 patients between 20-22 years old were also included in study C2202, and to ensure that age ranges given in sections 4.2 and 5.1 match and are consistent.

In section 5.1, MS2 proposes to add information concerning the number of prior lines of therapy, the proportion of patients with prior HSCT, and possibly also the proportion of patients who received bridging therapy prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, on the background that this information would be of interest to prescribers.

Further, MS2 proposes to ask the applicant to specify which subtypes are included in the term 'other diagnoses' in the phrase 'Subgroup analysis showed a lower ORR in patients with Burkitt lymphoma (20%, 95% CI 4.3, 48.1) compared to patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (37.5%, 95% CI: 8.5, 75.5) or other diagnoses (60.0%, 95% CI: 14.7, 94.7)'.

The removal of PFS and OS from the SmPC is supported by MS1, considering the data is from a SAT.

## CAT Rapporteur's Assessment:

The  comments  received  from  MS1  and  MS2  are  appreciated.  The  comments  from  MS2  have  been incorporated as appropriate in the updated SmPC.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Regarding the MS2 suggestion to include a statement in section 4.2 that the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel has not been established in the paediatric B-cell lymphoma population, the CAT Rapp proposed further amendments to this  section.  In  line  with  the  SmPC  Guideline,  the  following  statement  is  proposed included  for  both  DLBCL  and  FL  indications:  ' The  safety  and  efficacy  of  Kymriah  in  children  and adolescents below 18 years of age have not yet been established '. Please refer to the enclosed SmPC.

Concerning the proposal to adjust the age range given in the reference in section 4.2, it should be noted that the information referred to is given under the subheading of 'paediatric population'. Therefore, it is not considered appropriate to include information on young adults (18-22 years of age). This approach is also in line with the SmPC Guideline. Acknowledging that the data on the young adult population are also described under the subheading of 'paediatric population' in section 5.1, it is considered acceptable to include this information as part of the complete study results.

It is agreed with MS2 that further baseline information on the EAS, including the number of prior lines of therapy, proportion of patients with prior HSCT, as well as the percentage of patients received bridging therapy, may be of value to prescribers and should be included in section 5.1. The inclusion of this information would also be consistent with what is presented in the SmPC for the DLBCL and FL pivotal studies. A comment regarding the inclusion of this data has been added to the SmPC.

Concerning the use of the term 'other diagnoses' in section 5.1, a small amendment has been proposed to clarify. This is considered sufficient as all diagnoses included in the study were already provided in the initial paragraph. Please refer to the enclosed SmPC.
