Based on the currently available quality- related information relating to the approval of the new manufacturing site in the EU (see II/0013), the suspension of the Marketing Authorisation for Forcaltonin 100IU solution for infusion has been lifted.                                                                                                                             |

The opinion will be revisited after one year or as soon as all adequate information on the manufacturer of the finished product has been provided to the Committee. |
