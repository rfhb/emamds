## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Submission of the dossier

Viatris Limited submitted on 11 November 2024 an extension of the marketing authorisation.

Extension application to add a new strength of 160 mg for solution for film-coated tablets. The RMP (version 1.0) is updated in accordance.

The MAH applied for an addition of a new strength in all approved indications:

- as monotherapy or in combination with androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of adult men with high-risk biochemical recurrent (BCR) non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC) who are unsuitable for salvage-radiotherapy (see section 5.1).
- in combination with androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of adult men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) (see section 5.1).
- for the treatment of adult men with high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (see section 5.1).
- for the treatment of adult men with metastatic CRPC who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated (see section 5.1).
- for the treatment of adult men with metastatic CRPC whose disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy.

## 1.2. Legal basis

## The legal basis for this application refers to:

Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, (2) point(s) (c) - Extensions of marketing authorisations

## 1.3. Information on Paediatric requirements

Not applicable

## 1.4. Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## 1.4.1. Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## 1.5. Scientific advice

The MAH did not seek Scientific advice at the CHMP for the current line extension.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Problem Statement

Enzalutamide Viatris is currently indicated:

- as monotherapy or in combination with androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of adult men with high-risk biochemical recurrent (BCR) non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC) who are unsuitable for salvage-radiotherapy (see section 5.1).
- in  combination  with  androgen  deprivation  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  men  with  metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) (see section 5.1).
- for the treatment of adult men with high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (see section 5.1).
- for the treatment of adult men with metastatic CRPC who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated (see section 5.1).
- for the treatment of adult men with metastatic CRPC whose disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy.

Enzalutamide Viatris is currently available as 40 mg and 80 mg film-coated tablets. The recommended dose is 160 mg enzalutamide (four 40 mg film-coated tablets or two 80 mg film-coated tablets) as a single oral daily dose.

This submission is an application for an extension of the marketing authorisation to introduce an additional strengths 160 mg of enzalutamide in addition to the existing 40-mg and 80-mg strengths film-coated tablets formulations.

The objective of the new strengths is to minimize the quantity of dosage units and therefore to reduce the patient 'tablet burden'.

Two bioequivalence (BE) studies ENZ-0623-60 and ENZ-0623-61 have been performed using the originator Xtandi as a reference product.

## 2.2. About the product

Enzalutamide is a potent androgen receptor signalling inhibitor that blocks several steps in the androgen receptor signalling pathway. Enzalutamide competitively inhibits androgen binding to androgen receptors, and consequently; inhibits nuclear translocation of activated receptors and inhibits the association of the activated androgen receptor with DNA even in the setting of androgen receptor overexpression and in prostate cancer cells resistant to anti-androgens. Enzalutamide treatment decreases the growth of prostate cancer cells and can induce cancer cell death and tumour regression.

The environmental risk assessment was performed following the 'Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use' ((EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev. 1 - Corr., 2024). Based on the result obtained following the decision tree for Phase I ERA a tailored ERA was required since enzalutamide is an Endocrine Active Substance (EAS) with an antiandrogen mode of action. The Applicant conducted a comparative assessment to show similarity between the medicinal product at hand and the originator's product Xtandi in terms of indications, market areas, population groups, and strengths. In addition, the Applicant performed the required evaluation of the information available regarding the active substance to show that the scientific conclusions reached via earlier ERA remain applicable for his product. Based on the information available on the EMA website and the available documentation linked to the Marketing Authorisation Approval of the originator's product, Xtandi, is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.2. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The Applicant performed a thorough search of the literature. The new strength introduced has been developed only to serve the daily dose via the intake of lesser tablets therefore the marketing authorization of the new strength  will  not  alter  current  environmental  exposure,  and  the  already  available  data  from  procedure EMEA/H/C/006299/0000 are sufficient to support the current application.

The information presented in this application is sufficient to support this conclusion and fulfils the requirements of the CHMP guideline (i.e., EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev. 1 - Corr., 2024).

The  non-clinical  sections  of  the  SmPC  are  in  line  with  the  latest  version  of  the  originator  (Xtandi  EMEA/H/C/002639 - Last updated 09.07.2024)

## 2.4.3. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The non-clinical data submitted is adequate. The discussion regarding the impurity profile is included and considered sufficient. There are no remaining issues from the non-clinical perspective.

## 2.5. Clinical aspects

## · Determination of Sample size

Sample size calculation was based on the power of Schuirmann's two one-sided tests procedure for interval hypotheses using the ± 20 rule for the assessment of average bioequivalence.

For Enzalutamide, considering total variability of 26% and a T/R ratio of 92.4%, power of 80%, 80 subjects were considered sufficient to establish bioequivalence between formulations.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Analytical methods

Enzalutamide was determined by a LC/MS/MS method.

Study samples handling, processing and storage conditions were described in the Bioanalytical Report and in the Final Clinical Study Report.

Each run contained 16 QC samples (four samples at each of four levels) - more than 5 % of the total number of unknown samples in the run.

Unexpired certificates of Analysis for enzalutamide and enzalutamide-D6 were attached to the Bioanalytical Report. Isotopic enrichment of internal standard was 98.5 %. Stock solutions were stored at -20°C within the validated stability period. The preparation of calibration standards and quality control samples was from two separate stock solutions.

One sample was repeated under code A due to obvious problem arising during analysis (it means e.g. technical error, sample processing error, equipment failure). This reason for re-assay was predefined in the SOP and was acceptable.

The pre-dose concentrations higher than LLOQ were not observed.

Incurred sample reproducibility was evaluated with enough samples around cmax and at 72 h. At least 2/3 of the total samples selected for ISR evaluation have met the percent difference criteria of ≤ 20.0% of the mean between original and re-assayed concentrations.

All chromatograms (of 100 % of study subjects) and chromatograms of failed analytical run were attached to the Bioanalytical Report. The chromatography data acquisition and analysis were accomplished using SCIEX OS 2.1.0. No re-integration or manual integration was performed during the analysis of study samples.

The method was validated for the calibration range of 10 to 8000 ng/mL.

In  line  with  the  ICH  guideline  M10,  100  %  chromatograms  were  submitted  for  all  validation  and  partial validation tests.

## · Pharmacokinetic variables

The pharmacokinetic parameters of enzalutamide were calculated from the drug concentration vs time profile by non-compartmental model using WinNonlin statistical software, version 8.4.

Primary pharmacokinetic variables:

| C max              | Maximum measured plasma concentration over the time span specified.                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Truncated AUC 0-72 | The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, from time (0) hour to the last measurable concentration time (72) hour, as calculated by the linear trapezoidal method via partial AUC. |

Secondary pharmacokinetic variables:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AUC0-∞ The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time (0) to infinity. AUC0-∞ was calculated as the sum of the AUC0-t plus the ratio of the last measurable plasma concentration to the elimination rate constant.

tmax Time of the maximum measured plasma concentration. If the maximum value occurred at more than one time point, tmax was defined as the first time point with this value.

t1/2el The elimination or terminal half-life was calculated as 0.693/ Kel.

Kel Apparent first-order elimination or terminal rate constant calculated from a semi-log plot of the plasma concentration versus time curve. The parameter was calculated by linear leastsquares regression analysis using the last three (or more) non-zero plasma concentrations and excluding Cmax.

AUC%Extrap\\_obs Percent of AUC0-∞ extrapolated, represented as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The secondary pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-∞ , Kel, t1/2el and AUC%Extrap\\_obs were calculated for information purposes only.

## · Statistical methods

The pharmacokinetic calculations were performed by WinNonlin statistical software, version 8.4.

Descriptive statistics were calculated for plasma concentrations at each individual time point and for all PK parameters.

The  statistical  evaluation  of  bioequivalence  included  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  in  the  logarithmically transformed  data  of  Cmax  and  truncated  AUC0-72  calculation  of  formulations  ratios  (point  estimates)  and parametric 90% confidence interval for ln-transformed Cmax and truncated AUC0-72 parameters.

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) tested for treatment effect was used. ANOVA was performed on ln truncated AUC0-72 and ln Cmax for enzalutamide. Fixed effects model was used.

Treatment  effect  was  tested  at  the  0.05  level  of  significance  for  Cmax  and  truncated  AUC0-72.  Intersubject variability was calculated using residual variance of ANOVA for ln-transformed analysis of Cmax and truncated AUC0-72.

A logarithmic transformation of the original data was used. Under the assumption of a logarithmic normal distribution,  a  parametric  approach  recommended  by  Steinijans  and  Diletti  based  on  the  inclusion  of  the shortest 90% confidence interval in the bioequivalence range was adopted.

For the parametric analysis of bioequivalence for ln-transformed data, the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of (Test /Reference) was to be contained within the acceptance boundaries of 80.00 - 125.00% for truncated AUC0-72 (that defines the extent of absorption) and for Cmax (parameter that reflects rate of absorption) to conclude bioequivalence between formulations.

(Enzalutamide) given as a single dose of 160 mg enzalutamide under fed conditions, in healthy adult male subjects. A total of 80 (plus 2 alternates) healthy, adult, male human subjects were enrolled in the study.

## · Objectives

Primary objective of this study is to investigate the bioequivalence of test product relative to reference product after a single oral dose of 160 mg enzalutamide to healthy male adults under fed conditions.

Secondary  objective  of  this  study  is  to  investigate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  the  test  and  reference formulation.

## · Dose and mode of administration

On study day 1, following the overnight fast of at least 10 hours, a standardized high fat, high caloric breakfast was  served  30  minutes  before  dosing.  Thereafter,  the  study  drugs  were  administered  according  to  a randomization plan. The administration of the study drugs was documented in the drug administration forms. Study drugs were administered by the clinical staff of IPRC as follows:

Test Product (Treatment A): One tablet of Enzalutamide 160 mg film-coated Tablets was given with 240 ml of water. Water was at room temperature and was measured with a graduated cylinder.

Reference Product (Treatment B): Four tablets of Xtandi   40 mg film-coated tablets were given with 240 ml of water. Water was at room temperature and was measured with a graduated cylinder.

The study drugs were given in a sitting posture under the supervision of trained study personnel.

No  consumption  of  beverages  or  foods  containing  methylxanthines,  (e.g.  coffee,  tea,  cola,  energy  drinks, chocolate, etc.) or poppy containing foods was permitted for the subjects at least 48 hours prior to the study drug administration until the end of confinement period. In addition, the consumption of any beverages or foods containing grapefruit, Seville orange or pomelo -containing beverages and food was prohibited at least 30 days prior to the study drug administration until donating the last sample of the study. Also, consumption of alcohol containing beverages and foods was prohibited for at least 30 days before study drug administration and until donating the last sample of the study. Food and fluid-intake was starting from the dinner served at least 11 hours before study drug administration on study day -1 until the end of confinement. The subjects were not allowed to consume any additional beverages or foodstuffs other than those provided throughout the period of confinement.

Subjects received a standardized, high-fat high-calorie breakfast 30 minutes prior to administration of the study drug. The subjects were asked to finish breakfast within 30 minutes before the scheduled dosing time. High fat, high calories meal was served in the study.

## · Sampling schedule

Blood samples (22) were collected before dose (0.00) and 0.167, 0.333, 0.667, 1.00, 1.33, 1.67, 2.00, 2.33, 2.67, 3.00, 3.33, 3.67, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 6.00, 10.00, 24.00, 36.00, 48.00 and 72.00 hours post dose. The total volume of blood draws did not exceed 420 ml for each subject.

## · Protocol deviations

All protocol deviations in this study were minor in nature.

## · Randomization

The study was randomized as a parallel design. Administration was done according to a plan of randomization. Subjects were assigned to one of the two treatments (Test or Reference).

## · Blinding

The study was open-label study in terms of the drug and the dose. The randomization plan and dispense records were freely available to all CRO clinical personnel.

None of the laboratory staff in charge of the bioanalysis of plasma samples had access to the randomization, since the bioassay was performed blinded with regard to the randomization.

## · Determination of Sample size

Sample size calculation was based on the power of Schuirmann's two one-sided tests procedure for interval hypotheses using the ± 20 rule for the assessment of average bioequivalence.

For Enzalutamide, considering total variability of 26% and a T/R ratio of 92.4%, power of 80%, 80 subjects were considered sufficient to establish bioequivalence between formulations.

## · Analytical methods

Enzalutamide was determined by the same validated LC/MS/MS method as in the study ENZ-0623-60 over the same calibration range of 10 to 8000 ng/mL. The validation parameters have already been summarized and assessed for the study ENZ-0623-60 (see above). In addition, the long-term stability of enzalutamide in human plasma was proved also in presence of N-Desmethyl Enzalutamide up to 22 days at -20 °C (Attachment 05 to the Validation Report).

The  compliance  with  SOPs  and  GLP  principles  was  declared  and  the  QAU  statement  was  enclosed  in  the Bioanalytical Report.

Study samples handling, processing and storage conditions were described in the Bioanalytical Report and in the Final Clinical Study Report.

All acceptance criteria for calibrators and QC samples followed the ICH guideline M10. Each run contained 16 QC samples (four samples at each of four levels) - more than 5 % of the total number of unknown samples in the run. All runs passed the acceptance criteria. The results of between-run QC samples accuracy and precision demonstrated reliable performance of the method. QCs graphs trend analysis and internal standard plots were provided as outlined in the updated ICH M10 guideline. All runs passed the acceptance criteria.

No sample was repeated. There was no pre-dose sample with quantifiable concentration.

Incurred sample reproducibility was evaluated with enough samples around cmax and at 72 h. At least 2/3 of the total samples selected for ISR evaluation have met the percent difference criteria of ≤ 20.0% of the mean between original and re-assayed concentrations as outlined in the guidelines.

All chromatograms (100 % of study subjects) as well as all validation chromatograms were attached to the Bioanalytical Report. The chromatography data acquisition and analysis were accomplished using SCIEX OS 2.1.0 software. No re-integration or manual integration was done.

## · Pharmacokinetic variables

The pharmacokinetic parameters of enzalutamide were calculated from the drug concentration vs time profile by non-compartmental model using WinNonlin statistical software, version 8.4.

Primary pharmacokinetic variables:

Cmax

Maximum measured plasma concentration over the time span specified.

Truncated AUC0-72

The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, from time (0) hour to the last measurable concentration time (72) hour, as calculated by the linear trapezoidal method via partial AUC.

Secondary pharmacokinetic variables:

AUC0-∞ The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time (0) to infinity. AUC0-∞ was  calculated  as  the  sum  of  the  AUC0-t  plus  the  ratio  of  the  last  measurable  plasma concentration to the elimination rate constant.

tmax Time of the maximum measured plasma concentration. If the maximum value occurred at more than one time point, tmax was defined as the first time point with this value.

t1/2el

The elimination or terminal half-life was calculated as 0.693/ Kel.

Kel Apparent first-order elimination or terminal rate constant calculated from a semi-log plot of the plasma concentration versus time curve. The parameter was calculated by linear least-squares regression  analysis  using  the  last  three  (or  more)  non-zero  plasma  concentrations  and excluding Cmax.

AUC%Extrap\\_obs Percent of AUC0-∞ extrapolated, represented as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The secondary pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-∞ , Kel, t1/2el and AUC%Extrap\\_obs were calculated for information purposes only.

## · Statistical methods

The pharmacokinetic calculations were performed by WinNonlin statistical software, version 8.4.

Descriptive statistics were calculated for plasma concentrations at each individual time point and for all PK parameters.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  statistical  evaluation  of  bioequivalence  included  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  in  the  logarithmically transformed  data  of  Cmax  and  truncated  AUC0-72  calculation  of  formulations  ratios  (point  estimates)  and parametric 90% confidence interval for ln-transformed Cmax and truncated AUC0-72 parameters.

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) tested for treatment effect was used. ANOVA was performed on ln truncated AUC0-72 and ln Cmax for enzalutamide. Fixed effects model was used.

Treatment  effect  was  tested  at  the  0.05  level  of  significance  for  Cmax  and  truncated  AUC0-72.  Intersubject variability was calculated using residual variance of ANOVA for ln-transformed analysis of Cmax and truncated AUC0-72.

A logarithmic transformation of the original data was used. Under the assumption of a logarithmic normal distribution,  a  parametric  approach  recommended  by  Steinijans  and  Diletti  based  on  the  inclusion  of  the shortest 90% confidence interval in the bioequivalence range was adopted.

For the parametric analysis of bioequivalence for ln-transformed data, the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of (Test /Reference) was to be contained within the acceptance boundaries of 80.00 - 125.00% for truncated AUC0-72 (that defines the extent of absorption) and for Cmax (parameter that reflects rate of absorption) to conclude bioequivalence between formulations.

## · Safety data

One subject reported hypotension during the study on 07/03/24, blood pressure test was performed at 07:30 and found below 90/60 mm Hg then blood pressure test was repeated at 07:56 and found to be within normal range. The AE was resolved prior to study drug administration.

No severe, serious or life-threatening adverse events were reported during the course of the study. The test and reference products were found to be safe and well tolerated by the study subjects.

## Pharmacokinetic Conclusion

Based on the presented bioequivalence studies Enzalutamide 160 mg Film-coated Tablet could is considered bioequivalent with Xtandi 40 mg, Film-coated Tablet at 160 mg dose.

## Pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The reference product can be taken with or without food according to the SmPC. Since the specific formulation (solid dispersion) of the tablet is known to be critical to the performance of the formulation in fed conditions, it cannot be assumed that the impact of food will be the same regardless of formulation. Therefore, both fasted and  fed  state  comparisons  of  test  to  reference  formulations  are  required.  Composition  of  served  high  fat breakfast in study ENZ-0623-61 is in accordance with guideline recommendations.

In accordance with 'Enzalutamide soft capsule 40 mg and film-coated tablet 40 mg &amp; 80 mg product-specific bioequivalence guidance' (EMA/CHMP/371467/2021), a cross-over design is preferable to a parallel study, but a parallel study is also acceptable considering the long half-life of enzalutamide (5.8 days - range 2.8 to 10.2 days).

The median time to reach maximum plasma enzalutamide concentrations (Cmax) is 2 hours (range 0.5 to 6 hours), the sampling schedule is considered appropriate because it ensured reliable estimation of the peak exposure. Samples were collected up to 72 hours, this is sufficient for IR product despite the long half-life of enzalutamide.

The chosen population complies with the guidelines and both treatment groups in both studies are well balanced and comparable.

All protocol deviations in both studies were minor in nature and consequently, had no significant impact on the integrity of the study results or on subject safety. Some samples after confinement period were not withdrawn on scheduled time. Nevertheless, the effect of these time deviations in collection time on results is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

minimal as the actual post-dose sample collection times were taken into consideration in the statistical analysis. There were no non-zero pre-dose concentration

Enzalutamide was determined in both studies by a LC/MS/MS method. developed and validated in compliance with ICH guideline M10 over the calibration range of 10 to 8000 ng/mL.

The compliance with SOPs and GLP principles was declared and the Quality Assurance Unit statement was enclosed in the Bioanalytical Report.

The  results  of  between-run  QC  samples  accuracy  and  precision  demonstrated  reliable  performance  of  the method. QCs graphs trend analysis and internal standard plots were provided as outlined in the updated ICH M10 guideline.

The method was validated for the calibration range of 10 to 8000 ng/mL. The method was demonstrated to be selective, linear, and reliable. The newer type of detector was evaluated in the partial validation (within- and between-run accuracy, precision, and linearity). The extent of partial validation was acceptable.

Stability studies demonstrated that analyte was stable under conditions of samples shipment, treatment, and analysis. Study samples were analysed within a period covered by the long-term stability data.

100 % chromatograms were submitted for all validation and partial validation tests as outlined in the updated ICH guideline M10.

Overall, the method was suitable for the determination of enzalutamide in K3EDTA human plasma samples from  bioequivalence  studies  over  a  calibration  range  of  10  ng/mL  to  8000ng/mL.  Enzalutamide  was demonstrated to be stable under various storage conditions.

Based on the presented bioequivalence studies Enzalutamide 160 mg Film-coated Tablet could be considered bioequivalent with Xtandi 40 mg, Film-coated Tablet at 160 mg dose.

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical pharmacology

Based on the presented bioequivalence studies Enzalutamide 160 mg Film-coated Tablet is considered bioequivalent with Xtandi 40 mg, Film-coated Tablet at 160 mg dose.

## 2.6. Clinical efficacy

## 2.9. Product information

## 2.9.1. User consultation

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Xtandi. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

This application concerns a hybrid version of enzalutamide 160 mg film-coated tablets. The reference product Xtandi is indicated:

· as monotherapy or in combination with androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of adult men with high-risk biochemical recurrent (BCR) non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC) who are unsuitable for salvage-radiotherapy (see section 5.1).

- in  combination  with  androgen  deprivation  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  men  with  metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) (see section 5.1).
- for  the  treatment  of  adult  men  with  high-risk  non-metastatic  castration-resistant  prostate  cancer (CRPC) (see section 5.1).
- for the treatment of adult men with metastatic CRPC who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated (see section 5.1).

· for  the  treatment  of  adult  men  with  metastatic  CRPC  whose  disease  has  progressed  on  or  after docetaxel therapy.

Nonclinical studies have been provided for this application and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant's clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient.

Two  bioequivalence  studies  (Study  ENZ-0623-60  and  Study  ENZ-0623-61  form  the  pivotal  basis  for  this application. Both studies were single centre, open-label, laboratory-blinded, randomized, single-dose, two-arm, two  treatment,  with  parallel  design  comparing  the  bioequivalence  of  enzalutamide  from  Test  product  and Reference Product given as a single dose of 160 mg enzalutamide under fasting or fed conditions, in healthy adult male subjects.

A cross-over study design would have been preferable to a parallel study, but a parallel study is also acceptable considering the long half-life of enzalutamide (5.8 days - range 2.8 to 10.2 days) and is considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation. In accordance with 'Enzalutamide soft capsule 40 mg and film-coated tablet 40 mg &amp; 80 mg product-specific bioequivalence guidance' (EMA/CHMP/371467/2021 the reference product can be taken with or without food according to the SmPC.

Both fasted and fed state comparisons of the test to the reference formulations were performed, since the specific formulation (solid dispersion) of the tablet is known to be critical to the performance of the formulation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in fed conditions and could not be assumed that the impact of food would have been the same regardless of formulation.

Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied are adequate.

The  test  formulation  of  Enzalutamide  160  mg  film-coated  tablets met  the  protocol-defined  criteria  for bioequivalence when compared with the Xtandi 40 mg film-coated tablets (four tablets). The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t, AUC0∞, and Cmax were all contained within the  protocol-defined  acceptance  range  of  80.00  to  125.00%.  Bioequivalence  of  the  two  formulations  was demonstrated.

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product could therefore be concluded.

## Conclusions

The overall benefit /risk balance of Enzalutamide 160 mg film-coated tablets is positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and pharmacology, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of, Enzalutamide Viatris 160mg new strength is favourable in the following indications:

- as monotherapy or in combination with androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of adult men with high-risk biochemical recurrent (BCR) non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC) who are unsuitable for salvage-radiotherapy (see section 5.1).
- in combination with androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of adult men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) (see section 5.1).
