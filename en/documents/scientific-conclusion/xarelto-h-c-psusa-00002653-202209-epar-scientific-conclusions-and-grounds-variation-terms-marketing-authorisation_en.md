## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for rivaroxaban, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

In view of the available data on 'anticoagulant related nephropathy' (ARN) from the literature and spontaneous reports, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between rivaroxaban and ARN is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing rivaroxaban should be amended accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for rivaroxaban the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefitrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing rivaroxaban is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
