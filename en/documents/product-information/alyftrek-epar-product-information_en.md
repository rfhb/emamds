Purple, capsule-shaped tablet debossed with 'V10' on one side and plain on the other (15 mm × 7 mm).

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Alyftrek tablets are indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in people aged 6 years and older who have at least one non-Class I mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Alyftrek should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals with experience in the treatment of CF. If the person with CF has an unknown genotype, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be performed to confirm the presence of at least one CFTR mutation that is responsive based on clinical and/or in vitro data (using a genotyping assay) (see section 5.1). Alyftrek should only be used in people diagnosed with CF. A diagnosis of CF should be made based on diagnostic guidelines and clinical judgement.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There are a limited number of people with CF who harbour mutations not listed in Table 4 that may be responsive to treatment. In these cases, treatment can be considered when the physician deems the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks and under close medical supervision. This excludes people with CF with two Class I (null) mutations (mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein) as they are not expected to respond to modulator therapy (see sections 4.1, 4.4, and 5.1).

## Posology

Monitoring of transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin is recommended for all patients prior to initiating treatment, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. For patients with a history of liver disease or transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered (see section 4.4).

Adults and paediatrics aged 6 years and older should be dosed according to Table 1.

| Table 1: Dosing recommendation for people with CF aged 6 years and older   | Table 1: Dosing recommendation for people with CF aged 6 years and older   | Table 1: Dosing recommendation for people with CF aged 6 years and older   |

Each dose should be taken in its entirety with fat-containing food, once daily at approximately the same time each day (see Method of administration).

## Missed dose

If 6 hours or less have passed since the missed dose, the missed dose should be taken as soon as possible, and the original schedule should be continued the next day.

If more than 6 hours have passed since the missed dose, the missed dose should be skipped, and the original schedule should be continued the next day.

## Concomitant use of CYP3A inhibitors

When co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole, erythromycin, verapamil) or strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin, or clarithromycin), the dose should be reduced as recommended in Table 2 (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Elderly

No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly patient population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

## Mild hepatic impairment (ChildPugh Class A)

No dose adjustment is recommended. Liver function tests should be closely monitored (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2).

## Moderate hepatic impairment (ChildPugh Class B)

Use not recommended. D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefit outweighs the risk. If used, no dose adjustment is recommended. Liver function tests should be closely monitored (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2).

## Severe hepatic impairment (ChildPugh Class C)

Should not be used (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Renal impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended for people with CF who have mild or moderate renal impairment. There is no experience in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

## Paediatric population

The safety and efficacy of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ in children aged less than 6 years have not yet been established. No clinical trial data are available. D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ should not be used in children less than 1 year of age because of safety-related findings in juvenile rat studies with tezacaftor (see section 5.3).

## Method of administration

For oral use. People with CF should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole. The tablets should not be chewed, crushed, or broken before swallowing because there are no clinical data currently available to support other methods of administration.

Tablets should be taken with fat-containing food. Examples of meals or snacks that contain fat are those prepared with butter or oils or those containing eggs, cheeses, nuts, whole milk, or meats (see section 5.2).

Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment (see section 4.5).

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Elevated transaminases and hepatic injury

Cases of liver failure leading to transplantation have been reported within the first 6 months of treatment in patients with and without pre-existing advanced liver disease taking a medicinal product containing elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor, which contains one same (tezacaftor) and one similar (ivacaftor) active ingredient as Alyftrek. Elevated transaminases are common in people with CF and have been observed in some people with CF treated with D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ (see section 4.8). In patients taking IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, transaminase elevations have sometimes been associated with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. Assessments of transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin are recommended for all people with CF prior to initiating treatment, every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. For people with CF with a history of liver disease or transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered.

Treatment should be interrupted, and serum transaminases and total bilirubin should be promptly measured if a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of liver injury (e.g., jaundice and/or dark urine, unexplained nausea or vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, or anorexia). Dosing should be interrupted in the event of ALT or AST &gt; 5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or AST &gt; 3 × ULN with bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN. Laboratory tests should be closely followed until the abnormalities resolve. Following resolution, the benefits and risks of resuming treatment should be considered (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). Patients who resume treatment after interruption should be monitored closely.

In people with CF with pre-existing advanced liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, portal hypertension) D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ should be used with caution and only if the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used in these patients, they should be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2).

## Patients who discontinued or interrupted a medicinal product containing tezacaftor or ivacaftor due to adverse reactions

There are no available safety data for D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ in patients who previously discontinued or interrupted treatment with a medicinal product containing tezacaftor or ivacaftor due to adverse reactions. The benefits and risks should be considered before using D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ in these patients. If D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ is used in these patients, they should be closely monitored, as clinically appropriate.

## Hepatic impairment

Treatment of patients with moderate hepatic impairment is not recommended. For people with CF with moderate hepatic impairment, the use of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, no dose adjustment is needed.

Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2).

## Depression and other psychiatric disorders

Depression and anxiety have been reported in patients treated with D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ.

In some cases, symptom improvement was reported after treatment discontinuation. Patients (and caregivers) should be alerted about the need to monitor for depressed mood, suicidal thoughts,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

insomnia, anxiety, or unusual changes in behaviour and instruct them to notify their physician if these symptoms occur (see section 4.8).

## Renal impairment

There is no experience with D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ in people with CF with severe renal impairment/endstage renal disease therefore caution is recommended in this population (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Mutations unlikely to respond to modulator therapy

Patients with a genotype consisting of two CFTR mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein (i.e., two Class I mutations) are not expected to respond to treatment.

## Clinical studies comparing D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ to TEZ/IVA or IVA

No clinical study has been conducted to directly compare D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ to TEZ/IVA or IVA in patients not harbouring F508del variants.

## Patients after organ transplantation

D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ has not been studied in people with CF who have undergone organ transplantation. Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. If used, see section 4.5 for interactions with commonly used immunosuppressants.

## Rash events

The incidence of rash events was higher in females than in males, particularly in females taking hormonal contraceptives. A role for hormonal contraceptives in the occurrence of rash cannot be excluded. For people with CF taking hormonal contraceptives who develop rash, interrupting treatment with D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ and hormonal contraceptives should be considered. Following the resolution of rash, it should be considered if resuming D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ without hormonal contraceptives is appropriate. If rash does not recur, resumption of hormonal contraceptives can be considered (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).

## Elderly

Clinical studies of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ did not include sufficient number of people with CF aged 65 years and older to determine whether response in these patients is different from younger adults. Dose recommendations are based on the pharmacokinetic profile and knowledge from studies with tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA) in combination with ivacaftor (IVA), and ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Interactions with medicinal products

## CYP3A inducers

Exposures to vanzacaftor (VNZ), tezacaftor (TEZ) and deutivacaftor (D-IVA) are expected to decrease with the concomitant use of moderate or strong CYP3A inducers, potentially resulting in the reduction of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ efficacy; therefore, co-administration with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.5).

## CYP3A inhibitors

Exposure to VNZ, TEZ and D-IVA are increased when co-administered with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors. Therefore, the dose should be reduced when used concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Cataracts

Cases of non-congenital lens opacities without impact on vision have been reported in people with CF aged less than 18 years treated with ivacaftor (IVA)-containing regimens. Although other risk factors were present in some cases (such as corticosteroid use, exposure to radiation), a possible risk attributable to treatment with IVA cannot be excluded. As D-IVA is a deuterated isotopologue of IVA, baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in people with CF aged less than 18 years initiating treatment with D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ (see section 5.3).

## Excipients with known effect

## Sodium

This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Medicinal products affecting the pharmacokinetics of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ

## CYP3A inducers

VNZ, TEZ and D-IVA are substrates of CYP3A. VNZ and D-IVA are sensitive substrates of CYP3A. Concomitant use of CYP3A inducers may result in reduced exposures and thus reduced D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ efficacy. Co-administration with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.4).

Examples of moderate or strong CYP3A inducers include:

- rifampicin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ), and efavirenz

## CYP3A inhibitors

Co-administration with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased VNZ AUC by 10.5-fold, TEZ AUC by 4.0- to 4.5-fold and D-IVA AUC by 11.1-fold. The dose of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ should be reduced when co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

Examples of strong CYP3A inhibitors include:

- ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole
- telithromycin and clarithromycin

Simulations indicated that co-administration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors may increase VNZ, TEZ, and D-IVA AUC by approximately 2.4- to 3.9-fold, 2.1-fold, and 2.9- to 4.8-fold, respectively. The dose of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ should be reduced when co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

Examples of moderate CYP3A inhibitors include:

- fluconazole
- erythromycin
- verapamil

Co-administration of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of VNZ, TEZ and D-IVA. Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Ciprofloxacin

D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ was not evaluated for concomitant use with ciprofloxacin. However, ciprofloxacin had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of TEZ or IVA and is not expected to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of VNZ or D-IVA. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary during concomitant administration of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ with ciprofloxacin.

## Medicinal products affected by VNZ, TEZ, and D-IVA

## CYP2C9 substrates

D-IVA may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, monitoring of the international normalised ratio (INR) during co-administration of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ with warfarin is recommended. Other medicinal products for which exposure may be increased by D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal products should be used with caution.

## Potential for interaction with transporters

D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ was not evaluated for concomitant use with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates. However, co-administration of tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA) with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin AUC by 1.3-fold. Administration of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used concomitantly with digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index such as ciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used.

Based on in vitro data, VNZ, TEZ, and D-IVA have low potential to inhibit OATP1B1 at clinically relevant concentrations. D-IVA has a similar OATP1B1 inhibition potential to IVA in vitro . Co-administration of TEZ/IVA with pitavastatin, an OATP1B1 substrate, had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure of pitavastatin.

## Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) Substrates

VNZ and D-IVA are inhibitors of BCRP in vitro . Concomitant use of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ with BCRP substrates may increase exposure of these substrates; however, this has not been studied clinically. When administered concomitantly with substrates of BCRP, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used.

## Hormonal contraceptives

D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ was not evaluated for concomitant use with oral contraceptives. TEZ in combination with IVA and IVA alone have been studied with ethinyl estradiol/norethindrone and were found to have no clinically relevant effect on the exposures of the oral contraceptive. VNZ, TEZ, and D-IVA have low potential to induce or inhibit CYP3A in vitro . D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ is not expected to have an impact on the efficacy of oral contraceptives.

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ in pregnant women . Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Alyftrek during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

Limited data show that TEZ is excreted in human milk and has been quantified in plasma of breastfed newborns/infants of treated women. VNZ is excreted into the milk of lactating female rats. The effect of D-IVA has not been evaluated, however, limited data show that IVA is excreted in human milk and has been quantified in plasma of breastfed newborns/infants of treated women.

A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Alyftrek therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

There are no data available on the effect of VNZ, TEZ, and D-IVA on fertility in humans. The effects of D-IVA on fertility have not been evaluated in rats; however, IVA had an effect on fertility in female and male rats. VNZ and TEZ had no effects on fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ has a minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Dizziness has been reported in people with CF receiving TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA as well as IVA monotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients experiencing dizziness should be advised not to drive or use machines until symptoms abate.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most common adverse reactions in people with CF aged 12 years and older treated with Alyftrek include headache (15.8%) and diarrhoea (12.1%). The frequency of treatment discontinuation, in clinical trials, due to adverse reactions is 3.8%. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were alanine aminotransferase increased (1.5%) and aspartate aminotransferase increased (1.3%).

The most common serious adverse reactions that occurred with Alyftrek are ALT increased (0.4%) and AST increased (0.4%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Table 3 reflects adverse reactions observed with D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ, TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA, and IVA monotherapy. Adverse reactions are ranked under the MedDRA frequency classification: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1,000); very rare (&lt; 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

* Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies with deutivacaftor/tezacaftor/vanzacaftor.

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Transaminase elevations

In Studies 121-102 and 121-103, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt; 8 ×, &gt; 5 ×, or &gt; 3 × the ULN was 1.3%, 2.5%, and 6.0% with D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ. The incidence of adverse reactions of transaminase elevations was 9.0% with D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ. Of the D-IVA/TEZ/VNZtreated participants, 1.5% discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases.

In study 121-105, Cohort B1, in people with CF aged 6 to less than 12 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt; 8 ×, &gt; 5 ×, and &gt; 3 × ULN were 0%, 1.3%, and 3.8%, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Rash events

In Studies 121-102 and 121-103, the incidence of rash events (e.g., rash, rash pruritic) was 11.0% with D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ. The rash events were generally mild to moderate in severity. The incidence of rash events was 9.4% in males and 13.0% in females (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

## Increased creatine phosphokinase

In Studies 121-102 and 121-103, the incidence of maximum creatine phosphokinase &gt; 5 × the ULN was 7.9% with D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ. Of the D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ-treated participants, 0.2% discontinued treatment for increased creatine phosphokinase.

## Paediatric population

The safety data of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ in study 121-105, Cohort B1 was evaluated in 78 people with CF aged 6 to less than 12 years. The safety data of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ in study 121-102 and study 121-103 was evaluated in 67 people with CF aged 12 to less than 18 years. The safety profile is generally consistent among paediatric and adult patients.

## Transaminase elevations

During study 121-105, Cohort B1, in people with CF aged 6 to less than 12 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) &gt; 8 ×, &gt; 5 ×, and &gt; 3 × ULN was 0.0%, 1.3%, and 3.8%, respectively. No Alyftrek-treated patients had transaminase elevation &gt; 3 × ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations (see section 4.4).

## Rash

During study 121-105 in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, 4 (5.1%) subjects had at least 1 rash event. The rash events were mild in severity. These rashes did not lead to discontinuation or interruption of treatment.

## Lenticular opacity

During study 121-105 in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, 1 (1.3%) person with CF had an event of lenticular opacity.

## Other special populations

The safety profile of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ was generally similar across all subgroups of patients, including analysis by age, gender, baseline percent predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (ppFEV1) and geographic regions.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

No specific antidote is available for overdose with Alyftrek. Treatment of overdose consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products, ATC code: R07AX33

## Mechanism of action

VNZ and TEZ are CFTR correctors that bind to different sites on the CFTR protein and have an additive effect in facilitating the cellular processing and trafficking of select mutant forms of CFTR (including F508del -CFTR) to increase the amount of CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface compared to either molecule alone. D-IVA potentiates the channel open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface.

The combined effect of VNZ, TEZ and D-IVA is increased quantity and function of CFTR at the cell surface, resulting in increased CFTR activity as measured both by CFTR mediated chloride transport in vitro and by sweat chloride (SwCl) in people with CF.

## CFTR Chloride Transport Assay in Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing mutant CFTR

The chloride transport response of mutant CFTR protein to D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ was determined in Ussing chamber electrophysiology studies using a panel of FRT cell lines transfected with individual CFTR mutations. D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ increased chloride transport in FRT cells expressing select CFTR mutations.

The in vitro CFTR chloride transport response threshold was designated as a net increase of at least 10% of normal over baseline because it is predictive or reasonably expected to predict clinical response. For individual mutations, the magnitude of the net change over baseline in CFTR mediated chloride transport in vitro is not correlated with the magnitude of clinical response.

In CF, the presence of one CFTR mutation responsive to D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ based on in vitro data in FRT cells, will likely result in a clinical response.

Table 4 lists CFTR mutations included in the indication for treatment with Alyftrek. The occurrence of CFTR mutations listed in this table should not be used in lieu of a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, nor as a sole determinant for prescribing purposes.

There are people with CF harbouring two rare, nonF508del CFTR mutations not listed in Table 4. Provided that they do not harbour two Class I (null) mutations (mutations that are known not to produce CFTR protein) (see section 4.1), they may respond to treatment. In these cases, Alyftrek can be considered when the physician deems the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks and under close medical supervision.

The individual diagnosis of CF should be based on diagnostic guidelines and clinical judgement as considerable variability exists in phenotype for patients harbouring the same genotype.

⁎ Mutations supported by clinical data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

† Non-canonical splice mutations where efficacy is extrapolated from clinical data from other CFTR modulators because these mutations are not amenable to FRT assay.

‡  Complex/compound mutations where a single allele of the CFTR gene has multiple mutations; these exist independent of the presence of mutations on the other allele.

¶  N1303K is extrapolated from clinical data from IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA and supported by Human Bronchial Epithelial (HBE) assay data.

#  Mutations are extrapolated from FRT data with TEZ/IVA or IVA monotherapy in which a positive response is indicative of a clinical response.

Non-annotated mutations are included based on the FRT assay with D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ in which a positive response is indicative of a clinical response.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

## Effects on sweat chloride

In study 121-102 (people with CF heterozygous for a F508del and a CFTR mutation that predicts either no production of a CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that does not transport chloride and is not responsive to other CFTR modulators (IVA and TEZ/IVA) in vitro ) , the treatment difference of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ compared to IVA/TEZ/ELX for mean absolute change in SwCl from baseline through week 24 was -8.4 mmol/L (95% CI: -10.5, -6.3; P &lt;0.0001).

In study 121-103 (people with CF homozygous for the F508del mutation, heterozygous for the F508del mutation and either a gating or a residual function mutation, or at least one mutation responsive to IVA/TEZ/ELX with no F508del mutation), the treatment difference of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ compared to IVA/TEZ/ELX for mean absolute change in SwCl from baseline through week 24 was -2.8 mmol/L (95% CI: -4.7, -0.9; P = 0.0034).

In study 121-105, Cohort B1 (people with CF aged 6 to less than 12 years with at least one mutation that is responsive to IVA/TEZ/ELX), the mean absolute change in SwCl from baseline through week 24 was -8.6 mmol/L (95% CI: -11.0, -6.3).

## Cardiovascular effects

## Effect on QT interval

At exposures corresponding up to 6 times over those observed with the VNZ maximum recommended dose, and doses up to 3 times over the TEZ and D-IVA maximum recommended doses, the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects was not prolonged to any clinically relevant extent.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

The efficacy of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ in people with CF aged 12 years and older was evaluated in two, phase 3, randomised, double-blind, IVA/TEZ/ELX-controlled studies (Studies 121-102 and 121-103). The pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and efficacy of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ in people with CF aged 6 to less than 12 years are supported with evidence from studies of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ in people with CF aged 12 years and older (Studies 121-102 and 121-103) and additional data from an open-label, phase 3 study (study 121-105, Cohort B1).

## Studies 121-102 and 121-103

Study 121-102 was a 52-week, randomised, double-blind, IVA/TEZ/ELX-controlled study in people with CF heterozygous for F508del and a CFTR mutation that predicts either no production of a CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that does not transport chloride and is not responsive to other CFTR modulators (IVA and TEZ/IVA) in vitro A total of 398 people with CF aged 12 years and older received IVA/TEZ/ELX during a 4-week run-in period and were then randomised to receive

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ or IVA/TEZ/ELX during the 52-week treatment period. The mean age was 30.8 years (range 12.2 years, 71.6 years; 14.3% aged under 18 years) and 41% female and 59% male. After the 4-week run-in, the mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 67.1 percentage points (range: 28.0, 108.6), the mean CFQ-R RD score at baseline was 84.4 (range 22.2, 100), and the mean SwCl at baseline was 53.9 mmol/L (range: 10.0 mmol/L, 113.5 mmol/L).

Study 121-103 was a 52-week, randomised, double-blind, IVA/TEZ/ELX-controlled study in people with CF who had one of the following genotypes: homozygous for the F508del mutation, heterozygous for the F508del mutation and either a gating or a residual function mutation, or at least one mutation responsive to IVA/TEZ/ELX with no F508del mutation. A total of 573 people with CF aged 12 years and older received IVA/TEZ/ELX during a 4-week run-in period and were then randomised to receive D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ or IVA/TEZ/ELX during the 52-week treatment period. The mean age was 33.7 years (range 12.2 years, 71.2 years; 13.8% aged under 18 years) and 48.9% female and 51.1% male. After the 4-week run-in, the mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 66.8 percentage points (range: 36.4, 112.5), the mean CFQ-R RD score at baseline was 85.7 (range 27.8, 100), and the mean SwCl at baseline was 42.8 mmol/L (range: 10.0 mmol/L, 113.3 mmol/L).

In both studies, the primary endpoint evaluated non-inferiority in mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 through week 24. The key secondary endpoint evaluated superiority in mean absolute change from baseline in SwCl through week 24.

ppFEV1: percent predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second; CI: Confidence Interval; SD: Standard Deviation; SE: Standard Error; CFQ-R RD: Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (respiratory domain); SwCl: Sweat Chloride Note: Analyses were based on the full analysis set (FAS). FAS was defined as all randomised subjects who carry the intended CFTR allele mutation and received at least 1 dose of study treatment.

* A 4-week IVA/TEZ/ELX run-in-period was performed to establish an on-treatment baseline.

† The pre-specified non-inferiority margin was -3.0 percentage points.

§ Not controlled for multiplicity.

In Studies 121-102 and 121-103, mean absolute change from baseline in ppFEV1 and absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through week 24 was maintained through week 52.

Study 121-105

Study 121-105 was an open-label study in people with CF with at least one mutation responsive to IVA/TEZ/ELX. Cohort B1 evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ in a total of 78 people with CF aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean age 9.1 years (range 6.2 years to 12.0 years), 43.6% female, 56.4% male) during a 24-week treatment period. In Cohort B1, all participants were on IVA/TEZ/ELX at baseline. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline on IVA/TEZ/ELX was 99.7 percentage points (range: 29.3, 146.0), the mean CFQ-R RD score at baseline on IVA/TEZ/ELX was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

84.8 (range 16.7, 100), and the mean SwCl at baseline, on IVA/TEZ/ELX, was 40.4 mmol/L (range: 11.5 mmol/L, 109.5 mmol/L).

In study 121-105, Cohort B1, safety and tolerability were the primary endpoints. Efficacy endpoints included absolute change in ppFEV1, absolute change in SwCl, absolute change in CFQ-R respiratory domain score, and number of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) through week 24.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ in one or more subset of the paediatric population in cystic fibrosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

The pharmacokinetics of VNZ, TEZ and D-IVA are similar between healthy adult subjects and people with CF. Following initiation of once-daily dosing of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ plasma concentrations reach steady state within 20 days for VNZ, within 8 days for TEZ, and within 8 days for D-IVA.

Upon dosing D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ to steady state, the accumulation ratio based on AUC is approximately 6.09 for VNZ, 1.92 for TEZ and 1.74 for D-IVA. Key pharmacokinetic parameters for D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ at steady state in people with CF aged 12 years and older are shown in Table 7.

## Absorption

VNZ, TEZ, and D-IVA are absorbed with a median (range) time to maximum concentration (tmax) of approximately 7.80 hours (3.70 to 11.9 hours), 1.60 hours (1.40 to 1.70 hours), and 3.7 hours (2.7 to 11.4 hours), respectively.

VNZ exposure (AUC) increases approximately 4- to 6-fold when administered with fat-containing meals relative to fasted conditions. D-IVA exposure increases approximately 3- to 4-fold when administered with fat-containing meals relative to fasted conditions, while food has no clinically significant effect on the exposure of TEZ (see section 4.2).

## Distribution

VNZ and D-IVA are &gt; 99% bound to plasma protein primarily to albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. TEZ is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin.

After oral administration of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ, the mean (SD) apparent volume of distribution of VNZ, TEZ and D-IVA was 90.4 L (31.3), 123 L (43.2) and 157 L (47.3), respectively. VNZ, TEZ and D-IVA do not partition preferentially into human red blood cells.

## Biotransformation

VNZ is metabolized extensively in humans, mainly by CYP3A4/5. VNZ has no major circulating metabolites.

TEZ is metabolized extensively in humans, mainly by CYP3A4/5. Following oral administration of a single dose of 100 mg 14 C-TEZ to healthy male subjects, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ were the three major circulating metabolites of TEZ in humans. M1-TEZ has similar potency to that of TEZ and is considered pharmacologically active. M2-TEZ is much less pharmacologically active than TEZ or M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ is not considered pharmacologically active. Another minor circulating metabolite, M3-TEZ, is formed by direct glucuronidation of TEZ.

D-IVA is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4/5 to form the two major circulating metabolites, M1-D-IVA and M6-D-IVA. M1-D-IVA has approximately one-fifth the potency of D-IVA and is considered pharmacologically active. M6-D-IVA is not considered pharmacologically active.

## Elimination

After oral administration of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ, the mean (SD) apparent clearance values of VNZ, TEZ and D-IVA were 1.18 (0.455) L/h, 0.937 (0.338) L/h and 6.52 (2.77) L/h, respectively. The mean (SD) terminal half-lives of VNZ, TEZ and D-IVA following administration of the D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ fixed-dose combination tablets are approximately 54.0 (10.1) hours, 92.4 (23.1) hours and 17.3 (2.67) hours, respectively. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the mean (SD) effective half-lives of VNZ, TEZ and D-IVA following administration of the D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ fixed-dose

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

combination tablets in people with CF are approximately 92.8 (30.2) hours, 22.5 (5.85) hours and 19.2 (8.71) hours, respectively.

## Excretion

Following oral administration of 14 C-VNZ alone, the majority of radioactivity (91.6%) was eliminated in faeces, primarily as metabolites.

Following oral administration of 14 C-TEZ alone, the majority of the dose (72%) was excreted in the faeces (unchanged or as the M2-TEZ) and about 14% was recovered in urine (mostly as M2-TEZ), resulting in a mean overall recovery of 86% up to 26 days after the dose.

Preclinical data indicate that the majority of 14 C-D-IVA is excreted in the faeces. Major excreted metabolites of D-IVA were M1-D-IVA and M6-D-IVA. The excretion of D-IVA in humans is expected to be similar to that of IVA, based on similar structure (deuterated isotopologue) and nonclinical data.

After oral administration of 14 C-IVA alone, the majority of IVA (87.8%) was eliminated in faeces after metabolic conversion. There was minimal elimination of IVA and its metabolites in urine (only 6.6% of IVA was recovered in the urine).

## Hepatic impairment

D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). Following a single dose of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ, subjects with moderate hepatic impairment had an approximately 30% lower total VNZ exposures, comparable total TEZ exposures, and 20% lower total D-IVA exposures compared to healthy subjects matched for demographics.

## Renal impairment

Urinary excretion of VNZ, TEZ, and D-IVA is negligible (see Elimination).

VNZ alone or in combination with TEZ and D-IVA has not been studied in people with CF with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min) or in people with CF with end-stage renal disease. Based on population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, VNZ exposures appear similar in patients with mild (N = 126; eGFR 60 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and moderate renal impairment (N = 2; eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) relative to those with normal renal function (N = 580; eGFR 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or greater).

Based on population PK analysis, exposure of TEZ was similar in patients with mild renal impairment (N = 172; eGFR 60 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and moderate renal impairment (N = 8; eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) relative to those with normal renal function (N = 637; eGFR 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or greater).

Based on population PK analysis, exposure of D-IVA was similar in patients with mild (N = 132; eGFR 60 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and moderate renal impairment (N = 2; eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) relative to those with normal renal function (N = 577; eGFR 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or greater) (see section 4.2).

## Race

Race had no clinically meaningful effect on VNZ exposure based on population PK analysis in whites (N = 664) and non-whites (N = 44). The non-white races consisted of 9 Black or African Americans, 7 Asians, 7 with multiple racial background, 2 American Indian or Alaska Native, 2 with other ethnic background, and 17 not collected.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Very limited population PK data indicate comparable exposure of TEZ in whites (N = 652) and nonwhites (N = 8). The non-white races consisted of 5 Blacks or African Americans and 3 Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders.

Race had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of D-IVA in whites (N = 670) and non-whites (N = 41) based on a population PK analysis. The non-white races consisted of 18 Black or African Americans, 2 Asians, 3 with multiple racial background, 1 with other ethnic background, and 17 not collected.

## Gender

Based on population PK analysis, there are no clinically relevant differences in exposures of VNZ (433 males compared to 275 females), TEZ, and D-IVA between males and females.

## Elderly

Clinical studies of D-IVA/TEZ/VNZ included 2 people with CF aged 65 years and older. This number is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger people with CF (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).

## Paediatric people with CF 6 to less than 18 years of age

VNZ, TEZ, and D-IVA exposures observed in phase 3 studies as determined using population PK analysis are presented by age group in Table 8. VNZ, TEZ, and D-IVA exposures in the 6 to less than 18 years of age are within the range observed in adults with CF.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

## Vanzacaftor

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Fertility and Pregnancy

VNZ was not teratogenic in rats at 10 mg/kg/day and at 40 mg/kg/day in rabbits (approximately 30 and 22 times, respectively, the MRHD based on AUCs of VNZ).

VNZ had no effects on fertility and early embryonic development in rats at oral doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day in males and 10 mg/kg/day for females (approximately 19 times for males and 30 times for females the MRHD based on AUC of vanzacaftor). Placental transfer of VNZ was observed in pregnant rats.

## Tezacaftor

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and development. Placental transfer of TEZ was observed in pregnant rats.

Juvenile toxicity studies in rats exposed during postnatal day 7 to 35 (PND 7-35) showed mortality and moribundity, even at low doses. Findings were dose related and generally more severe when dosing with tezacaftor was initiated earlier in the postnatal period. Exposure in rats from PND 21-49 did not show toxicity at the highest dose which was approximately two times the intended human exposure. Tezacaftor and its metabolite, M1-TEZ, are substrates for P-glycoprotein. Lower brain levels of P-glycoprotein activity in younger rats resulted in higher brain levels of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ. These findings are likely not relevant for the indicated paediatric population of 6 years of age and older, for whom P-glycoprotein expression levels are equivalent to levels observed in adults.

## Fertility and Pregnancy

TEZ had no effects on fertility and early embryonic development in rats at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day in males and 100 mg/kg/day for females (approximately 3 times for males and 3 times for females the MRHD based on AUC of tezacaftor).

## Deutivacaftor

D-IVA is a deuterated isotopologue of IVA, with a bridge between their toxicity profiles established through a 13-week rat toxicity study. No additional toxicity studies were conducted for D-IVA, as toxicity data from IVA studies are considered sufficient to demonstrate the toxicity profile of D-IVA.

As for IVA, non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential.

## Fertility and pregnancy (IVA)

The NOAEL for fertility findings was 100 mg/kg/day (8 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of IVA and its metabolites) in male rats and 100 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of IVA and its metabolites) in female rats.

In the pre- and post-natal study IVA decreased survival and lactation indices and caused a reduction in pup body weights. The NOAEL for viability and growth in the offspring provides an exposure level of approximately 5 times the systemic exposure of IVA and its metabolites in adult humans at the MRHD. Placental transfer of IVA was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits.

## Juvenile animals

Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal day 7 through 35 with IVA dose levels of 10 mg/kg/day and higher (0.3 times the MRHD based on systemic exposure of IVA and its metabolites). This finding has not been observed in foetuses derived from rat dams treated with IVA on gestation days 7 to 17, in rat pups exposed to IVA to a certain extent through milk ingestion

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

up to postnatal day 20, in 7-week-old rats, or in 3.5- to 5-month-old dogs treated with IVA. The potential relevance of these findings in humans is unknown (see section 4.4).

## Deutivacaftor/tezacaftor/vanzacaftor

Combination repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats involving the co-administration of VNZ, TEZ and D-IVA to assess the potential for additive and/or synergistic toxicity did not produce any unexpected toxicities or interactions.

## 1. What Alyftrek is and what it is used for

Alyftrek is a tablet that contains three active substances: deutivacaftor, tezacaftor, and vanzacaftor.

Alyftrek is for people aged 6 years and over who have CF with at least one mutation in the CFTR ( cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ) gene that is responsive to Alyftrek. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited condition in which the lungs and the digestive system can become clogged with thick, sticky mucus. Alyftrek is intended as a long-term treatment.

Alyftrek works on a protein called CFTR. The protein is damaged in some people with CF, if they have a mutation in the CFTR gene. Vanzacaftor and tezacaftor increase the amount of CFTR protein at the cell surface, while deutivacaftor causes the protein to work better.

Alyftrek helps your breathing by improving your lung function. You may also notice that you do not get ill as often, or that it is easier to gain weight.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Alyftrek

## Do not take Alyftrek

- If you are allergic to deutivacaftor, tezacaftor, vanzacaftor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).

Talk to your doctor and do not take the tablets if this applies to you.

## Warnings and precautions

- Liver damage and worsening liver function in people with and without liver disease has been seen in some patients taking ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor, a medicine that has the same

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

or similar ingredients as Alyftrek. The worsening of liver function can be serious and may require transplantation.

- Talk to your doctor if you have liver problems , or have had them previously.

Your doctor will do some blood tests to check your liver before and during treatment with Alyftrek, especially if your blood tests showed high liver enzymes in the past. Increased liver enzymes in the blood are common in patients with CF, and those taking Alyftrek.

Tell your doctor right away if you have any signs of liver problems. These are listed in section 4.

- Depression and anxiety have been reported in patients while taking Alyftrek. Talk to your doctor straight away if you (or someone taking this medicine) experience any of the following symptoms which may be signs of depression or other psychiatric disorders : sad or altered mood, anxiety, feelings of emotional discomfort or thoughts of harming or killing yourself, sleep difficulties, and/or abnormal behaviour (see section 4).
- Talk to your doctor if you have kidney problems , or you have previously had them.
- If you have two Class I mutations (mutations known not to make CFTR protein), you should not take Alyftrek, as you are not expected to respond to this medicine.
- Talk to your doctor before starting treatment with Alyftrek if you have received an organ transplant .
- Talk to your doctor if you have taken another product with tezacaftor or ivacaftor before and temporarily or permanently stopped because of side effects . Your doctor may want to see you more often.
- Talk to your doctor if you are using hormonal contraception (birth control) - for example, women using the contraceptive pill. This may mean you are more likely to get a rash while taking Alyftrek. Talk to your doctor if you develop a rash while taking Alyftrek.
- Your doctor may do eye examinations before and during treatment with Alyftrek. Cloudiness of the eye lens (cataract) without any effect on vision has occurred in some children and adolescents receiving ivacaftor which is similar to deutivacaftor, one of the active substances in Alyftrek.
