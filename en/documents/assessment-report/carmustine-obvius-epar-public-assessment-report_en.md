## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Carmustine is a cell-cycle phase nonspecific antineoplastic agent belonging to the nitrosourea group of compounds (bischlo-roethyl nitrosourea), which exerts tumour cytotoxicity via multiple mechanisms. As an alkylating agent, it can alkylate reactive sites on nucleoproteins, thus interfering with DNA and RNA synthesis and DNA repair. It is able to form interstrand crosslinks in DNA, which prevents DNA replication and transcription. Carmustine undergoes spontaneous nonenzymatic decomposition under physiological conditions to release reactive intermediates with alkylating and carbamoylating activities, which are thought to be responsible for the antineoplastic and cytotoxic activities of carmustine.

The pharmaceutical form and mode of administration of the proposed product is the same as reference product - powder and solvent for solution for infusion. The active substance of Carmustine Obvius 100 mg, powder and solvent for solution for infusion is the same as for reference product - carmustine.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Carmustine is an alkylating agent used as an antineoplastic agent. It is considered that the antineoplastic and toxic activities of Carmustine Obvius may be due to metabolites.

Carmustine has been used for more than 40 years and has a well-defined place in different oncological treatment protocols, such as in BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) and transplantation of haemopoietic stem cells in patients with chemosensitive first relapse of Hodgkin's disease irrespective of length of initial remission (Schmitz et al 2002).

This is an abridged marketing authorisation application for CARMUSTINE 100 mg -Powder and solvent for concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion,  which  are  essentially  similar  to  the  reference  product  CarmubrisTrockenstechampull mit Lösungsmittel, 100 mg (Emcure Pharma UK, Ltd., UK) and is therefore filed under Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC (i.e. a generic application).

Carmustine has been on the European markets since 15 August 1998, but has been on discontinuation in the EU since February 2014 due to a number of reasons mostly related to complexities in the manufacturing of the active substance. The applicant Obvius claimed eligibility to the centralised procedure on the basis that the shortage and impact on patients would be addressed, thus fulfilling patients' needs.

The originator Carmubris is approved in the following indications:

Carmustine is effective in the following malignant neoplasms as a single agent or in combination with other antineoplastic agents and/or other therapeutic measures (radiotherapy, surgery):

- -Brain tumors - glioblastoma, Brain-stem gliomas, medulloblastoma, astrocytoma, ependymoblastomas and brain metastases
- -Second line treatment for NHL and Hodgkin's disease
- -Tumours of the gastrointestinal system
- -Malignant melanoma in combination with other effective ani-neoplastic medicinal  products
- -multiple myeloma (in combination with a glucocorticoid such as  prednisone),

The generic product Carmustine Obvius has applied for part of the originator's indications.

Carmustine Obvius is indicated is indicated in adults as part of established combination therapy with other approved chemotherapeutic agents, in the following:

- -Brain tumors - glioblastoma, Brain-stem gliomas, medulloblastoma, astrocytoma  and Ependymoblastomas
- -Second line treatment for NHL and Hodgkin's disease

The strength and pack size (100mg carmustine powder and 3ml solvent, 1 vial each) are consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of use.

Carmustine  Obvius  is  a  simple  formulation  containing  only  the  active  substance  carmustine.  Taking  into account the fact that it concerns a powder for solution for infusion (parenteral use) no extensive development studies were performed. According to the information obtained from EDQM, water is used in the final step of synthesis of active substance (in final recrystallization). As the active substance is further used for parenteral infusion, the applicant upon the CHMP request demonstrated compliance of the water used in the final steps of the synthesis with the corresponding requirements of CPMP/QWP/158/01 Revision 'Note for guidance on quality of water for pharmaceutical use'.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Excipients  used  as  processing  solvents  in  the  manufacture  of  carmustine  100  mg  powder  for  solution  for infusion  are  ethanol  and  water  for  injection,  which  are  evaporated  during  freeze-drying  step  and  are  not present in the finished product. The quality of excipients used during manufacturing process is confirmed to comply  with  Ph.Eur.  monographs  1318  (Ethanol,  anhydrous)  and  0169  (Water  for  injections)  and  are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry.

The  reference  product  Carmubris  (from  EU  market)  has  been  characterised  with  respect  to  a  chemicalpharmaceutical  properties;  i.e.  appearance,  pH,  density,  osmolality,  reconstitution  time,  assay,  impurities profile, water content and container closure characterization .

From a pharmaceutical point of view, Carmustine Obvius and the reference products have the same active substance,  the  same  pharmaceutical  form  and  the  same  route  of  administration.  Comparative  studies between the generic product and two batches of the reference product Carmubris have been performed and show essential similarity with respect to major physicochemical parameters (appearance, appearance of the reconstituted solution, pH value, density, assay, osmolality, reconstitution time, water content, impurity A, any unspecified impurity and total impurities). The impurity profiles between the test and reference products are  comparable;  the  only  minor  difference  being  the  presence  of  an  unknown  impurity  in  the  reference product.  Osmotic  values  were  compared  between  generic  product  and  reference  product  and  can  also  be considered as comparable. The reference product shows slightly higher water  content.

In  conclusion,  Carmustine  Obviuscan  be  considered  as  essentially  similar  to  the  reference  product  as  it contains the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active ingredient and is presented in the same pharmaceutical form.

The  pharmaceutical  development  studies  focused  mainly  on  development  of  a  stable  bulk  solution  with appropriate concentration of the active and compounding temperature to assure bulk solution stability and development and optimisation of the lyophilisation process resulting in a stable product with pharmaceutically acceptable  physico-chemical  properties.  The  development  of  the  manufacturing  process  (compounding, filtration, filling and freeze drying process) for the drug product Carmustine Obvius has been performed at Oncotec Pharma Produktion GmbH. Because carmustine is very slightly soluble in water and freely soluble in ethanol,  the  active  substance  is  dissolved  in  ethanol  and  water  is  added  subsequently  to  form  the  bulk solution.  The  active  substance  is  very  reactive  and  rapidly  degrades  through  formation  of  Impurity  A  and multiple  other  impurities  when  exposed  to  heat  (room  temperature),  oxidation,  acid/alkali  treatment  and light. The degradation is significantly increased when the active substance is in solution. The solubility of the active substance and the stability of bulk solution were tested at different concentrations and temperatures. The data showed a temperature effect on the stability of the bulk solution and that a low concentration (3 mg/ml) at a low temperature (12.5 ± 2.5°C) leads to a stable bulk solution of carmustine in a 12.5 vol% ethanol  solution  without  precipitation  and  crystal  formation.  Therefore  the  above  values  for  these  three parameters have been set for use in the routine manufacture. Results indicated that the temperature of the bulk solution was critical for the stability of the bulk solution, thus the temperature was set as critical process parameter to be monitored during the compounding process. Nitrogen is used during routine compounding, filling  and  freeze  drying  to  minimise  the  amount  of  oxidative  reactions  during  manufacture.  Its  quality complies with the Ph.Eur. monograph for Nitrogen. The active substance is also sensitive to light, therefore light protective conditions (equipment closed with aluminium lids and filling at the red light) are considered during  manufacturing  process.  Moreover,  the  time  from  addition  of  active  substance  to  freeze  drying  is important as the active substance degrades in solution. Development studies with bulk solution were

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

performed and a holding/processing time was defined. The time from addition of active substance to the end sterile filtration is defined to 4 hours to ensure enough time for filling and loading of the freeze dryer within a total of 8 hours from compounding.

The freeze drying program was tested with the pilot scale freeze dryer to confirm the designed freeze drying program.

Lyophilisation parameters were evaluated and optimised according to target of final water content, amount of impurities, assay and optimal lyophilisation cycle total length by changing filling volume, concentration of active substance in ethanol solution, drying temperatures and time and overfilling. The main focus in the lyophilisation cycle development was related to cake appearance, water content, assay and content of the related substances. Based on the critical temperatures and several trial runs, in which temperatures and times of the separate steps were varied, the lyophilisation cycle parameters were established as shown in Table 3:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The duration of the freeze drying cycle was increased during cycle optimization studies due to the reduction of the concentration of Carmustine in bulk solution and leads to a homogenous result of the finished product after the freeze drying.

It is proposed to use 5 % overfill of bulk solution in the vials prior to freeze drying during filling process thus ensuring acceptable content of carmustine in the final freeze dried product. According to the applicant, an overfilling of 5 % is required for the routine production to achieve an assay of 100 % due to small molecule weight, the fluffy cake structure and the high filling limit might have caused a sublimation effect/micro blow out (molecules can be pulled out of the vial by the sublimation force).

It has been demonstrated that dry heat sterilization and radiation sterilization lead to significant degradation of  the  finished  product  since  carmustine  is  a  thermolabile  substance,  therefore  sterilisation  by  aseptic processing and filtration, was considered the most appropriate method. The choice of sterilisation method is considered satisfactorily justified according to the 'Decision trees for the selection of sterilisation methods' (CPMP/QWP/054/98). Taking  also  into  account  the  known  sensitivity  of  the  active  substance  to  elevated temperature (melting range ~30 °C), the bulk solution processing temperature was set accordingly and the manufacturing  process  includes  use  of  nitrogen  to  avoid  oxidation.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the impact of the employed filter (PVDF) used for sterilization on assay and impurity profile has been provided including acceptable validation reports.

The  active  substance  is  known  to  be  light  sensitive.  Therefore  brown  glass  vials  are  used  as  primary packaging. Additional warning to keep drug product in outer packaging and protect from light also during clinical use are stated in the product information. The vials are stoppered with light grey 20 mm bromobutyl stoppers  and  sealed  with  a  dark  red  aluminium  flip-off  cap.  The  proposed  container  closure  system  is common for freeze dried powders and suitable for the current finished product. The size of vial (50 ml) was chosen  to  cover  the  filling  amount  and  reconstitution  amount.  As  the  finished  product  is  a  dry  powder, according to chapter 3.2.1 of the European Pharmacopoeia, it is justified to use a glass quality conforming to type I glass. The rubber stoppers are made of bromobutyl rubber, which are recommended by Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 to be used in manufacture of parenteral dosage forms.

## Solvent

The solvent is used for the reconstitution of lyophilised carmustine and consists of anhydrous ethanol; there are no other components (Table 4).

Table 4. Complete composition of solvent per vial (3.3 ml)

| Ingredient         | Reference    | Quantity   | Function   |
|--------------------|--------------|------------|------------|
| Ethanol, anhydrous | Ph.Eur. 1318 | 3.3 ml     | Solvent    |

Nitrogen is used in the manufacturing process, but is not present in the finished product. Anhydrous ethanol is a colourless to light yellow, clear liquid and complies with Ph.Eur. 1318 monograph requirements. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

nitrogen gas used in the manufacture of the ethanol solvent complies with Ph. Eur. monograph for Nitrogen. No formulation development has been performed.

The manufacturing process is a simple process of filling ethanol in vials. The most critical issue is the sterility of the diluent as it is intended for intravenous use. A manufacturer for the diluent who has prior experience with both sterile products as well as working with ethanol was selected in this regard. The diluent is sterilised by a combination of aseptic filtration and aseptic processing. The sterilisation method has been justified in according to the 'Decision trees for the selection of sterilisation methods' (CPMP/QWP/054/98) taking into account the physicochemical properties of the solvent (ethanol) e.g. boiling point.

A risk analysis investigation the different manufacturing steps of the production process for Ethanol in vials has been performed for all steps of the process. The possible risks connected to each step and the content of preventive controls have been summarised and presented. It has been concluded that the critical steps are: preparation of the bulk solution, sterile filtration, filling/crimping of the vials.

The overall strategy of the steps taken to ensure the sterility of the ethanol solvent was provided. The overview of the performed media fill runs was presented in the dossier.

It has been clarified that an overfill of 0.3 ml is applied and, therefore, 3.3 ml of solvent is filled in the ampoule in order to ensure that the health care professionals can withdraw at least 3.0 ml required for the powder reconstitution.

The  initial  container  closure  system  for  the  diluent  was  glass  Type  I  vials  sealed  with  stoppers  and  a combined flip off cap. During the final manufacturing runs of three commercial scale batches, high values of Residue on Evaporation and Absorbance were obtained. During development of the manufacturing process several issues arose as the filling line as well as the intended stopper resulted in OOS results on absorbance as  well  as  Residue  on  Evaporation.  Root  cause  analysis  and  re-development  work  has  been  described  in detail.  In  order  to  avoid  the  risk  of  introducing  impurities  from  the  stoppers,  it  was  decided  to  use  glass ampoules as the primary container for the ethanol solvent, as the absorbance and residue on evaporation is not  expected  to  be  affected  by  the  container  closure  system  when  using  glass  ampoules.  A  different manufacturer of the ethanol solvent was also introduced.

The proposed container closure system consists of a 5 mL, Form B, OPC Type I Clear glass ampoule. The glass ampoules are tested in accordance with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1.

## Manufacture of the product and process controls

## Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion

The main steps of the manufacturing process are the preparation of primary packaging materials, preparation of  the  solution,  pre-,  sterile  filtration,  filling  into  vials,  lyophilisation  and  closing  of  the  vials,  labelling  and packaging. A production flow chart, identifying the in-process controls, is presented in Figure 2.

No holding time on the bulk solution has been defined and therefore no intermediates have been defined. However, due to the rapid degradation of the active substance when in a solution maximum processing times during routine manufacturing process have been defined during development studies and confirmed by validation studies. The material of container at which these studies have been performed was stated. Nitrogen is used during routine compounding, filling and freeze drying steps to minimize the amount of oxidative reactions during manufacture.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Time and temperature is stated for primary packaging sterilisation cycles.

The primary container closure system (50 mL glass vial) is sterilised by dry heat in accordance with Ph. Eur. 5.1.1. The sterilisation process is performed according to a validated procedure and undergoes a regular revalidation using a worst-case concept. The validation package for the heat sterilization process was provided. The latest report on the routine revalidation of the process using the worst-case vial size of 100 mL is also included. The validation reports confirm the proposed sterilisation process efficacy.

The steam sterilisation of the rubber stoppers is performed at standard Ph.Eur. conditions of at least 121°C for at least 15 minutes, therefore no further information was requested.

Filter validation data (reports) has been provided with regards to bacterial retention capacity, solution compatibility and extractable/leachable.

Sterile filtration, filling of vials and lyophilisation are defined as critical steps. Filtration step is controlled by the bioburden limit prior to sterile filtration and filter integrity testing before and after filtration. Filling step is controlled by testing of fill weight. Continuous control of time, pressure and temperature is performed by computer monitoring throughout the lyophilisation process step. The control strategy of critical steps is satisfactory to ensure consistent manufacturing process and quality of finished product.

The  aseptic  manufacturing  process  by  sterile  filtration  in  combination  with  a  lyophilisation  process,  is considered a non-standard manufacturing process in accordance with Annex II of the Guideline on process validation  for  finished  products,  therefore  validation  has  been  performed  on  three  consecutive  commercial scale batches manufactured in accordance with the commercial process. Information regarding media fill runs at the proposed manufacturing site has also been included in the dossier. The results obtained during the validation of the manufacturing process in general confirm that all the parameters tested of all the batches are in line with the required specifications and could be considered as  validated.

## Solvent

Anhydrous ethanol is pre-filtered and sterile filtered, and aseptically filled in ampoules. The main steps of the manufacturing process are the preparation of primary packaging materials, preparation of bulk ethanol volume, sterile filtration, aseptic filling into vials, closing and inspection. A production flow chart, identifying the in-process controls, is presented in Figure 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Critical steps have been defined as preparation of bulk solution, sterile filtration, filling of ampoules, closing. The IPCs for each step were described and are adequate. The bioburden is controlled before sterile filtration with acceptable limit; filter integrity is controlled after filtration.

The holding time during routine manufacture from addition of ethanol to end of filtration is not more than 24 hours and has been justified by filter validation data as well as process validation data.

Both the sterile filtration and filling steps are performed in the presence of nitrogen. The reason for using nitrogen gas is to create positive pressure for solution transfer during filtration and filling. The presence of nitrogen  also  reduces  the  risk  of  oxidation  of  the  ethanol,  and  of  ignition  of  the  flammable  ethanol.  The nitrogen is removed during manufacture and is not present in the final product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  manufacturing  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard  process.  A  process  validation  of  the manufacturing  process  of  the  ethanol  solvent  has  been  performed  on  three  consecutive  commercial  scale validation  batches.  The  conclusion  is  that  the  process  is  validated  and  suitable  for  the  intended  use. Satisfactory  filter  validation  data  was  provided  with  respect  to  extractables  from  filter,  bacterial  retention capacity and solution compatibility. The overview of the performed media fill runs was also presented. The bracketing approach applied is acceptable.

The specification for the Solvent contains all the tests described in the Ph. Eur. monograph 1318 for ethanol anhydrous. Since the route of administration is i.v. the Ph. Eur. tests for visible and sub-visible particles as well  as  sterility  and  endotoxin  are  also  included  in  the  specification.  The  specification  limit  for  bacterial endotoxins is calculated in accordance with Ph.Eur. 5.1.10.

In addition, a Ph. Eur. Test for extractable volume ensures that the amount in each vial is acceptable. Filling volume is ensured through in-process controls by weighing thus ensuring the uniformity of content in the diluent vials.

All the analytical procedures tests are performed according to Ph. Eur. Only exception is the appearance which is a very simple test. Method validation reports for sterility test method and bacterial endotoxin test method have been provided. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for testing has been presented.

Batch results for three commercial scale batches demonstrated compliance with the proposed specifications.

## Stability of the product

## Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion

Stability data from three production scale batches stored in the proposed packaging both in upright and inverted position under long term conditions for up to 18 months (2°C -8°C) and under accelerated conditions 25°C / 60 % RH for 6 months according to the ICH guidelines was provided.

All tests in the specification were performed at the 18 month time point (including endotoxin and sterility), including the new tests in the updated specification. Both HPLC methods were demonstrated to be stability indicating. No trend is observed for up to 18 month storage at 2-8°C. All data are within the updated specification limits for all three batches for both upright and inverted positions of the vials. Results from the accelerated conditions show a time dependent degradation, where carmustine content is OOS after 6 months and the content of impurity A is OOS after 6 months. The water content increased however stayed within the specification limits. Additional data with the recently implemented method for testing unknown impurities were also provided and support the original data.

An elevated temperature stability study was performed on three commercial scale batches stored at elevated temperature at 25°C/60% RH for 24 hours and 7 days, followed by 6 month storage at long term conditions (2-8°C). Vials were stored both upright and inverted position. All data are within the specification. The generated data supports temperature excursions, i.e. such as those likely during transport of the product.

In addition, a stress stability study was conducted to demonstrate the stability indicating capability of the analytical methods. Samples were exposed to heat, light, acid, alkali and oxidative treatments. Based on these data it is concluded that the finished product in solution is much less stable as compared to in a lyophilisate. It is known that the active substance is light sensitive. The stress study confirmed as expected that the drug product when exposed to daylight, especially in solution, showed very significant degradation and heavy formation of unspecified impurities and should therefore be protected from light.

An in-use/compatibility stability study has been performed upon request of the CHMP during the procedure. The study was performed on two commercial scale batches mimicking the clinical use of the product. The purpose of the in-use/compatibility study was to support an in-use shelf-life. The stability commitments in this regard are also noted and are acceptable.

The previously proposed pre-cooling step (precooling of the 5% glucose and with 0.9% sodium chloride solutions to be used for reconstitution and dilution) has been excluded from description of handling procedures for healthcare professionals, as is not justified from clinical point of view.

The two commercial scale batches of Carmustine Obvius have been tested and compared with one batch of the reference product Carmubris. The study was conducted in glass containers with PVC free PE infusion sets, stored at inverted position at room temperature, protected from light and tested after 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours to demonstrate quality of Carmustine Obvius within proposed period of use (infusion 1-2 hours) and compatibility with proposed container and solvents solutions listed in the SmPC.

The parameters investigated were clarity and color of solution, pH, osmolality/density, assay of carmustine, impurity A, unknown impurities and total impurities, visual particles/sub-visual particles. The acceptance criteria for clarity, color of solution, pH, osmolality/density are the same as for release/shelf-life specification. The results for reconstituted/diluted carmustine solution were found within proposed limits

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and are acceptable. The acceptance criteria for impurity A, unknown impurities and total impurities are the same as for release/shelf-life specification and are considered qualified and justified in accordance with the Ph. Eur. monograph on Carmustine (1187) and guideline CPMP/ICH/2738/99 Impurities in new Drug Products.

Out of specification results for ready for use infusion solution were observed for assay. During storage assay decreases more than 5 % at testing time point 4 hour.

The comparison of the stability of the reconstituted/diluted Carmustine Obvius with the stability of the reference product it has been shown that the in-use assay content and degradation profile of the generic product and reference product Carmubris shows similar degradation tendencies with approximate 4-5 % decrease in assay from initial value at testing time point 3 h. At testing time point 4 h decrease in assay is more than 5 % i.e. 6-7%. It is known that active substance is susceptible for degradation in solution, however it should be noted that severe mass imbalances (e.g. assay decrease without increase of impurity level) were observed during in-use stability studies, and were not explained by the applicant. However considering the similar degradation profile between the test and reference product and the observed assay/impurity imbalance, the acceptance criteria for assay in the in-use specification (Table 7) 87.2 % 106 % and the administration of the infusion solution must be completed within 3 hours after preparation of solution (SmPC 6.3 and 6.6).

Out of specification results for ready for use infusion solution were also observed for particulate contamination. During storage tests results for visual and sub-visual particle doesn't fulfill Ph. Eur. requirements for parenteral preparations. However the CHMP noted that in accordance with Ph.Eur. all parenteral preparations have to be tested for visible/subvisible particles and in-use specification should include test for particles in accordance with guidelines CPMP/ICH/367/96 Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances , where it is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

stated that both chemical and physical parameters should be monitored. The CHMP also noted that the manufacturer should be able to control quality of the product during lifecycle, and therefore the test for visible/sub-visible particles should be included in the in-use specification. Analytical results demonstrating compliance with Ph.Eur requirements for parenterals regarding visible/sub-visible particles were provided.

Based on the provided stability data, a shelf life of 24 months for the powder vials has been demonstrated. The product must be stored and transported refrigerated (2°C - 8°C), and kept in the vial and ampoule in the outer carton, in order to protect from light. The in-use shelf-life claim of 3 hours at room temperature for the reconstituted and diluted with 5% glucose or 0.9% NaCl solution as stated in the SmPC (section 6.6) is also acceptable. The reconstituted and diluted solutions must be administered over 1-2 hours and administration must be finalised within 3 hours after reconstitution of the product (section 6.3).

## Solvent

Stability data was provided from three production scale batches and one at 50% the full scale batch size stored in the proposed packaging both in upright and inverted position under long term conditions (2°C-8°C and 25°C/60% RH) for up to 6 months and under accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH) for 6 months according to the ICH guidelines.

All tests in the specification were performed. All the results are within the updated specification limits for all three batches for both upright and inverted positions of the vials.

In addition 18 months supportive stability data performed on 3 batches of Dehydrated Alcohol Injection, USP in  glass  vials  with  a  coated  rubber  stopper,  at  25°C/60%  RH  have  been  presented. Samples in this study were tested according to USP specification which is very much similar to Ph. Eur. The results from this study comply with the acceptance criteria for up to 18 months and demonstrate that ethanol is stable for at least 18 months when stored in glass vials with coated rubber stoppers.

Extrapolation  of  the  pivotal  stability  data  is  applied  and  12  months  shelf-life  is  proposed.  Considering  the nature of the solvent (ethanol anhydrous) and primary packaging (glass ampoule), the proposed extrapolation  of  the  shelf  life  to  12  months  is  accepted.  According  to  the  stability  data  (25°C  long-term condition  and  40°C  accelerated  condition),  no  special  storage  conditions  are  necessary.  Additionally,  the stability of ethanol ampoules in 2-8°C is shown as the ethanol solvent ampoules will be packed together with the carmustine powder which is to be stored at 2-8°C.

## Powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion

Due to fact that ethanol solvent ampoules will be packed together with the carmustine powder, the accepted shelf-life for powder for concentrate for solution for infusion and solvent package is limited to the accepted shelf life of the solvent which is shorter than the powder.

In  conclusion,  the  proposed  shelf  life  of  12  months  and  the  storage  conditions  for  the  finished  product (powder vial and solvent ampoule) as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. The product must  be  stored  and  transported  refrigerated  (2°C  -  8°C),  and  kept  in  the  vial  and  ampoule  in  the  outer carton, in order to protect from light.

## Adventitious agents

No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  Issues  related  to  the  stability  of  the,  prone  to  degradation,  active substance,  the  finished  product,  and  the  reconstituted  and  diluted  product  ready  for  administration  have been satisfactorily addressed and appropriate instructions are included in the SmPC regarding reconstitution, dilution, handling and administration. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the  conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory  way.

## 2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development

None.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.

Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.

## 2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The Applicant following a request from the CHMP has submitted phase I (pre-screening) evaluation. Using the equation of Du Bois* (Du Bois &amp; Du Bois, 1916) the body surface area in a human weighing 70kg with a height  of  185cm  can  be  calculated  to  1.85m 2 .  According  to  the  proposed  SmPC  the  maximum  dose  of Carmustine Obvius 100mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion is 200mg/m 2  which thereby equal a maximum dose per inhabitant of 370mg. PECsurface water can then be calculated as -

PECsurface water = 370 x 0.01/200 x 10 = 0.00185mg/liter equals 1.85μg/liter. The Applicant stated that the emission of active substance is larger than the action limit of &lt; 1μg/liter.

Refinement of the PECsurface water was made. The calculation was based on the fact that the medicine is used once  every  6  weeks  so  the  value  was  divided  with  42.  PECsurface water  value  resulted  0.044µg/liter.  The logKOW  value  is  1.53.  A  revised  ERA  was  submitted  in  which  a  refinement  of  Fpen  according  to  the 'Guideline on the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use'  has  been  performed.  Fpen  was calculated  based  on  published  prevalence  data  for  the  sought  indications.  The  calculated  value  for PECsurface water using the refined Fpen values for all individual indications fell below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L, as did the summed PECsurface water of all indications combined. This value was calculated as 0.0057 μg/L.

Based on this calculation, and since no other environmental concerns for the active substance carmustine became apparent (especially since the octanol-water partition coefficient of 1.53 was well below the action limit of 4.5), it is concluded that Carmustine Obvius is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment and that ERA studies should be waived.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

Carmustine is a cell-cycle phase nonspecific antineoplastic agent of nitrosourea type, which exerts tumour cytotoxicity via multiple mechanisms. As an alkylating agent, it can alkylate reactive sites on nucleoproteins, thus interfering with DNA and RNA synthesis and DNA repair. It is able to form interstrand crosslinks  in  DNA,  which  prevents  DNA  replication  and  transcription.  Carmustine  undergoes  spontaneous nonenzymatic decomposition under physiological conditions to release reactive intermediates with alkylating and carbamoylating activities, which are thought to be responsible for the antineoplastic and toxic activities of carmustine.

The  non-clinical  overview  provides  detailed  information  on in  vitro and in  vivo activity,  efficacy  and pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  in  animal  models  and  human  tumour  cell  cultures  from  the published literature. The safety pharmacology of carmustine has not been demonstrated due to the lack of published data.

Formal non-clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  not  been  conducted  and  it  is  considered  acceptable  for generic application. The non-clinical overview provides comprehensive overview of published information on pharmacokinetics of carmustine, including parameters in different animal species.

The  biological  half-life  of  carmustine  is  short.  Intravenously  administered  BCNU  is  rapidly  degraded  to reactive  intermediates  with  a  half-life  of  approximately  15  min  in  humans.  In  studies  on  dogs,  using radiolabeled BCNU, approximately 28-30% of the total radioactivity administered was excreted in the urine in 6 h. Pharmacokinetic study in the dog demonstrates a rapid decline of carmustine in the plasma following intravenous injection.

Systemically administered carmustine is distributed to most tissues, including the brain. Carmustine crosses the blood-brain barrier readily, which has been observed in both dogs and monkeys. Carmustine is unstable in aqueous solution and undergoes spontaneous decomposition to release reactive intermediates.

Carmustine is inactivated through enzymatic biotransformation. Excretion is primarily in the urine: most rapid in mice and less rapid in dogs and monkeys.

The range of non-clinical data presented in the dossier is typical for a generic application. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product.

The CHMP considers that no further non-clinical studies are required.

Following the submission of a revised ERA it is concluded that Carmustine Obvius is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment and that ERA studies should be waived.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3.4. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Carmustine Obvius and justifications that the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non-clinical studies were not considered necessary.

Carmustine Obvius 100mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

This is an application for Carmustine Obvius containing 100 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion containing carmustine, the same active substance in the same quantity and in the same dosage form as the reference product.

It is intended for intravenous administration. According to the current Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev.1/Corr**), bioequivalence studies are generally not required if the test product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently approved product.

There are no excipient interactions which might affect the pharmacokinetics of the active substance.

The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as efficacy and safety of carmustine based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the reference product.

No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.

## Exemption

Bioequivalence testing with the reference product is not required under the provisions of the 'Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence' (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev.1) which states that 'Bioequivalence studies are generally not required if the test product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently approved product'.

The pharmaceutical form and mode of administration as well as the qualitative and quantitative composition of Carmustine Obvius 100 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion is the same as of the reference product Carmubris 100 mg, powder and solvent for solution for infusion (Carmubris-Trockenstechampulle mit Lösungsmittel, 100 mg (Emcure Pharma UK, Ltd., UK)).

The use of carmustine is well established. The Applicant has provided a justification for not submitting new clinical data.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.2. Post marketing experience

No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country.

## 2.4.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Carmustine is a well-known active substance. As the product is administered as an aqueous i.v. solution the Applicant is not required to submit a bioequivalence study or to provide the results of clinical trials.

Clinical  overview  on  the  clinical  pharmacology  is  adequate.  The  PK  of  carmustine  is  well  known  and satisfactory described by the Applicant. Overview based on literature review is appropriate and acceptable. Section 5.2 of SmPC is acceptable and in line with the originator's.

According to the ESMO guidelines current standard of care for patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme up to age 70 or fit elderly patients older than 70 years is a concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide in addition to radiotherapy. The Applicant has updated Clinical overview and included 8 publications covering period 20042015 regarding efficacy of carmustine in brain tumours.

The Applicant updated the Clinical overview with 4 publications covering period 2007-2014 regarding efficacy of carmustine in Hodgkin's disease. Referred publication by William et al (Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk 13 (4), 417-423. 2013 Jun 15) regarding impact of conditioning regimen on outcome of 2-year Disease-Free Survivors of autologous stem cell transplantation for Hodgkin lymphoma was submitted to discuss the use of the product in this context. The Applicant also updated Clinical overview and included 10 publications covering period 2001-2015 regarding efficacy of carmustine in Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

The indications with reference to Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are very broad considering the current  clinical  use  of  the  product,  i.e.  as  part  of  a  conditioning  regimen  for  haematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation (high dose chemotherapy/mini-BEAM) which is a standard treatment option for relapsed/refractory disease.

Pulmonary toxicity has been observed in up to 30% of patients. In cases where pulmonary toxicity started early (within 3 years of treatment), pulmonary infiltrates and/or pulmonary fibrosis occurred, some of which were fatal. The patients were between 22 months and 72 years old. Risk factors include smoking, respiratory disease, existing radiographic abnormalities, sequential or concomitant thoracic radiation, as well as combination with other active substances that can cause lung damage. The incidence of adverse reactions is probably dose-related; cumulative doses of 1200-1500 mg/m2have been associated with an increased likelihood of pulmonary fibrosis. During treatment, lung function tests (FVC, DLCO) should be performed regularly. Patients showing a baseline value of &lt;70% of expected forced vital capacity or carbon monoxide diffusion capacity in these tests are at particular risk.

Based on the conclusions of the results from the published pilot study of a French Society of Pediatric Oncology (SFOP) (Chastanger et al. 2007) in view of the high risk of pulmonary toxicity Carmustine Obvius should not be used in children and adolescents due to the high risk of pulmonary toxicity (See SmPC section 4.4, 4.8. and 4.3).

In patients having received carmustine in childhood or adolescence, cases of extremely delayed-onset pulmonary fibrosis (up to 17 years after treatment) have been described. Long-term follow-up observation of 17 patients who survived brain tumours in childhood showed that 8 of them succumbed to pulmonary fibrosis. Two of these 8 fatalities occurred within the first 3 years of treatment and 6 of them occurred 8-13 years after treatment. The median age of patients who died on treatment was 2.5 years (1-12 years), the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

median age of long-term survivors on treatment was 10 years (5-16 years). All patients younger than 5 years of age at the time of treatment died from pulmonary fibrosis; neither the carmustine dose nor an additional vincristine dose or spinal radiation had any influence on the fatal outcome. All remaining survivors available for follow-up were diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary toxicity also manifested in the post-marketing phase as pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease.

The  European  Medicines  Agency  has  completed  a  review  of  carmustine  containing  medical  products pursuant to Article  107b of  Directive  2001/83/EC  (PSUSA/00010349/201504). The Agency's Coordination Group of Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures for Human use (CHDh) on December 16, 2015 has  adopted  a  position  on  the  PSUR  for  carmustine  (powder  and  solvent  for  solution  for  infusion)  EMA/CMDh/819842/2015 - requesting update of product information to update Section 4.8 of the SmPC and Section 4 of the PL with information on pulmonary toxicity. There have been also publications regarding follow-up  data  for  the  patients  up  to  25  years  from  the  date  of  carmustine  treatment  from  a  long-term follow-up study. (O'Driscoll et al. Chest, Volume107, Issue 5, May 1995, Pages 1355-1357 and Lohani et al. Chest. 2004;126(3):1007.)

Further, it is recommended that -although not generally requested for generics- periodic safety updates for Carmustine Obvius will be submitted as per the frequencies in the EURD list.

## 2.4.4. Conclusions on clinical aspects

A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Carmustine Obvius and as the active substance does not differ in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference product was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional clinical studies were not considered necessary.

## Conclusion

The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.4 is acceptable.

## 2.6. Pharmacovigilance

## Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

## Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

## 2.7. Product information

## 2.7.1. User consultation

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Carmustine BiCNU (Carmubris). The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable.

## 3. Benefit-risk balance

This application concerns a generic version of carmustine [100 mg, powder and solvent for solution for infusion]. The reference product Carmubris (carmustine) is indicated for Brain tumors - glioblastoma, Brain-stem gliomas, medulloblastoma, astrocytoma and Ependymoblastomas; Second line treatment for NHL and Hodgkin's disease; Tumours of the gastrointestinal system; Malignant melanoma in combination with other effective anti-neoplastic medicinal products; Multiple myeloma (in combination with a glucocorticoid such as prednisone).

No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the provided clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 4. Recommendation

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Carmustine Obvius is not similar to Iclusig, Xaluprine , Imbruvica, Revlimid, Torisel , Ledaga, Venclyxto, Adcetris , Gazyvaro, Arzerra, Blincyto and Besponsa within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200 (see Appendix 1).

## Outcome

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Carmustine Obvius is favourable in the following indications:

Carmustine is effective in the following malignant neoplasms as a single agent or in combination with other antineoplastic agents and/or other therapeutic measures (radiotherapy, surgery):

- Brain tumours (glioblastoma, brain-stem gliomas, medulloblastoma, astrocytoma and ependymoma), brain metastases.
- Secondary therapy in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease.

The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, section 4.2).

- -Please note this constitutes a deviation from the MA of the originator product (medical  prescription).

## Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

## Periodic Safety Update Reports

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

## Risk Management Plan (RMP)

The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP.

An updated RMP should be submitted:

- At the request of the European Medicines Agency;
- Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result ofan important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.
