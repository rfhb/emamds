<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Co-administration of other medicinal products

Co-administration of repaglinide and tecovirimat may cause mild to moderate hypoglycaemia, (see section 4.5).  Blood glucose and hypoglycaemic symptoms should be monitored when administering tecovirimat with repaglinide.

Co-administration of midazolam and tecovirimat may reduce the effectiveness of midazolam (see section 4.5).  Effectiveness of midazolam should be monitored when administering tecovirimat with midazolam.

## Renal impairment

Tecovirimat should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment as there is limited clinical data in this population and higher unbound drug and metabolites levels may be observed. (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Tecovirimat should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment as there is limited clinical data in this population and higher unbound drug and metabolite levels may be observed (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Immunocompromised population

The safety and efficacy of tecovirimat has not been evaluated in immunocompromised individuals. Nonclinical studies using animal models indicate that tecovirimat may have reduced efficacy in immunocompromised individuals.  (See section 5.1).

## Excipients

This medicine contains lactose.  Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.

This medicine contains sunset yellow (E110).  May cause allergic reactions.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Effect of other medicinal products on tecovirimat

Tecovirimat is a substrate of UGT1A1, 1A3 and 1A4.  Co-administration of tecovirimat with strong inhibitors or inducers of these UGTs is not expected to have a clinically important effect on tecovirimat exposures.

Tecovirimat was studied in people against phosphate binders with the results indicating a slight increase in exposure of tecovirimat.  See Table 2 for results.

a These interactions have been studied in healthy adults.

## Effect of tecovirimat on other medicinal products

Tecovirimat and its M4 metabolite are inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A and CYP2B6. Co-administration with tecovirimat may lead to reduced plasma exposures of sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 or CYP2B6, potentially leading to reduced effects.  Monitoring is advised during co-administration of tecovirimat with CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 substrates that have narrow therapeutic windows.  See Table 3 for some examples.

Tecovirimat is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C19. Co-administration with tecovirimat may lead to increased plasma exposures of sensitive substrates of CYP2C8 or CYP2C19, potentially leading to increased adverse effects.  Monitoring is advised during co-administration of tecovirimat with CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 substrates that have narrow therapeutic windows. See Table 3 for some examples.

a These interactions have been studied in healthy adults to evaluate the effect of repeated doses of tecovirimat 600 mg twice daily on the single-dose PK of probe substrates.

## Vaccine

No vaccine-drug interaction studies have been performed in human subjects.  Some animal studies have indicated that co-administration of tecovirimat at the same time as live smallpox vaccine (vaccinia virus) may reduce the immune response to the vaccine.

## Paediatric population

Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

## 4.6 Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation

## Pregnancy

There are no data from the use of tecovirimat in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Tecovirimat is not recommended during pregnancy.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether tecovirimat/metabolites are excreted in human milk.

Available toxicological/safety data in animals have shown excretion of tecovirimat in milk (see section 5.3).

A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.

Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with tecovirimat.

## Fertility

The effects of tecovirimat on fertility in humans have not been studied.

Tecovirimat caused decreased fertility due to testicular toxicity in male mice (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to Drive and use Machines

Tecovirimat has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  Patients should be informed about the possible occurrence of dizziness and should be cautoned about driving or operating machines until they know how tecovirimat will affect them.

## 4.8 Undesirable Effects

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions were headache (12.3%) and nausea (4.5%).

## Tabulated summary of adverse reactions

Adverse reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency.  Frequency categories are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to &lt;1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to &lt;1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000), very rare (&lt;1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

## Paediatric population

Tecovirimat has not been studied in the paediatric population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product.  Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

In case of overdose, patients should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions. Haemodialysis will not significantly remove tecovirimat in overdosed patients.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group:  Antiviral for systemic use, other antivirals, ATC code: J05AX24.

## Mechanism of action

Tecovirimat inhibits the activity of the orthopoxvirus VP37 protein, which is encoded by a highly conserved gene in all members of the orthopoxvirus genus.  Tecovirimat blocks the interaction of VP37 with cellular Rab9 GTPase and TIP47, which prevents the formation of egress competent enveloped virions necessary for cell-to-cell and long-range dissemination of virus.

## Activity in cell culture

In cell culture assays, the effective concentrations of tecovirimat resulting in a 50% reduction in virus induced cytopathic effect (EC50), were 0.016-0.067 μM, 0.014 -0.039 µM, 0.015 µM and 0.009 µM, for smallpox, mpox, rabbitpox and vaccinia viruses, respectively.

## Resistance

There are no known instances of naturally occurring tecovirimat-resistant orthopoxviruses, although tecovirimat resistance may develop under drug selection.  Tecovirimat has a relatively low resistance barrier, and certain amino acid substitutions in the target VP37 protein can confer large reductions in tecovirimat antiviral activity.  The possibility of resistance to tecovirimat should be considered in patients either who fail to respond to therapy or who develop recrudescence of disease after an initial period of responsiveness.

## Nonclinical efficacy

Efficacy studies were conducted in cynomolgus macaques infected with mpox virus and New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits infected with rabbitpox virus.  The primary efficacy endpoint for these studies was survival.  In non-human primate studies, cynomolgus macaques were lethally challenged intravenously with 5 x 10 7 plaque-forming units of mpox virus.  Tecovirimat was administered orally once daily at a dose level of 10 mg/kg for 14 days, starting at Day 4, 5 or 6 post-challenge.  In rabbit studies, NZW rabbits were lethally challenged intradermally with 1,000 plaque-forming units of rabbitpox virus.  Tecovirimat was administered orally once daily for 14 days at a dose level of 40 mg/kg, starting at Day 4 post-challenge.  The timing of tecovirimat dosing in these studies was intended to assess efficacy when treatment is initiated after animals have developed clinical signs of disease, specifically dermal pox lesions in cynomolgus macaques and fever in rabbits.  Clinical signs of disease were evident in some animals at Day 2-3 post-challenge but were evident in all animals by Day 4 post-challenge.  Survival was monitored for 3-6 times the mean time to death for untreated animals in each model.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment with tecovirimat for 14 days resulted in statistically significant improvement in survival relative to placebo, except when given to cynomolgus macaques starting at Day 6 post-challenge (Table 5).

## Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship

The non-human primate (NHP) and rabbit PK/PD models were developed in order to establish the exposure-response relationship between tecovirimat treatment and survival.  The dose and regimen for humans were subsequently selected to provide exposures that exceed those associated with the fully effective dose in animals.  Analysis of PK/PD models indicates that Cmin and AUC are the most predictive PK parameters for drug efficacy.

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with tecovirimat in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of orthopoxvirus disease (smallpox, mpox, cowpox and vaccinia) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

This medicinal product has been authorised under 'exceptional circumstances'.  This means that for ethical reasons it has not been possible to obtain complete information on this medicinal product. The European Medicines Agency will review any new information which may become available every year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties

## Absorption

Tecovirimat reaches maximum plasma concentrations 4 to 6 hours after oral administration with food.

The administration of tecovirimat with a meal of moderate fat and calories (~ 600 calories and ~ 25 grams of fat), as compared to tecovirimat taken in the fasted (unfed) state, increased the drug exposure (AUC) by 39%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Distribution

Tecovirimat is 77.3-82.2% bound to human plasma proteins.  After a single 600 mg dose of [ 14 C]-tecovirimat in healthy subjects, concentrations of total radioactivity were lower in whole blood compared to plasma at all time points, with ratios of whole blood to plasma ranging from 0.620.90 across all time points.  Tecovirimat has a high volume of distribution (1356 L).

## Biotransformation

Based on human studies, tecovirimat is metabolized to form metabolites M4 (N-{3,5-dioxo-4azatetracyclo[5.3.2.0{2,6}.0{8,10}]dodec-11-en-4-yl}amine), M5 (3,5-dioxo-4aminotetracyclo[5.3.2.0{2,6}.0{8,10}]dodec-11-ene), and TFMBA (4 (trifluoromethyl) benzoic acid). None of the metabolites is pharmacologically active.

Tecovirimat is a substrate of UGT1A1 and UGT1A4.  In urine, primary tecovirimat glucuronide conjugate and M4 glucuronide conjugate were the most abundant components accounting for means of 24.4% and 30.3% of dose, respectively.  However, none of the glucuronide conjugates was found as a major metabolite in plasma.

## Elimination

After a single dose of [ 14 C]tecovirimat in healthy subjects, approximately 95% of the [ 14 C]-radioactivity was recovered in urine and faeces over the 192 -hour post-dose period, with approximately 73% of the [ 14 C]-radioactivity administered being recovered in urine and 23% being recovered in faeces, indicating that the renal pathway is the major route of excretion.  The renal excretion of parent compound was minimal, accounting for less than 0.02%.  The majority of drug excreted by the renal system is in a glucuronidated form.  In faeces, the excretion was mainly of unchanged tecovirimat. The terminal halflife of tecovirimat was 19.3 hr.

## Linearity/non-linearity

Tecovirimat exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over a dose range of 100-600 mg.

## Special populations

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of tecovirimat were observed in healthy subjects based on age, gender or race.

## Renal impairment

In subjects with renal impairment (based on estimated GFR), no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of tecovirimat were observed.

## Hepatic impairment

In subjects with with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (based on Child Pugh Scores A, B or C), no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of tecovirimat were observed. However, it is possible that patients with severe hepatic impairment may have higher unbound drug and metabolite levels (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).

## Paediatric patients

The pharmacokinetics of tecovirimat has not been evaluated in paediatric patients.  The recommended paediatric dosing regimen for subjects at least 13 kg body weight is expected to produce tecovirimat exposures that are comparable to those in adult subjects aged 18 to 50 years based on a population pharmacokinetic modeling and a simulation approach.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.

The non-clinical safety was evaluated in 28-day and 3-month studies in mice and monkeys, respectively.  Cmax exposures at the no observed adverse effect level in the toxicology studies compared to the human Cmax at the recommended human dose (RHD) have safety margins of 23 based on the mouse and 2.5 based on the monkey.  The dog is a more sensitive species to tecovirimat and was tested after a single dose or repeated doses.  Six hours after a single dose of 300 mg/kg, one dog experienced convulsions (tonic and clonic) with electroencephalography (EEG) consistent with seizure activity.  This dose produce a Cmax in the dog that was approximately 4 times higher than the highest human Cmax at the RHD.  In the dog, the no observe adverse effect level was determined to be 30 mg/kg with a Cmax safety margin at the RHD of 1.

Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with tecovirimat.

Tecovirimat was not genotoxic in in vitro or in vivo assays.

In a fertility and early embryonic development study in mice, no effects of tecovirimat on female fertility were observed at tecovirimat exposures (AUC) approximately 24 times higher than human exposure at the RHD.  In a fertility and early embryonic development study in mice, no biologically meaningful effects of tecovirimat on male or female fertility were observed at tecovirimat exposures (AUC) approximately 24 times higher than human exposure at the RHD.

Reproductive toxicity studies have been performed in mice and rabbits.  Based on pilot studies, the highest dose selected for the definitive study in rabbit was 100 mg/kg and in mice was 1,000 mg/kg. No embryo-foetal toxicities were observed in rabbit at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (0.4 times the human exposure at the RHD) and no embryo-foetal toxicities were observed at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day in mice (approximately 23 times higher than human exposure at the RHD).

No embryo-foetal toxicities were observed at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits (0.4 times the human exposure at the RHD).  Maternal toxicity was detected in rabbits at 100 mg/kg/day, which included decreases in body weight and mortality.

Available toxicological/safety data in animals have shown excretion of tecovirimat in milk. In a lactation study at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day, mean tecovirimat milk to plasma ratios up to approximately 0.8 were observed at 6 and 24 hours post-dose when administered orally to mice on lactation Day 10 or 11.

Wash and dry your hands before and after preparation.  Carefully open the capsule so that the contents do not spill or escape into the air.  Hold the capsule with the cap facing up and pull the cap away from the body of the capsule.  Use a small container for mixing.  Mix the entire contents of the capsule with 30 mL of liquid (e.g. milk) or soft food (e.g. yogurt).  The mixture should be taken within 30 minutes after mixing and within 30 minutes of eating a meal.
