## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Macular oedema is a nonspecific response of the retina to a variety of insults, and is associated with a number  of  diseases,  including  uveitis,  retinal  vascular  abnormalities,  sequela  of  cataract  surgery, macular  epiretinal  membranes,  and  inherited  or  acquired  retinal  degeneration.  Macular  oedema involves  the  breakdown  of  the  inner  blood-retinal  barrier  at  the  level  of  the  capillary  endothelium, resulting in abnormal retinal vascular permeability and leakage into the adjacent retinal tissues. The macula  becomes  thickened  due  to  fluid  accumulation  resulting  in  significant  disturbances  in  visual acuity. Prolonged oedema can cause irreversible damage resulting in permanent visual loss.

Depending on the location of the venous blockage, retinal vein occlusion is classified as branch retinal vein  occlusion  (BRVO)  or  central  retinal  vein  occlusion  (CRVO).  Retinal  vein  occlusive  disease  is thought to occur as a consequence of thrombus formation at the lamina cribrosa or by compression of the  venous  wall  by  an  overlying  arteriole.  Although  the  prevalence  of  retinal  vein  occlusion  is  only between  0.7  and  1.6 %,  it  is  the  second  most  common  sight-threatening  vascular  disorder  after diabetic retinopathy.

Therapeutic choices for macular oedema depend on the cause and severity of the condition. Currently there  are  no  approved  pharmacologic  therapies  for  macular  oedema.  Argon  laser  photocoagulation increased the likelihood of vision improvement in patients with macular oedema due to BRVO, but not in patients with macular oedema due to CRVO.

Focal/grid  laser  photocoagulation  has  been  shown  to  be  efficacious  in  the  prevention  of  moderate visual loss for macular oedema due to diabetic retinopathy. For central retinal vein occlusion, there are no known effective therapies.

Greater understanding of the pathophysiology of macular oedema has provided a scientific rationale for the use of steroids as a potential treatment. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a cytokine which  is  expressed  at  increased  concentrations  in  the  setting  of  macular  oedema.  It  is  a  potent promoter of vascular permeability.

Corticosteroids have been shown to inhibit the expression of VEGF. Additionally, corticosteroids prevent the  release  of  prostaglandins,  some  of  which  have  been  identified  as  mediators  of  cystoid  macular oedema. There is a growing body of clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of intraocular steroids for the treatment of macular oedema.

Dexamethasone,  a  potent  corticosteroid,  has  been  shown  to  suppress  inflammation  by  inhibiting oedema, fibrin deposition, capillary leakage, and phagocytic migration of the inflammatory response. The  use  of  dexamethasone  has  had  limited  success  in  treating  retinal  disorders  including  macular oedema, largely due to the inability  to  deliver  and  maintain  adequate  quantities  of  the  drug  to  the posterior segment. After topical administration of dexamethasone, only about 1% reaches the anterior segment, and only a fraction of that amount moves into the posterior segment. Although intravitreal injections of dexamethasone have been used, the exposure of the drug is very brief as the half-life of the drug within the eye is approximately 3 hours. Periocular and posterior sub-Tenon's injections of dexamethasone also have a short-term treatment effect.

Ozurdex is a sterile, single-use system intended to deliver one biodegradable implant into the vitreous for the treatment of macular oedema. The rationale of the design is to overcome ocular drug delivery barriers  and  prolong  the  duration  of  dexamethasone  effect  in  the  eye.  This  biodegradable  implant delivers a 700 micrograms total dose of dexamethasone to the vitreous with gradual release over time allowing  for  sustained  levels  of  dexamethasone  in  the  target  areas.  Ozurdex  may  offer  a  new

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

therapeutic  option  in  the  treatment  of  macular  oedema  while  reducing  the  potential  for  side  effects typically observed from steroid administration through other routes of delivery (e.g. systemic).

The claimed indication reads as follows: Ozurdex is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with macular  oedema  following  either  Branch  Retinal  Vein  Occlusion  (BRVO)  or  Central  Retinal  Vein Occlusion (CRVO).

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## Introduction

Ozurdex is presented as a prolonged release intravitreal implant in applicator containing 700 micrograms  of  dexamethasone  as  the  active  substance.  It  is  a  medicinal  product-device combination product for implantation into the vitreal chamber of the eye.

The  implant  is  formed  into  rods  (diameter  0.46 mm  x  6 mm  long).  Matrix  of  the  implant  is biodegradable, slowly degrading to lactic acid and glycolic acid through simple hydrolysis, then further degrades  into  carbon  dioxide  and  water.  It  consists  of  two  different  poly  (D,  L  lactide-co-glycolide) polymers (PLGAs). The only difference between the polymers is that one is terminated with an ester group (50:50 PLGA ester) and the other is terminated with an acid end group (50:50 PLGA acid).

The implant is contained within its own specific applicator, located in the needle (stainless steel) of the disposable  device.  The  applicator  consists  of  a  plunger  (stainless  steel)  within  a  needle  where  the implant is held in place by a sleeve (silicone). The plunger is controlled by a lever on the side of the applicator  body.  The  needle  is  protected  by  a  cap  and  the  lever  by  a  safety  tab.  The  applicator containing the implant is packaged in a sealed foil pouch containing desiccant.

Administration is by needle injection. At the time of use, the patient is typically under a topical or local anaesthetic. The implant is delivered in a controlled manner by depressing the actuator button with the index  finger.  The  needle  is  subsequently  withdrawn  as  the  puncture  site  self  seals.  To  prevent applicator reuse the actuation lever latches after the dispensing stroke has been completed and the implant has been deployed.

To ensure that air is not introduced into the eye, the applicator has been designed to vent air through a small gap between the implant and the inner needle wall. This allows air to move back through and out  of  the  needle  as  the  implant  is  being  delivered.  The  small  size  of  this  gap  prevents  fluid  from flowing out of the eye through the needle.

The needle is a 22-gauge thin-wall hypodermic needle and is externally lubricated with silicone oil. A silicone rubber sleeve is placed over the needle from the hub to a cut-out in the needle. The sleeve is designed with a small ring at the distal end that fits into a cut-out in the needle to hold the implant in place. The sleeve remains outside the eye and contacts the conjunctiva during insertion.

## Active substance

Dexamethasone is chemically designated as pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione-9-fluoro-11,17,21trihydroxy-16-methyl-,(11 β ,16 α ) or 9 α -Fluoro-11 β ,17,21-trihydroxy-16 β -methylpregna-1,4-diene3,20-dione (IUPAC) or (11 β ,  16 α )-9-Fluoro-11,17,21-trihydroxy-16-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20dione (CAS) and has the following structure:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

It  is  white  or  almost  white,  crystalline  powder,  practically  insoluble  in  water,  sparingly  soluble  in anhydrous ethanol, slightly soluble in methylene chloride. Dexamethasone has 8 chiral centers and is optically active, specific rotation values are +75° and +80° (dried substance).

Two polymorphs (form A and form B) and a chloroform solvate are described in the literature. Although form A and form B have equivalent solubility in water, the proposed manufacturing process leads to a single polymorphic form. Chloroform is not used in the manufacturing process utilised by the proposed manufacturer.

## · Manufacture

The manufacturer of dexamethasone obtained a Certificate of suitability with requirements of European Pharmacopoeia  (CEP). The detailed information on manufacturing process, starting materials, justification of critical steps, process controls and their evaluation, critical process intermediates and acceptance criteria were provided to the EDQM and assessed before granting the CEP.

Since  particle  size  may  be  considered  a  critical  attribute  and  because  the  particle  size  grade  is  not within the scope of the CEP the applicant provided satisfactory information concerning the method of micronisation and demonstrated that this process is adequately controlled.

It  has  been  confirmed  that  no  changes  in  the  manufacturing  process,  specifications  and  analytical methods, were introduced since the granting of the CEP.

## · Specification

Dexamethasone is described in the European Pharmacopoeia and its manufacturer has confirmed that the  active  substance  complies  with  these  requirements.  Additional  tests  for  particle  size,  bacterial endotoxin, microbial contamination and residual solvents have been added to the specification for the active substance. A copy of the CEP has been provided. The CEP includes a test for residual solvents used during the synthesis.

The tests methods are according to the Ph Eur except for the assay and related substances tests were an in-house HPLC method is used. Satisfactory details for this method have been provided. It includes a satisfactory system suitability test.

Satisfactory  validation  data  are  provided  for  the  HPLC  assay  for  the  active  substance  and  related substances (including demonstration of equivalence with the Ph Eur monograph methods).

The microbiological contamination and endotoxin tests have also been satisfactorily validated.

Batch analysis data were provided for 5 batches of the active substance. All results were consistent from batch to batch and complied with the requirements in the active substance specification.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Stability

A retest period and storing conditions of the active substance are not mentioned in the CEP. To support the claimed shelf-life and storing conditions stability data from a study in formal conditions (ICH) have been provided.

Results indicate that the active substance is stable when stored according to proposed conditions and confirmed the claimed re-test period.

## Finished Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

The  goal  of  the  formulation  development  was  to  obtain  a  sustained  release  polymer  implant  that delivers dexamethasone to posterior segment of the eye.

An  extensive  formulation  development  program  has  been  conducted.  The  implant  formulation development proceeded through two major formulation changes that were in response to three process changes,  as  the  implant  form  changed  from  a  compressed  tablet  to  an  extruded  filament.  The formulation  was  initially  developed  as  a  solid,  tablet-shaped  implant  delivered  surgically  to  the posterior segment  of the eye. Since the tablet implant required surgical insertion and the manufacturing process was no viable for large scale manufacturing a hot-melt extruded implant has been developed. The extrusion process is an efficient and accurate method to produce homogeneous dexamethasone-polymer matrices assuring that the consistency and the diameter of the filament could be more precisely controlled, allowing placing inside a 22G hypodermic needle. A single-use applicator was designed with the needle for injecting the implant into the vitreous.

The change from a tablet to an extruded filament required:

1. Change of polymers as the extruded implant needed to be mechanically stronger than the tablet (which was surgically inserted). The polymeric matrix was also changed in order to achieve drug release  profile  for  the  extruded  filament,  equivalent  to  that  observed  for  the  tablet.  Many different  PLA  and  PLGA  polymer  combinations  were  tested  and  a  combination  of  two  PLGA polymers was selected.
2. Evidence  that  the  extrusion  and  the  sterilization  process  did  not  adversely  affect  the  safety, quality  or  performance  of  the  implant.  The  effects  of  extrusion  on  the  active  substance  were studied. The effect of extrusion on the drug substance was studied comparing the crystallinity, melting point, melting enthalpy and IR spectra of dexamethasone in the implant with the same properties of the pure dexamethasone.

The  effects  of  gamma  sterilization  were  studied  in  relation  to  the  polymer  matrix.  Gamma radiation reduces the molecular weight of PLGA polymers by cleaving the backbone chains, and this  could  potentially  result  in  faster  drug  release  from  gamma  irradiated  implants  than  from non-irradiated  implants.  The  studies  showed  that  the  drug  release  rate  with  the  gamma radiation dose selected was not affected.

3. Improve dimensional tolerance and content uniformity to facilitate placement of the implant in a 22 gauge needle, the delivery of the implant from the needle and a guarantee that cut filaments provide a consistent dose of dexamethasone.

The final formulation was established as a combination of two poly D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) polymers to  produce  a  suitable  matrix  that  controls  the  sustained  release  of  dexamethasone,  and  ensure  a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mechanical strength suitable for use in the applicator. This formulation was established in Phase 2b clinical study and has remained unchanged since then.

## · Adventitious agents

None of the excipients used in the medicinal product, including the active substance, is of the animal origin.

## · Manufacture of the product

During the development program of the manufacturing process a number of studies were undertaken. Development program included (1) development an extrusion process to assure content uniformity of the drug in the implant, the dimensional tolerances and physical characteristics that would facilitate the reliable delivery of the implant from the applicator, (2) development a cutting process to assure accurate dosing in the implants, (3) development a loading process and vision system to detect the loaded implant in the applicator system and (4) development a sterilization process to assure that the implant with the applicator was not adversely affected by gamma sterilization.

Based  on  these  development  studies  and  manufacturing  experience  gained  during  development  all critical  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  identified  and  adequately  studied,  and appropriate in-process control parameters have been established.

Manufacturing  process  developed  for  Phase  3  is  essentially  the  same  as  the  one  proposed  for commercial  product.  The  Phase  3  equipment  is  also  the  same  as  proposed  for  commercial  product except for improvements that have subsequently been introduced to the commercial process.

The product is terminally sterilised by gamma irradiation. The specified dose is 25 - 40kGy which is in compliance with the Ph Eur standard requirements.

The majority of steps in the Manufacturing process of the medicinal product are performed in a Grade C environment  resulting in sealed applicator pouches which are than terminally sterilised by gamma irradiation and packed in its outer carton.

Validation data on three process validation batches manufactured in the proposed manufacturing site have been submitted. Validation reports were provided for all critical steps of the process and considered satisfactory.

## · Product specification

The drug product specifications include tests for appearance, identification of dexamethasone (HPLC and TLC), assay of dexamethasone (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), Insoluble Particulate Matter, Actuation Force, Dexamethasone Release, sterility, Bacterial Endotoxin (implant and the device), content uniformity.

The  analytical  methods  have  been  sufficiently  described,  some  of  them  are  compendial  methods described in the Ph Eur.

Single HPLC method is used for dexamethasone content, content uniformity and related substances. The method is specific for dexamethasone, separates dexamethasone from its impurities, and there is no placebo interference. Satisfactory validation data, according to ICH validation guidelines, have been provided. Suitability of the method for routine control and stability has been demonstrated.

The dexamethasone release profile from the implant is determined by using a non-standard dissolution apparatus  and  HPLC  method.This  method  is  intended  to  determine  the  amount  of  dexamethasone released from the polymer matrix over a 21 day period for quality control purposes only. Combined

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

with the outer and inner blood-retinal barriers as well as a host of retinal pigmented epithelial drug transport  mechanisms  this  makes  an  a  priori  in  vitro-in  vivo  correlation  in  humans  impossible. Therefore, for the intravitreal implant, the quality control drug release method is not intended to fully represent the human in-vivo performance of the drug product, but rather to ensure that the implant manufacturing process is reproducible.

Batch analysis results  on  5  commercial  scale  batches  of  the  drug  product  demonstrated  compliance with the proposed specification and confirmed consistency and uniformity of the product. The results were consistent from batch to batch and proved that the product can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification.

## · Stability of the product

Stability studies according to the ICH guidelines have been performed on 3 primary stability batches of Ozurdex 700 micrograms. Additional data were generated for 3 primary batches of 350 micrograms implants. This data is considered representative of the 700 micrograms product.

Stability data were generated using the storage conditions listed in the ICH Guidance and contained results  for  24 months  from  long  term  storage  at  25°C/60% RH,  12 months  from  storage  under intermediate conditions at 30°C/65%RH, and 6 months from accelerated conditions at 40°C/75% RH.

Test methods used in 'Stability studies' are the same as the one used at release except the test for content uniformity, which is performed only at release.

The  container/closure  system  used  in  the  primary  stability  study  utilizes  the  same  materials  as  the proposed commercial package.

Photo-stress studies were not conducted as there is brief exposure to light during manufacture and dosing.  Additionally,  the  implant  is  packaged  in  an  applicator  system  with  an  aluminium  foil  pouch which protects the product from exposure to light until just prior to administration

A package leachable study was performed to evaluate potential volatile leachables which might migrate and  adsorb  into  the  implant  matrix.  The  product  was  monitored  after  three  months  of  storage  at 40°C/75% RH and compared to cut bulk filament stored in glass vials. No leachables were observed, which indicates that the proposed container closure system is suitable for use with implant.

The results generated during the stability studies and statistical analyses support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1 Introduction

The  applicant  conducted  a  partial  non-clinical  development  program.  This  program  is  in  general agreement with the applicable guidelines.

All definitive toxicology studies were carried out in full compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations.  Investigations  undertaken  to  establish  suitable  doses  for  use  in  the  toxicity  and pharmacokinetic studies were performed in accordance with the general principles of GLP.

## 2.3.2.  Pharmacology

## · Primary pharmacodynamic studies

The  applicant  provided  data  from  published  literature  (Nakada,  1987)  regarding  dexamethasone binding affinity to glucocorticoid receptors in fibroblasts. Data from saturation analysis yielded a Kd of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3.47 ± 0.38 nM and a Bmax of 50,100 ± 2,200 sites/cell (n=3).  The Kd value for [ 3 H] dexamethasone binding correlated very well with the 2.77 nM EC50 value for dexamethasone regulation of β -adrenergic receptor  subtype.  The  relevance  of  these  data  was  initially  unclear  to  the  CHMP,  but  the  applicant provided an acceptable justification arguing that the provided references could be extrapolated to the claimed  indication  as  there  were  no  available  specific  dexamethasone  pharmacology  data  on  tissue explants  or  cell  culture  models  for  the  blood-retinal  barrier  at  the  time  of  initial  submission.  In addition,  a  new  reference  was  submitted  by  the  applicant  during  the  procedure  that  showed dexamethasone  cytokine  induction  inhibition  in  human  retinal  microvascular  pericytes  in  the  same range of concentrations (2 nM).

The applicant also provided the results of a 10 week study in the rabbit eye to evaluate the primary pharmacodynamics of the 350 µg and 700 µg DEX PS DDS. The rabbit model used for this study was designed  to  mimic  the  pathologies  associated  with  retinal  vein  occlusion  (RVO),  demonstrating  a breakdown of the blood-retinal and blood-aqueous barriers, and an accumulation of retinal fluid. An intravitreal  injection  of  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (rHu-VEGF)  was  used  to  activate  specific endothelial  receptors  that  signal  the  breakdown  of  the  blood-retinal  and  blood-aqueous  barriers. Glucocorticoids  such  as  dexamethasone  and  triamcinolone  acetonide  were  previously  shown  to suppress the expression of VEGF protein and to block nearly all pathological retinal responses elicited by intravitreal VEGF injection. In the study, the 350 µg dose completely blocks VEGF-induced bloodretinal barrier (BRB) breakdown in rabbits two weeks after intravitreal drug injection. This dose also partially inhibits blood-aqueous barrier (BAB; iris) breakdown.  Six weeks after injection, the 350 µg dose partially inhibits BRB breakdown but has no effect on BAB breakdown. For the higher 700 µg dose, the efficacy was similar to that of the 350 µg dose, with more pronounced inhibition, and this was still significant six weeks after the injection unlike in the lower dose. There was no pharmacological effect on VEGF-induced responses measured ten weeks after intravitreal injection of either formulation. The doses chosen for this study are the therapeutic doses considered for humans, and it is important to note  the  relative  difference  in  eye  size  from  the  rabbit  eye  administered  intravitreally  in  this  study compared to the larger human eyes. In general, CHMP considered that Ozurdex was effective in the study relevant to the proposed indication.

## · Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were performed by the applicant with the 350 µg or 700 µg DEX PS DDS formulations. Considering the low dexamethasone systemic exposure following intravitreal administration of 350 µg or 700 µg DEX PS DDS, systemic effects on glucocorticoid receptors is not expected.

## · Safety pharmacology programme

No safety pharmacology studies were conducted with the intravitreal DEX DDS formulations.

The  applicant  provided  literature  references  regarding  peribulbar,  intravitreal  and  anterior  chamber injections  of  dexamethasone  (5  mg  [peribulbar]  and  400 μ g  [intravitreal  and  anterior  chamber] respectively), as well as topical and oral administration for treatment of different ocular pathologies in humans (endophthalmitis and ocular inflammatory conditions unresponsive to topical corticosteroids). No ocular adverse effects were reported in any of these publications. According to CHMP Guideline on Safety pharmacology studies for human pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/539/00), considering that DEX PS DDS is administered locally (i.e. ocular, intravitreal), and the systemic exposure is demonstrated to be low, the absence of specific safety pharmacology studies for Ozurdex was acceptable to the CHMP.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed by the applicant with the 350 or 700 µg DEX PS DDS.

However, as reflected in section 4.2 'Posology and method of administration' of the SPC, adequate anaesthesia and a broad spectrum topical antimicrobial should be given prior to Ozurdex injection. The applicant  was  therefore  requested  to  discuss  potential  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  between Ozurdex and ophthalmic anaesthetic and antimicrobial agents. The applicant responded by reviewing the results  of  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  rabbit  and  primate  where  gentamicin,  tropicamide, proparacaine and benzylalkonium chloride eye drops were administered prior to Ozurdex injection. The applicant highlighted that no increase of infection rates, lack of anaesthetic strength or abnormal pupil dilation were noted. Although the agents included in the repeat-dose toxicity studies are not the same agents that are foreseen to be administered in humans, the CHMP  agreed that potential pharmacodynamic  interactions  do  not  seem  to  be  likely  and  that  the  lack  of  pharmacodynamic interaction studies between Ozurdex and recommended co-medication has been adequately justified by the applicant.

## 2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics

To  support  the  safety  of  Ozurdex  (DEX  PS  DDS  Applicator  System)  in  man,  the  posterior  segment pharmacokinetics  of  dexamethasone  has  been  evaluated  in  five  single-dose  ocular  absorption  and distribution  studies  in  rabbits  and  in  one  single-dose  study  in  monkeys.  All  pivotal  single  dose pharmacokinetic studies and two repeat dose toxicokinetic studies were conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations, using validated analytical methods.

Due to the limited availability of monkey vitreous humour, aqueous humour, retina and iris-ciliary body, rabbit samples were used as a proxy matrix, and the same analytical methods were thus employed for both species. For biological matrices that are difficult to obtain, the use of a physiologically appropriate proxy  matrix  is  scientifically  acceptable.  For  aqueous  humour,  a  cross-validation  as  described  by Bressolle was performed. The applicant considered the results acceptable, although precision results did  not  satisfy  previously  established  acceptance  criteria  (&lt;  15%).  In  addition,  for  dexamethasone determinations in vitreous humour, retina and iris-ciliary body in monkey samples, no cross-validation was performed to demonstrate the adequacy of the rabbit proxy matrices. The applicant was therefore requested  by  the  CHMP  to  apply  the  cross  validation  criteria  to  all  the  analytical  methods  for  the different matrices in rabbit, to warrant the adequacy of the methods validated for rabbit matrices to monkey matrices.

According to the Draft EMEA Guideline on Validation of Bioanalytical Methods (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009) more flexible approaches are admitted when validating methods for rare matrices. In addition, the applicant submitted the summaries of two new cross-validation studies for  monkey  vitreous  humour  and  retina  using  rabbit  proxy  matrices.  According  to  these  results, analytical  methods  for  monkey  VH  and  retina  appear  to  be  adequately  validated.  However,  these reports  were  not  considered  fully  adequate  as  final  study  validation  reports  since  original  raw  data were  not  included  to  allow  an  accurate  assessment  of  the  results  presented.  The  applicant  was therefore  requested  to  submit  complete  study  reports  including  original  raw  data  to  the  CHMP  as  a follow-up measure (see section 2.7 of this report).

## Absorption

The  ocular  absorption  of  DEX  PS  DDS  was  studied  in  New  Zealand  White  (NZW)  rabbits  and cynomolgus monkeys following a single dose administration for different observation periods. Tablet,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

single and double extruded dosage forms were tested, and two different implantation methods were used, sclerotomy and implantation via Ozurdex applicator. The extruded implants generally released dexamethasone more gradually and with less variability  than  the  tablet  implants,  and  the  extruded form showed greater uniformity of dexamethasone release compared to the tablet implant.

In the repeat-dose toxicology studies, the plasma Cmax in rabbit and monkey at the highest DEX PS DDS  dose  (1400  µg)  administered  were  1.60  and  0.555  ng/ml,  respectively.  The  repeat-dose toxicokinetic profiles were similar to the single-dose, and this suggests that there is no potential for ocular or systemic drug accumulation following repeat dosing of DEX PS DDS.  Based on body weight differences between human (~60 kg) and monkey (~3 kg) the systemic exposure of dexamethasone in human is expected to be ~20-fold lower than in monkey.

The  applicant  also  provided  literature  references  regarding  the  mean  peak  plasma  concentration following  a  single  (IV  or  oral)  or  multiple  (topical  ocular)  administration  of  dexamethasone  or dexamethasone disodium in humans. These plasma concentration varies from 10.5 ± 2.8 (IV), 8.4 ± 3.6 (oral) and 0.7 ± 0.4 mg/ml (topical ocular). The oral and IV doses range from 6 mg up to 8 mg more than ocular administration, leading to subsequently higher human exposure.

## Distribution

Following intravitreal implantation, both radiolabel solution and non-radiolabel implant studies showed a similar pattern of distribution and indicate that ocular distribution does not change. There is delivery to the posterior of the eye and distribution to the retina following implantation of DEX PS DDS. As a result of the observations in the 6-month pharmacokinetic study in rabbits, CHMP concluded that the location of the implant in the posterior segment of the eye has a direct effect in the duration of the drug  release.  The  applicant  was  further  requested  by  the  CHMP  to  discuss  the  relevance  for  the healthy/untreated  eye  of  the  dexamethasone  exposure  via  contralateral  diffusion  observed  in  the  6 months  study  in  rabbits.  Taking  into  account  the  low  systemic  levels  of  dexamethasone  following intravenous administration, exposure in the untreated eye due to systemic exposure does not seem to be likely. In addition, as stated by Sigurdsson et al, 2007, the contribution of systemic drug return to the ocular tissues would probably be lower in humans as the apparent volume of distribution is much greater  in  70  kg  humans  than  in  2  kg  rabbit.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  minimal biological effect of DEX PS DDS on the contralateral eye in humans would be expected. However, the route of exposure in the untreated eye following administration of DEX PS DDS in the contralateral eye has  not  been  fully  clarified.  Section  5.3  of  the  SPC  therefore  includes  information  to  reflect  the potential contralateral exposure in the untreated eye, as observed in rabbits, as a warning for eventual findings in clinical practice.

No new studies regarding the systemic distribution of dexamethasone have been submitted. The data provided  by  the  applicant  from  literature  references  included  data  from  dexamethasone  binding  to plasma protein. This study revealed that 85, 73, 74 and 77% was bound in rat, dog, cow and human plasma, respectively. Results submitted also suggest that the binding of dexamethasone is linear and occurs  primarily  to  albumin,  with  little  or  no  binding  to  corticosteroid-binding  globulin  (transcortin); endogenous cortisol does not compete with dexamethasone for protein binding sites. Considering the low systemic dexamethasone concentrations following intravitreal administration of DEX PS DDS, no relevant systemic effects are expected in renally impaired patients.

The applicant was requested by the CHMP in the Scientific Advice (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/340437/2005) to  provide  in  the  MAA  data  on  melanin  binding  (especially  intraocular)  in  a  specific  study  in  a pigmented  species  or  from  literature.  The  in  vivo  results  submitted  by  the  applicant  instead, adequately  reflect  the  absence  of  dexamethasone  binding  to  melanin  in  Dutch-Belted  rabbits.  In addition,  dexamethasone  showed  rapid  clearance  from  all  ocular  tissues  in  NZW  rabbits  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Cynomolgus monkeys. Dexamethasone is therefore not expected to accumulate in human pigmented ocular tissue.

## Metabolism

The  applicant  provided  literature  references  regarding  dexamethasone  metabolism.  Dexamethasone metabolism has been extensively examined. Liver metabolism via CYP3A4 enzymes has been shown previously. Ocular metabolism studies were conducted by the applicant and both in vitro and in-vivo studies  have  shown  no  or  minimal  evidence  of  metabolism  in  the  rabbit,  monkey  or  human  ocular tissue.  The  use  of  poly  (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)  biodegradable  polymer  (PLGA)  has  also  been examined  previously  with  humanised  monoclonal  antibody,  rhuMAb  HER2  in  rabbits,  and  has  been shown to be well tolerated and with slow vitreous clearance. Though the metabolism of the poly (D,Llactide) polymer (PLA) and PLGA vehicle of the implant is well established and recognised in other drug formulations,  this  is  not  established  for  intravitreal  administration,  although  it  can  be  assumed  that they are degraded in a similar way.

## Excretion

The elimination of dexamethasone from the systemic circulation following administration of Ozurdex is considered to be similar to that of oral, intravenous or topical ocular administration. Following a single intravitreal injection of dexamethasone in rabbit and monkey, dexamethasone was rapidly cleared from the vitreous humour. Estimation of human vitreal clearance can further be made from the literature (Gan et al, 2005). This study suggests that vitreal clearance in humans to be approximately 12 ml/day, and this is in line with both the rabbit and monkey, implying a similarity in elimination. Influence of a disease  state  may  however  have  an  effect  on  dexamethasone  clearance,  but  this  has  not  been explored.

Dexamethasone is known to cross the placenta and be excreted in milk. This information is accurately reflected in section 4.6 of the SPC.

## Pharmacokinetic drug interactions

No  ocular  drug-drug  interaction  studies  have  been  conducted  for  DEX  PS  DDS  and  no  systemic pharmacokinetic drug interactions are expected following intravitreal administration of Ozurdex since only very low dexamethasone concentrations will be reached at systemic level.

Regarding potential pharmacokinetic interactions, the CHMP initially highlighted, as stated above in the section  on  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions,  that  adequate  anaesthesia  and  a  broad  spectrum topical antimicrobial will be given prior to Ozurdex injection. Following assessment of further data from the applicant the CHMP agreed that systemic pharmacokinetic interactions between Ozurdex and other co-administered  medication  are  not  expected  due  to  the  low  systemic  exposure  to  dexamethasone following Ozurdex intravitreal administration, not high enough to induce hepatic enzymes.

Local  interactions  were  not  observed  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  conducted  in  rabbits  and monkeys. No abnormal or unexpected pharmacokinetic findings were noted. Potential pharmacokinetic interactions do not seem to be likely. However, it should be noted that co-administered medication in these studies was not exactly the same that is foreseen to be administered in clinical practice.

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

Toxicity studies were conducted to evaluate the ocular and systemic effects of DEX PS DDS following administration in NZW rabbits. Repeat-dose intravitreal ocular toxicity studies were also conducted in NZW rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys using the DEX PS DDS and the Ozurdex applicator system. No

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

new studies were performed to investigate the mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, or reproductive effects due  to  the  well  established  clinical  use  of  dexamethasone  and  the  low  systemic  exposure  following intravitreal  administration.  All  toxicology  studies  with  the  DEX PS  DDS  were  conducted  according to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) guidelines and procedures.

## · Single dose toxicity

A number of single-dose toxicity studies in rabbits were conducted to evaluate the ocular and systemic effects  of  DEX  PS  DDS  following  sclerotomy  implantation  of  the  implant.  Rabbits  were  surgically (sclerotomy)  implanted  with  700  µg  (1  implant),  1400  µg  (2  implants),  or  2100  µg  (3  implants) dexamethasone  into  the  posterior  segment  of  the  right  and  left  eyes.  Unlike  standard  single-dose toxicity studies, animals in DEX PS DDS studies were not sacrificed 14 days post-dosing, as the singledose effects extend beyond this time period and ocular effects were observed up to 23 weeks postimplantation.  This  was  considered  as  an  acceptable  approach  by  the  CHMP,  in  the  context  of  the treatment and administration of the implant.

Sclerotomy  implantation  to  the  posterior  segment  of  both  eyes  showed  no  evidence  of  intravitreal ocular  toxicity.  A  number  of  surgical-related  effects  were  observed,  including  cataract  formation, squinting, decreases in intraocular pressure (IOP), focal granulomatous or chronic inflammation in the sclera and/or conjunctiva associated with silk sutures. These ocular changes were observed in both the test and placebo groups and was believed to be attributed to the surgical procedure and the reduced amount of vitreous volume for the rabbit eye (1.5 ml rabbit compared to 3.6 ml in human). By using relative  vitreous  volumes  to  normalise  doses  between  species  the  applicant  demonstrated  that  it  is possible to overcome the effects due to differences in vitreous volume between species.

Lymphotoxicity and decreased body weight was observed, this was most evident up to 30 days postimplantation and considered a dexamethasone-related systemic effect. These effects were reduced at two months and disappeared thereafter. The intravitreal dose of dexamethasone administered in each 700 µg DEX PS DDS implant is equivalent to approximately 0.2 mg/kg body weight in rabbits, which is

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

roughly 20 times higher than the expected therapeutic dose for man (assuming 60 kg body weight). In more detail, the safety margins relating to the exposure to dexamethasone range from 3.8 to 17 fold in animal studies with use of the applicator, and from 7 to 100 fold following topical and intravenous dexamethasone.

## · Repeat dose toxicity

Two repeated-dose toxicity studies were conducted in rabbits and monkeys using the clinical Ozurdex applicator system. In both studies, two intravitreal injections were followed by an observation period up  to  9  months  post  the  second  injection.  Both  studies  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GLP standards.

Parameters evaluated in the studies included detailed observations, body weights and food consumption. Serum chemistry and haematology evaluations, urianalysis, organ weights, macroscopic and microscopic pathologic evaluations, gross ocular observations, ophthalmology, electroretinography and tonometry were also conducted in these studies.

As  stated  earlier,  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  rabbits  and  monkeys.  The Ozurdex implants were tolerated adequately in both species following two intravitreal implantations. In the  rabbit  there  was  evidence  of  cortical  lens  opacity  following  the  second  dose.  Of  these  three incidences, one showed opacity regression after 12 months, which is in line with what has been shown previously to occur following topical administration of corticosteroids.

The duration of the repeat-dose studies was considered adequate by the CHMP. There were expected procedure-related  effects  of  transient  conjunctival  irritation,  vitreal  implant  remnants,  and  fibrosis (foreign body reaction) that was localised to the implant (injection) sites and this was observed in both species and in all treated animals and controls. The doses these animals were administered are the human therapeutic doses of 350 µg or 700 µg DEX PS DDS. Considering the relatively small size of the rabbit/monkey eye compared to the human, the doses administered in these repeat-dose studies are higher than would be expected to be exposed to human.

The applicant has, as described earlier, developed an applicator to deliver the DEX PS DDS implant to the posterior segment of the eye, and following administration in the repeat-dose studies, there was no incidence of injection-related cataract observed.

The applicant also provided literature references regarding the lack of toxicity of PLGA microspheres, administered intravitreally, to the ocular tissues. Whereas the implantation of PLGA fibres in a rabbit cornea  pouch  (cornea  micropocket  assay)  resulted  in  vascular  invasion  into  the  cornea,  although  it could be caused by leachables from the implanted materials. This bibliographic data was considered sufficient by the CHMP to satisfy the requirements given in the CHMP Scientific Advice (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/340437/2005) of providing appropriate toxicological studies or other justifications to demonstrate the safety of PLGA by the intravitreal route of administration. In addition, there were no  observable  findings  in  the  two  studies  referenced  that  could  be  attributable  to  PLGA  in  placebo treated animals (i.e. PLGA implant).

The studies into repeated-dose toxicity of DEX PS DDS are considered to be generally acceptable to the CHMP.

## · Genotoxicity

Previous  studies  to  evaluate  the  mutagenic  potential  of  dexamethasone  in  bacteria  and  mammalian cells in vitro have been negative. Given the long history of safe use of dexamethasone and with the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

low levels of patient exposure, genotoxicity studies have not been performed and this was considered acceptable to the CHMP.

## · Carcinogenicity

Given the long history of safe use of dexamethasone and with the low levels of patient exposure, no carcinogenicity studies on dexamethasone or DEX PS DDS have been performed. Inactive components of  DEX  PS  DDS  have  been  shown  to  metabolise  into  substances  normally  found  in  the  body  and therefore are not considered to increase the risk of carcinogenicity. This was considered acceptable to the CHMP.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

No  new  studies  on  fertility  and  general  reproduction,  embryo-fetal  development,  or  pre-/post-natal development  have  been  performed  for Ozurdex. However,  there are published data on the teratogenicity of dexamethasone in mice, rabbits and rhesus monkeys following topical ophthalmic and intramuscular administration. The teratogenic dose in rhesus monkeys (1.0 mg/kg/day dose) is 85-fold higher than a 700 µg DEX PS DDS implant in humans. It should also be considered the low systemic exposures  observed  following  intravitreal  implantation  of  DEX  PS  DDS  in  absorption  studies  (7.40 ng.day/mL  and  16.8  ng.day/mL,  in  rabbits  and  cynomolgus  monkeys,  respectively).  However, adequate warnings regarding the potential risk in pregnant or nursing women is included in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SPC.

## · Toxicokinetic data

Mean plasma Cmax values increased with dose in monkeys between 350 and 700 μ g DEX PS DDS, and similarly between 700 and 1400 μ g DEX PS DDS treatment groups in rabbits. The extent of systemic exposure appeared to be dose proportional in rabbits and more than dose proportional in monkeys. Duration of plasma drug concentrations was longer for the high dose group compared to the low dose group in both species. No gender-related differences were observed in monkeys where animals of both sexes were included.

## · Local Tolerance

The applicant has not performed specific local tolerance studies, but considered based on the Note for guidance on non-clinical local tolerance testing of medicinal products (CPMP/SWP/2145/00) that local tolerance was assessed in the ocular single and repeat dose toxicity studies in rabbits and monkeys.

The CHMP accepted the applicant's strategy, but requested the applicant to discussion in detail  the histopathology of the eye in those studies. It should be highlighted that retina and choroid are the target tissues for  DEX  PS  DDS  action.  In  response  the applicant provided a discussion on histopathology data from repeat dose toxicity studies, including local tolerance endpoints and based on the conclusion that there were no abnormal findings on the retina or choroids outside the injection site in either rabbit or monkey repeated dose studies, the CHMP subsequently considered that there are no safety concerns regarding the local tolerance of Ozurdex.

To  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  DEX  PS  DDS  applicator,  a  special  study  in  NZW  rabbits  was conducted.  The  Ozurdex  applicator  system  was  used  to  implant  DEX  PS  DDS  into  the  posterior segment  of  rabbit  eyes.  The  study  found  that  the  applicator  system  was  easy  to  use.  Traumatic

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

cataracts and other reactions were observed in this study, but these are thought to be likely related to the dimensions of the rabbit eye and not a problem associated with the Ozurdex applicator.

## Phototoxicity

As dexamethasone absorbs outside the visible and UVA/B light spectrum (290-700 nm), phototoxicity testing  was  not  performed.  Dexamethasone  has  a  long  history  of  safe  use  following  topical  ocular administration.

## Studies on impurities

All  starting  materials  were  USP  grade  and  met  USP  specifications.  According  to  the  applicant, impurities in the drug product were tested at levels that exceeded current specifications and exceeded what will be used clinically.

Dexamethasone  ketone,  degradation  product,  was  tested  up  to  1%  in  batches  used  in  non-clinical studies  according  to  drug  product  specifications  provided.  However,  proposed  release  and  shelf-life specification for dexamethasone ketone was NMT 1.4%. The CHMP highlighted that this specification is above the qualification threshold for degradation products in new drug products (Maximum daily dose: &lt; 1 mg; threshold: 1.0% or 5 µg TDI, whichever is lower) according to Note for guidance on impurities in new drug products (CPMP/ICH/2738/99). Therefore, this impurity (degradation product), dexamethasone ketone, was not initially considered by the CHMP as qualified.

In response the applicant argued that as DEX PS DDS is a slow release delivery system, patients are not  expected  to  be  exposed  to  daily  amounts  of  dexamethasone  ketone  exceeding  the  qualification threshold, in this case: 1.0% or 5 μ g TDI, whichever is lower, for a Maximum daily dose: &lt; 1 mg (Note for guidance on impurities in new drug products (CPMP/ICH/2738/99)). Therefore, as qualification of dexamethasone ketone was considered by the applicant to be required. The CHMP acknowledged the applicants  argument  and  considered  that  further  qualification  of  the  degradation  product  was  not needed.

## 2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An environment risk assessment for dexamethasone was performed. The dexamethasone PECsurface water value is 0.007 μ g/L, below the action limit of 0.01 μ g/L and dexamethasone is not a PBT substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5 (2.06 ± 0.58). It is concluded that Ozurdex intravitreal implant is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1.  Introduction

The applicant has conducted several studies (phase I-III) to evaluate the use of DEX PS DDS. Two of those studies (206207-008 and 206207-009) have utilised the formulation intended for marketing in the  proposed  indication.  The  dose  ranging  study  DC103-06  included  patients  with  the  intended indication (macular oedema), however, this study was performed with the tableted formulation. The release  characteristics  of  the  tablet  appear  to  be  very  different  to  the  final  product,  therefore  all studies performed with the tablet could only be considered as supportive.

## 2.4.2.  GCP

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

A routine GCP inspection has been performed on the request from the CHMP In the GCP inspection no critical findings were identified by the GCP inspectors.

## 2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics

No formal pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. Systemic exposure was however measured within the two pivotal phase III studies (206207-009 and 206207-008).

The results indicated that exposure is low. No ocular pharmacokinetic evaluations were conducted. In both  studies,  the  majority  of  plasma  dexamethasone  concentrations  were  below  the  level  of quantitation  (BLQ).  In  the  pooled  studies,  plasma  dexamethasone  concentrations  from  10  of  73

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

samples in the DEX 700 group and from 2 of 42 samples in the DEX 350 group were above the LLOQ, and  ranged  from  0.0521  ng/mL  to  0.0940  ng/mL.  There  were  no  apparent  correlations  between plasma  dexamethasone  concentration  and  age,  body  weight,  or  sex.  The  single  highest  plasma dexamethasone concentration observed in the phase 3 studies was 0.0940 ng/mL which is only 13.4% of that reported following multiple ocular applications of 1 drop of dexamethasone disodium phosphate (0.1%) to one eye every 1.5 hours.

## 2.4.4.  Pharmacodynamics

No  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  conducted  and  therefore  PK/PD  relationships  could  not  be ascertained.  Pharmacodynamic  data  were  collected  from  a  phase  II  dose-ranging  exploratory  study (DC103-06) in which a dose-response improvement in visual acuity was observed. The maintenance of the effect over time was studied in the two confirmatory trials.

## 2.4.5.  Clinical efficacy

## · Dose response study

One dose-finding phase II study (DC103-06) was conducted.

## Study DC103-06

This dose-ranging study was a randomised, examiner blinded, parallel group, three arms comparative trial  (DEX  350  tablets,  DEX  700  tablets,  both  inserted  through  the  pars  plana  vs.  observation)  in patients  with  persistent  macular  oedema  (PME)  following  treatment  and  associated  with  diabetic retinopathy,  uveitis,  retinal  vein  occlusion,  and  Irvine-Gass  syndrome.  Safety  was  evaluated  for  6 months and efficacy through day 90.

Eligible  patients  were  aged  12  years  and  older  with  persistent  macular  oedema  defined  as  clinically observable  macular  oedema  persisting  at  least  90  days  after  laser  treatment  or  after  90  days  of medical management. Macular oedema was defined as retinal thickening at the centre of the fovea, visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/40 attributable to PME and angiographic evidence of leakage in the perifoveal capillary net.

The  primary  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  patients  with ≥ 2  lines  improvement  in  best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at day 90.

Statistical  significance  for  the  primary  endpoint,  an  improvement  of  2  or  more  lines  in  the  last observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  analysis  of  best-corrected  visual  acuity  (BCVA)  at  day  90,  was observed  for  the  DEX  PS  DDS  700 μ g  group  (36.7%)  versus  the  Observation  group  (19.0%),  p  = 0.005. The improvement rate was likewise numerically higher with DEX PS DDS 350 μ g (26.1%) than with Observation, although the difference was not statistically significant. The improvement was with DEX PS DDS 350 μ g was also lower than with DEX PS DDS 700 μ g thus indicating a dose-response effect.

## · Main studies

This application is based on two pivotal phase III studies to support the efficacy and safety of DEX PS DDS in  the  treatment  of  macular  oedema:  Study  206207-009  and  Study  206207-008.  The  studies which were identical in design, were six-month randomised, sham-controlled studies with a 6-month open label extension, assessing the safety and efficacy of 700 μ g and 350 μ g dexamethasone posterior segment drug delivery system, in patients with macular oedema due to Branch or Central Retinal Vein Occlusion. Results of the open label extension were provided during the procedure. In the extension

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

phase,  patients  in  all  three  groups  received  a  second  DEX  700  implant  and  were  followed  up  for  a further 6 months (re-treated population). A number of patients who received only one treatment at baseline were followed up to 12 months (single treatment population).

## STUDY 206207-009 and STUDY 206207-008

- Methods
- Study Participants

## Inclusion criteria

Key inclusion criteria were male or female, at least 18 years of age, macular oedema due to CRVO at least 6 weeks to 9 months prior to study entry; and macular oedema due to BRVO at least 6 weeks to 12 months prior to study entry, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score between 34 and 68 letters by Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), retinal thickness of ≥ 300 μ m by optical coherence tomography (OCT). If both eyes were eligible for the study, the eligible eye with the shorter duration of disease was used as the study eye.

## Exclusion criteria

Key  exclusion  criteria  were  ocular  condition  that  would  prevent  a  15-letter  improvement  in  VA, epiretinal  membrane,  ocular  hypertension,  aphakia  or  anterior  chamber  intraocular  lens,  diabetic retinopathy,  retinal  or  disc  or  choroidal  neovascularization,  rubeosis  iridis,  active  ocular  infection, toxoplasmosis, visible scleral thinning or ectasia, media opacity, intraocular surgery, need for ocular surgery  or  laser,  hemodilution,  periocular  depot  or  systemic  steroids,  carbonic  anhydrase  inhibitors, immunosuppressants/modulators,  antimetabolites,  alkylating  agents,  topical  ophthalmic  steroids  or topical  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs),  warfarin,  heparin,  enoxaparin,  history  of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation in response to steroids.

Therapy  considered  necessary  for  the  patient's  welfare  could  be  given  at  the  discretion  of  the investigator. Dosages were to remain constant throughout the course of the trial for those concurrent medications that may have affected the study outcomes (e.g. treatment of elevated IOP, if systemic NSAIDs  were  regularly  used  prior  to  enrolment,  these  medications  may  have  continued  during  the study, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were not prohibited if they needed to be used to treat elevated IOP that developed during the course of the study.

## · Treatments

Patients received DEX 700, DEX 350, or Sham on the randomisation day 0 visit. In addition, qualified patients received open-label DEX 700 at the initial treatment day 180 visit. Only one eye was treated with study drug.

The study treatment procedure was performed by the treating investigator in a surgical suite or office setting using a standard, sterile technique. A combination of topical and subconjunctival anesthetics was used. Patients randomized to active treatment had the study drug placed into the vitreous through the pars plana using the DEX PS DDS applicator system. Patients randomised to Sham treatment had the needleless applicator pressed against the conjunctiva.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Objectives

The study objectives were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the 700 μ g DEX PS DDS applicator system (700 μ g dexamethasone) and 350 μ g DEX PS DDS applicator system (350 μ g dexamethasone) compared with a Sham DEX PS DDS applicator system (needleless applicator).

Secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the 700 μ g compared with the 350 μ g DEX PS DDS applicator systems in patients with macular oedema due to BRVO or CRVO as well as to assess the safety of the 700 μ g DEX PS DDS applicator system for an additional 6 months in patients who qualify for treatment in an open-label extension.

## · Outcomes/endpoints

## Primary efficacy endpoint

- o Efficacy was evaluated by the proportion of patients with a BCVA improvement of 15 or more letters from baseline at D180 (Study -009) and D90 (Study -008), using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) method. Visual acuity testing was to be performed at 4 meters, and for participants with sufficiently reduced vision, at 1 meter.

The primary efficacy variable was considered appropriate by the CHMP as improvement in visual acuity is  paramount  for  the  patient  and  improvement  by  more  that  15  letters  is  considered  a  clinically relevant outcome.

## Secondary key endpoints of efficacy

Secondary analyses include comparisons of DEX 700 versus Sham or DEX 350 versus Sham for specific variables such as:

- o Changes from baseline in contrast sensitivity using the Pelli-Robson chart, optical coherence tomography  (OCT  is  a  laser-based  noninvasive,  diagnostic  system  providing  high-resolution images of the retina, which analyzes retinal cystoid spaces and the thickness of the central 1 mm  macular  subfield),  fundus  photography  (for  quality  assessment  of  OCT  images),  and fluorescein angiography (to analyze leakage improvement).
- o Health related quality of life questionnaires (National Eye  Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25 (VFQ-25); SF-36™ Health Survey version 1 (SF-36v1); EuroQol5 Dimensions Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D)).
- o Safety  measurements  (AEs,  BCVA,  IOP,  biomicroscopy  examination,  indirect  ophtalmoscopic examination  for  vitreous  and  fondus,  retroillumination  photography,  vital  signs  and  DEX  PS DDS residual assessment by indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression).

Blood sample(s) of approximately 15 patients were to be collected at selected sites to determine plasma dexamethasone concentrations at each of the following visits: predose, days 1, 7, 30, 60, and 90, and early exit when applicable.

## · Sample size

The sample size calculation was based on the primary efficacy analyses of the proportion of patients with BCVA improvement from baseline of 15 or more letters in the study eye, comparing between DEX 700 and Sham and between DEX 350 and Sham. Assuming a 9% improvement rate for Sham and α = 0.05, with 165 patients per group the power was 81% to detect a between-group absolute difference of 11 percentage points in the improvement rate.

For this 3-arm study with a 1:1:1 ratio for treatment allocation, a total of 495 patients was needed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Accounting for approximately 10% dropout rate, approximately 550 patients were to be enrolled.

## · Randomisation

Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to DEX 700, DEX 350 and Sham.

## · Blinding (masking)

Masking was maintained through the use of a treating investigator who performed the study treatment procedure,  and  a  follow-up  investigator  who  did  not  participate  in  study  treatment  procedures. Individuals  collecting  efficacy  data  (BCVA,  contrast  sensitivity,  fluorescein  angiography,  OCT,  and fundus  photography)  and  the  central  reading  facility  remained  unaware  of  patient  treatment assignments. Patients remained masked from the initial study treatment assignment and for the whole duration of the trial.

## · Statistical methods

There  were  4  analysis  populations:  intent-to-treat  (ITT),  per  protocol  (PP),  safety,  and  re-treated populations. The ITT population includes all randomized patients. The PP population includes patients who had no major protocol violations determined prior to database lock. The safety population includes all randomized and treated patients. The retreated population includes all patients who enter the openlabel extension and receive the second treatment.

The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of patients with a BCVA improvement of 15 or more letters from baseline in the study eye. This included a comparison between DEX 700 and Sham and a comparison between DEX 350 and Sham at initial treatment day 180 in the ITT population.

However, for Study 008 the protocol was amended to update the definition and analysis of the primary endpoint after having analysed the results from Study 009: the comparison between DEX 700 versus Sham for the time to achieve a treatment response of BCVA improvement of 15 or more letters from baseline in the study eye during the initial treatment period was designated as the primary efficacy analysis.  However,  for  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  submission,  the  comparison  between DEX 700 versus Sham in the proportion of patients with 15 or more letters improvement from baseline in BCVA at initial treatment day 90 was designated as the primary efficacy analysis.

According to the information provided by the applicant (and later confirmed in a GCP inspection), the amendment of the primary endpoint for study 008 was made while the database remained masked.

There  had  been  996  patients  screened  for  the  study,  and  33%  (328/996)  failed  to  meet  the  entry criteria.  A  total  of  668  patients  were  randomized  and  enrolled  in  the  study.  Approximately  95%  of patients in each treatment group completed the initial 180 day treatment period.

The ITT population included all randomized patients: 226 in the DEX 700 group, 218 in the DEX 350 group,  and  224  in  the  Sham  group.  Seven  patients  were  randomized  but  not  treated.  The  PP population included all randomized patients with no major protocol deviations (93%): 213 in the DEX 700  group,  201  in  the  DEX  350  group,  and  209  in  the  Sham  group.  A  total  of  49  patients  were excluded from the PP population: 14 patients in the DEX 700 group, 18 patients in the DEX 350 group, and  17  patients  in  the  Sham  group.  The  safety  population  included  all  randomized  patients  who received at least one dose of study medication: 225 in the DEX 700 group, 215 in the DEX 350 group, and 221 in the Sham group.

In the open label extension part of the study, patients in all three groups received a second DEX 700 implant and were followed up for a further 6 months (re-treated population). A number of patients who received only one treatment at baseline were followed up to 12 months (single treatment population).

## · Baseline data

For the ITT population, overall, the mean (range) age was 63.6 years (31 to 96), 52.4% (350/668) were  male,  67.2%  (449/668)  were  Caucasian.  The  diagnosis  was  CRVO  for  34.7%  (232/668)  and BRVO for 65.3% (436/668). There were no statistically significant  differences  among  the  treatment groups in the demographic and baseline characteristics in the ITT population, as summarised in the following table:

Ophthalmic history, other than macular oedema in the study eye, was reported in the Eye disorders class  by  99.9%  of  patients.  The  most  common  findings  were  retinal  vein  occlusion  99.1%,  cataract 57.2%, retinal haemorrhage 17.5% , refraction disorder 12.0% , and vitreous detachment 10.5%.

Overall, treatment groups were well balanced with respect to other than ophthalmic baseline disorders, among  which  the  most  common  were  vascular  disorders  65.4%,  musculoskeletal/connective  tissue disorders 35.6%,  metabolism/nutrition disorders 33.8%,  gastrointestinal disorders  25.1%,  and infections/infestations 22.2%.

Prior  medication:  Overall,  8.5%  (57/668)  of  patients  reported  prior  procedures  for  the  treatment  of macular oedema in the study eye. All these patients had retinal laser coagulation, except one patient, who had intra-ocular injection.

Ocular concomitant medications in the study eye were reported for 46.5% (105/226) of patients in the DEX 700 group, 44.0% (96/218) in the DEX 350 group, and 22.3% (50/224) in the Sham group. The most frequently reported drug classes (more than 10% in any treatment group) were:

- ophthalmic beta blocking agents (25.7% [58/226] in the DEX 700 group, 21.6% [47/218] in the DEX 350 group, and 2.7% [6/224] in the Sham group),
- sympathomimetics in glaucoma therapy (12.8% [29/226] in the DEX 700 group, 12.8% [28/218] in the DEX 350 group, and 1.3% [3/224] group),
- ophthalmic prostaglandin analogues (9.7% [22/226] in the DEX 700 group, 11.5% [25/218] in the DEX 350 group, and 1.3% [3/224] in the Sham group), and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- other ophthalmologicals (9.7% [22/226] in the DEX 700 group, 11.0% [24/218] in the DEX 350 group, and 9.8% [22/224] in the Sham group).

The higher incidence of IOP-lowering medications is to be expected in the patients receiving intravitreal steroid  injections.  Information  provided  show  that  antiglaucoma  medications  were  among  the  most prescribed concomitant medication.

## · Outcomes and estimation

## Primary endpoints

## BCVA 15 or More Letters Improvement in ITT Population

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a BCVA improvement of 15 or more letters  from  baseline  at  day  180  in  the  study  eye  for  the  ITT  population,  as  summarised  in  the following table. The tables below also show the results following the open-label extension phase of the study for both the re-treated population and for the single treatment population.

Note:

Baselineisrelative tothefirstinjection

The proportion of patients with 15 or more letters improvement from baseline was significantly higher with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at initial treatment days 30, 60, and 90. At the primary time point initial treatment day 180, the difference (95% CI) between DEX 700 and Sham was 6.5% (0.9% to 13.9%), p = 0.087. The difference (95% CI) between DEX 350 and Sham was 5.1% (-2.3% to  12.4%),  p  =  0.180.  Neither  comparison  was  statistically  significant.  There  were  no  differences between the 2 doses of DEX.

## Secondary endpoints

## BRVO

The proportion of BRVO patients in the ITT population with a BCVA improvement of 15 or more letters from baseline in the study eye was similar to the overall ITT population. The proportion of patients with BCVA improvement of 15 or more letters from baseline was significantly higher with DEX 700 and DEX 350  compared  to  Sham  at  the  early  visits  but  not  at  initial  treatment  day  180.  There  were  no differences between the 2 doses of DEX.

## CRVO

The proportion of CRVO patients in the ITT population with a BCVA improvement of 15 or more letters from baseline in the study eye was similar to the overall ITT population for the DEX patients, but lower than the overall population for the Sham patients. The proportion of patients with BCVA improvement of 15 or more letters from baseline was significantly higher with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at the early visits, and with DEX 700 compared to Sham at initial treatment day 180. There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX.

## BCVA 15 or more letters improvement in patients with longer duration of macular oedema

The analysis was repeated excluding patients with a duration of macular oedema less than 90 days in order to assess the impact on the results of spontaneous improvement in BCVA. This subgroup was defined a posteriori and should therefore be read with caution. The proportion of patients with longer duration of macular oedema had similar BCVA improvement of 15 or more letters from baseline in the study eye as the ITT population. Excluding patients with acute macular oedema (&lt;90days), the rate of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

responders  in  the  sham  groups  decreased  leading  to  statistical,  although  not  clinical,  significant differences between DX700 and sham.

## Time to 15 or more letters improvement in BCVA

Treatment response was defined a posteriori as 15 or more letters improvement from baseline BCVA in the study eye at any time during the initial treatment period. Time to response was analysed using a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with the log-rank test for treatment differences. Overall, the cumulative response rate curves were significantly different for the DEX 700 and DEX 350 groups compared to the Sham group (p &lt; 0.001). Cumulative response rates were consistently higher with DEX 700 and DEX 350 than with Sham from day 30 to the end of the initial treatment period. There was a separation of curves as early as day 30 which was consistent over time without any crossover at any visit. There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX.

## Categorical change from baseline BCVA

The categorical change from baseline showed statistically significant better visual acuity in the study eye with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at each follow-up visit. From initial treatment day 30 onward, the beneficial effects of DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham were shown, not only in terms of ≥ 15 letters improvement but also in the prevention of ≥ 15 letters worsening. There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX.

## BCVA 10 or more letters improvement in ITT population

The proportion of patients with a BCVA improvement of 10 or more letters from baseline in the study eye for the ITT population is summarised in the table below:

## Mean change from baseline BCVA

In the ITT population, the mean changes from baseline BCVA number of letters read correctly in the study. Changes from baseline peaked at day 60, and were significantly greater with DEX 700 and DEX 350  compared  to  Sham  at  initial  treatment  days  30,  60,  90,  and  180  (p ≤ 0.016).  There  were  no differences between the 2 doses of DEX.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For BRVO patients, mean changes from baseline BCVA number of letters read correctly in the study eye were significantly greater with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at initial treatment days 30, 60, 90, and 180 (p ≤ 0.037). There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX.

For CRVO patients, mean changes from baseline BCVA number of letters read correctly in the study eye were significantly greater with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at initial treatment days 30, 60, and 90 (p ≤ 0.044), and with DEX 350 compared to Sham at day 180 (p = 0.018). There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX.

## Contrast sensitivity

At baseline, the mean number of letters read correctly in the study eye using contrast sensitivity was 27.3 in the DEX 700 group, 27.3 in the DEX 350 group, and 27.4 in the Sham group. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups at baseline or day 180. At day 180, the mean change from baseline number of letters read correctly in the study eye using contrast sensitivity was 1.2 in the DEX 700 group, 1.5 in the DEX 350 group, and 1.1 in the Sham group. There were no statistically significant between-group differences.

## Retinal Thickness in ITT population and diagnostic subgroups

Retinal thickness was significantly less with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at day 90 (p &lt; 0.001),  though  not  at  day  180.  There  were  no  differences  between  the  2  doses  of  DEX.  For  BRVO patients, mean central retinal thickness in the 1 mm subfield in the study eye measured by OCT was significantly less with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at day 90 (p &lt; 0.001), though not at day 180. There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX. For CRVO patients, mean central retinal thickness in the 1 mm subfield in the study eye measured by OCT was significantly less with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at day 90 (p ≤ 0.003), though not at day 180. There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX at day 90, however the mean thickness was significantly less with DEX 350 compared to DEX 700 at day 180.

## Retinal volume measured by Optical Coherence Tomography

Retinal volume was significantly less with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at day 90 (p ≤ 0.005), though not at day 180. There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX.

## Fluorescein Leakage

There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups in the distribution of change from baseline fluorescein leakage.

## · Recruitment and numbers analysed

A total of 872 patients were screened. Of these 275 (32%) failed to meet the entry criteria patients failed to fulfil selection criteria. Fifty ninety nine patients were randomised and 3 out of them did not receive treatment.

The ITT population included all randomized patients: 201 in the DEX 700 group, 196 in the DEX 350 group, and 202 in the Sham group. The PP population included all randomized and treated patients with no major protocol deviations: 189 in the DEX 700 group, 181 in the DEX 350 group, and 185 in the  Sham  group.  The  safety  population  included  all  randomized  patients  who  received  at  least  one dose of study medication: 196 in the DEX 700 group, 197 in the DEX 350 group, and 202 in the Sham group. Forty-four patients (12 patients in the DEX 700 group, 15 patients in the DEX 350 group, and 17 patients in the Sham group) were excluded from the PP population and all by-visit analyses. These patients were excluded from the PP population due to one or more protocol violations at baseline.

In the open label extension part of the study, patients in all three groups received a second DEX 700 implant and were followed up for a further 6 months (re-treated population). A number of patients who received only one treatment at baseline were followed up to 12 months (single treatment population).

## · Baseline data

For the ITT population, overall, the mean (range) age was 65.5 years (32 to 91), 54.6% (327/599) were  male,  83.8%  (502/599)  were  Caucasian.  The  diagnosis  was  CRVO  for  34.2%  (205/599)  and BRVO for 65.8% (394/599). There were no statistically significant  differences  among  the  treatment groups in the demographic and baseline characteristics in the ITT population, as summarised in the following table:

Ophthalmic history, other than macular oedema in the study eye, was reported by 99.2% of patients with  eye  disorders.  The  most  common  findings  were  retinal  vein  occlusion  98.5%,  cataract  54.1%, retinal haemorrhage 12.7%, and cataract nuclear 10.5%.

In relation to the baseline disease characteristics, the proportion CRVO/BRCO parallels that seen in the target population. However, selection criteria reflect a population likely to improve. Only 11% of the studied population had macular oedema of more than 270 days (and no longer than 365 days). By contrary,  up  to  20%  of  patients  had  macular  oedema  of  less  than  90  days  duration,  for  which  a spontaneous improvement might be expected.

Prior  medication:  In  BRVO  patients,  5.6%  (22/394)  used  medications  prior  to  study  entry  for  the treatment of macular oedema in the study eye. In CRVO patients, 8.8% (18/205) used medications prior to study entry for the treatment of macular oedema in the study eye. Overall, 12.5% of patients reported  prior  procedures  for  the  treatment  of  macular  oedema  in  the  study  eye.  Most  of  these patients, 93.2%, had retinal laser coagulation, 5.4% had haemodilution, and 1 patient had intra-ocular injections.  Overall,  18.2%  of  patient  reported  medications  for  other  than  the  treatment  of  macular oedema prior to study entry. The most common prior medications (reported by greater than 2% of patients) were other ophthalmologicals 5.0%, other antiinfectives 3.3%, platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding heparin 2.7%, and beta blocking agents 2.7%. Antiglaucoma medication was reported for up to 4.5%, 7.6% and 4.5% in DEX 700, DEX 350 and Sham, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Ocular concomitant medications in the study eye were reported for 40.8% (82/201) of patients in the DEX 700 group, 39.8% (78/196) in the DEX 350 group, and 19.8% (40/202) in the Sham group. The most frequently reported drug classes (more than 10% in any treatment group) were:

- ophthalmic beta blocking agents
- sympathomimetics in glaucoma therapy
- ophthalmic prostaglandin analogues

Retinal  laser  coagulation  and  eye  laser  surgery  were  the  most  commonly  performed  procedures. Similar  to  the  results  seen  in  Study  009,  the  use  of  IOP-lowering  medications  was  higher  in  the patients receiving intravitreal steroid injections.

The proportion of patients with 15 or more letters improvement from baseline was significantly higher with  DEX  700  and  DEX  350  compared  to  Sham  at  initial  treatment  days  30,  60,  and  90.  The comparison of DEX 700 versus Sham at day 90 was the primary endpoint, p = 0.008. There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX.

## Secondary endpoints

The results for BCVA 15 or more letters improvement in PP population were similar to the ITT population.

## BRVO

The proportion of BRVO patients in the ITT population with a BCVA improvement of 15 or more letters from baseline in the study eye was similar to the overall ITT population. The proportion of patients with BCVA  improvement  of  15  or  more  letters  from  baseline  was  significantly  higher  with  DEX  700 compared to Sham at days 30, 60, and 90 (p ≤ 0.021) and with DEX 350 compared to Sham at day 60 (p = 0.014). The response rates in the DEX 700 group were consistently higher than that in the DEX 350  group,  with  a  statistically  significant  difference  at  day  60  (p  =  0.038).  The  results  were  not significant  on  day  180.  Findings  for  BRVO  patients  in  the  PP  population  were  similar  to  the  ITT population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## CRVO

The proportion of CRVO patients in the ITT population with a BCVA improvement of 15 or more letters from  baseline  in  the  study  eye  was  lower  than  the  overall  population  for  the  DEX  700  group  but generally higher than the overall ITT population for the DEX 350 group. The proportion of patients with BCVA  improvement  of  15  or  more  letters  from  baseline  was  significantly  higher  with  DEX  350 compared to Sham at day 60 (p = 0.002) and day 90 (p = 0.025). There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX. Findings for CRVO patients in the PP population were similar to the ITT population.

## BCVA 15 or more letters improvement in patients with longer duration of macular oedema

The analysis was repeated excluding patients with duration of macular oedema less than 90 days in order  to  assess  the  impact  on  the  results  of  spontaneous  improvement  in  BCVA.  The  proportion  of patients with longer duration of macular oedema had similar BCVA improvement of 15 or more letters from  baseline  in  the  study  eye  as  the  ITT  population.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  BCVA improvement of 15 or more letters from baseline was significantly higher with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at initial treatment days 30, 60, and 90. The proportion was not significant for any of the groups at day 180. There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX. Overall, the results after excluding patients with shorter disease duration (&lt;90 days), which represent less than 20% of patients, showed consistent results to those seen in the overall study population.

## Time to 15 or more letters improvement in BCVA

The last amendment of the protocol establishes this as the primary endpoint for the FDA submission. Cumulative  response  rate  curves  were  significantly  different  for  the  DEX  700  and  DEX  350  groups compared to the Sham group (p ≤ 0.007). The response rates were consistently higher with DEX 700 and DEX 350 than with Sham, starting at initial treatment day 30. Rates were somewhat lower with DEX  350  compared  to  DEX  700,  although  the  difference  between  the  2  doses  was  not  statistically significant.

## Categorical change from baseline BCVA

The categorical change from baseline showed statistically significant better visual acuity in the study eye with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at days 30, 60 and 90.

## BCVA 10 or more letters improvement in ITT population

The proportion of patients with a BCVA improvement of 10 or more letters from baseline in the study eye for the ITT population is summarised in the following table:

## Mean change from baseline BCVA

In the ITT population, the mean changes from baseline BCVA number of letters read correctly in the study eye are summarised in the table below. Changes were significantly greater with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at initial treatment days 30, 60, and 90 (p ≤ 0.003), and peaked at day 60 with a difference of 6.4 mm Hg between DEX 700 and Sham, and 5.9 mm Hg between DEX 350 and Sham.  Mean  changes  from  baseline  were  consistently  greater  with  DEX  700  than  with  DEX  350, however the difference was not statistically significant.

For BRVO patients, mean changes from baseline BCVA number of letters read correctly in the study eye were significantly greater with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at initial treatment days 30, 60, 90 (p ≤ 0.018). Results were not significant on day 180. There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX.

For CRVO patients, mean changes from baseline BCVA number of letters read correctly in the study eye were significantly greater with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at initial treatment days 30, 60, and 90 (p ≤ 0.046),  and  with  DEX  350 compared to Sham at days 30 and 60 (p &lt;0.001). Results were not significant on day 180. There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX.

## Contrast sensitivity

At baseline, the mean number of letters read correctly in the study eye using contrast sensitivity was 26.6 in the DEX 700 group, 27.0 in the DEX 350 group, and 27.0 in the Sham group. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups at baseline or day 180.

## Retinal Thickness in ITT population and diagnostic subgroups

At day 90 in the ITT population, the mean decrease in retinal thickness was significantly greater with DEX 700 (-199.3 microns) and DEX 350 (-144.1 microns) compared to Sham (-78.2 microns), p &lt; 0.001, and with DEX 700 compared to DEX 350 (p = 0.002). There were no between-group differences at day 180. For BRVO patients, mean central retinal thickness in the 1 mm subfield in the study eye measured by OCT was significantly less with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at day 90, though not at day 180. There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX. For CRVO patients, mean  central  retinal  thickness  in  the  1  mm  subfield  in  the  study  eye  measured  by  OCT  was significantly  less  with  DEX  700  and  DEX  350  compared  to  Sham  (p ≤ 0.020),  and  with  DEX  700 compared to DEX 350 (p = 0.004) at day 90. There were no between-group differences at day 180.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Retinal volume measured by Optical Coherence Tomography

Retinal volume was significantly less with DEX 700 and DEX 350 compared to Sham at day 90 (p ≤ 0.006), though not at day 180. There were no differences between the 2 doses of DEX.

## Fluorescein Leakage

At initial treatment day 180, change from baseline in fluorescein leakage at the macula was improved from baseline for 50.8% (91/179) of patients in the DEX 700 group, 46.4% (85/183) in the DEX 350 group, and 40.2% (74/184) in the Sham group. The difference between the DEX 700 group and the Sham group was statistically significant, p = 0.023.

## · Ancillary analyses

Pharmacokinetic blood samples were collected from a total of 33 patients in the two pivotal trials. This included patients who  received  DEX  350,  DEX  700  or  sham.  Overall,  systemic  exposure  of dexamethasone was minimal though dose dependent in patients who received DEX treatment.

## · Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

A pooled analysis of both pivotal studies was presented by the applicant. Results of this analysis were consistent with the results of individual studies.

A  subgroup  analysis  according  to  macular  oedema  duration  was  also  presented.  For  patients  with macular oedema of less than 90 days duration, spontaneous improvement was seen in up to 30% of patients after 6 months follow up, showing in general better rates of response the in the overall ITT population. However, differences over sham at D90 and D180 were neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant. In the subgroup of patients with &gt;90 days duration, the overall benefit was lower to that  seen  in  acute  patients  and  differences  over  sham,  although  higher  than  those  seen  in  acute patients, were not clinically relevant after 2 months.

## · Clinical studies in special populations

The  applicant  did  not  submit  clinical  studies  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  dexamethasone  in  special populations.

## · Supportive studies

As  described  earlier  the  applicant  conducted  and  initially  submitted  the  results  from  several  studies (phase I-III) to evaluate the use of DEX PS DDS. The pivotal trials including the dose-ranging study have been discussed in detail in previous sections. The three studies listed below should therefore be seen as supportive.

- Study  DC103-07,  a  phase  2  study  to  test  the  safety  and  performance  of  the  DEX  PS  DDS applicator  system  compared  to  tableted  DEX  PS  DDS  in  patients  with  persistent  macular oedema. At baseline in study DC103-07, cataracts were reported for 78.9% of patients in the applicator group and 70% in the incision group. At day 180, cataracts were reported for 82.4% of patients in the applicator group and 80% in the incision group. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in the proportion of patients with cataracts at any visit.
- Studies 206207-010 and 206207-011 are 3-year, phase 3, multicentre, masked, randomized, sham-controlled trials  to  assess  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  700 μ g  and  350 μ g  DEX PS DDS applicator system in the treatment of patients with diabetic macular oedema. These studies are currently ongoing, and when completed will provide long-term safety data on DEX PS DDS. The final clinical study report for the 2 studies will be available in Q4 2013. During the procedure the  applicant  submitted  masked  interim  safety  results.  Although  the  DME  safety  data  at present are still masked, some observations could be made. From the masked results there is no  evidence  so  far,  that  the  incidence  of  increased  IOP  increases  with  the  second  or subsequent implantations. The incidence of increased IOP seems to peak after the first implant and then taper off, in contrast to cataracts where the incidence appears to increase with the number of implants. As part of a follow-up measure that applicant was requested to provide the  final  study  reports  of  the  studies  in  order  to  provide  assurance  on  the  long-term  safety (see section 2.7 of this report).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy

As  discussed  earlier  the  applicant  has  conducted  two  pivotal  phase  III  studies  (008  and  009)  to determine efficacy. The results were consistent in both studies and showed statistical significance on day 90, but not on day 180. Results of the open label extension were provided during the procedure.

The initial view of the CHMP was that the applicant had failed to robustly demonstrate efficacy in the two pivotal studies. Although study 008 was a successful study, the clinical relevance of the primary endpoint (90 days) was unclear to the CHMP. In response to this the applicant argued that both pivotal studies demonstrated substantial and clinically relevant efficacy and that day 90 is a clinically relevant time point. In the view of the applicant the intentions of the studies were to confirm the reduction of oedema as early and as much as possible and to reduce oedema for as long as possible to minimise the number of intravitreal injections. Therefore, although 15 letter improvement in visual acuity at 6 months was the development goal, it was not regarded by the applicant as the only definitive time point  for  a  single  dose  of  a  product  intended  to  treat  macular  oedema  resulting  from  retinal  vein occlusion. Rather 6 months was considered the maximum duration of effect estimated from the studies used to predict human ocular pharmacokinetics and the design limitations of an ocular implant of this type.  The  applicant  further  argued  as  the  proportion  of  DEX  700  patients  with  15  or  more  letters improvement from baseline BCVA was similar at day 180 (21.5%) to that seen at day 90 (21.8%), this would  show  that  the  treatment  effect  was  maintained.  Based  on  the  submitted  12-month  data  the applicant also believed that the benefit of early treatment with DEX 700 was confirmed and although treatment with DEX 700 in the second 6 months resulted in an increased response in the Sham/DEX 700 group, the rates never reached the improvements shown in the DEX 700/700 treatment group. The  applicant  therefore  concluded  that  early  treatment  with  DEX  700  is  important  to  achieving improved visual acuity. The CHMP acknowledged the applicant's view and agreed that it appears that patients treated with a second implant show a benefit in terms of improvement in visual acuity and prevention of visual acuity loss. However, as the applicant has not provided data on patients receiving more than 2 implants the CHMP requested that this was highlighted in the SPC and that, as part of a follow-up  measure,  the  applicant  should  perform  an  observational  study  to  provide  additional information on patients requiring more than 2 implants (see section 2.7 of this report).

Although efficacy  is  shown  at  early  time-points  such  as  60  and  90  days,  the  effect  appeared  to  be somewhat less pronounced by day 180. The results at 12 months after re-implantation at 6 months showed a similar pattern. However, the CHMP had some concerns following assessment of the data from patients who were followed-up to 12 months but did not receive a second implant. Efficacy for these patients seemed to be sustained, with patients in the Sham group reaching the same levels (or even  higher)  of  15  or  more  letters  improvement  from  baseline  BCVA.  The  applicant  was  therefore asked to comment on these results. The applicant provided a plausible explanation for the continuing response in patients receiving only one implant even after the initial 6 months. These were patients with a good response after the first implant that did not fulfil the criteria for re-implantation (BCVA, 84 letters or retinal thickness by OCT &gt;250 um and in the investigator's opinion the procedure would not put  the  patients  at  significant  risk).  The  SPC  therefore  includes  a  clarification  that  patients  who respond well should not be re-implanted until visual acuity starts to deteriorate. The impact of delaying treatment on visual loss was further discussed by the applicant. A statistically significant number of patients  who  initially  received  Sham  followed  by  DEX  700  showed ≥ 15-letter  worsening  in  BCVA compared  to  patients  receiving  two  DEX  700  implants.  The  majority  of  patients  benefited  from treatment  with  DEX  700  in  terms  of  improvement  in  visual  acuity  or  prevention  of  visual  loss; furthermore given that it is impossible to identify patients who may improve spontaneously deferring treatment may not be appropriate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP initially also had concerns regarding the fact that the 12 month efficacy data do not seam to offer reassurance that patients benefit from a second implant. There was limited evidence that patients benefit from a second or further implants and although at early time-points of 60 and 90 days there was  statistically  significant  improvement  in  the  primary  endpoint,  there  was  limited  evidence  that patients benefit from this treatment in the long term. Furthermore, given that the second implant lead to an increase in IOP and cataracts it was not clear to the Committee that the risk/benefit of additional implants  was  considered  positive.  The  applicant  was  therefore  requested  to  discuss  this  further.  In addition to the response that the applicant provided with regards to the CHMP question on the efficacy results  from the pivotal studies, the applicant further explained that the majority of patients (80%) were eligible for re-treatment at day 180. These patients demonstrated similar response to the first implantation with greater changes on days 30, 60 and 90 as seen during the first period. As far as mean  change  from  baseline  in  IOP  was  concerned,  the  pattern  following  the  second  injection  was similar to that of the first. Increases in IOP peaked at day 60 and returned to baseline levels by day 180.  There  was  no  evidence  of  accumulation  after  the  second  implantation.  Most  importantly  the majority of patients did not require treatment or were managed with topical IOP-lowering medications.

In addition to the CHMP queries on the clinical relevance, the CHMP also requested the applicant to try to  more  clearly  identify  a  patient  population  that  could  clearly  benefit  from  the  treatment  (i.e. according  to  the  duration  of  macular  oedema).  From  the  re-analyses  provided  by  the  applicant  in response  to  this  CHMP  request,  it  appeared  to  the  CHMP  that  patients  with  a  duration  for  macular oedema of more than 6 months at baseline, benefit more from treatment and results for this group were statistically significant at day 90 and day 180. This could be attributed to the fact that patients with  macular  oedema  of  less  than  6  months  are  more  likely  to  improve  spontaneously.  The  CHMP therefore  requested  the  applicant  to  explain  whether  efficacy  is  sustained  for  these  patients  in  the open label extension. The applicant was also requested to provide data for patients with duration of macular oedema at baseline of more than 6 months at the end of the open label extension for both patients  who  were  re-implanted  and  those  who  did  not  receive  a  second  implant.  In  response  the applicant provided analyses of BCVA stratified by duration of macular oedema at baseline ( ≤ 180 days and &gt; 180 days) for the re-treated  and  single  treatment  populations.  In  the  re-treated  population, statistically significant treatment-group differences were observed at initial treatment days 30 and 60 in  patients  with  duration ≤ 180  days  or  duration  &gt;  180  days.  The  statistically  significant  difference seen at day 90 in the patients with duration &gt; 180 days relates to a lower Sham response rather than an  improved  effect  in  patients  treated  with  DEX.  In  the  single  treatment  population,  statistically significant differences were (as for the re-treated population) driven by the Sham response rates, while the DEX response was similar among patients with duration ≤ 180 days or duration &gt; 180 days. DEX response  rates  also  appeared  to  be  similar  at  all  time  points  in  the  open-label  extension  for  both patient subgroups, with a suggestion of a higher response in those patients with duration of macular oedema ≤ 180  days.  Based  on  the  data  provided  by  the  applicant  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the patterns were similar for patients with long standing macular oedema and those with disease of shorter duration with regards to the mean change in BCVA from baseline and therefore it would not be possible to  characterise  a  subset  of  patient  that  would  be  benefiting  the  most  based  on  duration  of  existing macular oedema.

In a further attempt to identify a patient population that could clearly benefit from the treatment with DEX  700  the  CHMP  highlighted  that  despite  not  being  authorised  for  the  claimed  indication,  these patients are not left untreated and some other therapeutic alternatives are usually tested with some degree of success. The possible place in therapeutic of Ozurdex was therefore somewhat difficult for the CHMP to understand. The CHMP therefore requested the applicant to explore whether there is a subset of patients who could potentially benefit from Ozurdex in the light of the available treatments. The  applicant  argued  that  despite  the  burden  of  the  disease,  there  are  currently  no  licensed pharmacologic  therapies  and  no  agreed  standard  of  care  for  macular  oedema  caused  by  BRVO  and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

CRVO. Treatment strategies used by ophthalmologists are based on clinical practices that have become established  over  time,  but  which  have  not  been  founded  on  level  1  evidence  (Parodi,  2004).  An evaluation of the 3 most commonly used therapeutic interventions, ie, laser photocoagulation, off-label use of VEGF inhibitors and corticosteroids, was included in the applicant's response. The most relevant historical comparator for DEX 700 is triamcinolone acetonide, which is also the therapy for which most published data are available. Based on the applicant's response, the CHMP concluded that comparable efficacy of DEX 700 to triamcinolone was shown from the comparison of the pivotal studies 008 and 009 to the published results of the SCORE study, but with a more favourable safety profile for DEX 700. Although this comparison is limited by the differences in the designs of the trials, it offers some insight on where DEX 700 can be placed in the therapeutic regimen, taking also into account the fact that there are currently no licensed treatments for the treatment of macular oedema secondary to BRVO or CRVO.

In a follow-up question to this the applicant was requested by the CHMP to further characterise those patients who could potentially benefit from repeated doses and translated into a clinical recommendation in the SPC. The applicant subsequently performed further  analyses to help predict which  patients  would  respond  following  re-treatment.  These  analyses  demonstrated  an  additional prognostic  characteristic  of  reduction  in  prior  BCVA  response  by  greater  than  5  letters.  This  was subsequently proposed by the applicant to be included in the SPC.

Based on the applicant's responses to the concerns discussed above, the CHMP concluded that the data presented in  patients  treated  with  a  second  implant  -  even  those  initially  randomised  to  Sham  and subsequently treated with a DEX 700 implant at 6 months - show a significant benefit to patients in terms of improvement in visual acuity and prevention of visual acuity loss. Furthermore, increase in IOP  was  easily  managed  and  there  was  no  evidence  of  accumulation.  Although,  the  applicant  has defined in the proposed SPC the criteria for re-implantation, the CHMP recommended that the criteria for re-treatment should be based on current clinical practice, as in clinical practice retinal thickness by OCT assessment is not routinely used to guide treatment, and reflect the re-treatment criteria in the clinical  studies.  The applicant's proposal for re-treatment was not considered to be based on clinical trial  requirements  or  on  clinical  practice  recommendations.  However,  the  proposal  to  include  the criteria as established in the clinical trials was not entirely supported. Instead, the CHMP proposed that the  criteria  for  retreatment  should  be  when  patients  have  responded  to  treatment  and  then experienced a loss in visual acuity and in the physician's opinion may benefit from retreatment, which reflect the re-treatment criteria utilised in the clinical studies. With regards to the minimum interval of treatments, the CHMP requested that this should be in line with the clinical studies, i.e. that there is only very limited experience of intervals less then 6 months. In conclusion the CHMP recommended that section 4.2 of the SPC, in relation to repeat doses, should read as follows:

'The recommended dose is one OZURDEX implant to be administered intra-vitreally to the affected eye. Administration to both eyes concurrently is not recommended (see section 4.4).

Repeat doses should be considered when a patient experiences a response to treatment followed subsequently by a loss in visual acuity and in the physician's opinion may benefit from retreatment without being exposed to significant risk (see section 5.1).

Patients who experience and retain improved vision should not be retreated. Patients who experience a deterioration in vision, which is not slowed by OZURDEX, should not be retreated.

There is only very limited information on repeat dosing intervals less than 6 months (see section 5.1). There is currently no experience of repeat administrations beyond 2 implants in Retinal Vein Occlusion.

Patients should be monitored following the injection to permit early treatment if an infection or increased intraocular pressure occurs (see section 4.4).'

## 2.4.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

The provided data indicate that there is a maintained effect lasting up to 6 month but not thereafter with regards to improvement in visual acuity following treatment with Ozurdex in adult patients with macular  oedema  following  either  Branch  Retinal  Vein  Occlusion  (BRVO)  or  Central  Retinal  Vein Occlusion (CRVO). These results were replicated following administration of a second implant. Patients with long standing macular oedema and those with disease of shorter duration have similar response patterns. As the criteria for re-implantation have been clearly defined in the SPC and the applicant has committed to provide additional  efficacy  data  following  administration  of  more  then  2  implants,  the CHMP considered the efficacy of Ozurdex sufficiently established.

## 2.4.8.  Clinical safety

The focus of the safety evaluation in this submission is based on data from the two pivotal phase III trials  (008 and 009) performed in the claimed indication. Supportive safety data from other Phase I and phase II studies and a phase III study in uveitis which terminated early due to slow enrolment, were also provided.

## · Patient exposure

Overall, safety data for DEX PS DDS were collected from nine clinical studies including 2114 patients. In the two main pivotal trials approximately 401 patients completed a 6-month initial treatment period under the dose intended for MA (DEX PS DDS 700). In addition, data from 477 patients (re-treated population) who received a second administration of DEX PS DDS 700 in the open-label extension, and completed  1-year  of  follow-up  after  the  initial  treatment  and  from  118  who  received  only  one treatment at baseline (single treatment population) but were followed up to 12 months have also been provided.

Report DC103-04 includes data from single-patient studies DC103-02 and DC103-03, as well as DC103-04.

Masked data from ongoing studlies 206207-010 and 206207-011 can not be included in the exposure counts.

b One patient was treated in both eyes,1 patient had 2 insertions, and1 patient had 3insertions; 1 patient was lost to follow-up,had minimal data, and was not included in the database, tables or listings.

To allow for a relatively straightforward assessment of the safety data, the presentation of common AEs,  Ocular  AEs  and  SAEs  will  primarily  focus  on  the  pivotal  phase  III  trials,  mainly  showing  data reported for the final intended dose (DEX 700).

## · Adverse events

The overall incidence of adverse events during the initial treatment period was 72.4% for the patients receiving DEX 700. For the retreated patients the incidence of adverse events was between 80.1% and 87.2% depending on the initial treatment. The detailed figures are provided in the tables below.

## Non-ocular AEs

The most common non-ocular events reported were influenza 9 (2.1%) DEX 700 vs 2 (0.5%) Sham,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

headache 14 (3.3%) DEX 700 vs 7 (1.7%) Sham and hypertension 17 (4.0%) DEX 700 vs 15 (3.5%) Sham. Thus, so far, for systemic adverse reactions, no specific pattern indicating safety risks with the active treatment was revealed.

## Ocular AEs

## Initial treatment

The overall incidence of ocular adverse events in the study eye during the initial treatment was; 62.9% for DEX 700, 61.9% for DEX 350 and 42.8% for Sham treatment respectively.

The most frequently reported events in patients who received DEX 700 were increased IOP (25.2 %) and  conjunctival  haemorrhage  (20.2  %).  Ocular  adverse  events  related  to  the  insertion  procedure included  conjunctival  haemorrhage,  conjunctival  hyperaemia,  eye  pain,  vitreous  haemorrhage  and conjunctival oedema, which are reported generally occurring soon after the injection procedure.

Specific  recommendations  have  been  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SPC  regarding  monitoring  for elevation in intraocular pressure and for endophtalmitis after the intravitreal injection procedure. These include  monitoring  of  perfusion  of  the  optic  nerve  head  immediately  after  the  injection,  tonometry within 30 minutes following the injection, and biomicroscopy between two and seven days following the injection.

## Open-label extension

During the open label extension, the adverse event profile was similar among the 3 treatment groups, each  of  whom  had  received  DEX  700  as  their  second  injection.  The  incidences  of  cataracts  and subcapsular  cataracts  however  were  higher  in  the  second  6  months  following  re-treatment.  The incidence of intraocular pressure increased was comparable between patients receiving either 1 or 2 doses of DEX. The incidence of intraocular pressure increased was 32.6% in the DEX 700/700 group and 36.2% in the DEX 350/700 group compared to 28.1% in the Sham/DEX 700 group.

The incidence of AEs did not differ in a meaningful way considering subgroups based on age (mid-age 45  to  65  years  and  &gt;  65  years),  sex,  race  (Caucasians,  non-Caucasians),  iris  colour  and  baseline diagnosis  (macular  oedema  due  to  CRVO  or  due  to  BRVO).  The  incidence  of  increased  intraocular pressure was however higher in younger patients &lt;45 years. Although patients under 45 represented only a small number of patients included in the studies (5%) not enabling a firm conclusion to be made, CHMP recommended that this information should be included in the special warnings of section 4.4 of the SPC.

## · Serious adverse event and deaths

## Deaths

There  was  1  death  during  the  initial  treatment  period  in  study  009  and  3  deaths  during  the  initial treatment period in study 008. Two deaths were due to myocardial infarction, one due to cardiac arrest and one accidental drowning. There was also 1 death in study 009 and 1 death in study 008 in the retreated population. These are in addition to the deaths reported for the 6-month safety population. There  were  no  additional  deaths  during  the  6-month  extension  for  the  12-month  single  treatment population.  None  of  the  deaths  were  considered  to  be  related  to  study  treatment.  6  patients  died during  study  DC103-06.  None  of  these  deaths  were  considered  to  be  related  to  study  treatment. Deaths were due to drowning, brain damage, cerebrovascular accidents, metastatic prostate cancer, respiratory arrest, acute myeloid leukaemia.

## Serious adverse events in the phase III studies

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The overall incidence of serious adverse events in the initial treatment period for the pooled phase 3 studies was 5.0% (21/421) in the DEX 700 group, 6.6% (27/412) in the DEX 350 group, and 5.9% (25/423) in the Sham group. One additional Sham patient developed a recurrence of melanoma in the right axilla which met the criteria for a serious event but was reported as non serious. The rates of ocular serious events and non-ocular serious events were similar among the 3 treatment groups. None of  the  serious  adverse  events  was  related  to  treatment  with  the  following  exceptions:  ocular hypertension in the study eye (1 DEX 700) and intraocular pressure increased in the study eye (1 DEX 700 and 3 DEX 350).

The overall cumulative incidence of serious adverse events during the 12-month treatment period for the pooled phase 3 studies (re-treated population) was 9.4% in the DEX 700/700 group, 8.2% in the DEX 350/700 group, and 10.7% in the Sham/DEX 700 group. The serious adverse event profile was similar between the 3 treatment groups. Four of the serious events in the re-treated population were considered by the investigator to be related to the study treatments. Three were intraocular pressure increased (one in each group) and one was retinal detachment (in DEX 700/700).

The  cumulative  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  during  the  12-month  treatment  period  for  the pooled phase 3 studies (single treated population) was 10.0% in the DEX 700 group, 10.8% in the DEX 350  group,  and  10.4%  in  the  Sham  group.  Five  of  the  serious  events  in  the  single  treatment population  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  the  study  treatments.  Ocular hypertension  and  IOP  in  DEX  700  group,  two  cases  of  IOP  in  the  DEX  350  group  and  one  corneal disorder in the Sham group.

## · Laboratory findings

According  to  protocol,  standard  clinical  laboratory  data  were  not  collected  in  the  clinical  safety  and efficacy studies.

## · Safety in special populations

The analyses of adverse event rates did not identify any patient characteristics that would indicate a need  to  individualise  therapy  or  patient  management  because  of  safety  considerations.  The  same pattern was seen in each demographic subgroup of higher incidences with DEX than Sham for selected events (e.g. increased intraocular pressure), and no difference between the 700 and 350 μ g  doses. There  were  no  demographic  patterns  among  the  serious  adverse  events  or  discontinuations  due  to adverse events.

## Use in pregnancy and lactation

Safety for use in pregnancy and lactation has not been established. Dexamethasone has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and rabbits following topical ophthalmic application. There was 1 live birth without complications associated with the initial treatment period of the phase 3 study 009. There were no pregnancies associated with the initial treatment period of the phase 3 study 008.

## Overdose

Overdose has not been reported in clinical trials. The applicant explains that overdose is unlikely as the DEX PS DDS applicator system is administered by a physician.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No interaction studies have been performed, however due to the low systemic levels of dexamethasone, drug interactions are not expected. In the analyses of the initial treatment period for the  pooled  phase  3  studies,  there  was  no  evidence  of  drug-drug  interactions.  However,  specific

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analyses to identify such interactions were not conducted. As expected, many of the patients in these studies  were  using  multiple  concomitant  medications,  such  as  proton  pump  inhibitors,  systemic antihypertensives, anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic agents, lipid modifying agents, and analgesics.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

Notable, less than 2% of patients in each treatment group, withdrew from the initial treatment period of the phase III studies due to adverse events. None of the events were considered to be related to the study treatment with the exception of 2 patients receiving DEX 350 who reported intraocular pressure increased in the study eye.

Adverse events leading to discontinuation in the re-treated population for the pooled phase 3 studies were reported for 1.2% (4/341) in the DEX 700/700 group, 0.9% (3/329) in the DEX 350/700 group, and 0.9% (3/327) in the Sham/DEX 700 group. Adverse events led to discontinuation in the single treatment population for 8.8% (7/80) of patients in the DEX 700 group, 9.6% (8/83) in the DEX 350 group, and 9.4% (9/96) in the Sham group. In the single treatment group, all discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in the initial 6-month treatment period, with the exception of one Patient in the Sham group.

## · Post marketing experience

There are no post-marketing exposure data for DEX PS DDS 700 μ g as the product has not been licensed for any indication.

## 2.5. Discussion on clinical safety

In both pivotal studies during the first 6 months of treatment, the majority of patients (72%) in the active treatment groups (both doses DEX PS DDS 700 and DEX PS DDS 350) experienced at least one AE. Overall the incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in the DEX groups compared to Sham. Ocular adverse events were more commonly reported with DEX 700 and DEX 350 than with Sham. The most frequently reported adverse events were Increased Intraocular Pressure (IOP): DEX 106 (25.2%) vs. Sham 5 (1.2%), Conjunctival haemorrhage: DEX 85 (20.2%) vs. Sham 63 (14.9%), Eye pain: DEX 31 (7.4%) vs. Sham 16 (3.8%), Conjunctival hyperaemia: DEX 28 (6.7%) vs. Sham 20 (4.7%) , Ocular Hypertension: DEX 17 (4%) vs. Sham 3 (0.7%) and Cataract: DEX 15 (3.6%) vs. Sham 6 (1.4%). Most complications were reported as self-limited.

The overall incidence of serious adverse events in the initial treatment period for the pooled phase III studies was 5.0% (21/421) in the DEX 700 group, 6.6% (27/412) in the DEX 350 group, and 5.9% (25/423)  in  the  Sham  group.  Discontinuations  in  the  study  eye  were  mainly  due  to  increased intraocular pressure.

The percentage of subjects who experienced any adverse event in the study eye generally increased over time after the second DEX 700 device implantation (i.e. All AEs Initial treatment Period 79% vs. Open Label Extension 85%). As far as mean change from baseline in IOP was concerned, the pattern following the second injection was similar to that of the first. Increases in IOP peaked at day 60 and returned  to  baseline  levels  by  day  180.  There  was  no  evidence  of  accumulation  after  the  second implantation.  Most  importantly  the  majority  of  patients  did  not  require  treatment  or  were  managed with topical IOP-lowering medications.

The safety profile of DEX PS DDS in patients with macular oedema due to CRVO and BRVO did not show any unexpected signal related with the administration technique or the drug. With a few notable exceptions, the occurrence of non-serious ocular AEs following intravitreal DEX administration does not raise  any  major concern. One such exception is the appearance of IOP increases reported in nearly

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

25% of actively  treated  participants  in  the  pivotal  programme.  It  is  emphasised  that  only  a  few  of these patients were in need of acute medical and surgical intervention and warnings are appropriately included in section 4.4 of the SPC.

## 2.6. Conclusions on the clinical safety

As expected for an intravitreal corticosteroid implant, an increased incidence of ocular adverse events such as cataracts and increased IOP was observed, these were however manageable and only a few patients were in need of acute interventions.

## 2.7. Pharmacovigilance

## 2.7.1.  Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## 2.7.2  Risk management plan

The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan. The updated version of the Risk Management Plan has taken into account the comments and recommendations and was considered to be acceptable by the CHMP.

## · User consultation

The applicant has submitted results from user testing of the package leaflet, which was performed in English. Overall, the user test is found acceptable. The results demonstrated a sufficient percentage of identification  and  comprehension  of  product  related  information.  Therefore,  the  package  leaflet  was considered to be in line with the current readability requirements.

## 2.7.3.  Benefit-risk balance

The proposed product is a dexamethasone intravitreal implant intended for the treatment of macular oedema due to branch or central retinal vein occlusion.

## · Benefits

Limited pharmacokinetic information is available and this was derived from pharmacokinetic evaluations conducted in a small number of patients in the pivotal phase III studies. These indicated that systemic exposure is low.

The applicant has conducted a number of clinical studies in various indications. Two were relevant to this application.

The  studies  (008  and  009)  which  were  identical  in  design,  were  six-month  randomised,  shamcontrolled with a 6-month open label extension, assessing the safety and efficacy of 700 microgram and 350 microgram implant in patients with macular oedema due to Branch or Central Retinal Vein Occlusion. The primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of patients with a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improvement of 15 or more letters from baseline in the study eye at 180 days. In study 008,  this  was,  subsequently,  modified  to  90  days.  The  results  were  consistent  in  both  studies  and showed  statistical  significance  on  day  90,  but  not  on  day  180.  The  results  from  the  open  label extension from patients receiving a second implant at 6 months, showed a similar pattern.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Beneficial effects

A statistically significant improvement in visual acuity was demonstrated in patients receiving the 700 microgram implant. This was replicated following a second implantation. Furthermore, a statistically significant  number  of  patients  who  initially  received  Sham  followed  by  DEX  700  showed ≥ 15-letter worsening  in  BCVA  compared  to  patients  receiving  two  DEX  700  implants.  The  majority  of  patients benefited  from  treatment  with  DEX  700  in  terms  of  improvement  in  visual  acuity  or  prevention  of visual loss.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.

There is a lack of experience with repeat administration (more than 2 implantations).

## · Risks

The  most  commonly  observed  adverse  events  were  increased  intraocular  pressure,  cataracts  and adverse  events  related  to  the  procedure  of  intravitreal  injection  such  as  conjunctival  haemorrhage, conjunctival oedema and hyperaemia, eye pain and vitreous haemorrhage.

The adverse event pattern was similar following re-implantation. The majority of patients presenting with increased IOP did not require surgical intervention and were treated conservatively.

## Unfavourable effects

The  most  commonly  observed  adverse  events  are  increased  IOP  and  cataracts.  These  are  well recognised complications following administration of intravitreal corticosteroids and adequate warnings in the SPC are included.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

As with efficacy, there is lack of experience with repeat administration. An observational study as a follow up measure has been requested in patients requiring a second or subsequent implant due to deteriorating  visual  acuity  with  the  aim  of  collecting  long  term  outcome  and  safety  data  in  such patients.

## · Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Improvement in visual acuity and prevention of visual loss are extremely important clinical outcomes to patients with macular oedema due to BRVO and CRVO. The clinical studies submitted in support of this application have demonstrated a significant effect on these outcomes. Although, as expected for an intravitreal corticosteroid implant, an increased incidence of ocular adverse events such as cataracts and increased IOP was observed, these were manageable.

## Benefit-risk balance

An overall clinically relevant and statistically significant efficacy was demonstrated. Although there was an increase in ocular adverse events in the implanted eyes compared to the sham group, these in most cases were easily managed.

## · Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

The provided data indicate that there is a maintained effect up to 6 month, but not thereafter, with regards to visual acuity and prevention of visual loss in treatment with Ozurdex in adult patients with macular  oedema  following  either  Branch  Retinal  Vein  Occlusion  (BRVO)  or  Central  Retinal  Vein Occlusion  (CRVO).  These  efficacy  results  were  replicated  following  a  second  implant.  Furthermore,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

increase  in  IOP  was  easily  managed  and  there  was  no  evidence  of  accumulation.  The  implant  is administered through a needle with minimal trauma to the eye and slowly releases dexamethasone into  the  vitreous  with  effects  lasting  up  to  6  months,  preventing  the  need  for  frequent  intravitreal injections which can increase the risk for complications.

## · Risk management plan

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that:

- pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns.
- the following additional risk minimisation activities were required:

The MAH shall ensure that, at launch, all physicians who are expected to prescribe/use Ozurdex are provided with a physician information pack containing the following:

The physician information should contain the following key elements:

- The Summary of Product Characteristics
- Aseptic techniques to minimise the risk of infection
- Use of antibiotics
- Techniques for the intravitreal injection
- Patient monitoring after IVT injection
- Key signs and symptoms of IVT injection related adverse events including increased intraocular pressure,  glaucoma,  ocular  hypertension,  cataract,  traumatic  cataract  related  to  injection technique, vitreous detachment, vitreous haemorrhage, endophthalmitis, mechanical failure of device and implant misplacement
- Management of IVT injection related adverse events

The patient information pack should be provided in both the form of a patient information booklet and an audio-CD that contain following key elements:

- Patient information leaflet
- How to prepare for OZURDEX treatment
- What are the steps following treatment with OZURDEX
- Key  signs  and  symptoms  of  serious  adverse  events  including  increased  intraocular  pressure and ocular hypertension
- When to seek urgent attention from their health care provider

Prior  to  launch  in  each  Member  State  the  MAH  shall  agree  the  final  educational  material  with  the National Competent Authority.

## 2.7.4. Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Ozurdex  in  the  treatment  of  of  adult  patients  with  macular  oedema following either Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) or Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
