## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Actinic keratosis (AK) is an ultraviolet-light-induced lesion of the skin that can remain unchanged, resolve without further treatment or may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. It is by far the most common lesion with malignant potential to arise on the skin. AK is mostly seen in fair-skinned persons on skin areas that have had long-term sun exposure (Salasche, 2000). Regions with higher ultraviolet exposure have a higher prevalence of AK. In Europe, a prevalence of 15% in men and 6% in women has been documented. Over the age of 70 years, 34% of men and 18% of women were found to have AK (Memon et al, 2000). Following topical application of ALA (5-aminolevulinic acid), the substance is metabolized to PpIX, a photoactive compound which accumulates intracellularly in the treated actinic keratosis lesions. PpIX is activated by illumination with red light of a suitable wavelength and energy. In the presence of oxygen, reactive oxygen species are formed. The latter causes damage to cellular components and eventually destroys the target cells. Red-light illumination was chosen since light with longer wave lengths penetrates deeper into the tissue.

Treatment for AK is chosen based on several aspects such as age of the patient at diagnosis, previous occurrence of skin cancer, presence of the lesion(s), and the patient's tolerability of the treatment. The treatment options consist of either surgical destruction for well-defined lesions of the skin, topical medicinal products and photodynamic therapy. Current medicinal products approved for AK include 5fluorouracil, imiquimod and ingenol mebutate. PDT requires 3 components: (1) a photosensitizer, (2) light with a sufficient amount of energy at a suitable spectrum of wavelengths, and (3) oxygen. In PDT light energy is transferred by the photosensitizer to oxygen, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS oxidize cell membranes and other cellular compounds, causing necrosis or apoptosis of targeted cells. Ameluz (with 5-aminolevulinic acid as active ingredient) belongs to the pharmacological class of medications called 'photodynamic therapy photosensitizers'.

BF-200 ALA 10% (Ameluz) is a non-sterile, topical formulation of 10% 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride in a gel-matrix with nanoemulsion. BF-200 ALA 10% contains 10% ALA as hydrochloride salt, equaling 7.8% of the free acid. BF-200 ALA 10% is used in combination with red light photodynamic therapy. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a delta-amino acid and occurs as an endogenous molecule of the heme biosynthesis pathway in almost every cell in humans, animals and plants. ALA functions as a pro-drug and is metabolized to the photoactive substance protoporphyrinIX (PpIX) in mitochondria. PpIX, a photoactive compound, accumulates intracellularly in the treated actinic keratosis lesions. PpIX is activated by illumination with red light of a suitable wavelength and energy. In the presence of oxygen, reactive oxygen species are formed. The latter cause damage of cellular components and eventually destroys the target cells. Many actinic keratoses do not appear solitarily but in an area exceeding 4 cm2 (field cancerization). Field cancerization describes areas including actinic keratosis lesions and chronically photo-damaged fields. Data from a new phase III trial (ALAAK-CT007) is provided to support the efficacy and safety of the treatment in patients with AK and field cancerisation.

The MAH has applied for an extension of the indication as follows:

Ameluz is indicated for treatment of actinic keratoses of mild to moderate intensity severity on the face and scalp (Olsen grade 1 to 2; see section 5.1) and of field cancerization.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

One session of photodynamic therapy should be administered for single or multiple lesions or entire fields with cancerization. Actinic keratosis lesions or fields should be evaluated three months after treatment. Treated lesions or fields that have not completely resolved after 3 months shall be retreated.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new relevant non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The MAH did not submit an ERA. The extended indication is not expected to lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of 5-aminolevulinic acid. Hence, the extension of the indication is not likely to pose a significant risk to the environment.  5-aminolevulinic acid should be used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC in order to minimise any potential risks to the environment. Therefore, a standard disposal advice was updated in section 6.6 of the SmPC to add the following wording 'Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements'.

## 2.2.2. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The lack of non-clinical data to support the extension of the indication is acceptable as the condition and patient population is the same and the indication has not substantially changed. Therefore, no update to section 5.3 of the SmPC was proposed. The SmPC has been updated in section 6.6 concerning the disposal of the product in accordance with local requirements.

## 2.2.3. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The justification for not submitting an ERA in this application is acceptable as the data suggest that there will be no significant increase in environmental exposure to 5-aminolevulinic acid as the target population in the indication is the same as previously. Hence, 5-aminolevulinic acid is not expected to pose an increased risk to the environment. The lack of non-clinical studies is considered justified.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

## GCP

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. A GCPInspection in centre 03 with no critical and major findings was performed on 8 Apr to 9 Apr 2015 by the Regional Administrative Authority, Munich (Germany).

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacokinetics

## Absorption

Study ALA-AK-CT006: A single center, non-randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled, fixed sequence Phase I study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in 12 patients with actinic keratosis following topical application of a gel formulation containing 78 mg/g ALA (Ameluz) under maximal use conditions when using photodynamic therapy.

The primary objective of the study was to obtain baseline-adjusted plasma concentrations-time curves for ALA and its metabolic product protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) after a single treatment with ALA in patients with actinic keratosis under maximal use conditions.

The secondary objectives of the study included:

- Evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters of ALA: AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ , and Cmax derived from baselineadjusted plasma concentrations (if data permitted).
- Evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters of ALA: tmax, t1/2 , and λ z derived from unadjusted plasma concentrations (if data permitted) because baseline-adjustment had no influence on these estimates.
- Assessment of safety and tolerability of ALA under maximal use conditions

Patients were included with a confirmed actinic keratosis of mild to moderate intensity (Olson Grade 1 and 2) between 18 and 85 years (inclusive) with at least 10 actinic keratosis lesions on face or forehead in a total topical treatment area of approximately 20 cm 2  with a maximum of 2 illumination areas with each lesion being not more than 2 mm thick and having a side margin of at least 5 mm.

ALA was applied topically as a film of approximately 1 mm thickness over the treatment area of approximately 20 cm². Each patient received a photodynamic therapy after application of placebo (Period 1) and after application of ALA (Period 2) with a washout period of 7 days.

The primary endpoint was baseline-adjusted plasma concentrations of ALA and PpIX that were used for obtaining baseline corrected plasma concentrations-time curves. The secondary endpoints were baseline-adjusted AUC0-t, baseline-adjusted AUC0-∞ , baseline-adjusted Cmax, tmax, t1/2 , and λ z of ALA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Further endpoints analysed were baseline-adjusted AUC0-t, baseline-adjusted AUC0-∞ , baselineadjusted Cmax, tmax, t1/2 , and λ z of PpIX and the following pharmacokinetic characteristics were determined unadjusted Cmax and baseline-adjusted tmax of ALA and PpIX. Safety was assessed by evaluating physical examination, blood pressure and pulse rate, 12-lead electrocardiogram, local and overall tolerability, pain assessment, safety laboratory and adverse events.

All patients showed ALA concentrations above LLOQ at all sampling time points. In most of the patients ALA was systemically absorbed, i.e., an obvious increase of ALA concentrations was observed after application of the ALA gel compared to baseline and the placebo gel. Maximum geometric mean ALA concentrations were reached at 3 h after application. There was low systemic absorption; the geometric mean of Cmax was about 2.5 times of the geometric mean of baseline concentrations (41.18 ng/mL vs 17.28 ng/mL). Baseline-adjusted maximum concentrations (Cmax) were 4.47 ng/ml (range 1.4 - 6.94 ng/ml) following placebo and 21.56 ng/ml (range 4.76 - 77.53 ng/ml) following Ameluz. Thereafter, ALA was eliminated quickly from plasma returning to approximate baseline levels within 10 h after application. Baseline-adjusted total (AUC0-t) and maximum (Cmax) exposure to ALA was increased after application of the ALA gel compared to the placebo gel.

In one patient baseline concentrations of ALA were about 3-fold higher in Period 2 compared to Period 1 (placebo gel). Descriptive statistics of plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of ALA excluding this patient showed similar results as compared to the analysis including this patient. There was only little systemic absorption, geometric mean of Cmax was about 2.5 times of the geometric mean of baseline concentrations (with and without the outlier patient).

## PpIX

Concentrations of metabolite PpIX were generally low in all patients. Four patients showed concentrations BLLQ at all post-dose sampling time points. Most of the other patients showed concentrations BLLQ incidentally. In none of the patients, an obvious difference of PpIX concentrations was observed after application of the ALA gel compared to baseline and the placebo gel, i.e. metabolism of ALA to PpIX was not increased under maximal use conditions.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

The study ALA-AK-CT006 is deemed adequate in terms of the overall study design, PK measures and the patients selected patients.  ALA was systemically absorbed, i.e., baseline-adjusted total (AUC0-t) and  maximum  (Cmax)  exposure  to  ALA  was  increased  after  application  of  Ameluz  compared  to  the vehicle. Maximum concentrations were observed at 3 h after application and systemic absorption was low.  Thereafter,  ALA  was  eliminated  quickly  from  plasma  returning  to  approximate  baseline  levels within 10 h after application. In addition, concentrations of metabolite PpIX were also found to be low in  all  patients.  The  MAH  provided  literature  data  which  supported  the  overall  conclusions  (data  not shown). Hence, the SmPC section 5.2 has been updated with information that with the maximal use of Ameluz, plasma concentration of Ameluz was still within the normal range of reported endogenous ALA concentrations.

## 2.3.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology

There is no relevant increase to the plasma concentration of either ALA or PpIX when the product is used at maximal concentration. Considering that treatment of AK according to the new indication will cover a wider surface area, with potentially repeated use, this information confirms that there should be no potential implications derived by the exposure based on the extended use of the product. This information has been adequately reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC.

## Treatments

BF-200 ALA packed in tubes (two tubes per patient) were assigned to allow for retreatment, if necessary. Each tube was sufficient to cover 1-2 fields of approximately 20 cm 2 in total. The treatment field(s) were prepared for drug application by degreasing (using ethanol or isopropanol) and subsequently removing all scabs, crusts, and hyperkeratotic parts (using curettage). ALA was applied over 1-2 fields of approximately 20 cm 2 in total, allowed to dry for approximately 10 minutes, and covered with occlusive tape material for 3 h. Thereafter, any remnants of the applied formulation were removed carefully and PDT illumination using the BF-RhodoLED lamp was administered. Patients with non-responding AK lesions were retreated with the same medication after 12 weeks.

A placebo (a nanoemulsion gel formulation but without the active ingredient) was assigned to each patient, and administered in the same way as the BF-200 ALA.

Planned duration was 1 day to 12 weeks: BF-200 ALA or placebo was administered for the first PDT session (PDT-1) after all screening procedures had been performed. A second PDT session (PDT-2) with BF-200 ALA or placebo was performed 12 weeks later if there were lesions that were not completely cleared.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For all patients, 2 FU visits at 6 and 12 months after the last PDT were scheduled.

## Objectives

The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of BF-200 ALA with placebo for the field-directed treatment of mild to moderate actinic keratosis (AK) with PDT when using the BF-RhodoLED lamp.

The secondary objectives were: To evaluate the safety and secondary efficacy parameters related to BF-200 ALA for field-directed treatment of AK with PDT when using the BF-RhodoLED lamp in a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group (2:1 ratio) with 84 patients were planned to be randomized.

## Outcomes/endpoints

Primary efficacy endpoint:  Overall patient complete response (complete clearance of all treated lesions) assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT. An overall complete responder was defined as a patient in whom all treated AK lesions were cleared (Olsen score of 0) after the last PDT, i.e. after PDT-1 or after PDT-2 if re-treatment was performed.

## Secondary efficacy endpoints:

- Patient histopathological confirmed response (HCR) rate.
- Patient complete response (complete clearance of all treated lesions) assessed 12 weeks after PDT-1.
- Lesion complete response (complete clearance of all treated lesions) assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT.
- Patient partial response (complete clearance of at least 75% of the treated lesions) assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT.
- Reduction of total lesion area (the size of all treated lesions added up) per patient 12 weeks after the last PDT compared to baseline.
- The overall cosmetic outcome 12 weeks after the last PDT. The cosmetic outcome assessments were based on skin quality assessments at 12 weeks after the last PDT, which were reported by the investigator on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The cosmetic outcome was defined on a 5-point scale taking into account the investigator's ratings of the skin quality parameters.
- Patient complete response (complete clearance of all treated lesions) assessed 3-4 weeks after PDT-1, 3-4 weeks and 12 weeks after PDT-2, and 3-4 weeks after last PDT.
- Patient partial response (complete clearance of at least 75% of the treated lesions) assessed 3-4 weeks and 12 weeks after PDT-1, 3-4 weeks and 12 weeks after PDT- 2, and 3-4 weeks after last PDT.
- Lesion complete response (completely cleared individual lesions) assessed 3-4 weeks and 12 weeks after PDT-1, 3-4 weeks and 12 weeks after PDT-2, and 3-4 weeks after last PDT.
- Reduction of total lesion area (the size of all treated lesions added up) per patient assessed 3-4 weeks and 12 weeks after PDT-1, 3-4 weeks and 12 weeks after PDT- 2, and 3-4 weeks after last PDT.
- Number of new lesions in the treated field(s) assessed 12 weeks after PDT-1 and 12 weeks after the last PDT.
- Change in skin quality assessments 12 weeks after the last PDT compared to baseline.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Patient's satisfaction.

## Safety

- Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).
- Local skin reactions at the treatment area assessed by the investigators.
- Local discomfort and pain reported by patients during illumination.
- New lesions (AK, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), melanoma in the treatment area).
- Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate).
- Laboratory (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis).
- Physical examinations.

## Sample size

A sample size of 56 patients in the active treatment arm and 28 patients in the placebo arm ensured a power of more than 90% to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in response rates with a Fisher's exact test in the FAS. This estimate was based on the assumption of an expected placebo response rate of 27.5% (based on a previous study), an expected BF-200 ALA response rate of 72.5%, and a rate of missing or non-evaluable observations that cannot be imputed of 10%. As it cannot be excluded that these cases are missing not at random and related to an unfavourable outcome, these patients were considered non-responders. A randomization ratio of BF-200 ALA and placebo of 2:1 was selected.  The sample size is a multiple of 12 to stratify randomization by study site assuming 12 patients per site.

## Randomisation

Patients were randomised in a 2:1 allocation ratio of active treatment to control. Randomisation was stratified by center. Six to 18 patients were to be enrolled per site (up to 24 patients with prior permission). The randomisation schedule was automated for random assignment. The randomisation was performed in blocks to facilitate attainment of a homogeneous distribution of treatment groups and block size was not revealed before study completion.

## Blinding (masking)

The study was performed in a double-blind fashion. Active treatment and placebo were manufactured and packaged to ensure blinding. To guarantee the blind status of the investigator assessing efficacy after each PDT session, a second investigator or delegated person performed the PDT and conducted all safety evaluations during the PDT and the telephone call 1 week after PDT.

## Statistical methods

The primary null hypothesis was that the overall complete responder rate assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT for patients treated with BF-200 ALA is equal to that of patients treated with placebo. Fisher's exact test was used to test the primary hypothesis on a significance level of 0.05 two-sided. The impact of missing data on the results were to be evaluated with sensitivity analyses if the number and frequency distribution of missing data indicated a possibly substantial influence on primary or secondary efficacy results (e.g. a worst-case analysis).

No interim analysis was foreseen or performed.

A hierarchic test procedure was used for confirmatory hypothesis testing of secondary variables measured during the double-blind treatment period. These tests were to be performed only after the test of the primary efficacy variable was passed and were conducted in a strictly pre-defined order to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ensure the family-wise error rate. Hypothesis testing in the pre-defined order was to stop once the first non-significant test-result was obtained. The secondary endpoints included different response variables (patient based histopathological confirmed response rate, patient based complete response, lesion based complete response, patient based partial response (at least 75% of lesions)), analysed with similar methods as the primary endpoint, reduction of total lesion area per patient, evaluated by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with factor treatment and baseline total lesion area as covariate, and overall cosmetic outcome, analysed with a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Secondary endpoints were assessed 12 weeks after last PDT. Primary and secondary efficacy analyses were performed on the full analysis set.

Exploratory subgroups analyses in pre-defined subgroups of interest were performed by analysis in strata, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests adjusted for subgroups and by logistic regression.

Continuous data was summarised by using descriptive statistics. Categorical variables were summarised by using frequency and percentages. Laboratory values were classified as normal or abnormal according to the laboratories normal ranges and indicated as clinically significant or not clinically significant by the investigator, and shift tables illustrating changes with respect to the normal ranges between baseline and endpoint were also presented. Vital signs focused on change from baseline to the scheduled time points after baseline. All other safety variables were analysed descriptively. The safety analyses were performed for the safety analysis set.

## Results

## Recruitment

This study was conducted in 7 centres in Germany. Of 94 patients enrolled in this study, 87 patients were randomised (55 patients to BF-200 ALA and 32 patients to placebo); the remaining 7 patients were excluded from the study due to screening failures.

## Conduct of the study

Seven randomized patients prematurely discontinued the clinical part of the study: 5 patients due to patient's decision (all in the placebo group) and 2 patients were lost to follow-up (one patient in each group). In total, 10 patients included in the FAS had at least one major protocol deviation and were excluded from the PP population. A summary of major protocol deviations is presented in Table 1.

PDT= photodynamic therapy.

Of 84 patients who entered the FU phase, 80 patients had completed the clinical phase (54 patients in the BF-200 ALA group and 26 patients in the vehicle group). Another 4 of 7 patients withdrawn from the clinical phase were included in the FU. In the BF-200 ALA group, 49 patients were complete responders 12 weeks after the last PDT (33 patients 12 weeks after PDT1, and 16 patients 12 weeks after PDT2), in the vehicle group 7 patients were complete responders (3 patients 12 weeks after PDT1, and 4 patients 12 weeks after PDT2). 54 patients in the BF-200 ALA group and 26 patients of the vehicle group completed the FU. 4 patients (all in the vehicle group) prematurely discontinued the FU phase due to being lost to follow-up.

The database lock for the clinical phase was 3 September 2014.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary efficacy: Overall patient complete response 12 weeks after the last PDT

At 12 weeks after the last PDT, 50 (90.9%) patients in the BF-200 ALA group and 7 (21.9%) patients in the placebo group showed complete clearance of AK lesions.

## Secondary endpoints

A hierarchic test procedure was used for confirmatory hypothesis testing of secondary variables measured during the double-blind treatment period. These tests were to be performed in a strictly predefined order to ensure the family-wise error rate. The results of the secondary endpoints are presented in this pre- defined order.

## Histopathological confirmed response rates (HCR)

Assessments of HCR rates were based on the results from the biopsy taken 12 weeks after the last PDT from a representative AK lesion selected at screening.

The HCR was evaluated in subgroups, the HCR rates were higher in the BF-200 ALA group compared to placebo and the comparison between BF-200 ALA and placebo by Fisher's exact test yielded low pvalues in most subgroups except for the subgroups with too small sample size to allow a quantitative assessment of the treatment effect (data not shown).

## Patient complete response 12 weeks after PDT-1

At 12 weeks after PDT-1, patient complete response rates were considerably higher in the BF- 200 ALA group than in the placebo group (61.8% vs. 9.4%) and the difference in responder rates between the groups was statistically significant.

In all subgroups analysed, lesion complete responses 12 weeks after last PDT were higher in the BF200 ALA group compared to the placebo group. For both treatment groups, Grade I AK lesions at baseline had higher response rate 12 weeks after the last PDT than Grade II lesions (99.1% vs. 91.7% in the BF-200 ALA group and 49.2% vs. 24.1% in the placebo group). Likewise, AK lesions located on treatment area A (face) had higher response to treatment than AK lesions located on treatment area B (bald scalp) (97.1% vs. 90.2% in the BF-200 ALA group and 47.3% vs. 16.3% in the placebo group).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

withdrawn from the clinical phase (all in the placebo group) were included in the FU. Thus, 84 patients overall (54 patients in the BF-200 ALA group and 30 patients in the placebo group) entered the FU phase of the study. In the BF-200 ALA group, 49 patients were complete responders 12 weeks after the last PDT (33 patients 12 weeks after PDT1, and 16 patients 12 weeks after PDT2), in the vehicle group 7 patients were complete responders (3 patients 12 weeks after PDT1, and 4 patients 12 weeks after PDT2). 54 patients in the BF-200 ALA group and 26 patients of the vehicle group completed the FU. 4 patients (all in the vehicle group) prematurely discontinued the FU phase due to being lost to follow-up.

The related number of lesions entering FU was 294 in the BF-200 ALA group and 162 in the vehicle group. Of these lesions 247 (93.9%) were cleared after the last PDT (84.0% after PDT1 and 31.3% after PDT2) in the BF-200 ALA group. In the vehicle group, 52 (32.1%) were cleared after the last PDT (33 (20.4%) after PDT1 and 34 (21.0%) after PDT2). For 1 patient in the BF-200 ALA group (patient 0407), the assessment of one AK lesion 12 weeks after the last PDT was changed by the investigator from cleared to non-cleared after primary analysis reporting, which resulted in a slight difference in the total number of cleared lesions 12 months after last PDT between FAS and FAS-FUP analysis sets. Furthermore, 4 AK lesions were not included in the FAS-FUP as the patient with these cleared lesions at the end of the clinical phase did not enter the FU. The subject based evaluation was performed with all subjects in the follow-up period who were completely cleared at the end of the study (49 patients in the BF-200 ALA and 7 patients in the vehicle groups). In the BF-200 ALA group, recurrent AK lesions were observed in approximately 25% of those patients at 6 months FU (12 of 49 patients) and another 6 (12%) patients at 12 months FU. In the vehicle group, of 7 patients with complete remission after the last PDT, 6 (85.7%) patients remained cleared during the FU and 1 (14.3%) patient had a recurrent AK lesion at 6 months FU (Table 16).

Lesion recurrence rates were low in both treatment groups, with 1.9% and 6.2% in the vehicle and BF200 ALA groups, respectively, at the 6-month follow-up visit. Lower lesion recurrence rates were observed after the second 6-month period of the FU (at FU2/since FU1) with 0% and 2.9%, respectively (Table 17).

Since field treatment was applied in the ALA-AK-CT007 study, the follow-up of the skin quality parameters (including skin surface, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, mottled or irregular pigmentation, degree of scarring, and atrophy), as assessed by the investigator at FU1 and FU2 was of particular interest as the larger coherent areas outside the actual lesions allowed a better assessment of the cosmetic outcome. For the assessment, a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, and severe) was applied. All parameters of skin quality were further improved compared to the end of the study. At both FU visits, improvements were reported for a higher proportion of patients in the BF-200 ALA group compared to the vehicle group. Skin parameters improved continuously between FU1 and FU2 (Table 18).

## Summary of main study

A summary of the efficacy results from the main study supporting the present application is presented below. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

## ALA-AK-CT007

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group (2:1 ratio). 84 patients were planned to be randomized.

Primary objective: Comparison of efficacy of BF-200 ALA with placebo for field-directed treatment of mild to moderate actinic keratosis (AK) with PDT, using BF-RhodoLED lamp.

Secondary objectives: Evaluation of safety and secondary efficacy parameters related to BF-200 ALA for field-directed treatment of AK with PDT, using BF-RhodoLED lamp.

Efficacy results: Overall complete responder rates 12 weeks after the last PDT considerably higher in the  BF-200  ALA  group  (50  [90.9%]  patients)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (7  [21.9%]  patients).  The results of the Fisher's exact test of the comparison in complete responder rates between BF- 200 ALA

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and placebo (p&lt;0.0001) demonstrated the superiority of BF-200 ALA to placebo. The robustness of these results was confirmed by the per-protocol (PP) analysis.

The confirmatory analysis of all key secondary variables supported the superiority of BF-200 ALA to placebo shown in the primary analysis. The results demonstrated a significant treatment effect of BF200  ALA  to  placebo  for  all  key  secondary  efficacy  variables  tested  in  the  hierarchic  multiple  test procedure.

Superiority of BF-200-ALA to placebo was also supported by the exploratory analyses of the complete and partial responder rates, lesion complete response, and change from baseline in total lesion area at all assessment time points. No patients in the BF-200 ALA group had new AK lesions. In the placebo group,  only  one  patient  presented  with  new  lesions  12  weeks  after  PDT-2.  All  parameters  of  skin quality  (skin  surface,  hyperpigmentation,  mottled  or  irregular pigmentation,  degree  of  scarring,  and atrophy) improved in higher proportions of patients in the BF-200 ALA group compared to the placebo group 12 weeks after the last PDT. The proportion of patients with improvements in skin quality due to treatment with BF-200 ALA ranged from 35.7% to 69.6% of patients (excluding baseline evaluation 'none')  for  improvement  in  degree  of  scarring  and  skin  surface,  respectively.  Very  good  or  good cosmetic  outcome  was  reported  for  32  (66.7%)  patients  in  the  BF-200  ALA  group  and  9  (34.5%) patients in the placebo group.

All  efficacy  variables  in  this  study  were  analyzed  in  an  exploratory  way  for  a  number  of  subgroups including:  (maximum)  baseline  severity  of  AK  lesions,  age,  gender,  skin  type  and  skin  type  group, treatment area, number of AK lesions at baseline, AK history, and study center. For all subgroups, the results of the efficacy variables at all assessment time points supported the superiority of BF-200 ALA over placebo shown in the overall population. Patients with Grade I AK lesions at baseline had higher complete responder rates  12  weeks  after  the  last  PDT  than  patients  with  Grade  II  lesions  for  both treatment groups (10 [100%] vs. 40 [88.9%] patients in the BF-200 ALA group and 5 [71.4%] vs. 2 [8.0%] patients in the placebo group). Results for the treatment area subgroups revealed higher overall responder rates in patients with AK lesions located on the face only (treatment area A) than in patients with AK lesions located on the bald scalp only (treatment area B) (96.9% vs. 81.8% in the BF-200 ALA group and 35.3% vs. 7.1% in the placebo group). The vast majority of patients in the BF-200  ALA  group  were  satisfied  by  the  treatment:  49  (90.7%)  patients  rated  their  satisfaction  as 'very  good  or  good'  and  only  1  (1.9%)  patient  was  not  satisfied  by  the  treatment.  In  the  placebo group, 'very good or good' satisfaction was reported by 13 (44.8%) patients and more than one third (11 [37.9%] patients) were unsatisfied by the treatment. None of the patients was impaired by the BF200 ALA or placebo treatments.

## Supportive studies

## ALA-AK-CT002- 12 month follow up

The full description of the study was presented in the EPAR for the initial marketing authorisation. Of the 570 subjects in the ITT population, 549 completed the clinical treatment phase of the study and entered the follow-up phase (ITTFU population): 68, 241 and 240 from the vehicle, BF-200 ALA and Metvix groups, respectively. Of the 549 patients in the ITTFU, follow-up was completed by 532 (96.9%) patients.

## Outcomes and estimation

Recurrence at the 6- or 12-month follow-up (combined) in complete responders who completed followup was observed for 3 (23.1%) patients who had received vehicle and 77 (41.6%) and 69 (44.8%) patients who had received BF-200 ALA and Metvix, respectively. At the end of follow-up (12 months after the last PDT) 10 (79.9%) patients in the vehicle groups, 108 (58.4%) patients in the BF-200 ALA group and 85 (55.2%) patients in the Metvix group had still no recurrent lesions.

The AK recurrence rate was also calculated on a lesion basis. The AK lesion recurrence rate was 3.6%, 11.4% and 6.6% in the vehicle, BF-200 ALA and Metvix groups, respectively, at the 6-month follow-up visit, and 13.1%, 14.7% and 18.8%, respectively, at the 12-month follow up visit.

## ALA-AK-CT003 - 12 month follow up

The full description of the study was presented in the EPAR for the initial marketing authorisation. 122 subjects (81 subjects receiving BF-200 ALA and 41 subjects receiving placebo) entered the main phase of the study. 8 subjects (4 in each treatment group) did not complete the main phase as planned and did not enter the follow up phase, i.e. 77 subjects in the BF-200 ALA and 37 subjects in the placebo group entered the follow-up phase. 4 subjects (2 in each treatment group) were lost to follow-up prior to any follow-up assessments. Month 6 assessments were available for 72 subjects in the BF-200 ALA

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 34 subjects in the placebo group, month-12 assessments were available for 71 subjects in the BF200 ALA and 32 subjects in the placebo group.

Of the 114 subjects in the ITT population, all 114 completed the clinical treatment phase of the study, and 102 patients completed both the 6-month and 12-month follow-up: 70 in the BF-200 ALA group and 32 in the vehicle group. The subject based evaluation was performed with all subjects in the follow-up period who were completely cleared at the end of the study (53 patients in the BF-200 ALA and 5 patients in the vehicle groups).

## Outcomes and estimation

Patient AK recurrence rates were 17.0% and 40.0% for the BF-200 ALA and vehicle groups, respectively, at the 6-month follow-up visit, and 11.3% and 0%, respectively at the 12-month followup visit. Patient recurrence rates were in favor for narrow spectrum lamps with 11.1% at the 6-month and 12 months follow-up visit each versus 23.1% and 11.5%, respectively for broad spectrum lamps.

The AK recurrence rate was also calculated on a lesion basis. The AK lesion recurrence rate was 4.4% and  7.1%  in  the  vehicle  and  BF-200  ALA  groups,  respectively,  at  the  6-month  follow-up  visit,  and 4.4% and 7.9%, respectively, at the 12 -month follow-up visit. Again, recurrence rates were lower for narrow spectrum lamps compared to lesions treated with broad spectrum lamps.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The clinical assessment for this variation application is based on the new phase III study ALA-AKCT007 and the data on the 6 and 12 month follow up data from studies ALA-AK-CT002 and ALA-AKCT003, which were the pivotal trials for the initial marketing authorisation application.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

The primary endpoint and the response endpoints among the set of secondary endpoints were analysed using a Fisher exact test. This was presumably specified due to low expected response rates in the placebo arm. Although in retrospect it would not have been obligatory to use an exact test, this

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

analysis method is considered acceptable and from a regulatory perspective, generally more conservative than the methods used in the other phase III studies of the program (a Cochran-MantelHaenszel test in ALA-AK-CT003 and a chi-square test in ALA-AK-CT002). Type I error control is appropriate and the hierarchical procedure for the secondary endpoints allows confirmatory conclusions also for the secondary endpoints. Therefore, the statistical methods used for analysis in study ALA-AKCT007 were considered appropriate.

There was no considerable impact of missing data on the study results, as only 2 patients in the placebo arm and one patient in the active arm had missing observations at 12 weeks. Therefore, sensitivity analyses are not considered necessary.

The pre-specified subgroups analyses were considered appropriate.  It is noted that numbers in several subgroups (Grade I AK lesions, age &lt;= 65 years, females, skin type I, skin type IV and higher, AK lesion of &lt;=400 mm2, AK naïve patients) were very small. Therefore, the results comparing these subgroups have to be interpreted with caution. This also relates to apparent differences in treatment effects. Overall the subgroups results can be considered consistent.

The methods used for the pooled analyses across trials of the phase III program, including the studies ALA-AK-CT007, ALA-AK-CT003 and ALA-AK-CT002, are considered appropriate. The study characteristics and key design features are considered sufficiently similar to allow a pooled analysis across the study program. The studies had the same main inclusion criteria for patients (4 to 8 AK target lesions 0.5 to 1.5 cm diameter of mild to moderate severity with an overall size of approximately 20 cm 2 ). In ALA-AK-CT007, the lesions were to be located within one to two fields of 20 cm 2 , which was not required for the other two studies. The studies had an identical schedule for the PDT treatments and timing for the assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint and used the same primary efficacy endpoint (complete patient-based clearance rate) at 12 weeks after the last PDT.

Of note, the studies used different analysis set definitions for assessment of efficacy. The primary analysis set for efficacy of the integrated analysis comprised all patients randomised and treated at least once, and the same definition was used in studies ALA-AK-CT007 and ALA-AK-CT002, whereas in study ALA-AK-CT003, the primary analysis was performed in all patients randomized and treated at least once with the product and who had a least one post-dose assessment. Therefore, some of the results of the pooled analysis differ from the results in the original study report. However, these small differences have no impact on conclusions from the results.

Red-light illumination was chosen since light with longer wave lengths penetrates deeper into the tissue.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

For trial ALA-AK-CT007, the topical application of BF-200 ALA with PDT was shown to be superior to placebo for treatment of AK. The overall patient complete response rate 12 weeks after the last PDT was considerably higher in the BF-200 ALA group than in the placebo group (90.9% vs. 21.9% of patients, &lt;0.0001; FAS). Results of the confirmatory analyses of all secondary efficacy variables also showed superiority of BF-200 ALA to placebo.

A higher number of patients with Grade I AK lesions at baseline were complete responders 12 weeks after the last PDT compared to patients with Grade II lesions (100% vs. 88.9% of patients treated with BF-200 ALA). Complete responder rates were higher in patients with AK lesions located on the face (treatment area A) only than in patients with AK lesions located on the bald scalp only (96.9% vs. 81.8% of patients) (treatment area B).

Topical application of BF-200 ALA resulted in improvements of skin quality 12 weeks after the last PDT compared to baseline. The most prominent improvements were observed in the skin surface

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(roughness, dryness, and scaliness), reported in 69.6% of patients in the BF-200 ALA group, and mottled and irregular pigmentation, reported in 50.0% of the patients. The cosmetic outcome (with baseline sum score 0 excluded) assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT was considered as very good or good in 66.7% of patients in the BF 200 ALA group, compared to 34.6% of patients in the placebo group. The vast majority of patients treated with BF-200 ALA were satisfied by treatment results. In total, 90.7% of the patients rated their satisfaction as 'very good or good' and only 1 (1.9%) patient was not satisfied by the treatment.

The follow up period for trial ALA-AK-CT007 showed that patient lesion recurrence rates were in favour for the vehicle where new lesions in the treated field(s) were observed in 4 patients (7.4%) (one lesion in one subject at month 6, and in 3 subjects at months 12) in the BF-200 ALA group compared to no new lesions were observed in the vehicle group. The MAH clarified that none of the lesions were in the treated field (the region actually treated with BF-200 ALA) and only 3 lesions (one Bowen's, one BCC, one SCC) were in the respective treatment area (either face/forehead or scalp). The placebo had one lesion about 2-fold smaller, providing evidence that there was no increased non-melanoma malignancy in the treated areas. The majority of patients in both treatment groups had at least good cosmetic outcome at the end of the FU (83.3% and 87.5% of patients in the BF-200 ALA and placebo groups, respectively). Patients' contentment was reported by a higher proportion of patients in the BF-200 ALA group than in the placebo group at the end of the FU (77.8% vs. 69.2% patients) (see clinical safety section).

Study ALA-AK-CT002 follow up data showed that patients with completely cleared lesions 12 weeks after the last PDT (i.e. at the end of the clinical treatment phase), 41.6% in the BF-200 ALA group had recurrent lesions at 6 and/or 12 months follow up compared to 44.8% in the Metvix group and 23.1% in the placebo group. Overall, cosmetic outcome was comparable for Metvix and BF-200 ALA and better than for placebo. At 12 months follow-up in subjects that had been classified as complete responders at 12 weeks after the last PDT and that were still cleared (free of lesions) after 6 months follow-up in the BF-200 ALA group, 14.7% of the lesions were reported to be recurrent, compared to 18.8% in the Metvix group and 11.4% in the placebo group. The MAH provided a retrospective analysis of the neoplasia that occurred in patients either during the clinical phase (CSR) or the follow-up (FUP) which showed that 4.9 % of the patients in the BF-200 ALA group, 9.8 % of the Metvix patients and 9.7 % of the placebo patients displayed neoplastic lesions. Therefore, there appears that there is no solid evidence that patients in the BF-200 ALA group had an increased risk of developing novo skin neoplasia (see clinical safety section).

Study ALA-AK-CT003 follow up data showed that patients with complete clearance at the end of the study, 28.3% of the subjects in the BF-200 ALA group compared to 40.0% of subjects in the placebo group had recurrent lesions during the 12-month follow-up.  Comparison of the recurrence rate after BF-200 ALA treatment to placebo treatment was limited by to the low number of subjects with complete clearance (4 available subjects) and the low number of cleared lesions (45 lesions) at the end of the study in the placebo group. New AK lesions in the target area were observed slightly more often in the BF-200 ALA group than in the placebo group, however the difference was not statistically significant. Skin quality assessments and overall cosmetic outcome showed no substantial differences between the treatment groups. During a 12-month follow-up period, 15% of the lesions cleared at the end of the study after treatment with PDT and BF-200 ALA group were recurrent; in the placebo group slightly fewer lesions (8.8%) were recurrent. The MAH provided a retrospective analysis of the neoplasia that occurred in patients either during the clinical phase (CSR) or the follow-up (FUP). Indicated are the patient number and the preferred term (PT) which showed that neoplasia was detected in 3.1% in the BF-200 ALA group and 5.1% in the placebo group, indicating that there is no increased risk of novo skin neoplasia (see clinical safety section).

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

Trial ALA-AK-CT007 met it's primary endpoint and showed efficacy in the treatment of field cancerisation with ALA, where overall patient complete response at 12 weeks and clearance of lesions was observed. The primary efficacy results were supported by the secondary endpoints. The results are considered statistically significant and clinically meaningful. It also showed that field-directed treatment skin quality improved continuously from baseline to FU2. Overall, the results of the FU analyses were in agreement with the data of the clinical phase by demonstrating higher rates of patient- and lesion-wise clearance in the BF-200 ALA group vs. placebo at the end of FU. Follow up data from studies ALA-AK-CT002, ALA-AK-CT003 and ALA-AKCT007 indicated that the efficacy achieved 12 weeks after the last PDT was generally maintained during a 12-month follow up period.

All Phase III studies demonstrated that the use of illumination sources with a narrow wavelength spectrum, such as the BF-RhodoLED, seems to yield higher AK clearance rates than sources with a broad wavelength spectrum. Irrespective of the lamp, BF-200 ALA showed efficacy superior to placebo.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The MAH provided a follow up for the safety results of the studies ALA-AK-CT002, ALA-AK-CT003, and ALA-AK-CT007.

## Patient exposure

The number of patients exposed to PDT-1 and PDT-2 by treatment area is presented in Table 33. All 87 patients in the SAF were exposed to PDT in the first session: 32 patients received placebo and 55 patients received BF-200 ALA.

## Adverse events

## ALA-AK-CT002 follow-up

Of the 570 subjects in the ITT population, 549 completed the clinical treatment phase of the study and entered the follow-up phase (ITTFU population): 68, 241 and 240 from the vehicle, BF-200 ALA and Metvix groups, respectively. Of the 549 patients in the ITTFU, follow-up was completed by 532 (96.9%) patients. AEs during ALA-AK-CT002 follow-up included basal cell carcinoma (1.2%, 1.7%, 0% in theBF-200 ALA, Metvix and vehicle groups, respectively), seborrheic keratosis (1.2%, 1.3%,0%), squamous cell carcinoma of skin (0.4%, 0%, 0%; 0%, 0.4%, 1.5%) resp.), Bowen's disease (0%, 1.3%, 1.5%), skin papilloma (0%, 0%, 1.5%). There was no report of melanoma. AK was reported for 2 subjects in both the BF-200 ALA and Metvix groups. None of these AEs was regarded by the investigator as treatment-related.

## ALA-AK-CT003 follow-up

Of the 114 subjects in the FAS population, all 114 completed the clinical treatment phase of the study, and 102 (89.5%) patients completed both the 6-month and 12-month follow-up: 70 in the BF-200 ALA group and 32 in the vehicle group. Overall, 4 subjects (3 in the BF-200 ALA group and 1 in the vehicle group) had a new non-melanoma or melanoma skin cancers in the treatment area (face and forehead, bald scalp). Two subjects had a superficial cell carcinoma (in month 6 and 12, both BF-200 ALA) and 2 subjects had a nodular basal cell carcinoma (one BF-200 ALA, one placebo, both in month 6).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ALA-AK-CT005

In a clinical trial (ALA-AK-CT005) designed to investigate the sensitization potential of ALA with 216 healthy subjects, 13 subjects (6%) developed allergic contact dermatitis after continuous exposure for 21 days with doses of ALA that were higher than doses normally used in the treatment of AK. Allergic contact dermatitis has not been observed under regular treatment conditions.

## Study ALA-AK-CT006

More TEAEs were observed after application of the ALA gel and subsequent illumination compared to the placebo gel (10 TEAEs in 4 patients vs. 1 TEAE in 1 patient). After application of the ALA gel, 10 TEAEs were observed in 4 of the 12 patients. Seven of the 10 TEAEs occurred in one patient. Seven events were of moderate severity and 3 events were of mild severity. A relationship to the IMP was considered certain for 5 of the 10 events, probable for 3 of the 10 events, possible for 1 of the 10 events, and unlikely for 1 of the 10 events.

The TEAEs considered to have a causal relationship to the ALA gel were 6 local TEAEs (eyelid oedema, swelling face, application site erosion, application site pruritus, and application site pain and feeling hot) and headache.

No deaths and no SAEs occurred. No discontinuations due to an AE were reported. All TEAEs had recovered by the end of the study. No clinically relevant changes in laboratory, vital sign, and ECG parameters between screening and follow-up were observed. Pain and local tolerability assessment revealed pain and skin reactions to occur more often after application of ALA gel compared to the placebo gel. Immediately after PTD treatment following placebo gel application, none of the patients developed pain in the treatment area. After PTD treatment following ALA gel application, all patients developed pain. Most of the patients developed pain of moderate intensity; one patient had pain of severe intensity.

Twenty-four hours after placebo gel application, mild dryness was observed in 8 patients and mild itching was observed in 1 patient. After ALA gel application all patients showed skin reactions of mild or moderate intensity and all investigated skin reactions (erythema, dryness, burning, erosion, oedema, and itching) were observed. The most frequently observed skin reaction was erythema, oedema, and burning. The most frequently moderate skin reaction was erythema. At follow-up, i.e., after a short time span of 7 days, no obvious improvement in skin reactions was observed compared to Period 2 (ALA gel). One Patient showed severe erythema and erosion at follow-up. The healing time was expected to be comparable with the one after first- and second-degree burns, i.e., 14 to 21 days. At the follow-up visit, the investigator assessed the overall tolerability as good in 9 patients, as satisfactory in 1 patient, and as not satisfactory in another patient. These results are in line with the SmPC of ALA. In clinical trials with ALA, local skin reactions at the application site were observed in about 90% of the subjects. The most common signs and symptoms observed were application site irritation, erythema, pain, and oedema which were usually of mild or moderate intensity. They lasted for 1 to 4 days in most cases; in some cases, however, they persisted for 1 to 2 weeks or even longer. Headache is also known to be commonly associated with ALA gel.

## ALA-AK-CT007

The overall incidence of TEAEs was higher in the BF-200 ALA group than in the placebo group (100% vs. 68.8%). In both groups, the most commonly reported TEAEs were those of the application site, i.e. application site pain, erythema, pruritus, scab exfoliation, and oedema. The incidences of these TEAEs were higher in the BF-200 ALA group than in the placebo group. Application site pain was the most

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

common individual TEAE in both groups, reported in 53 (96.4%) patients in the BF-200 ALA group and in 16 (50.0%) patients in the placebo group.

## ALA-AK-CT007 follow-up

Of the 84 subjects in the FAS population, 80 subjects completed the clinical treatment phase of the study. Furthermore, 4 patients withdrawn from the clinical phase entered the FU. 80 patients completed the FU phase; all 54 (100%) BF-200 ALA patients and 26 (86.7%) vehicle patients completed both the 6-month and 12-month follow-up). In ALA-AK-CT007 follow-up new lesions in the treated field(s) were observed in 16 patients (29.6%) in the BF-200 ALA group, and 4 lesions (13.3%) in the vehicle group. Of these, 3 were assessed as probably or possibly related. Moreover, the trend for an increase in carcinoma was also observed in ALA-AK-CT007, 6 AEs of neoplasms (2x basal cell carcinoma, 1x Bowen´s disease, 1x keratoacanthoma, 1x squamous cell carcinoma in situ, 1x acrochordon) were observed in the BF-200 ALA group vs. 0 in the placebo group.

## Overview of adverse events

Overall, 64.4% (96/149) of patients who received vehicle and 96.6% (371/384) of patients who received BF-200 ALA had one or more AEs.

'Application site hypersensitivity' was a faulty classification used at at single center in study ALA-AKCT002. The correct term should have been 'application site hyperalgesia' as clarified by the investigator after database lock (see Appendix A.1.2 ALA-AK-CT002).

For treatment-related AEs, one or more related AEs were reported for 88 (59.1%) patients who received vehicle and 368 (95.8%) patients who received BF-200 ALA.

In the BF-200 ALA group,

- 4 patients (1.6 %) had one or two BCCs, 2 patients (0.8 %) had one or two SCCs, 1 patient (0.4 %) had a melanoma, 1 patient (0.4 %) had a sarcoma, and 4 (1.6 %) patients had a seborrheic keratosis.

In the Metvix group,

- 8 patients (3.3 %) presented with one or two BCCs, 5 patients (2.0 %) with an SCCs or keratoacanthoma, 4 patients (1.6 %) with Bowen's disease, 5 patients (2.0 %) with a seborrheic keratosis, and 3 patients (1.2%) with various other neoplasms.

In the placebo group,

- 2 patients (2.8 %) had a BCC, 2 patients (2.8 %) an SCC, 2 patients (2.8 %) a Bowen's disease, and 1 patient (1.4 %) a skin papilloma.

Together, 4.9 % of the patients in the BF-200 ALA group, 9.8 % of the Metvix patients and 9.7 % of the placebo patients displayed neoplastic lesions.

A melanoma occurred in one patient in the BF-200 ALA group, none in the Metvix or placebo groups. According to the patient's medical history, the patient affected by melanoma in the BF-200 ALA group suffered from 2 melanomas, an acanthoma, an SCC, and a dysplastic naevus syndrome prior to study start, which had been treated previously.

The following neoplasia occurred in patients of study ALA-AK-CT003, either during the clinical phase (CSR) or the follow-up (FUP). Indicated are the patient number and the preferred term (PT):

*For two subjects with lesions previously diagnosed as superficial cell carcinoma (in month 6 and 12, both BF-200 ALA 10%) a corrected determination became available after database lock (see study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

report ALA-AK-CT003). Diagnosis was stated more precisely as squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, respectively.

In the BF-200 ALA group

- 2 patients (2.6 %) presented with a BCC, 1 patient (1.3 %) with an SCC.

In the placebo group,

- one patient (2.7 %) had a BCC and one patient (2.4 %) an SCC. There was no melanoma. The SCC in the placebo group was identified through the second biopsy taken at the end of the study.

Percent values were calculated using for BF-200 ALA the safety population of 81 patients in the CSR and 77 patients in the FU, and for placebo 41 patients in the CSR and 37 patients in the FU.

Again, based on the number of patients with neoplasia (together 3.1% in the BF-200 ALA group and 5.1% in the placebo group) there is no indication for an increased risk of neoplasia after ALA PDT.

The following neoplasia occurred in patients of study ALA-AK-CT007, either during the clinical phase (CSR) or the follow-up (FUP).:

In summary, in the BF-200 ALA group

- there were 2 patients with one or two BCCs (3.7 %), 2 SCC or keratocanthoma (3.7 %), 1 seborrhoeic keratosis (1.8 %) and 1 Bowen's disease patient (1.8 %). In one patient an acorchordon (1.8 %) was observed which is a harmless small benign tumor.

In the placebo group, which was about half the size of the verum group,

- only one case of seborrheic keratosis (3.1 %) was observed.

One BCC at the shoulder of a patient in the ALA group was already present prior to PDT. There was no melanoma in either group.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Percent values were calculated using for BF-200 ALA the safety population of 55 patients in the CSR and 54 patients in the FU, and for placebo 32 patients in the CSR and 30 patients in the FU.

The total percentage of neoplasia was 18.3 % in the BF-200 ALA group (16.5 % without the BCC that was present already before PDT) and 3.1 % in the placebo group,

## Pooled analysis

In the pooled analysis, only 1/366 patients in the BF-200 ALA group, 0/247 patients in the Metvix group and 0/132 patients in the placebo group presented with a malignant melanoma during the follow-up phase of the studies.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

No serious adverse events or deaths observed during the clinical trials were considered drug related. In the SOC General disorders and administration site conditions, severe AEs were reported for 1.3% (2/149) of patients who received vehicle and 36.7% (141/384) of patients who received BF-200 ALA.

There was no death in the Phase I/II clinical program, including study ALA-AK-CT005, study ALA-AKCT001 and study ALA-AK-CT006. In the Phase III program, no death was reported in study ALA-AKCT002, study ALA-AK-CT003, or study ALA-AK-CT007.  One death was reported in the context of the Phase III study ALA-AK-CT002 but was determined to be unrelated to the study drug.

Hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis data gave no indication for any drug-related changes (laboratory values over time, individual subject changes, and individual clinically significant abnormalities).

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

There was no AE that led to discontinuation in ALA-AK-CT003 or ALA-AK-CT007. In ALA-AK-CT002, one patient had AEs of application site pain and application site irritation on Day 1 that led to discontinuation and were assessed as definitely related to treatment. Illumination stopped one minute after start because of the severe application site pain and irritation (burning).

## Post marketing experience

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There have been no safety signals from post-marketing sources. Since marketing in the EU early in 2012 approx. 91.000 patients have been treated with BF-200 ALA gel. No spontaneous cases concerning melanoma or new NMSCs have been reported to the MAH.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

In study ALA-AK-CT007, BF-200 ALA was well tolerated. The safety profile was consistent with the AK overall population which includes mainly elderly patients and similar characteristics of the underlying disease. The most commonly reported TEAEs (also the most commonly reported related TEAEs) were the TEAEs of the application site (application site pain, erythema, pruritus, scab exfoliation, and oedema). The frequency of serious TEAEs was very low and no related serious TEAEs were reported. Local skin reactions were mainly of mild to moderate intensity. In the BF-200 ALA group, the incidences shifted to less severe and more mild TEAEs rated as discomfort during and after PDT-2 compared with PDT-1. In the placebo group, no conclusion can be drawn due to low number of patients who had PDT-2. In the ALA-AK-CT007 follow up study, safety analyses in the FU showed that treatment of AK lesions with BF-200 ALA is well tolerated. The overall lesion status in the treatment areas revealed comparable skin disease progression over the FU period in both treatment groups.

In ALA-AK-CT002 follow-up, there was a marginal increased risk for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and AK in the verum group; in ALA-AK-CT003 follow up overall, 4 subjects (3 in the BF-200 ALA group and 1 in the vehicle group) had a new non-melanoma or melanoma skin cancers in the treatment area (face and forehead, bald scalp). Two subjects in the BF-200 ALA group had a 'superficial cell carcinoma' and 2 subjects (one each for BF-200 ALA and placebo group) had a nodular basal cell carcinoma. In ALAAK-CT007 follow-up, a trend for an increase in carcinoma was also observed in ALA-AK-CT007, 6 AEs of neoplasms (2x basal cell carcinoma, 1x Bowen´s disease, 1x keratoacanthoma, 1xsquamous cell carcinoma in situ, 1x acrochordon/fibroma molle) were observed in the BF-200 ALA group vs. 0 in the placebo group. According to the results of the follow up studies of ALA-AK-CT002, ALA-AK-CT003, ALAAK-CT007, there seems to be a slight increase in the rate for non-melanoma skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and carcinomata in situ respectively.

There is no evidence that patients in the BF-200 ALA group had an increased ratio of neoplasia. Furthermore, there is no apparent pattern in the time of onset of neoplasia after PDT that may point towards a causal relationship.

Percent values were calculated using for BF-200 ALA the safety population of 248 patients in the CSR and 241 patients in the FU, for Metvix 247 patients in the CSR and 240 in the FU, and for placebo 76 patients in the CSR and 68 patients in the FU.

In study ALA-AK-CT-007, it appears that a difference in the percentage of patients treated with ALAand placebo that have neoplasia potentially may exist. However, since in study ALA-AK-CT007 all lesions were followed separately and the location of new lesions was well documented, it can be stated that none of the lesions were in the treated field (the region actually treated with BF-200 ALA) and only 3 lesions (one Bowen's, one BCC, one SCC) were in the respective treatment area (either face/forehead or scalp).

During the assessment, the PRAC concluded to delete nasopharyngitis from the list of safety concerns. The rationale for not listing nasopharyngitis as related AE and deleting it from the SmPC is as follows:

- The frequency of nasopharyngitis was not increased in patients treated with PDT compared to the general population. Most patients complained of nasopharyngitis or bronchitis during the fall and winter, the typical season for these infections. No patient reported of repeated infections in the course of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Most of the cases were reported several weeks after PDT. Considering the late onset of the infections observed after the last PDT in both verum-treatment groups (ALA-AKCT002), the high incidences reported for nasopharyngitis especially in the elderly target population and the coincidence with the typical seasonal pattern, it was assumed that these AEs were highly unlikely to be induced by PDT treatment.

- None of the reported cases of nasopharyngitis were serious and all patients recovered,
- Nasopharyngitis is a self-limited disease.

BF-200 ALA has been marketed in the EU since the beginning of 2012. No spontaneous safety cases related to nasopharyngitis have been reported and no cases are described in the literature. Also, no cases of nasopharyngitis have been rated as likely related or related in the clinical study ALA-AKCT007. Therefore, nasopharyngitis has been deleted in Section 4.8 of the updated. The PIL has been updated accordingly.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

Overall, the safety of BF-200 ALA appears to be acceptable and also well tolerated in the photodynamic treatment of AK lesions on face and scalp with AK lesions located within 1-2 treatment fields of an overall size of an area of approximately 20 cm 2 . There were no unexpected safety concerns reported and most common ADRs were as expected, transient local skin reactions.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

The next data lock point will be 14 June 2018.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The MAH did not update the RMP during the procedure as this proposed extension of the indication is not a significant change in the product's indication for use and does not lead to a significant change to the risk-benefit balance, since the disease area is similar, the treated age group remains unchanged, and the proposed treatment population is not materially different from the current. The MAH proposed to provide an updated RMP with the response to questions (RTQ) for the renewal of the MA (EMEA/H/C/002204/R/0023), waited by 16 August 2016, which was considered acceptable by the PRAC rapporteur.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

## 2.7. Update of the Product information

As a consequence of this new indication to include treatment of actinic keratosis of mild to moderate severity on the face and scalp (Olsen grade 1 to 2) and of field cancerization, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet and to bring section 6.6 of the SmPC in line with the latest QRD template.

## 2.7.1. User consultation

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: The additional information in the SmPC does not substantially change to the PL or the readability of the PL.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The clinical efficacy of BF-200 ALA nanoemulsion gel for PDT in study ALA-AK-CT007 in subjects with AK target lesions of mild to moderate intensity (AK grade 1 and 2 according to Olsen et al. 1991) within 1-2 treatment fields (overall size of approximately 20 cm 2 ) in the treatment area of the face and forehead or bald scalp (excluding eyes, nostrils, ears, and mouth). Ameluz was superior to vehicle with respect to patient complete clearance rates (90.9% vs. 21.9% for Ameluz and placebo, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001) and lesion complete clearance rates (94.3% vs. 32.9%, respectively; p &lt; 0.0001), as controlled 12 weeks after the last PDT.  96.9% of patients with AK on the face or forehead were cleared from all lesions, 81.8% of patients with AK on the scalp were totally cleared. Lesions of mild severity were cleared by 99.1% vs. 49.2%, those of moderate intensity by 91.7% vs. 24.1% for treatment with Ameluz or placebo, respectively. After only 1 PDT complete patient clearance resulted in 61.8% vs. 9.4%, and complete lesion clearance in 84.2% vs. 22.0% for Ameluz or placebo treatment, respectively. Clinical efficacy was maintained during the follow-up periods of 6 and 12 months after the last photodynamic therapy. After Ameluz treatment, 6.2% of the lesions were recurrent after 6 and additionally 2.9% after 12 months, respectively (placebo: 1.9% after 6 and additionally 0% after 12 months, respectively).

The efficacy data from the pooled analysis supported the overall efficacy in the single study outcome. Generally, the effects of BF-200 ALA on all efficacy variables were consistent in all analyses of subgroup populations stratified by age, sex, lamp type, skin type, AK lesion severity, number of AK lesions at baseline, and AK lesion area.

Follow up data of the Phase III studies ALA-AK-CT002, ALA-AK-CT003 and ALA-AKCT007 demonstrated that the efficacy achieved 12 weeks after the last PDT was highly maintained during a 12-month follow up period. In study ALA-AK-CT002, recurrence rates were slightly lower than those achieved with MAL in all subgroups. Moreover, as demonstrated in study ALA-AK-CT007 with field-directed treatment skin quality improved continuously from baseline to FU2.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Patient and lesion recurrence rates were in favor for the vehicle in all follow up studies.  In study ALAAK-CT002 follow up, at 12 months follow-up in subjects that had been classified as complete responders 12 weeks after the last PDT and that were still cleared (free of lesions) after 6 months follow-up in the BF-200 ALA group 14.7% of the lesions were reported to be recurrent compared to 11.4% in the placebo group. For study ALA-AK-CT003 follow up, during a 12-month follow-up period, 15% of the lesions after were recurrent after treatment with PDT and BF-200 ALA group compared to 8.8% in the placebo group. For study ALA-AK-CT007 follow up, patient recurrence rates were 24.5 % and 14.3 % after 6 months, and additionally 12.2 % and 0 % after 12 months for Ameluz and placebo, respectively. However, it appears that overall treatment taking into consideration the study period as well as the follow up period, there is a lack of statistical significance between the incidence of skin neoplasia between BF-200 ALA and placebo in all studies. In many cases, the lesions appeared in areas that had not been previously treated with BF-200 ALA.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

In study ALA-AK-CT007, the safety profile was consistent with other studies. The most commonly reported TEAEs were application site pain, erythema, pruritus, scab exfoliation, and oedema. The frequency of serious TEAEs was very low and no related serious TEAEs were reported. Local skin reactions were mainly of mild to moderate intensity. Safety analyses in the FU period showed that treatment of AK lesions with BF-200 ALA was well tolerated.

No serious adverse events or deaths observed during the clinical trials were considered drug related. Hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis data gave no indication for any drug-related changes (laboratory values over time, individual subject changes, and individual clinically significant abnormalities).

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

For listing of the important identified risks, important potential risks and missing information, see RMP.

According to the results of the follow up studies of ALA-AK-CT002, ALA-AK-CT003, ALA-AK-CT007 there seems to be an increased rate for (non)melanoma skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and carcinoma in situ respectively. However, no clear causality between the risk and the treatment has been identified. The safety concerns will be closely monitored within the pharmacovigilance program from the MAH.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

BF-200 ALA was evaluated for PDT in adult subjects with AK lesions of mild to moderate severity on the face and/or scalp or with field cancerization. The efficacy results of the Phase III pivotal studies show a consistent and robust benefit with regard to the percentages of subjects with total AK lesion clearance and the total clearance of individual AK lesions compared to the vehicle control. In terms of safety, no new ADRs or safety concerns have been identified in study ALA-AK-CT007. The treatment is considered well tolerated and transient local skin reactions are manageable.

## Benefit-risk balance

The CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit observed with Ameluz in terms of clearance of mild and moderate severity AK lesions in the field treatment area of cancerisation outweigh the known safety risks. Therefore, the benefit-risk is considered positive.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The efficacy of BF-200 ALA nanoemulsion gel is considered demonstrated for PDT in adult subjects with AK lesions on the face and/or scalp and can be applied to field cancerization containing multiple AKs. The efficacy results of the Phase III pivotal studies are consistent and robust with regard to the superiority of BF-200 ALA over vehicle for both the percentages of subjects with total AK lesion clearance and the total clearance of individual AK lesion. Narrow-spectrum wavelength illumination yielded better results with regard to subject total AK lesion clearance which was associated with an increased incidence of local skin reactions and pain. These adverse reactions were, however, nonserious and self-limiting with duration of up to 7 days in most patients. However, irrespective of the illumination source, the efficacy of BF-200 ALA was generally superior to the other treatments. In addition, the cosmetic outcome of this combination has been proven in a Phase III study with field therapy.

In conclusion, BF-200 ALA in combination with red light seems an appropriate therapeutic option for PDT in subjects with AK lesions on the face and scalp. It can be applied in field-directed PDT and overcomes disadvantages of presently available preparations concerning stability of ALA and absorption to the lesions. Overall BF-200 ALA appears to be rather safe and well tolerated in the photodynamic therapy of AK lesions on face and scalp with the exception of expected transient local skin reactions.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

AK-CT007. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet and to bring section 6.6 of the SmPC in line with the latest QRD template.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.
