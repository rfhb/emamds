This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Lynkuet 60 mg soft capsules

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each soft capsule contains 60 mg elinzanetant.

## Excipient with known effect

Each soft capsule contains 71 mg sorbitol (E 420).

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

## 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM

Soft capsule (capsule)

Opaque red, oblong, approximately 24 mm long and 11 mm in diameter, with white printing of 'EZN60'.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Lynkuet is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS):

- -associated with menopause (see section 5.1)
- -caused by adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) related to breast cancer (see section 5.1).

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

## Posology

The recommended daily dose is 120 mg (two 60 mg capsules) elinzanetant taken at bedtime.

Benefits of symptomatic treatment should be periodically assessed (e.g. during routine and/or cancer follow-up care) as the need for treatment can vary by individual or change over time.

## Co-administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors

The recommended daily dose when used with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors is 60 mg (one 60 mg capsule) elinzanetant at bedtime (see section 4.5). After discontinuation of the moderate inhibitor (after 3 to 5 half-lives of the inhibitor), elinzanetant should be used at the usual dose of 120 mg once daily.

## Missed dose

If a dose is missed, the next dose should be taken as scheduled on the following day. Patients should not take 2 doses on the same day to make up for a missed dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elderly

The safety and efficacy of elinzanetant in women over 65 years of age has not been established. No dose recommendation can be made for this population.

## Hepatic impairment

No dose modification is required for patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) chronic hepatic impairment.

Elinzanetant is not recommended for use in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) chronic hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).

## Renal impairment

For patients with moderate to severe (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment the recommended daily dose is 60 mg (one 60 mg capsule) elinzanetant at bedtime (see section 5.2).

No dose modification is required for patients with mild (eGFR 60 - 89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment.

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of elinzanetant in the paediatric population in the indications moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause or caused by AET.

## Method of administration

Lynkuet is for oral use.

The capsules should be taken orally once daily at bedtime.

The capsules should be swallowed whole with water. The capsules should not be cut, chewed or crushed as they contain an oily solution.

The capsules can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2) but should not be taken with grapefruit or grapefruit juice (see section 4.5).

## 4.3 Contraindications

- -Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
- -Known or suspected pregnancy (see section 4.6).

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Concomitant use with other medicinal products

Cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors may decrease the clearance of elinzanetant, resulting in higher exposure. The concomitant use of elinzanetant with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended. For concomitant use with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors reduce the dose of elinzanetant (see section 4.5).

## Elinzanetant in combination with other breast cancer treatments

The use of elinzanetant has been evaluated in combination with AET consisting of aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen, with or without GnRH agonists. A decision to treat women with elinzanetant who receive medication other than those evaluated in the clinical studies should be based on an individual benefit-risk consideration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Concomitant use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with oestrogens to treat VMS associated with menopause

Concomitant use of elinzanetant and HRT with oestrogens has not been studied, and therefore concomitant use is not recommended. Local vaginal preparations can be used.

## Excipient with known effect

## Sorbitol

The additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account. The content of sorbitol in medicinal products for oral use may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products for oral use when administered concomitantly.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

## Effects of other medicinal products on elinzanetant

Elinzanetant is metabolised via CYP3A4 and is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter protein.

## CYP3A4 inhibitors (substances increasing exposure to elinzanetant)

Co-administration of multiple daily doses of itraconazole (200 mg), a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor, and elinzanetant 120 mg resulted in an increase of approximately 3.3-fold in Cmax and between 4.6-fold and 6.3-fold in area under the curve (AUC) of elinzanetant.

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling predictions after co-administration of 120 mg elinzanetant with the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin showed a 3-fold increase of AUC and 2-fold increase for Cmax of elinzanetant. PBPK predictions after co-administration of 60 mg elinzanetant with the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin showed a 1.4-fold increase of AUC and no increase in Cmax compared to 120 mg elinzanetant alone. PBPK predictions after co-administration of 120 mg elinzanetant with the weak CYP3A4 inhibitor cimetidine showed a 1.5-fold increase of AUC and 1.3-fold increase for Cmax of elinzanetant.

Elinzanetant should not be used together with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, cobicistat or ribociclib) (see section 4.4).

The concomitant use of elinzanetant with grapefruit (juice) is not recommended.

If used concomitantly with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, verapamil) the daily dose of elinzanetant is 60 mg (see section 4.2).

No dose adjustment is required for weak CYP3A4 inhibitors.

## Effects of elinzanetant on other medicinal products

Elinzanetant is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. Co-administration of midazolam, a sensitive substrate of CYP3A4, and multiple daily doses of elinzanetant 120 mg resulted in an increase of 1.5-fold in Cmax and 1.8-fold in AUC of midazolam.

Caution is required when co-administering elinzanetant with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (e.g. cyclosporine, fentanyl or tacrolimus). The related recommendation in the product information of these CYP3A4 substrates should be followed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

Lynkuet is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). If pregnancy occurs during treatment with Lynkuet, the treatment should be withdrawn.

There are no or limited data from the use of elinzanetant in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).Women of child-bearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. Non-hormonal contraceptives are recommended for this population.

## Breast-feeding

It is unknown whether elinzanetant/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of elinzanetant/metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.

A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Lynkuet therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

## Fertility

No human data on the effect of elinzanetant on fertility are available. In the fertility study in female rats, elinzanetant did not affect fertility (see section 5.3).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

Elinzanetant has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Somnolence and fatigue are potential adverse reactions to elinzanetant. Therefore, women should be advised to be careful when driving or using machines if they experience such reactions during treatment with elinzanetant (see section 4.8).

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most frequent adverse reactions (≥5%) with elinzanetant are:

- -for VMS associated with menopause: headache (7.8%) and fatigue (5.0%)
- -for VMS caused by AET: fatigue (14.2%), somnolence (9.5%), diarrhoea (7.1%), depression (6.2%), and muscle spasm (5.2%).

## Tabulated list of adverse reactions

The safety profile of elinzanetant is based on data from women who received at least 1 dose of 120 mg elinzanetant:

- -1 113 treated women with VMS associated with menopause in 3 phase III (OASIS 1, OASIS 2, OASIS 3) and 1 phase II (SWITCH-1) clinical studies and
- -465 treated women with VMS caused by AET in a separate phase III clinical study (OASIS 4).

The adverse reactions are listed in table 1. They are classified according to MedDRA System Organ Class. Adverse reactions are grouped according to their frequencies. Frequency groups are defined by the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to &lt; 1/1 000); very rare (&lt; 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data).

## Description of selected adverse reactions

## Photosensitivity reactions

In the pooled safety data up to 52 weeks, photosensitivity reactions were reported in 0.4% of patients treated with elinzanetant and in 0.1% of patients treated with placebo.

In OASIS 4 up to 52 weeks, photosensitivity reactions were reported in 0.9% of patients treated with elinzanetant and in 0.6% of patients treated with placebo.

## ALT and AST increased

In the pooled safety data up to 52 weeks, the term ALT increased was reported in 0.6% of patients treated with elinzanetant and in 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. The term AST increased was reported in 0.4% of patients treated with elinzanetant and in 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. In OASIS 4 up to 52 weeks, the term ALT increased was reported in 1.1% of patients treated with elinzanetant and in 0.6% of patients treated with placebo. The term AST increased was reported in 0.6% of patients treated with elinzanetant and in none of the patients treated with placebo.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

Single doses of elinzanetant up to 600 mg have been tested in clinical studies in healthy volunteers.

Adverse reactions at higher doses were similar to those observed with the therapeutic dose, but occurred slightly more often and with moderately higher intensity. Safety and tolerability of multiple once daily doses up to 240 mg over 5 days were similar compared to the recommended daily dose of 120 mg elinzanetant.

In the case of overdose, the patient should be closely monitored, and supportive treatment should be considered based on signs and symptoms.

There is no specific antidote for Lynkuet.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other gynaecologicals, other gynaecologicals, ATC code: G02CX07

## Mechanism of action

Elinzanetant is a non-hormonal, selective neurokinin 1 (NK-1) and 3 (NK-3) receptors antagonist. It blocks NK-1 and NK-3 receptors signalling on kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin (KNDy) neurons, which is postulated to normalise neuronal activity involved in thermo- and sleep regulation.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

No clinically relevant prolongation of the QTc interval was observed after single oral administration of elinzanetant at doses up to 5 times the maximum recommended dose.

In healthy premenopausal women having received elinzanetant over 21 days, results showed changes of plasma concentrations of sexual hormones (i.e. dose-related reductions of LH, oestradiol, and progesterone) and prolongation of the menstrual cycle. Changes in female sex hormones that were observed, are consistent with the anticipated pharmacological effects of elinzanetant on hypothalamic kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin neurons.

In postmenopausal women treated with elinzanetant, a transient decrease in luteinizing hormone (LH) levels was observed. No significant changes were noted in oestrogen, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone levels in this population. These effects are not clinically relevant.

## Clinical efficacy and safety

Treatment of moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause (OASIS 1-3)

The efficacy and safety of elinzanetant for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause were studied in 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase III studies (OASIS 1, 2 and 3).

In OASIS 1 and 2 a total of 796 postmenopausal women were randomised 1:1 to receive 120 mg elinzanetant or placebo once daily at bedtime for 12 weeks, followed by elinzanetant for 14 weeks, for a total treatment of up to 26 weeks. Women who had at least 50 moderate to severe VMS, including VMS at night, per week were enrolled in OASIS 1 and 2.

In OASIS 3 a total of 628 postmenopausal women were randomised 1:1 to receive 120 mg elinzanetant or placebo once daily at bedtime for 52 weeks. Inclusion did not require minimum number of VMS.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In OASIS 1 and 2 studies, the following patient demographics were balanced between treatment groups. The mean age of women was 54.6 years (range 40-65 years). Most women were White (80.4%), 17.1% Black or African American, 0.5% Asian, and 8.5% with Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The study population included postmenopausal women with spontaneous amenorrhoea for ≥ 12 consecutive months (62.1%), spontaneous amenorrhoea/hysterectomy for ≥ 6 months with FSH &gt; 40 IU/L (29.4%), or uni-/bilateral oophorectomy (20.6%). 31.4% had used prior hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

The primary efficacy endpoints in OASIS 1 and 2 were the mean change in frequency of moderate to severe VMS from baseline to weeks 4 and 12, including day and night VMS measured using hot flash daily diary (HFDD).

In OASIS 1 and 2 the women treated with elinzanetant showed statistically significant reduction in frequency of moderate to severe VMS from baseline to weeks 4 and 12 compared to placebo. Results of the change in mean frequency of moderate to severe VMS over 24 hours from OASIS 1 and 2 are shown in table 2.

In OASIS 1 and 2 the women treated with elinzanetant showed statistically significant results compared to placebo for the key secondary endpoints:

- -reduction in frequency of moderate to severe VMS from baseline to week 1
- -reduction in severity of moderate to severe VMS from baseline to weeks 4 and 12
- -improvement in PROMIS SD SF 8b total T-score (sleep disturbances) from baseline to week 12
- -improvement in MENQOL total score (menopause-related quality of life) from baseline to week 12.

The results from OASIS 1 and 2 are shown in table 3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment of moderate to severe VMS caused by adjuvant endocrine therapy (OASIS 4) The efficacy and safety of elinzanetant for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS caused by adjuvant endocrine therapy were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase III study (OASIS 4) in women with, or at high risk for, developing hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. A total of 474 women were randomised 2:1 to receive 120 mg elinzanetant or placebo once daily at bedtime for 12 weeks, followed by elinzanetant for 40 weeks, for a total treatment of up to 52 weeks. Of these, 473 women had a history of breast cancer and 1 woman had a high risk of developing breast cancer. Women who had at least 35 moderate to severe VMS, including VMS at night, per week were enrolled in OASIS 4. All women received concurrently adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen (55.4%) or aromatase inhibitors (44.6% e.g. anastrozole), both with and without the use of GnRH analogues.

The patient demographics were generally balanced between treatment groups. The mean age of women was 51 years (range 28-70 years) with 18 women (3.8%) of 65 years or older. Most women were White (88.2%), 1.5% Black or African American, 0.4% Asian, and 2.5% with Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The study population included women with prior hysterectomy (12.4%) or prior uni-/bilateral oophorectomy (12.2%).

Of the 474 women, 321 (67.7%) were classified as women of non-child-bearing potential and 153 (32.3%) were classified as women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP). In women classified as WOCBP, the use of a highly effective contraceptive method was required.

The primary efficacy endpoints were the mean change in frequency of moderate to severe VMS from baseline to weeks 4 and 12, including day and night VMS measured using HFDD.

In OASIS 4 the women treated with elinzanetant showed a statistically significant reduction in frequency of moderate to severe VMS from baseline to weeks 4 and 12 compared to placebo with a stable effect up to week 50. Results of the change in mean frequency of moderate to severe VMS over 24 hours from OASIS 4 are shown in table 4.

In OASIS 4 the women treated with elinzanetant showed statistically significant results compared to placebo for the key secondary endpoints:

- -improvement in PROMIS SD SF 8b total T-score (sleep disturbances) from baseline to week 12
- -improvement in MENQOL total score (menopause-related quality of life) from baseline to week 12.

The respective results from OASIS 4 were consistent with the results shown in patients with moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause (OASIS 1 and 2). The results of the key secondary endpoints from OASIS 4 are shown in table 5.

## Endometrial safety

Endometrial safety of elinzanetant was assessed primarily in the clinical study OASIS 3 by transvaginal ultrasound and 142 endometrial biopsies collected at 52 weeks of treatment with elinzanetant. Transvaginal ultrasound did not reveal increased endometrial thickness. There were no cases of endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy based on endometrial biopsies.

## Breast safety

In the OASIS 4 clinical study up to week 52, the reported recurrence rate of breast cancer was 0.4% in patients using tamoxifen and 1.9% in patients using aromatase inhibitors compared to 3.4% and 2.1%, respectively, in the published literature.

## Bone safety

Bone safety of elinzanetant was assessed in 343/628 women in the OASIS 3 clinical study by bone mineral density (BMD) measurements. After 52 weeks of treatment, the observed mean percentage change from baseline in BMD with elinzanetant was comparable to that with placebo and was within the expected age-related changes per year.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Lynkuet in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause or caused by adjuvant endocrine therapy related to breast cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Elinzanetant soft gel capsules show a dose-proportional increase in Cmax in the dose range 25 mg to 600 mg. The AUC increases dose-proportional in the dose range 25 mg to 120 mg and greater than dose proportional in the dose range 160 mg to 600 mg.

Steady state plasma concentrations of elinzanetant were reached 5 - 7 days after daily dosing, with &lt; 2-fold accumulation.

## Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of elinzanetant is 52%.

Administering 120 mg elinzanetant with food reduces Cmax with 60-70% and the AUC(0-24) with 20-40%, but no effect on the AUC was observed. The tmax shifted from 1-1.5 hours under fasted conditions to 3-4 hours under fed conditions. The food effect is not expected to be of clinical relevance for efficacy. Lynkuet may be administered with or without food (see section 4.2).

## Distribution

The plasma protein binding of elinzanetant is high (&gt; 99%) and is affected by circadian fluctuation. The blood-to-plasma ratio is between 0.6 and 0.7. The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration at steady state (Vss) of elinzanetant is 137 L, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. Exposure of elinzanetant in human brain was shown by clinical positron emission tomography (PET) studies.

## Biotransformation

Elinzanetant is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 to yield 3 active metabolites (M30/34 [13.7%], M27 [7.6%], M18/21 [4.9%]). Elinzanetant is also metabolised to a minor extend by CYP3A5 and UGTs. The active metabolites have similar potency for the human NK-1 and NK-3 receptors as compared to elinzanetant and contribute for &lt; 50% to the pharmacological effect. The ratio of these metabolites to parent in plasma is approximately 0.39.

## Elimination

Elinzanetant is mainly eliminated by metabolism. The clearance of elinzanetant after single intravenous dose is 8.77 L/h. Following oral administration of elinzanetant, approximately 90% of the dose was excreted with faeces (mainly as metabolites) and less than 1% with urine. The half-life of elinzanetant is approximately 45 hours in women with VMS after multiple dose and 11.2 to 33.8 hours in healthy volunteers after single dose.

## Transporter

Elinzanetant is in vitro a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter protein. No clinically relevant interaction with P-gp inhibitors and inducers is expected due to high permeability of elinzanetant through membranes and its main elimination through metabolism.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Hepatic impairment

In a clinical pharmacokinetic study, following multiple-dose administration of 120 mg elinzanetant in patients with Child-Pugh Class A (mild) chronic hepatic impairment, mean elinzanetant Cmax increased by 1.2-fold and AUC(0-24) increased by 1.5-fold, relative to healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function. In patients with Child-Pugh Class B (moderate) chronic hepatic impairment, mean elinzanetant Cmax and AUC(0-24) increased by 2.3-fold.

Elinzanetant has not been studied in patients with Child-Pugh Class C (severe) chronic hepatic impairment.

## Renal impairment

In a clinical pharmacokinetic study, following single-dose administration of 120 mg elinzanetant in patients with moderate (eGFR 30 - 59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment, mean elinzanetant Cmax, unbound increased by 2.3-fold and AUCunbound increased by 2.2-fold. In patients with severe (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment, mean elinzanetant Cmax, unbound and AUCunbound increased by 1.9-fold.

Elinzanetant has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease (eGFR &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ).

## Effects of age, race, and body weight

There are no clinically relevant effects on age (22 to 75 years), race (White, Black or African American, Asian), and body weight (45 to 129 kg) on the pharmacokinetics of elinzanetant.

## Inhibition and induction potential towards enzymes and transporters

In vitro studies indicated that at maximal intestinal concentrations elinzanetant is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and the transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP. At maximal portal vein concentrations, elinzanetant is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and 1B3. At maximal systemic concentrations, elinzanetant is a direct and time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of the transporters P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B3, and MATE1. Elinzanetant is not an inducer via AhR, CAR, or PXR at clinically relevant concentrations.

Clinical studies were performed investigating the inhibition potential of elinzanetant towards CYP3A4 (single and repeated dosing with elinzanetant) and the transporters P-gp (dabigatran etexilate) and BCRP, OATP1B1 and 1B3 (rosuvastatin). Elinzanetant is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 using midazolam as index substrate (Cmax increased 1.1- to 1.5-fold and AUC increased 1.4- to 1.8-fold). Elinzanetant did not affect the PK of dabigatran etexilate which was used as reference substrate of P-gp. Elinzanetant increased the PK of rosuvastatin (substrate of BCRP, OATP1B1 and 1B3) 1.2- to 1.3-fold.

No dedicated clinical DDI study was conducted towards MATE1. However, no effect on creatinine clearance was observed in a clinical study at supratherapeutic dosages of 600 mg. Overall, this indicates that the observed in vitro interaction potential is clinically not relevant.

In study OASIS 4, sparse blood samples were collected and concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites (N-desmethyltamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen) were investigated. No effect on the steady state plasma concentrations of tamoxifen and its metabolites were observed when co-administered with elinzanetant.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, phototoxicity, genotoxicity and abuse potential.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Systemic toxicity

Repeated dose toxicity studies were conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In female rats, daily administration of elinzanetant for 4 weeks at doses representing 40-fold the AUC(0-24) at the human therapeutic dose showed mucification of the vaginal epithelium, uterine atrophy, and persistent corpora lutea.

In a single 13-week study in rats with twice daily dosing, daily administration of elinzanetant at doses representing 4-fold (males) or 7-fold (females) the AUC(0-24) at the human therapeutic dose led to involuntary muscle contractions from day 24 in 10/88 animals, which later had also convulsions from day 34. In the same study, daily administration of elinzanetant at doses representing equal to or greater than 16-fold the AUC(0-24) at the human therapeutic dose showed skeletal muscle degeneration and necrosis. Convulsions were also observed in a 2-year rat study at doses representing equal to or greater than 20-fold the AUC(0-24) at the human therapeutic dose.

In cynomolgus monkeys, daily administration of elinzanetant for 39 weeks with twice daily dosing at doses equal to or greater than 60 mg/kg/day showed reduced cyclical ovarian activity. In the same study, administration of elinzanetant at 80 mg/kg/day showed diarrhoea. Diarrhoea was not observed at a lower dose of 60 mg/kg/day despite the 1.8-fold higher systemic exposure.

## Embryotoxicity / Teratogenicity / Reproduction toxicity

In the embryo-foetal developmental studies with elinzanetant in rats and rabbits no evidence of embryo-foetal toxicity occurred at doses resulting in exposures 16-fold and 1-fold the AUC(0-24) at the human therapeutic dose, respectively.

In the female rat fertility and early embryonic development study, increased percentage of pre-implantation and post-implantation embryo loss, resulting in reduced litter size, and lower foetal body weights were seen at the dose resulting in 16-fold the AUC(0-24) at the human therapeutic dose. These effects were not observed following dosing resulting in 4-fold the AUC(0-24) at the human therapeutic dose.

In the pre- and post-natal development studies in rats, F0 females showed post-implantation loss, increase in gestation length, delayed parturition and dystocia, as well as lower pup weights at doses resulting in 23-fold the AUC(0-24) at the human therapeutic dose (safety margin 6.7-fold at the NOAEL). Increase in total litter loss and corresponding decrease of pup viability on post-natal day 5 was observed in the range of human therapeutic exposure.

Following administration of radiolabelled elinzanetant to lactating rats, approximately 6% of the elinzanetant dose was excreted with milk.

In rats, a reduction in milk production of dams was seen at clinically relevant doses.

## Carcinogenicity

In a 2-year carcinogenicity study on elinzanetant in rats an increase in uterine neoplasms and lymphomas was reported. The findings were seen at a dose representing at least 29-fold the total AUC(0-24) at the human therapeutic dose, and are thus not considered clinically relevant. These effects were not observed at a dose representing 7-fold the total AUC(0-24) at the human therapeutic dose. The increased incidence of uterine neoplasms in aged rats undergoing reproductive senescence with pronounced body weight reduction resembles effects observed in dietary restriction studies in rats and chronic, drug-induced hypoprolactinaemia, a rat-specific mode of action, which is not relevant for humans.

No drug-related neoplasms were observed up to the highest dose of 3-fold (males) or 2-fold (females) the AUC(0-24) at the human therapeutic dose in the 26-week carcinogenicity study on elinzanetant in transgenic mice.

- -Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- -If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- -This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.

1. What Lynkuet is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you take Lynkuet
3. How to take Lynkuet
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store Lynkuet
6. Contents of the pack and other information

## 1. What Lynkuet is and what it is used for

Lynkuet contains the active substance elinzanetant. It is a non-hormonal medicine.

## It is used to treat moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms :

- -associated with menopause
- -
- caused by so-called adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer. These are anti-hormonal medicines (such as tamoxifen or anastrozole) that prevent cancer from
- coming back after anti-cancer treatment.

Vasomotor symptoms are sudden feelings of warmth or intense heat, mainly in the face, neck and chest and sweating during day or night, also called hot flashes or night sweats.

## How Lynkuet works

The active substance in Lynkuet, elinzanetant, works by blocking the activity of certain nerve cells in the brain (so-called Kisspeptin/Neurokinin B/Dynorphin neurons) that are involved in regulating body temperature and sleep. By blocking these nerve cells, Lynkuet helps to control hot flashes and night sweats.

## 2. What you need to know before you take Lynkuet

## Do not take Lynkuet if

- -you are allergic to elinzanetant or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
- -you are pregnant or think you might be pregnant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Lynkuet, if

- -you are taking certain medicines that keep the CYP3A4 liver enzyme from working properly. These medicines may cause Lynkuet to stay longer in your body, which may increase the risk of side effects. Examples are medicines used to treat infections such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, cobicistat or to treat breast cancer such as ribociclib.
- -you are taking hormone replacement therapy with oestrogens (medicines used to treat oeastrogen deficiency symptoms).

If you are unsure if you are taking such medicines, talk to your doctor.

## Children and adolescents

This medicine is not for use in children and adolescents under 18 years.

## Other medicines and Lynkuet

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained with or without prescription, or over the counter medicines such as vitamins, dietary supplements or herbal medicines.

Certain medicines may influence how Lynkuet works, or Lynkuet may influence how these medicines work. These may include medicines to:

- -treat fungal or bacterial infections such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, fluconazole
- -treat HIV infections such as ritonavir, cobicistat
- -treat breast cancer such as ribociclib
- -treat high blood pressure, chest pain and fast heartbeat such as verapamil
- -prevent organ rejection after transplantation such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus
- -treat long-term pain such as fentanyl

## Lynkuet with food and drink

Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice as long as you take this medicine. This is because grapefruit also keeps the CYP3A4 enzyme from working properly and may cause Lynkuet to stay longer in your body. This may increase the risk of side effects.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Do not take this medicine if you are pregnant, or if you think you might be pregnant.

If you could get pregnant, you or your partner should use an effective birth control method to prevent pregnancy while you are taking this medicine. Ask your doctor about the best method of birth control for you.

## 3. How to take Lynkuet

Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you take more Lynkuet than you should

Taking too much Lynkuet may make side effects more likely or more severe. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken too much of this medicine.

## If you forget to take Lynkuet

If you missed a dose at bedtime, take the next dose as planned on the following day. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

## If you stop taking Lynkuet
