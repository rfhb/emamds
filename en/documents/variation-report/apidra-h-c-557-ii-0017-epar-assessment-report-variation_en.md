## 1. Introduction

Insulin  glulisine  (Apidra,  3B  Lys-29B  Glu  -human  insulin)  is  a  recombinant  rapid-acting  insulin analog produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli (E. coli). It differs from human insulin  by  two  amino-acid  substitution  on  the  B  chain  of  the  protein  (replacement  of  asparagine  in position B3 by lysine and lysine in position B29 by glutamic acid). Thus, insulin glulisine is a close structural relative to human insulin.

Apidra  was  authorised  by  the  centralised  procedure  (EU/1/04/285)  in  27  September  2004  for  the treatment of adult patients with diabetes mellitus.

In this Type II variation the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied to add a new indication to the Apidra SPC. The proposed therapeutic indication was for the use of Apidra in: 'adolescents and children  of  4  years  or  above  with  diabetes  mellitus,  where  treatment  with  insulin  is  required'. The  MAH  proposed  to  make  changes  to  sections  4.1,  4.2  and  5.1  of  the  SPC  to  reflect  the  new indication.

In support of the indication results of two clinical trials have been submitted (Study HMR1964D/3001 and HMR1964A/1017).

## 2 Clinical aspects

## 2.1 Clinical efficacy

The clinical documentation consists of two clinical studies:

Study HMR1964D/3001 that investigated the efficacy and safety of insulin glulisine compared with insulin lispro in children and adolescents with type I diabetes mellitus: a 26-week, multicentre, open, parallel-group clinical trial.

Study  HMR1964A/1017 that  studied  the  pharmacokinetics  and  safety  of  0.15  IU/kg  HMR1964 (insulin  glulisine)  and  regular  human  insulin  injected  subcutaneously  as  a  single  dose  in  paediatric subjects with type 1 diabetes in a single-centre, double-blind, randomised, two-way crossover study.

## 2.1.1 Study HMR1964D/3001

This  study  was  a  multicentre,  multinational,  open,  parallel-group,  controlled,  1:1  randomised  study with a run-in phase of 4 weeks, and a treatment phase of 26 weeks with a total of 572 male and female patients  with  type  1  diabetes  (aged  4  to  17  years),  carried  out  between  12  April  2005  and  03 November 2006.

The  MAH  stated  that  'According  to  Article  8.3  (ib)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended,  the applicant confirms that clinical trials carried out outside the European Union met ethical requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice, applicable national laws and regulations and the ethical principles of Directive 2001/20/EC.'

## 2.1.1.1 Study design

Study HMR1964D/3001 was a multicentre, multinational, open-label, controlled, centrally randomised (1:1),  stratified,  parallel-group  study  in  children  and  adolescents  with  type  1  diabetes  mellitus  aged between 4 and 17 years. The study consisted, after a screening period of about 1 week, of a run-in phase of 4 weeks followed by a 26-week treatment phase, and by a 24-hour follow-up period.

Subjects  were  stratified  within  each  centre  according  to  whether  they  were  taking  NPH  or  insulin glargine as basal insulin at the time of randomisation. During the study, insulin glulisine or insulin lispro  was  given  at  least  twice  daily  within  15  minutes  prior  to  a  meal  in  combination  with  NPH insulin administered twice daily or insulin glargine administered once daily in the evening. Total study duration was approximately 31 weeks. Male and female patients aged 4-17 years with established type 1  diabetes  mellitus  with  an  onset  of  at  least  one  year  prior  to  screening,  an  uninterrupted  insulin therapy for at least one year on a stable insulin regimen consisting of either NPH or insulin glargine as the  basal  insulin,  willing  to  have  multiple  daily  injections  of  insulin,  with  a  glycated  haemoglobin (HbA1c) value in the range of ≥ 6.0  and ≤ 11.0%, able and willing to perform blood glucose (BG) monitoring, were eligible to participate in the study.

A total of 646 subjects were screened, 572 randomised with 276 subjects randomised into the glulisine group and 295 randomised into the lispro group. Of these, a total of 265 subjects completed the study with glulisine and 287 subjects completed with lispro. One subject randomised in the insulin lispro group  was treated by error in the insulin glulisine group; he was therefore considered in the insulin glulisine group for all analyses and excluded from the PP population. Thus, 277 subjects were treated in the insulin glulisine group and 295 in the insulin lispro group.

The  primary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  of  insulin  glulisine  compared  to  insulin lispro in the change in total glycated haemoglobin (GHb) from baseline to endpoint (week 26 or last observation on treatment) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Secondary  objectives  were  to  compare  insulin  glulisine  with  insulin  lispro  in  terms  of  secondary efficacy parameters (change in GHb at week 12 and week 26, self-monitored blood glucose [SMBG] parameters, symptomatic hypoglycaemia and insulin doses) and safety (adverse events [AEs], serious symptomatic hypoglycaemia, clinical chemistry and  haematology,  as  well  as  insulin  antibodies),  in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Overall, the mean age of subjects was 12.5 years. Approximately 7 % of subjects were &lt;8 years (1.6% &lt;6 years), 26% were between 8 and 12 years old, and 67% were above 12 years. Overall, the mean BMI was 20.6 kg/m².

## Treatments

Insulin  glulisine  (3mL  cartridges  and  10mL  vials),  individual  titration  based  on  the  BG  values. Subjects were administered a subcutaneous injection between 0 to 15 minutes prior to a meal, at least twice daily, in association with basal insulin therapy (NPH insulin or insulin glargine).

Insulin lispro (3mL cartridges and 10mL vials), individual titration based on the BG values. Subjects were administered a subcutaneous injection between 0 to 15 minutes prior to a meal, at least twice daily, in association with basal insulin therapy (NPH insulin or insulin glargine).

BG targets were adapted to the age of the subjects (&lt;8 years or ≥ 8 years) and to the BG meters used (plasma-referenced or whole blood-referenced). Details are provided below.

The doses of insulin glulisine or insulin lispro were to be titrated based on the pre-meal BG values and those of insulin glargine or NPH insulin based on the fasting BG (FBG) and pre-meal BG values.

The two treatment groups had a similar distribution for  diabetes  duration  (5.2 to  5.3  years),  age  at diagnosis (7.2 to 7.5 years), and duration of insulin treatment (5.2 to 5.3 years).

The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  design,  which  is  similar  to  that  of  the  adult  studies  submitted previously, and analysis of the study are in accordance with the European Guidelines.

## 2.1.1.2 Results

## Primary Efficacy Variable Analysis

The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  the  change  in  GHb  from  baseline  to  endpoint  using  the  mITT population,  where  endpoint  was  defined  as  the  subject's  last  available  measurement  during  the treatment phase. The PP population was analysed to check for the consistency of the results with the mITT population.

*Standard deviation (SD) for mean and standard error (SE) for adjusted mean from ANCOVA model

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The results appear to support the non-inferiority conclusion of insulin glulisine compared to insulin lispro. Nevertheless, CHMP initially had some concern over the effect on the analysis of the algorithm used for pooling small centres and whether the analysis was affected by empty strata within centres. The concern was in particular related to the fact that the results might be biased in favour of Apidra due to the chosen method of handling small centres.

In their responses to this concern the MAH provided a number of analyses of the primary variable that indicated that the upper limit of the 95% CIs for the difference in adjusted means for change from baseline at endpoint in HbA1c are well below the non-inferiority limit of 0,4%. These results were consistent  with  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  and  with  previous  results  of  sensitivity  analyses.  The MAH therefore concluded that the strategy of pooling centres did not induce any bias in favour of Apidra. The CHMP agreed with the MAH conclusions.

## Secondary Efficacy Variable Analysis

There  were  no  changes  from  baseline  in  GHb  at  week  12  and  a  minimal  increase  in  GHb  in  both groups  at  week  26  (+0.08%  in  the  insulin  glulisine  group,  +0.17%  in  the  insulin  lispro  group). The change from baseline at each time-point in the two treatment groups was similar to the change observed for the primary analysis at endpoint. The 95% CIs of the between-treatment difference are consistent with the conclusion of non-inferiority as defined for the primary efficacy variable.

Post-prandial glycaemic control, as assessed by self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) values and BG excursions,  was  similar  in  the  two  treatment  groups  at  endpoint,  with  no  statistically  significant difference  between  the  treatment  groups.  At  endpoint,  subjects  treated  with  insulin  lispro  required significantly greater increases from baseline in basal, rapid-acting and total insulin daily doses in order to achieve similar glycaemic control than subjects treated with insulin glulisine.

There  were  no  noteworthy  differences  between  the  two  treatment  groups  in  the  incidence  of  all symptomatic hypoglycaemia, severe symptomatic hypoglycaemia, and severe nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycaemia.  The  incidence  of  nocturnal  symptomatic  hypoglycaemia  was  higher  in  the  insulin glulisine group than the insulin lispro group in the time period 'entire treatment phase'; this betweengroup difference was mainly observed in the first month of treatment and decreased in the latter part of the treatment phase.

## 2.1.2 Study HMR1964A/1017

This study was a single-centre, double-blind, randomised, two-way crossover study to investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety of 0.15 IU/kg HMR1964 (insulin glulisine) and regular human insulin injected subcutaneously as a single dose in paediatric subjects with type I diabetes.

## 2.1.2.1 Study design

Study HMR1964A/1017  was  a  single-centre,  single-dose, double-blind, randomised,  two-way crossover study design in subjects with type 1 diabetic. All subjects were to be girls or boys aged 5-11 years and 12-17 years with established type 1 diabetes mellitus with an onset of at least one year prior to screening and stable insulin regimen for at least two years prior to study conduct, body weight not less than 20kg, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤ 11.0%, daily insulin dose ≥ 0.5 U/kg, normal findings in  medical  history  and  physical  examination  and  normal  laboratory  values.  The  subjects  were randomised to treatment sequences in a stratified manner with age class as the stratification factor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subjects treated with common individualised paediatric antidiabetic regimen employing insulins were to be included. The study consisted of four trial periods as follows: Trial period 0 (screening), Trial periods 1 and 2 (treatment) and Trial period 3(follow-up examination). At trial periods 1 and 2 each subject received 0.15 IU/kg  insulin glulisine or 0.15 IU/kg  regular human  insulin, injected subcutaneously in the periumbilical abdomen, according to the randomisation schedule.

A total of 20 subjects were enrolled and treated in the study. Ten subjects were children aged between 5 and 11 years and 10 subjects were adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years. All 20 subjects were evaluable for safety and pharmacodynamics. Nineteen subjects were fully evaluable for pharmacokinetics.

The primary objective was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin  (HOE31HPR100)  in  paediatric  type  1  diabetic  subjects.  The  secondary  objectives  were  to investigate prandial glucose profiles of insulin glulisine and regular human insulin (HOE31HPR100) administered before a standardised meal in paediatric type 1 diabetic subjects and to investigate the safety following a single subcutaneous dose of insulin glulisine in paediatric type 1 diabetic subjects.

Overall, the mean age of subjects was 12.4 years and the mean BMI was 20.9 kg/m².

Median

In  both  age  classes,  children  (5  to  11  years,  inclusive)  and  adolescents  (12  to  17  years,  inclusive), insulin  glulisine  was  more  rapidly  absorbed  than  RHI.  The  concentration  time  profile  of  insulin glulisine showed initial fractional areas under the curves (AUCs) being higher after insulin glulisine. The maximum concentration (Cmax) of insulin glulisine was 71% higher and was reached earlier, with a median Tmax of 54 minutes, compared to 66 minutes after regular insulin (RHI). The mean residence time (MRT) for insulin glulisine was distinctly shorter, at 88 minutes compared to 137 minutes for RHI.

- Maximum blood glucose excursion from baseline ( ∆ GLUmax, mg/dL)
- Maximum blood glucose concentration (GLUmax, mg/dL)
- Minimum blood glucose concentration (GLUmin, mg/dL)
- Time to minimum blood glucose concentration (tmin, min)

Additional analyses of glucose exposure and excursion were confined to data obtained within 4 hours after injection.

- Time to maximum baseline subtracted glucose concentration within 4 hours (tmax-4h, min)
- Maximum blood glucose excursion from baseline within 4 hours ( ∆ GLUmax-4h, mg/dL)
- Maximum blood glucose concentration within 4 hours (GLUmax-4h, mg/dL)

*★ Median

Blood  glucose  exposure  and  excursions  were  lower  (AUCs,  GLUmax-4h  and ∆ GLUmax-4h)  after insulin glulisine than after RHI, when given immediately before meal, in the paediatric population as a whole as well as in both age classes, children and adolescents.

## 2.1.2.3 Conclusions on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic

Insulin  glulisine  displays  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  properties  in  paediatric  type  1 diabetic  patients,  which  in  this  population  also,  classify  insulin  glulisine  as  a  rapid-acting  insulin analogue  and  which  do  not  differ  from  adult  data.  The  CHMP  considered  that  there  is  adequate evidence to show that the results from this study are in agreement with those of the adult population.

## 2.2. Clinical safety

## 2.2.1. Study HMR1964D/3001

## Extent of Exposure

A total of 572 subjects were treated with study medication: 277 with insulin glulisine and 295 with insulin lispro. The mean treatment duration was 176.6 (±27.0) days in the insulin glulisine group and 178.9 (±18.7) days in the insulin lispro group.

## Adverse Events

In general, both insulin glulisine and insulin lispro were well tolerated and overall, the kind, intensity and  frequency  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  were  similar  in  the  two  treatment groups.  A  total  of  148  (53.4%)  glulisine  subjects  and  173  (58.6%)  lispro  subjects  had  at  least  one reported TEAE. Possibly related TEAEs were reported in 25 (9.0%) glulisine and 28 (9.5%) lispro subjects. A total of 30 (10.8%) glulisine and 37 (12.5%) lispro subjects reported at least one serious TEAE.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no noteworthy differences between treatment groups in the number of subjects reporting hypoglycaemia  as  a  serious  adverse  event  (SAE),  including  events  of  coma/unconsciousness  or seizures associated with hypoglycaemia. The percentage of subjects with hypoglycaemia reported as SAEs was 7.2% in the insulin glulisine group, and 8.1% in the insulin lispro group. A summary of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) is presented below.

Similar percentages of subjects in the two treatment groups had possibly related TEAEs. The most common  possibly  related  preferred  terms  were  related  to  the  underlying  disease  (hypoglycaemic seizure, hypoglycaemia NOS, and hypoglycaemic coma) or to treatment of the disease (injection site hypertrophy). Similar percentages of subjects in the two treatment groups experienced these possiblyrelated  preferred  terms.  All  other  possibly  related  preferred  terms  occurred  in ≤ 2  subjects  in  either treatment group.

## Deaths, serious adverse events and other significant adverse events

There were no deaths. The number of SAEs reported for two treatment groups was similar with 30 subjects  (10.8%)  in  the  insulin  glulisine  group  and  37  subjects  (12.5%)  in  the  insulin  lispro  group. There  were  no  noteworthy  differences  between  the  two  groups  with  respect  to  the  types  of  SAEs. None of the SAEs led to discontinuation of the subjects from the study. There were no noteworthy differences  between  the  treatment  groups  in  the  numbers/percentages  of  subjects  experiencing hypoglycaemia  reported  as  SAEs,  including  events  of  coma/unconsciousness  or  seizures  associated with hypoglycaemia. The overall frequency of serious hypoglycaemic events was 7.2% (20 subjects) in the insulin glulisine group, and 8.1% (24 subjects) in the insulin lispro group.

## Withdrawals

One subject in the insulin glulisine group was withdrawn from this study due to a non-serious adverse event of injection site swelling, which was possibly related to study medication.

## Other  AES

A slightly higher percentage of subjects in the insulin glulisine group experienced potential systemic hypersensitivity reactions (8 subjects, i.e. 2.9% insulin glulisine, versus 3 subjects, i.e. 1.0% insulin lispro). All potential systemic hypersensitivity events were mild or moderate in intensity. None were considered possibly related to study medication, and no subjects discontinued treatment due to a hypersensitivity reaction. In all but two cases, the outcome was coded as recovered without sequelae; in the remaining two cases, the outcome was unknown (TEAEs of asthma and seasonal allergy). Potential systemic hypersensitivity reactions are summarised below.

## Significant overdose

Three subjects reported accidental overdoses during the treatment phase of the study.

## Clinical Laboratory Evaluations

Comparison of mean and median values for clinical laboratory values, as well as mean and median change in values, showed no relevant differences between the treatment groups.

## Cross-reactive insulin antibodies

In the insulin glulisine group, there was an increase in the median cross-reactive antibody values which was maximal at week 12 (+0.540% B/T) and then decreased between week 12 and endpoint (+0.260% B/T). In the insulin lispro group, there was a decrease in the median value at endpoint (0.190% B/T). Overall, no correlation was found between cross-reactive antibody levels and changes seen in GHb levels, insulin doses, or in symptomatic and severe symptomatic hypoglycemia.

## 2.2.2 Study HMR1964A/1017

## Adverse Events

A total of 19 AEs were reported by nine patients (seven adolescents and two children) over the entire study  period.  The  most  common  adverse  events  were  upper  respiratory  infection  (five  events)  and rhinitis (four events). All events were mild in intensity and patients recovered without sequelae. Only one AE was assessed as possibly related: this was a case of mild urticaria on the face, which occurred after RHI administration.

Only hypoglycaemia confirmed by a BG value below 50 mg/dL (=2.8 mmol/L), whether symptomatic or  not,  was  recorded  and  analysed.  Twelve  patients  had  symptomatic  hypoglycaemia  (18  events) during  the  study,  which  in  nine  patients  occurred  before  administration  of  study  medication. Countermeasures were confined to oral carbohydrates with the exception of one patient, who received an electrolyte-glucose infusion to prevent imminent nocturnal hypoglycaemia about nine hours before administration of insulin glulisine. There were no cases of severe hypoglycaemia.

## Deaths, serious adverse events and other significant adverse events

There  were  no  deaths,  no  SAEs,  no  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal,  no  hypoglycaemia  reported  as  a serious TEAE, no eye abnormalities and no episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis reported in this study. No clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory variables were observed.

## 2.2.3 Conclusions on safety

The CHMP considered that there was sufficient evidence to characterise the safety profile of Apidra in the  paediatric  population  aged  8  to  17  years  of  age  and  that  this  safety  profile  was  acceptable. However,  only  22  and  19  patients  under  the  age  of  8  years  old  had  been  randomised  to  insulin glulisine and lispro, respectively. The CHMP therefore considered that the analysis of the subgroup of younger patients did not provide reliable evidence for the consistency of the results in patients at the lower end of the range studied.

In  their  response  to this  concern  the  MAH proposed to lower this age limit to 6 years instead of 8 years, arguing that in the age category ≥ 6 and &lt; 8 years the number of subjects studied was 32 (18 in the glulisine group and 14 in the lispro group). Although relatively low, this number corresponds to 6.5% of the population exposed in the glulisine group and is consistent with the current epidemiologic data available for this age category. The MAH argued that it seems possible to extrapolate the data observed for the population over 8 years exposed in the study to the particular age category ≥ 6 and &lt; 8 years. The MAH also put forward that according to general experience in insulin therapy, there is no medical rationale supporting a difference in efficacy when considering the paediatric population below or above the age of 8 years.

The CHMP acknowledged the MAH arguments and agreed to an indication in the age group 6 to 17 years  of  age.  However,  since  experience  in  the  younger  children  is  regarded  as  limited  while  the incidence of serious hypoglycaemia was somewhat higher in the younger subgroups of the trial, the MAH was requested to undertake certain activities as defined in the RMP (section 2.4) and in the list of follow-up measures in order to gain further knowledge in the younger patients.

## 2.3 SPC and PL

Further to the new indication, the SPC sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 have been updated. Sections 1 and 2 of the PL have been updated accordingly. Annex II has been updated to include the revised PSUR cycle.

## 2.4 Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Plan

The MAH did not consider there was a need for a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for this application, as  it  was  to  extend  the  target  population  in  an  approved  indication,  and  there  were  no  new  or unexpected safety signals identified in the newly submitted data. However, within this type II variation procedure the CHMP considered a RMP to be necessary in view of the still limited data in the younger population. The MAH was therefore requested to submit a RMP. A summary of the RMP is presented in the table below.

The CHMP, having assessed the data submitted in the application, was of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

## 3. OVERALL CONCLUSION AND BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT

The MAH submitted one pharmacokinetic study and one safety and efficacy clinical trial in support of the  proposed  extension  of indication  to  the  treatment  of  adolescents  and  children  of  4  years  old  or above with diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required.

The data provided for children below 6 years of age were regarded by the CHMP as too limited but it was considered acceptable to extrapolate the results observed in the study population over 8 years to the subgroup of children aged between 6 and 8 years.

The CHMP was therefore of the opinion that the benefit-risk is positive for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in the  adolescents  and  children  from  the age  of  6  years.  However,  in  order  to  gain  further knowledge in the younger patients the MAH is to undertake certain activities as defined in the RMP (section  2.4)  and  in  the  list  of  follow-up  measures.  In  particular  the  MAH  is  to  submit  6  monthly PSURs until the renewal of the marketing authorisation.
