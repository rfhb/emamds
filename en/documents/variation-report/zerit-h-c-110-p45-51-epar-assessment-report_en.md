Conclusion: Studies 338 and 366 do not add any relevant information regarding efficacy and safety of stavudine in paediatric patients.

RECOMMENDATION The MAH submitted two completed paediatric studies for Zerit , in accordance with Article 45 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products for paediatric use. These studies do not change the benefit-risk for the use of Zerit in paediatric patients, and are not relevant for the Summary of Product Characteristics. Assessment ACTG 338, performed in 1997-1998, randomized (1:1:1) 297 'clinically stable' children, treatment experienced but naïve to protease inhibitors, and with ongoing ART (unchanged for at least the last 4 months) to: zidovudine + lamivudine or stavudine (1 mg/kg bid) + full dose ritonavir or Zidovudine+lamivudine + full dose ritonavir. Efficacy in this trial is, naturally, of low interest today. No significant differences in worst degree of toxicity were noted between arms, and no deaths occurred. (Study published in JAMA 2000, Jan 26;283(4):492-8.) ACTG 366 was performed in 1998-2000, and included treatment experienced children and adolescents from the age of 6 months and with rapidly progressive HIV infection (n=200). Various regimens could be used, depending on treatment history, ie patients were not randomized to any specific combination of antiretrovirals. Stavudine was part of the regimen for around 60% of the patients. (Study published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases 2005; 192:296-302) edicinal product no longer authorise
