- The  Rapporteur's  first  Assessment  Report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  members  on  20  June 2001. The Co-Rapporteur's first Assessment Report was circulated to all CPMP members on 6 July 2001.
- During the meeting on July 2001, the CPMP agreed on the consolidated List of Questions to be sent to the applicant. The final consolidated List of Questions was sent to the applicant on 31 July 2001.

- The  preliminary  report  of  the  inspection  carried  out  at  the  manufacturing  site  Ortho  McNeil Pharmaceutical  Inc.,  1000  Route  202  South  Raritan,  New  Jersey  08869  United  States  of America on 1 February 2002 was issued on 15 February 2002.
- The  preliminary  report  of  the  inspection  carried  out  at  the  manufacturing  site  Ortho  McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc., Drug Delivery Division, 701 Galveston Drive Redwood City, CA 94063, United States of America 28 January 2002 was issued on 15 February 2002.

- During  its  19-21  March  2002  meeting,  further  to  comments  received  from  independent environmental researchers, the CPMP agreed on the necessity to further evaluate the potential risks and environmental implications of the disposal of EVRA and to revise the CPMP opinion, if necessary. The applicant provided therefore supplementary information on the environmental

risk analysis associated with EVRA on 2 April 2002. The Rapporteur circulated an assessment report to all CPMP members on 11 April 2002.

- On 24 April 2002, the CPMP sent a letter to the European Commission to seek clarification on the legal framework with respect to the role of the environmental risk assessment of a medicinal product in the overall benefit/risk ratio assessment and the potential consequences in terms of the granting of a marketing authorisation before reaching a final recommendation.
- The European Commission provided the CPMP on 18 May 2002 with a written letter clarifying that,  according to the current pharmaceutical legislation, the environmental risk assessment is not  a  criterion  to  be  taken  into  account  when  recommending  the  granting  of  a  marketing authorisation. It foresees, however, that if applicable, reasons for any precautionary and safety measures to be taken for the storage of the medicinal product, its administration to patients and for the disposal of waste products, together with the indication of any potential risks presented by the medicinal product for the environment should be considered.
- During  the  meeting  in  May  2002,  the  CPMP,  in  the  light  of  the  information  submitted,  the current  legislative  framework  and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  agreed  to revise  the  sections  4.2  and  6.6  of  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  to  include  new recommendations on the disposal of the patch and to amend the Labelling and Package Leaflet accordingly. In addition, at the request of the CPMP, the applicant undertook to include in the package prior to marketing the product in the European Union an appropriate disposal container for used patches. The applicant provided on 28 May 2002 a supplementary letter of undertaking to the one already adopted in February 2002. The CPMP adopted therefore a revised opinion by 27  out  of  27  votes  with  1  abstention  for  granting  a  Marketing  Authorisation  to  EVRA, transdermal patch on 30 May 2002.
- The CPMP opinions were forwarded, in all official languages of the European Union, to the European Commission, which issued the corresponding Decision on 22 August 2002.
