In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make a minor correction in SmPC section 5.1 and to implement changes in the annexes in accordance with QRD template 10.1. The MAH provided an updated RMP version 9.0 as part of the application.

In order to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemias at the time of transfer, individual patient characteristics needs be taken into consideration. Therefore, the current recommendation in the SmPC of a starting dose of 16 dose steps has been amended to reflect the fact that although the recommended starting dose should not be exceeded, it may need to be reduced to avoid hypoglycaemia in selected cases. The benefit-risk balance of Xultophy, remains positive.   |

A new needle must always be attached before each use. Needles must not be re-used. The re-use of insulin pen needles increases the risk of blocked needles, which may cause under- or overdosing. In the event of blocked needles, patients must follow the instructions described in the instructions for use accompanying the package leaflet. The above warnings do not apply to the cartridge presentations of the medicine. |

| II/0017             | Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC in order to update the information on use of Xultophy in patients with hepatic impairment, based on clinical trial NN2211- 1328, the LEAD 1-6 meta-analysis as well as other liraglutide trials. In addition, 'fatigue' has been added to the tabulated list of adverse reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. RMP version 6.0 has also been submitted. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10. The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

The Posology section now clarifies that 'Xultophy can be used in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Glucose monitoring is to be intensified and the dose adjusted on an individual basis. Due to the liraglutide component, Xultophy is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.' |
