## 1. Introduction

On 9 th  of December 2021, the MAH submitted a completed study, PYC1140, containing two paediatric/ adolescent patients, for Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Study PYC1140 has been submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. The study is part of the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD), which is not an authorized indication within the EU.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study&lt;ies&gt;

Imbruvica (140mg capsule, 140-, 280-, 420- and 560 mg film-coated tablet)

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for:

- Study PCYC-1140; A Randomized, Double-Blind Phase 3 Study of Ibrutinib in Combination With Corticosteroids versus Placebo in Combination With Corticosteroids in Subjects with New Onset Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD). The study includes two paediatric/adolescent patients aged ≥12 -18 years.

Ibrutinib is an orally administered, covalently binding inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). It was first approved in the EU in October 2014. It is currently approved for use in adult patients with the following blood cancers:

- Mantle cell lymphoma in patients whose disease does not respond to or has come back after previous treatment.
- Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in both previously treated and untreated patients.
- Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia (also known as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma).

Study PCYC-1140 is part of the PIP for ibrutinib for cGvHD. The PIP includes one additional clinical study, Study PCYC-146-IM, with planned completion date Sep 2024. Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD) is not an authorized indication in the EU. Study PCYC-1140 includes only noninformative data from two paediatric/adolescent patients a ged ≥12 -18 with cGvHD.

No updates to the SmPC and package leaflet are proposed by the MAH in association with this final analysis of study PCYC-1140.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study PCYC-1140 (study 1140):

A Randomized, Double-Blind Phase 3 Study of Ibrutinib in Combination With Corticosteroids versus Placebo in Combination With Corticosteroids in Subjects with New Onset Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD).

## Description

Study 1140 was a Phase 3, multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral ibrutinib in combination with prednisone vs. placebo in combination with prednisone in subjects with treatment-naive chronic graft vs. host disease (cGVHD). Study 1140 was conducted in subjects ≥ 12 years of age with cGVHD.

Study 1140 was initiated on 11 May 2017. The primary analysis was based on a data extract date of 30 March 2020 (approximately 1 year after the last subject was randomized) and the final analysis based on a data extract date of 12 July 2021, ie, with approximately 16 months of additional follow-up.

A total of 193 subjects (adult, ≥ 18 years: n=191; adolescent, ≥ 12 to &lt;18 years: n=2) with treatment naive, moderate or severe cGVHD were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral ibrutinib 420 mg daily (3 capsules) (Arm A) or matching placebo daily (3 capsules) (Arm B) both in combination with prednisone starting at 1 mg/kg/day.

## Assessor's comment:

No conclusions on efficacy or safety of ibrutinib in paediatric patients with cGvHD can be drawn based on results of only two adolescent patients included in Study PYC1140. Furthermore, cGVHD is not an authorized indication in the EU. Hence, the submission of the final report of Study 1140 has no regulatory consequence.

## 3. Overall conclusion and recommendation

No conclusions on efficacy or safety of ibrutinib in paediatric patients with cGvHD can be drawn based on results of only two adolescent patients included in Study PYC1140. Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD) is not an authorized indication in the EU.

Accordingly, the data submitted does not change the risk benefit balance of ibrutinib and there is no regulatory consequence.
