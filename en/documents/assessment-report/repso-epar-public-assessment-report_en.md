## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Repso is a generic medicinal product containing leflunomide as active substance. Two strengths have been developed; 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets. The reference medicinal product Arava has been  centrally  authorized  on  2  September  1999  and  is  currently  available  as  10  mg,  20  mg  and 100 mg film-coated tablets.

Leflunomide  is  an  immunomodulator  with  anti-inflammatory,  analgesic,  and  antipyretic  activity mediated  primarily  through  inhibition  of  dihyroorotate  dehydrogenase,  an  enzyme  required  for  the de novo production of pyrimidine. Leflunomide is a prodrug which is rapidly metabolized to its active metabolite  which  possesses  symptom-,  inflammation-  and  structure-modifying  activities  in  patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. It has been approved as a DMARD (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug) for use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the European Union.

The  approved  indication  for  Repso  is  identical  to  the  current  indication  of  the  reference  medicinal product Arava: Leflunomide is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with: - active rheumatoid arthritis as a \"disease-modifying antirheumatic drug\" (DMARD), - active psoriatic arthritis. Recent or concurrent treatment with hepatotoxic or haematotoxic DMARDs (e.g. methotrexate) may result  in  an  increased  risk  of  serious  adverse  reactions;  therefore,  the  initiation  of  leflunomide treatment has to be carefully considered regarding these benefit/risk aspects. Moreover, switching from leflunomide to another DMARD without following the washout procedure may also increase the risk of serious adverse reactions even for a long time after the switching. The recommended dose for a therapy with leflunomide in rheumatoid arthritis is started with a loading dose of 100 mg once daily for 3 days. The recommended maintenance dose for rheumatoid arthritis is leflunomide  10  mg  to  20  mg  once  daily.  Patients  may  be  started  on  leflunomide  10  mg  or  20  mg depending  on  the  severity  (activity)  of  the  disease.  The  recommended  dose  for  a  therapy  with leflunomide for patients with psoriatic arthritis is started with a loading dose of 100 mg once daily for 3 days. The recommended maintenance dose for patients with psoriatic arthritis is 20 mg once daily. The  applicant  has  developed  leflunomide  film-coated  tablets  of  10 mg  and  20 mg  strength  and  has shown  bioequivalence  with  the  reference  medicinal  product  Arava.  All  the  clinical  and  non-clinical experience on Arava is therefore relevant for Repso film-coated tablets. According to the legislation the applicant  is  not  required  to  provide  the  results  of  pre-clinical  tests  and  clinical  trials  if  it  is demonstrated that the proposed medicinal product is a generic of a reference medicinal product which is authorised for 6/10 years in a Member State or in the Community. During the evaluation of this marketing authorisation application, the applicant changed the proposed invented name of this medicinal product from Leflunomide Teva to the invented name Repso.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

Repso is presented as film-coated tablets containing leflunomide as active substance. Two strengths have been developed: 10 mg and 20 mg. Other ingredients are defined in the SmPC, section 6.1. The

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

film-coated  tablets  are  packed  in  a  HDPE  bottle  with  screw  cap  with  integrated  desiccant  or  in aluminium blisters.

## 2.2.2. Active Substance

The  chemical  name  of  leflunomide  is  5-Methyl-N-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]isoxazole-4-carboxamide with molecular formula C12H9F3N2O2 and relative molecular mass 270.2 g/mol. It appears as a white or almost white crystalline powder and is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in methanol and sparingly soluble in methylene chloride. Leflunomide is not hygroscopic, does not contain any chiral centres, hence it does not have optical isomers. Leflunomide shows polymorphism. However, only one polymorphic form is consistently formed during the active substance manufacturing and is used in the manufacture of the medicinal product. There is a monograph of leflunomide in the Ph.Eur.

Manufacture At the time of the CHMP opinion, the active substance leflunomide used for Repso is supplied by one active  substance  manufacturer.  Because  no  Ph.Eur  certificate  of  suitability  has  been  issued  for  the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier, detailed information about the manufacturing process, control of starting materials, reagents and solvents, control of critical steps and intermediates and process development and process validation of the active substance has been supplied in the form of an active substance master file (ASMF). All manufacturing steps are adequately described. Adequate in  process  controls  are  in  place  and  appropriate  specifications  have  been  adopted  for  the  starting materials, solvents and reagents. All relevant impurities, degradation products and residual solvents have been appropriately characterized. Specification The active substance specifications proposed by the active substance manufacturer comply with the Ph.Eur  monograph  for  leflunomide  and  include  additional  in-house  methods  to  test  for  polymorphic purity, melting range, impurities (HPLC) and residual solvents (GC). The active substance specifications proposed by the medicinal product manufacturer comply with the Ph.Eur monograph for leflunomide  and  include  additional  parameters  such  as  tests  for  polymorphic  purity  (X-Ray  powder diffraction),  residual  solvents  (GC),  particle  size  distribution  (Malvern  Laser  Diffraction)  and  density. The  limit  for  the  residual  solvent  toluene  is  set  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines.  Where  possible, pharmacopoeial  methods  are  used,  non-pharmacopoeial  methods  have  been  satisfactorily  described and validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory  Certificates  of  Analysis  have  been  presented.  All  batches  were  in  compliance  with  the predefined active substance specifications. The specifications are considered adequate to control the quality of the active substance. The impurity limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety. Stability Medicinal product no longer authorised

Stability  studies  have  been  performed at long term and accelerated conditions. Up to 60 months of long  term  stability  data  and  up  to  6  months  of  accelerated  stability  data  have  been  provided, confirming the stability of leflunomide. The studies are still on-going on some batches at the time of the CHMP opinion. The specifications tested were appearance, identity, assay and impurities (HPLC). The  packaging  used  in  stability  trials  is  identical  to  that  proposed  for  market.  The  stability  data provided  support  the  proposed  retest  period  at  the  proposed  packaging  and  storage  conditions.  In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 1 , any confirmed out of specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA.

## 2.2.3. Medicinal Product

## Pharmaceutical Development

The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  develop  immediate-release  film-coated  tablets which are essentially similar and bioequivalent to the reference product Arava. The reference medicinal product Arava exists as film-coated tablets containing 10 mg, 20 mg or 100 mg leflunomide. In the marketing authorisation application for Repso, only the two lower strengths have been included.

The excipients in Repso are not exactly the same as those of the reference medicinal product Arava. There are small differences in the excipients used in the tablet core and film-coating. The Repso tablets are  coated  with  a  non-functional  colour  film-coating.  The  formulation  difference  is  not  considered significant with regards to the performance or the safety of the generic medicinal product compared to the  reference  medicinal  product.  The  excipients  used  in  the  Repso  formulation  are  well  known  and widely used in the pharmaceutical industry. All excipients comply with the European Pharmacopoeia or the  Commission  Directives  2008/84/EC  or  95/45/EC.  Certificates  of  Analysis  demonstrated  that  the excipients consistently meet the predefined specifications.

In  vitro  dissolution  studies  have  been  performed  in  different  dissolution  media  at  different  pH  and demonstrated that the Repso 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets and the Arava 20 mg film-coated tablets have equivalent release of the active substance leflunomide. The discriminatory power of the dissolution test is considered adequate. The influence of the leflunomide particle size on the dissolution of  the  medicinal  product  was  investigated  and  it  was  shown  that  the  particle  size  of  the  active substance does not influence the dissolution of the medicinal product.

Comparative  impurity  profile  studies  have  been  performed  and  showed  that  there  is  no  significant difference in the impurity profile compared to the reference medicinal product.

Repso film-coated tablets were developed in two different dosage strengths, i.e. 10 mg and 20 mg. The bioequivalence however, was tested and demonstrated on the 20 mg strength only. The applicant fulfilled all respective requirements to extrapolate the results of the bioequivalence study performed on the 20 mg dosage to the 10 mg strength. Therefore the biowaiver for the 10 mg strength has been granted.

## Adventitious agents

A TSE declaration was submitted to confirm that magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. Lactose monohydrate and lactose anhydrous are derived from milk and calf rennet and are compliant with the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via  Human  and  Veterinary  Medicinal  Products  (EMEA/410/01  Rev.  2).  No  excipients  derived  from human origin have been used.

## Manufacture of the Product

The manufacturing process for Repso film-coated tablets 10 mg and 20 mg is standard for film-coated tablets. Adequate in-process controls are performed. The acceptance criteria and the test methods are adequately  chosen  to  ensure  that  the  medicinal  product  will  comply  with  the  specification  limits.  A detailed manufacturing description and flow scheme have been provided.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

Validation results have been presented and show that the manufacturing process is reproducible and results  in  a  medicinal  product  that  complies  with  the  in-process  and  finished  product  specifications. These batches have the same formulation as production scale batches and same equipment has been used. Process validation on the first three production scale batches of each strength will be performed post opinion.

Leflunomide shows polymorphism. Studies demonstrated that no change in leflunomide's polymorphic form is observed during manufacturing or storage of the medicinal product.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Product Specification

The medicinal product release and shelf-life specifications include tests for description, identification of active  substance  and  film-coating  colourants,  content  uniformity,  dissolution,  assay,  impurities  and degradation products, and microbiological quality. The medicinal product specifications are standard for film-coated tablets. The proposed test procedures and acceptance criteria comply with the requirements  of  the  Ph.Eur  and  ICH  guidelines.  All  tests  included  in  the  specification  have  been satisfactorily  described  and  validated.  Appropriate  data  have  been  presented  to  justify  the  release specifications  for  each  quality  characteristic  that  is  controlled.  Impurities  and  degradation  products have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety. Batch analysis data have been provided. The batches were manufactured according to the proposed manufacturing process and  packed  in  proposed  packaging  material.  Batch  analysis  results  comply  with  the  predefined specifications  and  confirm  consistency  &amp;  uniformity  of  manufacture  and  indicate  that  the  process  is under control.

<!-- image -->

Stability of the Product Stability studies have been carried out under long term (25°C/60% RH), intermediate (30°C/65% RH) and accelerated  (40°C/75% RH) conditions according to the ICH requirements, for both the blisters and the bottles with screw cap. Up to 24 months long term, up to 12 months intermediate term and up to  6  months  accelerated  stability  data  have  been  provided.  The  parameters  tested  and  analytical methods used are identical to those used for the release specifications, except from the identity tests and content uniformity which were not retested at end of shelf life. The methods used for assay and related substances were proven as stability indicating. The stability batches have been manufactured at the proposed site of medicinal product manufacture, according to the proposed process and using the  active  substance  obtained  from  the  proposed  active  substance  manufacturer.  The  batches  were packaged  as  proposed  for  marketing.  Special  storage  conditions  have  been  proposed  as  defined  in section 6.4 of the SmPC. Photostability studies have been performed as per ICH Q1B guideline and demonstrate that the filmcoated tablets are not sensitive to light. In conclusion, the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for the commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SmPC. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines 1 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant  negative  trend,  should  be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and medicinal product has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were no unresolved quality issues which could have an impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the medicinal product. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 2.3. Non-Clinical aspects

## Pharmacology, Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology

Leflunomide is a well-established medicinal product for which there is a large amount of experience supporting its safe and effective use in patients. In this generic application, non-clinical aspects were

1 6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

therefore  only  evaluated  based  on  public  literature  and  by  cross-referring  to  the  non-clinical information available for the reference product. Relevant non-clinical safety data for Repso have been summarized in a non-clinical overview and included in section 5.3 of the SmPC which is identical to the texts of the reference medicinal product Arava. No further studies are required and the applicant has properly justified why no such data was provided.

The  impurity  profile  of  the  reference  medicinal  product  and  the  test  product  have  been  compared; since no significant amounts of impurities have been found in either product it can be concluded that the products are similar.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The applicant has considered that an ERA is not necessary since Repso is a generic medicinal product and  will  replace  other  similar  medicinal  product  already  on  the  market.  Therefore  no  increase  in consumption is awaited. This was acceptable for CHMP.

## 2.4. Clinical Aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

To  support  this  application  for  generic  leflunomide,  the  applicant  has  submitted  one  bioequivalence study (no. 2008-1776; Table 1) to determine the relative oral bioavailability of leflunomide 20 mg filmcoated tablets compared with the reference product, Arava in the same strength. For the 10 mg filmcoated tablet the applicant has provided a justification for a biowaiver.

No  scientific  advice  from  CHMP  was  sought  for  the  development  program  of  this  product.  The assessment  took  into  consideration  the  recommendations  of  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of Bioequivalence in its current version (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## GCP

The study was complying with GCP, as claimed by the applicant. The applicant provided a statement to the  effect  that  study  no.  2008-1776  was  conducted  outside  the  Community  and  was  carried  out  in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## Exemption

The  applicant  submitted  a  bioequivalence  study  with  the  highest  strength  (20  mg  tablets)  and requested a biowaiver for  the lower  10  mg  strength.  The  applicant  provided  justification  for  such  a biowaiver based on the facts that:

-  The drug input has been shown to be linear over the therapeutic dose range
-  The pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturer and process

 The qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same  The ratio between amounts of the active substance and excipients is the same.  The dissolution profiles are similar under identical conditions for the additional strength and the strength of the batch used in the bioequivalence study The  biowaiver  request  was  acceptable,  since  the  conditions  set  by  the  applicable  bioequivalence guideline  including  comparative  dissolution  testing  at  (at  least)  3  pH  levels  were  fulfilled  and sufficiently discussed by the Applicant. 2.4.2. Clinical studies Pharmacokinetics  Methods Study design The  relative  oral  availability  of  leflunomide  20  mg  tablets  (Test)  and  the  reference  product  Arava 20 mg tablets (Reference) was established in a randomized, single dose, parallel group bioavailability study under fasting conditions by comparing the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite, A771726 (Table  1).  The  parallel  group  design  was  chosen  due  to  the  very  long  half-life  of  the  substance,  in accordance with the relevant bioequivalence guideline. Plasma levels were measured from blood samples collected over a period of 72 hours after dosing. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Each  subject  received  either  a  20  mg  leflunomide  test  tablet  (n=36)  or  a  20  mg  reference  tablet (n=38) with 240 ml water after an overnight fast, according to a computer generated randomisation list.

During each study period, blood samples were taken pre-dose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.33, 1.67, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, 48 and 72 hours after drug administration. Plasma was harvested from these samples and assayed for A771726 using a validated LC/MS/MS method.

Subjects were confined to the clinical testing facility from at lest 10 hours prior to drug administration until  24 hours post-dose. Subjects fasted overnight for at lest 10 hours prior to drug administration and  for  at  least  4  hours  following  drug  administration,  at  which  point  a  standardized  meal  was provided. Other standardized meals were served throughout the remainder of the confinement period.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

With the exception of the water ingested during drug administration, water was not allowed from one hour prior until one hour following drug administration.

The conduct of the clinical study, analytical, pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses were performed by  a  contract  research  organization.  The  clinical  study  protocol  and  associated  documents  were reviewed and approved by an Ethics Review Board and a No Objection Letter for protocol was received by Health Authorities prior to start of study procedures. The enrolment and treatment periods were started and finished between September and December 2008.

Fifty-four subjects were Caucasian, 7 were Hispanic/Latino, 7 were Asian and 6 were Black. All subjects were postmenopausal or surgically sterile.

Eighty subjects were planned to be enrolled while only 78 subjects were screened. Four subjects did not meet the inclusion criteria and therefore only 74 subjects were dosed.

All  subjects  were  judged  eligible  for  enrolment  in  this  study,  based  on  medical  and  medication histories, demographic data, vital signs measurements, 12-lead ECG, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests.

## Analytical methods

The analyte for the pharmacokinetic evaluation in this study was the metabolite A771726. This was justified  by  the  applicant  as  leflunomide  is  rapidly  converted  into  this  metabolite  and  there  is  no documented analytical method available which would provide reliable measurement of leflunomide

Subject  plasma  concentrations  of  the  leflunomide  metabolite  A771726  were  measured  by  a  liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric detection method. Leflunomide metabolite was shown to be stable in human plasma following three (3) freeze thaw cycles, short term and long term stability of analytes has been presented and the validation of analytical LC MSMS method is adequate.

## Pharmacokinetic Variables

The pharmacokinetic parameters of interest in this study were AUC0-72, Cmax and Tmax in respect of A771726.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Statistical methods

SAS software release  9.1  was  used  to  analyze  the  data.  ANOVA  was  carried  out  on  ln-transformed AUC0-t,  C max .  Factors  of  subjects,  treatments,  and  group  were  also  evaluated  in  the  model.  A  nonparametric test was carried out to compare the Tmax values between treatments. Individual data were presented,  logarithmic  transformation  used,  and  individual  plasma  concentration-time  profiles  were shown in the dossier. Descriptive statistics was used to summarize the results.

AUC0-t and Cmax were considered as primary parameters for bioequivalence conclusion with standard acceptance range of 80-125%.

##  Results

Only 74 subjects were dosed but complete PK profiles for BE assessment were only available for 71 subjects.  This was because three subjects had been excluded from the PK and BE analysis as the last time  point  of  the  AUC  could  not  be  reliably  estimated  due  to  broken  72-hour  samples  during centrifugation.

In  addition, there were several minor protocol deviations during the conduct of the study, including delayed sample drawings and minor modification of standard meal, all of which were only considered minor.

Of the 71 female subjects included in the data analysis, 51 were Caucasian, 7 were Hispanic/Latino, 7 were Asian and 6 were Black. The mean age was 56 ± 5 yrs (42 - 65 yrs), height 159.3 ± 7.2 cm (145.0 - 182.0 cm), weight: 65.1 ± 9.3 kg (47.4 - 87.0 kg) and BMI 25.6 ± 2.8 (20.2 - 29.9).

The standard 90% CI for ln-transformed AUC0-72, and Cmax values fit within standard acceptance range of 80-125% for the active metabolite A771726.

##  Conclusion

Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study  Repso  20  mg  film-coated  tablets  is  considered bioequivalent with the reference medicinal product Arava 20 mg film-coated tablets.

## Pharmacodynamics

No  new  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  presented  and  no  such  studies  are  required  for  this application.

## 2.4.3. Post marketing experience

The sampling period of 72 hours was suitable to adequately characterize the concentration-time profile for bioequivalence purposes, although due to the long half-life of the analyte a complete pharmacokinetic profile could not be obtained. This sampling period is in accordance with the current bioequivalence guideline, which indicates that AUC truncated at 72h (AUC(0-72h)) may be used as an alternative to AUC(0-t) for comparison of extent of exposure as the absorption phase has been covered by 72h for immediate release formulations. The test conditions were sufficiently standardized in order to minimize the variability of all factors involved except that of the products being tested. The dose was selected according to the usual dosing recommendations and corresponds to the highest strength applied for. There were only minor deviation from protocol, there is some uncertainty connected to the description of samples lost during centrifugation, which were considered acceptable.

Medicinal products from Teva containing leflunomide are registered in 6 countries: Canada, Argentina, USA, Uruguay, Puerto Rico and Peru. The first registration was in Canada on 10th December 2004. Since  that  until  31st  January  2010  the  estimated  patient  exposure  was  107,611  patient-years (39,277,899 daily doses) from all 6 countries. Since the launch of Teva's leflunomide in North and South America, Teva received no reports of off label use. There were totally 4 reports of pregnancy (3 ended in abortion and 1 in mild intrauterine growth  retardation  with  no  other  abnormalities).  According  to  the  MAH,  the  spectrum  of  reported adverse reactions is in line with the product labelling, no unexpected safety signal has been detected. 2.4.4. Discussion and conclusion of clinical aspects The  bioequivalence  study  no.  2008-1776  used  a  parallel  design  due  to  the  long  half-life  of  the substance  and  was  conducted  with  conventional  procedures.  The  conversion  of  leflunomide  to  its metabolite, A771726, is rapid and therefore very low plasma levels of parent compound have been occasionally  detected.  Still,  there  is  no  reliable  analytical  method  for  determination  of  parent compound in human plasma. Therefore leflunomide may be considered to belong to a minority of drugs for which metabolite data are adequate for the assessment of bioequivalence. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The patient population was chosen according to the relevant guidelines. The study has been conducted in a population of female subjects, which is considered acceptable, since there is no concern that this study population would be less sensitive for the detection of formulation-specific differences.

The analytical method, its validation and the description of the way how the samples were handled were acceptable. The sensitivity, precision, accuracy and linearity of determination are adequate and the analytical method was appropriate.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The statistics were described adequately and statistical methods used were acceptable. The primary bioequivalence conclusion is based on the standard acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% for the active metabolite A771726. The data shows that the 90% CI for ln-transformed AUC0-72, and Cmax values fit within the pre-specified acceptance range.

The  biowaiver  for  the  10  mg  strength  can  be  granted  as  all  conditions  including  comparative dissolution testing at (at least) 3 pH levels have been submitted.

In  summary,  bioequivalence  of  the  Repso  20  mg  film-coated  tablets  with  the  reference  medicinal product, Arava 20 mg film-coated tablets, has been satisfactorily demonstrated.

## 2.6. User consultation

A user-testing has been performed for the package leaflet of the reference medicinal product, Arava. The applicant has used the user-tested package leaflet of Arava as a basis for the proposed package leaflet  and  has  performed  user  testing  of  the  Repso  package  leaflet.  The  differences  between  both package leaflets are considered minor and do not affect readability. The proposed package leaflet was judged acceptable.

## 2.7. Benefit/risk assessment and recommendation

## Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment

The applicant has applied for marketing authorisation for Repso 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets based on a claimed bioequivalence with a marketed reference medicinal product Arava. No nonclinical studies  have  been  provided  for  this  generic  application  but  an  adequate  summary  of  the  available nonclinical  information  for  the  active  substance  was  presented.  The  efficacy,  safety  and  clinical pharmacology of the active ingredient leflunomide are already well-established and documented for the reference  medicinal  product,  Arava.  The  submitted  bioequivalence  study  no.  2008-1776  is  designed and reported in accordance with the relevant EU note for guidance on BE investigation. The primary bioequivalence conclusion is based on the 90% CI for ln-transformed AUC0-72 and Cmax of the active metabolite  A771726  which  fit  within  the  standard  acceptance  range  of  80.00-125.00%  and  the bioequivalence to the reference product has been shown.

Moreover, switching from leflunomide to another DMARD without following the washout procedure (see section 4.4) may also increase the risk of serious adverse reactions even for a long time after the switching.

In accordance with the 'Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence' (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98, Rev 1) the applicant provided a justification  for  the  extrapolation  of  the bioequivalence study results to the 10 mg strength. This justification is considered acceptable. The  application  contains  adequate  quality,  non  clinical  and  clinical  data  and  the  bioequivalence  has been shown. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. Recommendation Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk ratio of Repso in the indication as mentioned below was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation. Repso is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with: * active rheumatoid arthritis as a \"disease-modifying antirheumatic drug\" (DMARD), * active psoriatic arthritis. Recent or concurrent treatment with hepatotoxic or haematotoxic DMARDs (e.g. methotrexate) may result in an increased risk of serious adverse reactions; therefore, the initiation of leflunomide treatment has to be carefully considered regarding these benefit/risk aspects.
