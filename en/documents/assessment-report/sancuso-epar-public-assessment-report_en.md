## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Nausea  and  vomiting  are  recognized  as  2  of  the  most  upsetting  adverse  reactions  of  cancer chemotherapy. Current guidelines propose 5-HT3 receptor antagonists as an effective pharmacological intervention for prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) with some reservations according to the intensity and duration of chemotherapy. The active substance of SANCUSO 3.1 mg/24 hrs transdermal patch submitted for marketing authorisation is granisetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.

The  legal  basis  for  this  marketing  authorisation  application  for  SANCUSO  3.1  mg/24  h  transdermal patch  is  Article  10(3)  ('hybrid  application')  of  Directive  2001/83/EC.  The  nonclinical  and  clinical development  strategies  were  therefore  designed  to  bridge  to  the  previous  findings  of  efficacy  and safety  for  the  reference  product,  Kytril  (granisetron  hydrochloride)  1  mg  Tablets.  Oral  as  well  as intravenous formulations of granisetron have been authorized and marketed in the EU Member States. The literature has also been reviewed for new information generated since the licensing of the existing dosage forms of granisetron and it has been incorporated in the submitted dossier.

The granisetron transdermal delivery system (granisetron TDS) that is applied in this application has been developed for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy for up to 5 consecutive days with an expectation that a single application of the patch offers steady, sustained delivery of granisetron.

Granisetron TDS is approved in several countries outside the EEA. The indication sought is prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy for up to 5 consecutive days.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

## 2.2.1. Introduction

Granisetron TDS consists of an active matrix spread on to a polyethylene terephthalate backing. The active matrix has an area weight of 110 g/m 2 (572 mg per patch). The active matrix consists of a pressure sensitive adhesive containing 6 % (w/w) granisetron base. The total content of the active drug substance is 34.3 mg per patch and the flux determined during the clinical programme using patches made by the proposed commercial product manufacturer is 3.1 mg/24 h.

## 2.2.2. Active  substance

At the time of the CHMP opinion, the active substance granisetron is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia.

Granisetron is an off-white to pale yellow coloured powder, non hygroscopic, freely soluble in methanol and methylene dichloride. A single crystalline form of granisetron is consistently produced; no further studies on polymorphism were performed.

The molecular formula of granisetron is C18H24N4O, its relative molecular mass 312.41 and its structural formula as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Manufacture

The active substance is sourced from two different manufacturers: Dr Reddy's Laboratories (Andhra Pradesh, India) and Cipla Ltd (Mumbai, India). Both sources of drug substance are supported by Active Substance Master Files.

Granisetron base manufactured by both drug substance suppliers is generally produced by the same manufacturing process as granisetron hydrochloride. The active substance from Cipla Ltd is manufactured  to  the  point  of  granisetron  base  with  manufacture  halted  before  conversion  to  the hydrochloride  salt,  while  the  active  substance  from  Dr  Reddy's  Ltd  is  manufactured  to  the  point  of granisetron  hydrochloride  and  then  converted  to  granisetron  base.  Applicant  states  that  due  to  the above presented approaches, the impurity profile of both sources of granisetron base drug substance is,  therefore,  the  same  as  for  the  respective  granisetron  hydrochloride  salts  manufactured  by  both Cipla Ltd and Dr Reddy's Ltd.

The synthetic routes are considered essentially identical except for a few minor details and would be expected  to  produce  finished  product  of  identical  quality  with  very  similar  impurities  profiles.  The solvents used by the two processes have some differences, which are reflected in the residual solvents specifications for the respective active substances.

The active substance produced by Cipla Ltd. is dried, milled and sieved; the active substance produced by Dr Reddy's Laboratories Limited is dried and sieved. Since the granisetron base is dissolved in N,Ndimethylacetamide  during  the  granisetron  TDS  manufacturing  process,  there  is  no  particle  size specification and the active substance physical characteristics have no influence on the quality of the drug product. The granisetron base produced by both Cipla Ltd. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited is the  endo  form.  Thus  the  Applicant  considers  two  granisetron  base  sources  can  be  considered equivalent with respect to the manufacture of granisetron TDS.

The  quality of the starting material supplied by different manufacturers  is satisfactory.  The manufacturing  processes  are  well  established  and  reproducible  and  the  specification  of  granisetron ensures that the product fully meets the requirements. Adequate details are provided for the quality control  testing  performed  during  the  synthesis;  these  include  specifications  and  the  associated  test methods for all the raw materials used in the process plus any in-process testing also with limits and test  method.  These  procedures  and  tests  ensure  that  the  processes  are  properly  and  adequately controlled.  Batch  analysis  from  production  scale  batches,  are  provided  ensuring  consistency  in    the manufacture of the active substance.

## Specification

As the active substance in Sancuso preparation, presented in a form of granisetron base, is identical to the active moiety of the reference product Kytril 1 mg Tablet (granisetron hydrochloride), for the purposes of setting specifications the existing European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) monograph for granisetron hydrochloride has been considered.

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Specifications have been set that are appropriate in view of the Ph Eur Monograph 'Substances for Pharmaceutical use', ICH guidance.

The specifications of the active substance as tested by the finished product manufacturer include the following test parameters: description, solubility, identification (HPLC and IR), water content (LoD), residue on ignition, heavy metals, related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), particle size and residual solvents (GC).

Batch analysis results of at least 3 production scale batches from each manufacturer demonstrate compliance with the proposed specification and indicate that the manufacturing process followed by both manufacturers is under control.

## Stability

Satisfactory stability data of three batches from each manufacturer of the active substance stored in their proposed commercial packaging at 25 °C/ 60 % RH or 30 °C/ 65 % RH and 40 °C/ 75 % RH, have been provided to support  the  proposed  re-test  period  of  24  months.  The  following  tests  were included  in  the  stability  program:  description,  identification,  loss  on  drying,  related  substances  and assay. The container closure system is similar to that proposed for commercial packaging. All results comply with the specifications and no trends are observed.

## 2.2.3. Finished medicinal product

## Pharmaceutical development

Granisetron TDS consists of a stable matrix of granisetron base (6% w/w: 34.3 mg/52 cm2 patch) in a commercially available adhesive (Duro-Tak 387-2287).

Granisetron base was selected as the active drug substance in preference to granisetron hydrochloride (the form of the drug used in currently marketed oral and intravenous formulations and described by a Ph. Eur. compendial monograph) because of anticipated superior skin permeation properties. Granisetron base is lipophilic, non-ionic drug substance and due to its physical/chemical properties it is more suitable for the preparation of transdermal dosage forms and for appropriate penetration through the skin.

The objective of the granisetron TDS formulation development programme was to create a stable granisetron transdermal matrix system capable of delivering the active substance over multiple days whilst achieving the necessary plasma levels. The pharmaceutical development process focused on the manufacturability and stability of the formulation, and permeation and loading of the active substance. The pharmaceutical development is presented in sufficient details and is supported by adequate amount of experimental data. Adequately designed and reported comprehensive validation studies are presented. Steps in formulations development and manufacturing process development are logical and consistent.

## Adventitious agents

No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

## Manufacture of the product

The manufacturing process involves several processing steps such as manufacture of the adhesive blend containing Granisetron base, spreading of the blend onto the siliconised liner, followed by drying,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

rolling the backing onto the dried adhesive matrix and finalising by punching and packaging the patches. The description of manufacturing process and process controls is presented in sufficient detail and process flow diagram is presented with indication of the critical steps, including appearance, identification of granisetron, assay, and residual solvents. The manufacturing steps are conducted for a 40 kg batch size.

Process validation results of four production scale batches were provided. Results of tested parameters are batch to batch comparable and are within proposed limits. The results verify that the process assures adequate batch to batch consistency.

## Product specification

The specification of the drug product are acceptable and include: appearance, assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units, identification by HPLC and UV, related substances (HPLC), presence of crystals, dissolution, microbiological purity, pouch integrity, adhesion and peel force. The finished product specifications are adequate for controlling this pharmaceutical form. The proposed test procedures and acceptance criteria comply with the requirements of the Ph.Eur. and ICH guidelines. All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated.

Certificates of analysis of seven production scale batches are provided. The batch analysis results show that the finished product meets the proposed specifications and confirm the consistency &amp; uniformity of manufacture indicating that the process is under control.

## Stability of the product

The conditions used in the stability studies are in accordance with the ICH stability guideline (25 °C/ 60 % RH, 30 °C/ 65 % RH and 40 °C/ 75 % RH) and the packaging similar to that proposed for the market. The control tests and specifications of drug product are adequately drawn up. Photostability tests performed on one batches showed that the product is unstable at when exposed to UV and cool white light but that the proposed container closure system adequately protected the product from light. Based on the stability data provided the proposed shelf-life of 3 years when stored in the original packaging at 25 °C with allowable excursions to 30 °C can be granted.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance.

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## 2.2.6. Recommendation(s) for future quality development

Not applicable

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature as well as studies conducted by the applicant to support this application. In accordance with the requirements for a hybrid application, the applicant has identified a programme to address the following points:

(1) whether administration of granisetron base via the transdermal route results in a comparable systemic toxicological profile to that established following oral and intravenous administration of granisetron hydrochloride, and

(2) whether transdermal administration of granisetron base exhibits the potential for local irritation or photosensitivity.

The safety programme undertaken by the Applicant comprises the following studies:

- -14-day local tolerance and systemic toxicity studies in rat and dog, which compared the effects of granisetron administration via different routes: transdermal versus oral versus intravenous (i.v). bolus injection
- -14-day toxicology studies via continuous i.v. infusion in rats and dogs in order to further increase systemic exposures to granisetron (rat) and maintain plasma granisetron concentrations constant over the whole duration of the treatment period (rat and dog)
- -Six additional, non-pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies
- -Skin sensitising potential in the guinea-pig according to the Buehler protocol
- -In vitro photosafety studies in Balb/c 3T3 fibrobasts and Chinese hamster ovary cells
- -In vivo photoirritation and photosensitisation study in guinea-pigs.

Furthermore, an environmental risk assessment was performed.

All pivotal non-clinical studies provided with this application were performed according to the GLP standards.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

Granisetron was previously demonstrated to be potent and effective in the anaesthetised rat, cat and in the conscious ferret with a long duration of action and a shallow dose/inhibition curve. Relatively large changes in granisetron levels are required to result in marked changes in anti-emetic effect. Noteworthy findings during preclinical general pharmacological testing with granisetron were observed at very high doses in vivo and very high concentrations in vitro, and were considered unlikely to be clinically relevant. Later findings of possible inhibition of the human cardiac ion channels was taken into account in clinical studies with granisetron TDS (Study 392MD/39/C).

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

The absorption patterns following IV administration of 14C-granisetron to rats and dogs suggest no differences in Cmax, t1/2, and AUC of granisetron between the single-dose and repeated-dose groups (Haddock, 1990 1 ). There is no indication in the literature of a gender difference in PK in animals.

1 Haddock, R.E., 1990. Pharmacokinetics of granisetron hydrochloride - Distribution,

Sancuso

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Elimination of IV granisetron was both urinary (40 %) and faecal (60 %) in both rats and dogs and it is unlikely that granisetron undergoes significant enterohepatic circulation.

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

Median lethal dose values for the rat and mouse are described by Hakansson et al., 1990 1 . The acute toxicity of granisetron was primarily due to CNS stimulation with convulsions occurring in rats and mice after oral, subcutaneous and IV administration.

## Repeat dose toxicity

The pivotal programme consists of two 14-day local tolerance and systemic toxicity studies in rats and dogs, comparing granisetron administration via the TDS route versus the oral and IV (bolus) routes, as well as two 14-day continuous IV infusion toxicology studies were performed in rats and dogs. In total, the applicant has performed 8 repeat-dose toxicity studies. These studies are summarized in the table below.

No new signals were identified by the Applicant with the exception of local intolerance in the form of erythema at the application sites. The formulation of the granisetron TDS used in the toxicology studies was the same formulation composition, containing the same strength as that used in the clinical trials and the same as the proposed commercial composition.

## Genotoxicity

The genotoxicity of granisetron has been studied by the originator with respect to gene mutations in bacteria and mammalian cells and chromosomal aberrations in vitro. No significant genotoxic effects could be observed.

## Carcinogenicity

Carcinogenicity studies conducted by the originator showed no special hazard for humans when used at the recommended dose. In accordance with the recommendations of ICH S1A (treatment duration

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

below 6 months and patient population) no new genotoxicity studies have been performed for granisetron TDS.

## Reproduction Toxicity

Reproductive and developmental toxicity was previously studied with po and sc fertility studies in rats, po and iv embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits (only po), po and sc pre and post-natal development studies in rats.  These studies demonstrated no effects on fertility, no embryotoxicity or effects on development and reproductive performance of pups, at maximum doses which were sufficiently high to produce parental toxicity.

## Toxicokinetic data

Toxicokinetic analysis was performed from the repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs. The results are summarized in the following table.

## Local Tolerance

The local tolerance of granisetron TDS was investigated in the repeat-dose toxicity studies performed by the Applicant in rats and dogs which revealed a low potential for irritancy for granisetron TDS. In addition, the applicant has conducted a specific local tolerance and sensitisation study in guinea-pigs

No sensitising properties were observed in this study

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other toxicity studies

## Phototoxicity

The Applicant conducted 2 in vitro studies and 1 in vivo study in female guinea-pigs (Report 21022/06) to assess the phototoxic potential of granisetron base as well as an in vivo photosensitisation test in guinea-pigs (see table below). The phototoxicity studies are not showing any phototoxicity, photoirritation, or photosensitisation potential. However the results of a single in vitro study in CHO cells suggest that there is a potential for photoactivation of granisetron as this is shown in a dosedependent and statistically significant increase in chromosome structural damage following photoirradiation. This finding is reflected in sections 4.4. and 5.3 of the SmPC.

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

The applicant has conducted an experimental determination of the octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) of granisetron, using the shake-flask method. A log Kow value of 2.84 ± 0.25 (n=6) was calculated, which is close to the computed value of 2.8, previously submitted, and is below the log Kow limit value of &gt;4.5. Therefore the substance is not a PBT.

For calculating PECsw both (1) the total amount of granisetron within the granisetron TDS, whether this enters the environment through use or after removal of the patch, and (2) the amount released during actual use have been considered by the applicant.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Only the first approach is being used by CHMP as basis for the calculation, as the active substance remaining in the patch discarded after use can have also an impact on the environment and because this is the most conservative approach.

According to the Q&amp;A CHMP Guideline on the ERA of medicinal products for human use (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010), note 1, Fpen can be refined taking into account the prevalence data provided and the treatment regime.The incidence of all new cancers is estimated in EU at 3.2 million and the prevalence of all cancers (based on Globocan 2008) at 3.4 million.

In the worst case scenario, granisetron TDS is given as 7 patches/week in 12 courses of chemotherapy in a 12 month period. Considering that each patch contains 34.3 mg of granisetron, and taking into account the  dosing regime, calculated (average) Doseai = 34.2 mg *7 *12/365 = 7.9 mg.

Taking the prevalence as 3.2 million (out of 498 million inhabitants in EU), the refined Fpen is 3.2/498= 0.0064.Therefore the calculated PECsw= (7.9*0.0064)/(200*10)= 0.025 10-3 mg/L= 0.025  g/L, which is above the action limit of 0.01  g/L.

Consequently, the applicant was asked to perform a phase II ERA. The applicant should perform a phase II ERA based on literature with a view to propose amendments for the information for use and handling (&amp; disposal) of the patches. Overall, considering that the actual use of granisetron TDS is likely to be far less than the above assumptions, it is considered reasonable in these circumstances to conclude at present that the therapeutic use of granisetron TDS is unlikely to pose a risk to the environment. Recommendations for disposal are included in the product information.

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed:

The MAH is recommended to perform a literature based phase II ERA analysis, with a view to propose amendments for the information for use and handling (&amp; disposal) of the patches.

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The pharmacological properties of granisetron in the Non-clinical part are adequately overviewed on the basis of scientific publications. The Applicant has not conducted any new pharmacokinetic nonclinical studies and nowadays available data are discussed and reviewed in the Nonclinical Overview part. Data on the toxicology of granisetron TDS are based on bibliographical sources on granisetron and repeat-dose toxicity, local tolerance, photogenotoxicity and photosensitisation studies conducted by the Applicant according to the GLP standards.

In the repeat dose toxicity and the toxicokinetic analysis no new signals were identified with the exception of local intolerance in the form of erythema at the application sites. The formulation of the Granisetron TDS used in the toxicology studies was the same formulation composition, containing the same strength as that used in the clinical trials and the same as the proposed commercial composition.

In addition, the Applicant has conducted a specific local tolerance and sensitisation study in guineapigs. Different grades of skin irritations were observed in granisetron base-treated animals, as well as erythema in all positive controls.

Application site erythema and application site irritation were added to the RMP as important potential risks furthermore application site reaction was reflected in 4.4 of the SmPC.

The Applicant has conducted 3 formal studies to assess the phototoxic potential of granisetron base as well as an in vivo photosensitisation test in guinea-pigs. The phototoxicity studies are not showing any phototoxicity, photoirritation, or photosensitisation potential. However the results of a single in vitro study in CHO cells suggest that there is a potential for photoactivation of granisetron as this is shown

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in a dose-dependent and statistically significant increase in chromosome structural damage. This finding is reflected in 4.4 and 5.3 of the SmPC.

With respect to the environmental risk assessment, it is considered reasonable to conclude at present that the therapeutic use of granisetron TDS is unlikely to pose a risk to the environment. Adequate recommendations for disposal are included in the product information. Nevertheless, a phase II ERA should be performed by the applicant with a view to propose amendments for the information for use and handling (&amp; disposal) of the patches.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The non-clinical program performed by the applicant was considered adequate to support this hybrid application. Issues observed in the performed studies such as application site erythema and photogenotoxicity were adequately addressed in the relevant parts of RMP and SmPC.

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress the MAH was recommended to perform a literature based phase II ERA analysis, with a view to propose amendments for the information for use and handling (&amp; disposal) of the patches.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

## 2.4.1. Introduction

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of granisetron TDS have been studied in all ten clinical studies involving 1,386 subjects (576 healthy subjects and 810 cancer patients with CINV), of whom approximately 58 % were the target patient population - cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The release of granisetron from granisetron TDS was measured in nine of these. No formal study has been performed to assess granisetron TDS pharmacokinetics in children.The measurement was made by determining the residual amount of granisetron that remained in the granisetron TDS after removal and calculating the administered dose as patch content minus residual granisetron amount. The in vitro flux, that is the dose released per day (apparent dose), could then be calculated as released dose/days contact.

The in vitro flux has been dose normalised, for comparison purposes, to a dose of 34.3 mg, that is, to a 52 cm2 patch. Adjusting the total apparent dose (21.7 mg) from this study for number of days' exposure (7 days) yields a flux value of 3.1 mg/24 h.  Thus, the granisetron TDS flux has been calculated as 3.1 mg/24 h.

## Bioanalytical methods

Bioanalytical methods for granisetron were adequately described and validated to support the clinical pharmacokinetic programme conducted. The analytical methods used in each study are listed in Table 2.

## Absorption

Study 392MD/4/C. This was a single-centre, single-dose, open, Phase I study and was conducted in 12 healthy subjects (6 males and 6 females) to evaluate the systemic bioavailability of one 15 cm² granisetron TDS and to determine the PK profile over an application period of 5 days on the abdomen. For the evaluation of the plasma concentrations of granisetron, blood samples were drawn per time point at the following times after patch application: 0 (pre-dose), 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120 (preceding patch removal), 126, 132 h after patch application. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental or model free methods, namely, linear trapezoidal rule for AUC, log-linear regression for λ z. PK parameters are given in the table below.

This study was contributing to the first understanding of mean Tmax determination that was found as 48 hrs, and ranging form 30 to 126 hrs.

The CHMP noted that in this study were a number of outliers, with both higher and lower exposures within this study. The observed variability in PK parameters was in line with the known high variability for oral and IV granisetron.

Different application sites were used in study 392MD/4/C (abdominal wall) compared to the other clinical trials presented (upper arm). Data from this study show that somewhat higher concentrations are obtained in comparison with Study 392MD/11/C (patch applied on upper arm). Further, in the patient studies it was specified that in cases of breast cancer and lymph gland issues prevented use of the upper arm, the patch should be applied to the patient's upper abdomen. However, no subgroup analyses could be performed from these patient studies as only one patient applied the patch to another site. As no safety issues are expected from the observed higher concentrations, the CHMP accepted the companies proposal to use the abdomen as an alternative administration site if an arm is not available, which is reflected in the SPC Section 4.2.

Study 392MD/11/C. This was a single-centre, open-label, four-way-crossover study to compare the bioavailability of granisetron after a single 6-day application of three dosages of granisetron TDS, to that of once-daily dosing of 2 mg granisetron tablets for 5 days. This study also assessed the dose proportionality of granisetron pharmacokinetics after patch application.

Twelve healthy male subjects received oral granisetron administered as a 2 mg dose once daily, for 5 days and three dosages of granisetron TDS (15, 33 and 52 cm2) applied for 6 days to the upper outer arm. Each treatment was separated by a washout period of at least 5 days. The mean age of all 12 subjects was 37.1 years; mean weight 76.8 kg; and mean BMI (body mass index) 24.2 kg/m2.

Serial blood samples were taken before and up to 240 hrs after TDS application and up to 72 hrs after the last oral dose. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated: Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, λ z, AUC(0-z), AUC(0-∞ ), in vivo flux (for TDS only) and Cavg calculated as AUC(0-24h)ss/24 for oral dosing and as AUC(0-144h)/144 for TDS application. The apparent elimination half-lives (t1/2, λ z) were calculated by non-compartmental analysis.

Descriptive statistics were calculated for plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of granisetron.

As Tmax is a discrete variable, day effect was tested using a Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test. Time for plasma concentrations of granisetron to reach steady state was assessed on Ln-transformed trough plasma concentrations (C24h) observed from days 1 to 5 using an analysis of variance with subject and day as main effects in the model followed by a Tukey's test. For TDS: Proportionality between the dose administered (size of the patch) and the pharmacokinetic parameters was assessed by means of an analysis of variance with subject, dose and period interaction as main effects in the model on the following Ln-transformed parameters: Cavg/dose, AUC(0-∞ )/dose, in vivo flux/dose and t1/2, λ z.

Study 392MD/26/C. This study was a double-blind, placebo controlled study to assess the skin irritation and sensitisation potential of granisetron TDS and was undertaken in healthy subjects. The secondary objective was to assess the delivery of granisetron from the patch by determining the plasma granisetron levels in a subset of subjects. During the first 7-days administration of the patches a subset of 24 subjects had blood samples taken for plasma granisetron measurements to determine the release profile of the drug from the patch in the the to-be-marketed formulation.

The mean plasma granisetron Cmax and AUC values in healthy females were both approximately 3fold higher than in males. Individual Cmax and AUClast values generally overlapped and part of the observed difference in mean values was caused by one female subject with Cmax and AUClast values 10-fold higher than those reported in other subjects (respectively, over 42 ng/mL and 4500 ng.h/mL). After this subject exclusion from the analyses, mean plasma granisetron Cmax and AUC values in healthy females were 1.8-fold higher than in males. Median Cmax and AUC values were 1.805 ng/mL and 169.05 ng.h/mL, respectively, in males and 4.92 ng/mL and 489.85 ng.h/mL, respectively, in females.

granisetron TDS (52 cm²) and i.v. granisetron on the QT interval in 120 healthy male and 120 healthy female subjects. The secondary objectives of this study were to assess the relationship between the QTcF change from baseline and plasma granisetron concentrations; and to assess patch adhesion and residual granisetron remaining in the patch after use. During the 5 day application of granisetron TDS, geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-120h were 3.6 ng/mL and 239 ng.h/mL (see Table 5) respectively, with high intersubject variability (%CV 80%  and 89%) respectively. Median time to  maximum concentrations was 56 hours.

Subsequent to these concentration e. 24 maxima, plasma concentrations were variable but generally declined in a mono-exponential manner.

Based on geometric mean AUC(0 -168) and AUC(168 -336) estimates no meaningful difference in systemic exposure to granisetron was noted between the two granisetron TDS applications following co-administration of transdermal and i.v. granisetron.

This was a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, parallel group Phase 2 study in chemotherapy naïve patients undergoing a single day regimen of chemotherapy with MEC. A total of 175 patients received study medication and 157 were included in the per protocol (PP) population. The study included male or female patients 18-75 years of age with histologically and/or cytologically confirmed solid tumours, ECOG status ≥ 2 and a body mass index (BMI) of 18-30 kg/m2, who were scheduled to receive single-day administration of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy n Plasma Blood samples for determining plasma levels of granisetron were taken 2 hrs following administratio of the oral granisetron/placebo on Day 0 and thereafter on Days 1 and 4. In a small subset of 17 patients, samples were also taken on Days 5 and 6 after oral granisetron/placebo administration in order to establish the apparent terminal decline following removal of the patch on Day 4. concentration data were available for 86 patients on Day 0 granisetron TDS application (52 cm2 patch) and for 82 patients who had received a single 2 mg dose of oral granisetron.

nter-subject variability of the pharmacokinetics d The applicant noted, that this study confirmed the high i of granisetron overall and in both male and female cancer patients treated with oral granisetron an granisetron TDS. Median plasma concentrations at Visit 1 (anticipated peak plasma concentration) were higher for oral granisetron than granisetron TDS.

The CHMP noted that main PK data in patients were generated from two trials (8/C and 15/C). In Study 8/C minimally required time for patch application was 24 hours time before chemotherapy. In Study 392MD/15/C median time value prior to chemotherapy was 45.1 hours, median (SD) was 40.7 (9.4) hours, individual values ranged between 25 and 72 hours. So, median time value was closer to 48 hours than to 24 hours. As it can be seen from measured median plasma concentrations, differences between oral and TDS is ~ 7 times different in Study 8/C and ~4 times different in Study 15/C.

/C, 15/C and 26/C. The Population PK . The PK model was developed using data from 4/C, 8/C, 11 objectives of the population PK analyses were to develop a population PK model for granisetron after granisetron TDS application and after oral administration, to explore the effects of various covariates on the PK characteristics of granisetron and to use it for PK/PD modelling.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on the granisetron TDS PK model for the cross-over study, the fraction, bioavailable after pa administration (F), was determined to be 46% relative to oral dosing. This value is based on t nominal dose. The median amount removed from the patch was 55% in trials 4/C, 8/C, 11/C and 26/C. It was assumed by the applicant that, based on the administrated dose, F is approximately tch he 80% relative to oral . As Granisetron exposures showed a high inter-individual variability, in the final PK model fitted to data of all granisetron TDS treated subjects, a inter-subject CV of 112% was determined for the apparent clearance (CL/F), which is inversely proportional to exposure. In the final model based only on the cross-over trial, an intra-subject CV of 26% was determined for exposure after granisetron TDS administration.

According to bibliographic data and in original studies evaluating CL after patch application (PPK modelling), the total plasma CL in healthy patients was ~0.79 l/h*kg or 42.5 L/hr and in patients CL = 23.6 L.

## Dose proportionality and time dependencies

y No formal dose proportionality studies were performed. Some aspects relevant to dose determination were assessed in Study 11/C, where Granisetron TDS application resulted in maximal concentrations 48 hrs post application. Mean Cmax values of 1.15, 2.08 and 3.85 ng/mL and mean Cavg values of 0.68, 1.24, and 2.23 ng/mL were determined for 15 cm², 33 cm² and 52 cm² patch sizes, respectivel er the plasma concentration-time curve between time 0 For the granisetron TDS, the mean area und and infinity (AUC0-∞ ) was 149, 287 and 420 ng.h/mL, for 15cm2, 33cm2 and 52cm2 patch, respectively.

The CHMP acknowledged the high inter-subject and intra-subject variability of the main PK parameters (Cmax, Cavg, AUC, and CL).

## Special populations

x is generally higher in males Gender. The gender effect was assed via bibliographic data and original studies (4/C, 26/C, 15/C and PPK modelling). Published data showed that Cma than in females but AUC at whilst in study 26/C, also in healthy subjects, the mean plasma granisetron Cmax is unaffected by gender. This seem broadly consistent with the findings in healthy subject study 4/C where the mean plasma granisetron Cmax and AUC in the healthy male subjects was greater than th seen in the females and AUC were higher in females than males.

For Study 39/C, both granisetron TDS and i.v. granisetron exposure was higher in females compared to males, although there was considerable overlap in the ranges of individual values and high intersubject variability.

The CHMP considered that overall there seem to be a general tendency towards higher concentration in females in comparison to males, but this trend does not result in a clinical significant difference. This is also substantiated by the population pharmacokinetic model, where gender was not identified covariate improving the fit. s as a

Race. Study SP-0101 assessed the PK of granisetron after a single 6-day application of granisetron TDS in healthy Japanese males. High inter-subject variability in systemic exposure was observed (as it is well documented for granisetron studies) but overall the PK profile in Japanese subjects was comparable to that in non-Japanese subjects.

e Weight. Weight was assessed in study 40/C. Comparisons of mean Cmax, Cavg and AUC estimates indicated that systemic exposure appeared slightly lower in the normal subject group than in either th underweight or obese subject groups, although there was extensive overlap in the 95% CI around the geometric mean estimates for these parameters.

Additionally, total clearance of granisetron was not affected in patients with severe renal failure who received a single 40 μ g/kg dose of granisetron (Carmichael et al 1989 2 ).

Impaired hepatic function . Palmer (1994) 3 investigated the pharmacokinetics of granisetron in 20 cancer patients with malignant involvement of the liver and 19 cancer patients who did not have liver involvement. In this study total clearance was approximately halved compared to patients without liver involvement, which is expected due to the fact that granisetron is predominately eliminated by hepatic metabolism. For the reference product dose adjustment is not considered necessary based on the wide variability in PK parameters and good tolerance of doses above the recommended clinical dose. In section 4.4 of the SPC a special warning for hepatically impaired patients has been included considering the fact that granisetron is eliminated predominantly by the liver.

## Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

## In vitro

As reported in the literature (Bloomer et al. 1994 4 ) and mentioned in the prescribing information of the reference product, granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug metabolizing enzyme system in vitro.

## In vivo

The prescribing information of the reference product mentions that there have been no definitive drugdrug  pharmacodynamic  or  PK  interaction  studies  performed  with  i.v.  granisetron;  however  safe administration  is  reported  with  drugs  representing  benzodiazepines,  neuroleptics  and  anti-ulcer medications.

Youlten  (2004) 6 investigated the effect of repeat dosing with cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics of i.v. granisetron in 12 healthy subjects and found that PK parameters measured after cimetidine administration were not significantly different from those taken before.

## Primary and Secondary pharmacology

t of s. Granisetron is a selective antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT3 receptors). Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that granisetron is effective against nausea and vomiting as a resul cytostatic therapy. Radioligand binding studies have demonstrated that granisetron has negligible affinity for other receptor types, including 5HT1, 5HT2, 5HT4 and dopamine D2 binding site

The following pharmacology assessmentshave been performed specific for the present application.

General methodo The model applied to describe the PK and PD was a population or mixed-effect models. Modelling strategy. A sequential PK-PD modelling approached was followed. First, the oral PK model was developed. Subsequently the distribution and elimination parameters from this oral model were used in the development of the PK model for patch administration. The PK models were then used for the investigation of the PK-PD relationship. Development of a PK-PD model. The final PK models developed for patients after oral dosing or patch application were used to derive the exposure of each individual to granisetron in the Study 15/C. From the post hoc estimates, exposure was calculated in NONMEM a the area under the curve (AUC) from the start of chemotherapy until 24 h later (AUC24), and the AUC from start of patch attachment or oral dosing until the end of the study period, which is 7 days later (AUC168). Possible exposure-response relationships were evaluated using s proportional odds models . The relationship between AUC24 and Total Control on Day 1 was evaluated in separate models after oral administration, patch application, and in a combined oral/patch model. In an analogous manner, the relationship between AUC168 and Total Control Overall was evaluated.

## 2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

g efficacy and safety for the reference Granisetron TDS has been developed for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receivin moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy for up to 5 consecutive days. The clinical development strategies were designed to bridge to the previous findings of product, the oral formulation of granisetron, to the transdermal formulation. The pharmacology program performed is formally acceptable for this purpose.

n howed A dose ranging and comparative bioavailability study with oral granisetron (392MD/11/C) showed that a 52 cm2 patch was the most suitable for further clinical development. The calculated flux of granisetron from grainsetron TDS 52 cm² is 3.1 mg/24 h. Pharmacological characteristics of the patch showed that initially plasma concentrations were slow to increase and that Cmax was reached at around 48 hours. Mean Cmax with granisetron TDS (3.85 ng/mL) was lower than that measured with oral granisetron 2 mg (5.5 ng/mL). However, the delivered dose from granisetron TDS resulted in a average plasma granisetron concentration (Cavg) of 2.23 ng/mL compared with 2.14 ng/mL after the first oral granisetron administration and 2.6 ng/mL following the final oral granisetron dose. When administered for 7 days the granisetron TDS 52 cm2 patch delivers, on average, a dose of 3.1 mg of granisetron per day. Hence the granisetron TDS 52 cm² patch delivers comparable average plasma concentrations to 2 mg oral granisetron every 24 hours. Therapeutically relevant concentrations were maintained through to the removal of the patch at 144 hrs (Day 6), with less fluctuation in comparison with repeat daily oral administration. Upon removal of the patch plasma concentrations continued to decline slowly, suggesting a dermal reservoir of drug.Consistent with PK studies of other formulations the interpatient variability of granisetron concentrations and exposure is high.

## Methods

## Study Participants

Main inclusion criteria: (1) Male or female aged; ≥ 18 yrs for the Czech Republic and Russia; ≥ 16 yrs for Serbia and Montenegro; ≥ 15 yrs for Bulgaria, India, Mexico, Poland, Romania and the USA (no upper limit) (2) Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of ≤ 2. (3) Life expectancy of ≥ 3 months; (4) Assigned to receive the first cycle of a new multi-day MEC or HEC regimen including the daily administration of a cytotoxic regimen with the emetogenic potential of level 3-5 (Hesketh 1997) for 3-5 days.

Main exclusion criteria: (i) hypersensitivity to adhesive plasters; (ii) contraindications to 5-HT3 receptor antagonists; (iii)any cause for nausea and vomiting other than CINV (iii) any episode of retching, vomiting or uncontrolled nausea in the 72 hour period prior to chemotherapy administration; (iv) clinically relevant abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters (at the discretion of the investigator) and/or a baseline QT corrected for heart beat (QTc) &gt; 450 ms for male patients or a baseline QTc &gt; 470 ms for female patients; (v) Other 5-HT3, neurokinin-1 (NK1) or dopamine antagonists.

## Treatments

Treatments Patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups at a 1:1 ratio: (i) GTDS + placebo capsule; (ii) placebo patch + active capsule (2 mg oral granisetron). The patch was applied 1-2 days prior to the first dose of MEC or HEC and remained in place for a full 7 days in all patients (e.g. Saturday 7 pm to Saturday 7 pm). The capsule was administered 1 h prior to MEC or HEC on each day the HEC or MEC cytotoxic agent or combination of cytotoxics was administered.

Prior and concomitant therapy. Some of the treatments were considered as criteria for exclusion due to violations of the protocol, depending on when the concomitant medication was administered: (i) concomitant radiotherapy of total body, brain or upper abdomen within one week of study entry or planned during the study; (ii) intake of medication to control the symptoms of a brain tumour, brain metastasis or seizure disorder; (iii) patients using SSRI antidepressants (unless a stable dose for the duration of the study); (iv) scheduled to receive an neurotising NK1 receptor antagonist, dopamine receptor antagonist or another 5-HT3 receptor antagonist between 72 h prior to the administration of the chemotherapy and patch removal

Concomitant use of corticosteroids The concomitant use of prophylactic corticosteroids was permitted throughout the study according to local clinical practice.

Rescue Medication. The investigator was permitted to prescribe rescue medication, in accordance with the site's standard of care, to be taken by the patient, as required. There were no restrictions on the use of anti-emetic drugs as rescue medication except those known to cause prolongation of QTc. Patients recorded details of the medication taken, including time, in their diary card.

## Objectives

The null hypothesis was that granisetron TDS was inferior to oral granisetron.

Non-inferiority margin. The applicant employed delta for Non-inferiority margin as 15%.

The applicant justified the chosen NI margin for multiday type CINV as follows:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

(1) The historical evidences for efficacy, including the effect of intravenous 5-HT3-RA plus dexamethasone in multiday type of CINV (3 to 5 days of cisplatin administration) as shown during MASCC Perugia 2004 Consensus conference.

(2) Clinical judgement of the scientific advisory board.

(3) Superiority of the reference product over placebo: numerical difference is estimated from 24% to 35%.

(4). Additive effect of dexamethasone. The argumentation is based on (i) an estimated minimum relative value for granisetron TDS (~7%) that is falling within chosen 15% of NI margin and (ii) similar to 15/C study design approach taken in previous study for palonsetron authorisation.

The 2-sided 95% confidence interval of difference was obtained via a logistic regression, adjusting for study treatment, gender, planned duration of chemotherapy regimen (3, 4/5 days), planned cisplatin/corticosteroid use, and chemotherapy naive status (yes, no) as recorded in IVRS (called 'planned chemotherapy naivety'). A main effects model was used.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint of the trial was the composite endpoint complete control (CC) of CINV over the whole period at risk from the first dose of chemotherapy to 24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy (3, 4 or 5 days). CC was defined in study 15/C as no vomiting and/or retching, no more than mild nausea and no rescue medication.

The main secondary efficacy endpoints were : (i) time from start of MEC or HEC to treatment failure (failure of CC); (ii) time from start of MEC or HEC to treatment failure (failure of CR, i.e. no vomiting and/or retching and no rescue medication); (iii) time from start of MEC or HEC to first administration of rescue medication; (iv) time from start of MEC or HEC to first emetic episode (vomiting/retching); (v) Time from start of MEC or HEC to first episode of more than mild nausea; (vi) Percentage of patients achieving CC of CINV overall and during different time periods.

## Sample size

The sample size for this study was based on efficacy considerations. In particular, it was based upon the primary efficacy endpoint: the percentage of patients achieving CC of CINV during the period (from the first administration until 24 h after the last administration of ME or HE multi day chemotherapy).

The null hypothesis was that the TDS is inferior to oral granisetron. The alternative hypothesis was that the TDS is not inferior (by greater than a non-inferiority margin Δ ) to oral granisetron.

The hypothesis was tested via construction of a two-sided 95% confidence interval around the difference in percentage CC between the 2 treatment groups (D). If the lower limit of this confidence interval was greater than Δ , the null hypothesis was rejected.

Setting the reference rate for CC with oral granisetron to 50%, an absolute non-inferiority margin of 15%, and 90% power, 576 patients (288 per group) were required. This assumed that there was no clinical difference (i.e. D=0) between oral granisetron and GTDS. This sample number was conservative in the sense that it was based on the CC rate for oral granisetron which gave the highest required sample size. However, it did not allow for an interstratum difference in effect size.  Analysis of the primary endpoint was carried out on both the FAS and the PPS. As the PPS was likely to be smaller than the FAS and assuming 9% drop out, based on the GTDS Phase II study, the randomisation of approximately 630 patients in all (315 per treatment group), yielding a PPS of 576 patients, was planned.

## Randomisation

Once patients were confirmed as eligible for the study and had completed all screening procedures, they were each assigned a unique randomisation number by a centralized randomisation procedure using Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). After randomisation, the patient received a unique blinded number, allocated by the IVRS, corresponding to the patient's randomised treatment group. After matching the appropriate patient pack with the patient pack number, in accordance with the IVRS, patients were dispensed medication by the investigator or the designee. The patient pack number was entered in the CRF. A randomisation list was generated independently by a statistician, not involved in the conduct or management of the study, using the validated computer programme SAS, Version 8.02.

A random permuted block design was used to obtain a 1:1 ratio with categories using the following stratification variables:

- Gender
- Chemotherapy regimen:
1. Cisplatin chemotherapy regimen,
2. Non-cisplatin chemotherapy regimen with planned use of corticosteroids
3. Non-cisplatin chemotherapy regimen without planned use of corticosteroids
- Duration of planned chemotherapy (3 day versus 4/5 day)
- Chemotherapy naive versus non-naive

## Blinding (masking)

A double-dummy method was used to ensure blinding. Each patient received a patch (active or placebo) and an appropriate number of capsules (active or placebo). The patches containing granisetron and patches without granisetron were of identical appearance, as were the capsules containing granisetron and placebo capsules.

The investigator did not break the treatment code unless knowledge of the patient's treatment was required for the patient's clinical care and safety. If unblinding was considered necessary the respective patient was withdrawn from the study after unblinding.

## Statistical methods

Study populations. Several populations for statistical analysis were defined for this study. Full Analysis Set . The Full Analysis Set (FAST) was defined as all randomised patients who received study treatment (GTDS or capsule) and had at least one efficacy assessment after the start of chemotherapy. Per Protocol Set. The Per Protocol Set (PPS) was defined as all FAST patients without violations of the protocol which directly impinged on or affected the primary endpoint. Safety Set. The Safety Set (SS) was defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment (GTDS or capsule).

Handling of outliers and missing data. Missing data were not imputed, except for the analysis of efficacy endpoints, where the following assumptions were made: (i) If severity of event was missing the worse case was assumed; (ii) If time of event/rescue medication was missing but the date corresponded to a chemotherapy day then the time was set to 1 minute (min) after start of that day's chemotherapy; (iii) Nausea and vomiting starting prior to the first chemotherapy on day 1 were

ignored; (iv) Patients who withdrew from the study during the primary endpoint evaluation period were assumed not to have attained the primary endpoint (i.e. not achieved CC).

## Results

## Participant flow

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

A total of 39 patients (24 patients in the GTDS group and 15 patients in the oral group) from the FAS were excluded from the PPS due to protocol violations.

## Recruitment

First patient enrolled: 24 January 2006 Last patient completed: 11 October 2006

## Conduct of the study

Several amendments were introduced (i) Country-Specific Amendment 1 as requested by local Regulatory Authorities (exclude minors in some countries), (ii) Global Amendment 1 as requested by the FDA (mainly introducing the aspects of QT prolongation measurements), and (iii) changes in SAP (main of them - changing the definition of 'overall emetogenicity' from average to maximal observed; primary endpoint results was examined not via an unadjusted logistic regression . but the normal approximation to the binomial .) (iv) additional changes before unblinding (omitting metabolites analysis [due to unavailability of validated methods], method of tabulation of TEAE, omitting capturing prior CINV); (v) Additional changes post unblinding (as some subjects had been incorrectly included/excluded from the PPS. This was corrected post unblinding and all affected tables, figures and listings were re-run).

## Baseline data

Demographics. Demography data show that patient where comparable within groups, with regards to age group, weight, height, BMI and ethnic origin. Patients where comparable also with regards to nicotine and alcohol use as well as ECOG performance status.

Individual data on medical history, related to primary disease reveal that in general primary tumour sites were comparable. More then 40 % had metastatic disease. The history of disease therapy for the treatment groups was comparable with regards to history of radiotherapy, number of curses; history of chemotherapy and number of previous courses. The most common past relevant medical conditions were comparable by system - organ class.

## Primary disease.

There was a broad range of primary disease. Pro-emetogenic primary diseases (i.e. Gastrointestinal and gynaecological malignancies) were balanced in both treatment arms. Pro-emetogenicity of CNS metastases was not captured however it was acknowledged by the CHMP that this influence might be minor due to defined exclusion criteria (any condition likely to cause nausea and vomiting other than CINV), randomization and short duration to efficacy assessment (5 days).

## Chemotherapy and their emetogenicity.

An external expert classified the 159 unique regimens applied in the pivotal study into 28 sets (15 HEC and 13 MEC regimens) which were equally balanced in the oral and the TDS group. The algorithm to calculate the emetogenicity for combination chemotherapy was proposed as published by Hesketh (1997) 1 . This algorithm was introduced prior to unblinding into this study as the amendment following expert advice. The CHMP considered the Hesketh score as informative for the regulatory purpose for this application.

Concomitant medication. The use of antiemetogenic concomitant medicines was slightly higher in the TDS group (up to 12- 13%, firstly for propulsives, antihistamines, and benzodiazepines).

Concomitant corticosteroid use was comparable between groups (median dosage was 8 and 7.5 mg of dexamethasone equivalent per day).  Of the 621 patients included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS), 396 were also administered corticosteroids.  As anticipated the use of corticosteroids with cisplatin was high (277/446 = 62.1%) and stratification according to cisplatin use helped ensure that the use of corticosteroids overall in the study was balanced between the two groups (oral: 201 patients; granisetron TDS: 195 patients). The majority of patients used them not as rescue medications. The use of non-rescue concomitant therapy was comparable between both treatments groups.

The corticosteroid use was analysed for the Full analysis set.  All corticosteroids used during the 24 hours prior to the start of chemotherapy and during days on which chemotherapy was given were included, unless identified in the case report form as 'rescue medication'.  Corticosteroids with a respiratory indication are excluded (4 patients).; a: British National Formulary, 2007 ; b: Patients who received no CS are included as zero dose in the median, minimum and maximum

Treatment compliance and patch adhesion. The majority of patients (~76%) in both treatment groups had the patch on for 7 days and most of the patients (~90%) for primary evaluation had taken a capsule for the correct number of days.

## Numbers analysed

Overall 715 patients were screened to yield 621 in the FAS and 582 in the PPS.  The disposition of the patients is depicted in Table 21 and Figure 12.

## Outcomes and estimation

## Primary Endpoint (Complete Control)

In the PPS population the percentage of patients who achieved CC from the first administration until 24 hours after the start of the last day's administration of the MEC or HEC regimen was comparable between granisetron TDS and the oral groups with the point estimate of the difference between groups of -4.89% (95% CI-12.91%; 3.15).

Since the lower limit of this confidence interval was above -15%, the null hypothesis was rejected and the alternative hypothesis was accepted, i.e. that granisetron TDS was non-inferior to oral granisetron.

The results of the supportive analysis of the primary endpoint on the FAS were similar to the results obtained for the PPS (see Table 32). The percentage of patients achieving complete control was comparable between the two treatment groups.

The CHMP noted that only one cycle of chemotherapy was included in the pivotal study 392MD/15/C, and therefore the activity during further cycles of chemotherapy is unknown. The applicant explained that is not seeking specific wording in the indication relating to use over multiple cycles. This was acknowledged by the CHMP and included in 5.1 of the SmPC.

Secondary Endpoints. A number of secondary efficacy analyses revealed similar differences in secondary efficacy assessment including the estimated point differences as assessed via complete response and total control ranging from -3.8% to -6.58% for PPS population and from -4.5% to 7.74% for FAST population (see Table 36). The lower bound of the 95% CI was below settled delta of 15% only in one case - CR in FAST and above -15% for all the rest response analyses.

The efficacy analysis by Day showed results consistent with the overall non-inferiority conclusion of the primary analysis. On Day 1, the estimated point difference was -4.89%; 95% confidence interval (12.91%, +3.13%) for the PPS. Although the estimated difference between the means for CC is greatest on Day 1 the lower bound of the 95% CI remains above -15%, demonstrating consistency with the primary efficacy endpoint.

PEEP: primary endpoint evaluation period,

N°: Number of patients with data available

N: Number of patients in the respective treatment group

n: Number of patients

%: Percentage based on N*

The CHMP noted that since non inferiority was shown for the primary endpoint, and the endpoints are all related, it is not surprising that the small, non significant difference of -4.89% observed in the primary endpoint between the TDS and oral groups was generally apparent across the secondary endpoints.

## Day 1 and overall (up to Day 5) treatment failure calculations.

The applicant presented clearly positioned composition of treatment failures on Day 1 (see Table below).

The CHMP acknowledged that these data represent somewhat comparable trends in distribution.

## Ancillary analyses

## Heterogeneity

The CHMP raised questions regarding the design of the pivotal study mainly due to a wide variety of chemotherapy regimens administered, likely regional differences in patient care and concerns that the randomisation and the statistical analysis does not consider the influence of emetogenicity potential of primary diseases possibly confounding the complete control positives or negatives giving rise to concerns about the comparability of treatment groups and the assay sensitivity of the study.

In response the applicant emphasized that the concept of this development were the comparison of two routes of delivery of granisetron in which the only difference expected between these routes was PK. To address the issue of wide variety of chemotherapy regimens the applicant argued that the treatment regimens used in Study 392MD/15/C were examined by an expert independent oncologist and grouped into 28 categories with similar emetogenic chemotherapies (MEC or HEC) which where balance in both treatment arms. According to the applicant these groupings are expected to reduce the perceived heterogeneity among the treatment regimens. Furthermore the most important variables of treatment are the inclusion or exclusion of cisplatin and the classifying of the treatment as moderately or highly emetogenic.

In Study 392MD/15/C, 69.9% of patients received a cisplatin-based regimen. Cisplatin is the most frequently used chemotherapeutic agent in multiple day chemotherapy. The Applicant provided further analysis of the balance of chemotherapy regimens administered between treatment groups in Study 392MD/15/C in Table 9. and noted that the data confirm that cisplatin use by day was also balanced between the treatment groups.

The applicant performed a logistic regression analysis for effect modification in the pivotal Study 392MD/15/C. Table 10 below summarizes the results of the logistic regression analysis taking into account five selected factors (regimen (cisplatin present/absent); emetogenicity of regimen (MEC or HEC); Country, Region, emetogenic potential of primary disease).

In all five cases the P value for the interaction did not achieve statistical significance (P &gt; 0.05). Therefore the applicant concluded that the treatment effect is similar, except for random fluctuations across the subgroups.

Further to these analyses, the applicant provided several arguments related to other clinical studies for the development of anti-emetics for CINV, the standardize management of monitoring in study 392MD/15/C, as well as the evaluation of assay sensitivity of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The CHMP agreed that primary disease is not an important factor in emetogenicity, provided the primary site is outside the CNS; only primary brain tumor or brain metastases can have an impact on nausea and vomiting. The CHMP acknowledged that at baseline patients in the studies of other antiemetics had a broad range of primary disease with varying emetogenic potential; thus study 392MD/15/C was conducted in line with this approach and precedent. Investigators launching a clinical trial intended to assess the efficacy of an antiemetic drug are free to choose among all the available regimens a few regimes within the same emetogenicity class (HEC or MEC). However CHMP emphasized that the use of a wide range of regimes in the same trial as much as different primary diseases and regional differences in patient care can make the comparability of treatment groups difficult and may compromise the assay sensitivity of studies. However it is acknowledged that in this case the pivotal trial shows non inferiority versus the 2mg oral dosage for the overall population providing valuable information close to a real live scenario making the study sufficiently informative for a new mode of administration in a substance with established benefit risk profile.

## Clinical relevance of inferior plasma levels

During the procedure the applicant was requested to provide argumentation that the difference in plasma levels between granisetron oral and granisetron patch is not clinically relevant concerning efficacy overall and specially during the first day of chemotherapy.

The applicant used a logistic regression to test for an association between each PK parameter and achieving CC on Day 1.

Methodologically the logistic regression model assumed a linear relationship between the log odds of achieving CC and log transformed PK parameters, i.e. a sigmoidal relationship between the probability of achieving CC and log transformed PK parameters. This analysis included PK parameter, treatment group, Day 1 emetogenicity, chemotherapy naïve, gender, age and all interactions. In each case, the PK parameter was included in the model and the remaining were added, if significant (P &lt; 0.05), in a stepwise fashion. The final models for each of the PK parameters are presented in Table 1 , Table 2 and Table 3 below.

For both AUC and Cmax no statistically significant association with CC was observed, suggesting that within the range covering both granisetron TDS and oral granisetron at 2 mg QD, CC on the first day of chemotherapy is not dependent on daily granisetron exposure or achieved maximum levels. The relationship between observed plasma concentration and % CC on Day 1 was statistically significant (P = 0.0038).

TDS. Figure 1 (log scale) and Figure 2 (linear scale) shows the modelled probability of achieving CC on Day 1, and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Figure 1 and shows that based on the obtained statistically significant association, the change in the probability of achieving CC on D1 across the range of observed granisetron plasma levels at the start of chemotherapy for oral granisetron and granisetron TDS is shallow. Figure 1 also shows the observed D1 CC figures (82.0% for granisetron TDS and 88.5% for oral granisetron). This demonstrates that a 14-fold increase in granisetron levels would be required to increase the probability of achieving CC from 82 to 88.5%, which is much higher than the observed 2.2-fold difference in geometric mean granisetron plasma levels for oral granisetron and granisetron TDS.

The applicant provided also predicted probabilities of achieving CC for treatment groups, based on granisetron geometric mean levels (see Table 4 ) for the two treatment groups, based on the modeled relationship and noted that based on this relationship the observed difference in geometric

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

mean plasma levels for oral granisetron and granisetron TDS would lead to only a minimal difference in the probability of achieving CC (84.4% for granisetron TDS and 86.4% for oral granisetron), with the 95% CIs almost completely overlapping.

Furthermore the applicant noted that the observed plasma levels in the granisetron oral and TDS groups at Visit 1 differ by a factor of 2.2 in geometric mean. An oral 1 mg twice daily (BID) dosing regimen is approved for CINV and therefore by implication is considered equally as effective as 2 mg QD. The plasma level one hour after the first dose (i.e. the start of chemotherapy) dosing for the 2 mg QD regimen would be expected to be 2-fold that for the oral 1 mg BID dosing regimen. Thus, a difference in plasma level of the order of approximately 2-fold, as observed when comparing oral granisetron to granisetron TDS, should be acceptable. It is also noteworthy that in both treatment groups the granisetron level at the start of chemotherapy was below LLOQ (0.05) in a number of subjects. This number was more than twice as high in the oral granisetron group compared to the granisetron TDS group: 26/235 (11.1%) vs 12/230 (5.2%) respectively.

Besides overall CC, oral granisetron and granisetron TDS were also compared based on CC on each individual day. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 6 below. The criterion for noninferiority was met for each individual day of treatment, as the lower limit of the 95% CIs were above the non-inferiority margin of -15%. The applicant noted that for granisetron TDS the % CC on each day was relatively constant. For oral granisetron a marked drop in % CC was observed on Days 2-5 relative to Day 1. This observation was also confirmed statistically, comparing CC on Days 1 and 2 for both oral granisetron and granisetron TDS using McNemar's test (Oral: P &lt;0.001; TDS: P = 0.212).

The applicant noted that in view of this observation, the possible relevance of differences in granisetron plasma levels in terms of clinical efficacy may be questioned, as the observed drop in % CC after Day 1 for oral granisetron cannot be explained by changes in granisetron plasma concentrations or exposure.

For oral granisetron, exposure even increases slightly during continued use due to accumulation to steady-state levels (see Study 392MD/11/C where oral graniseteron is taken for 5 days). Granisetron TDS is designed to deliver relatively constant granisetron levels for multiple days (as confirmed in the performed clinical pharmacology studies) and therefore plasma levels will be relatively similar on the first and second day of chemotherapy. The applicant argued that therefore on the second day of chemotherapy the difference in granisetron plasma levels for oral granisetron and granisetron TDS can be considered to be at least similar to Day 1. However on Day 2 only a marginal difference in % CC was observed. This might highlight the lack of a clear dependency of CC on granisetron levels, when comparing granisetron TDS and oral granisetron at 2 mg QD.

The CHMP acknowledged that the gradual increase in plasma levels of granisetron following application of the transdermal patch and possible slower onset of efficacy compared to 2 mg oral granisetron at the start of chemotherapy can be managed with clear instructions in the SmPC that the TDS should be applied 24-48 hours before chemotherapy.

The slower onset of efficacy can be balanced restricting the indication to patients having swallowing difficulties where the benefits of a transdermal system are obvious.

## Additional Efficacy Analyses

The generalisation of the primary endpoint results was examined using a breakdown by the categories: gender, (actual) cisplatin and corticosteroid use, planned duration of chemotherapy regimen and chemotherapy naivety, and is summarised in Table 33 and Figure 13

Gender differences. Study 15/C revealed tendency for better efficacy of granisetron TDS in females vs. males. According to the applicant, the reason for having lower bound of the 95% CI below -15% in males as compared to females is due to underpowered study for this analysis. In addition, the efficacy results do not correlate with exposure differences between males and females.

Corticosteroid Use. The CC proportions divided by CS use and by emetogenicity or cisplatin use were assessed and study results revealed comparable point estimates. CSs had an additive effect on CC during PEEP, although without significant interaction during a logistic regression analysis. The effect was observed in both study arms, numerically more in Oral vs TDS groups, 7.2% vs 5.1%, respectively.

## Summary of the main study

The following table summarises the efficacy results from the main study supporting the present application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Study 392MD/8/C. This exploratory Phase 2 efficacy study was initially conducted to investigate the efficacy of the granisetron TDS in delayed CINV . It was a randomised, active-control, double-blind, double-dummy, multi-centre Phase 2 study comparing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

granisetron TDS with oral granisetron in CINV following a single day administration of MEC. The trial was conducted at 21 sites in Germany.

The trial was constructed to allow study of both pre and post 24-hour phases of CINV following chemotherapy. The primary analysis was on TC of CINV for the period 24 to 120 hours following chemotherapy administration (i.e. delayed CINV). Total control (TC) was defined as no nausea, no vomiting, no use of rescue medication and no withdrawal from the study.

Inclusion criteria: (i) ECOG status &lt; 2; (ii) Life expectancy of at least 3 months; (iii) Chemotherapynaïve for at least 6 months since last chemotherapy; (iv) At least 3 weeks since last major surgery, including thoracotomy, laparotomy, craniotomy or vascular surgery involving the major vessels; (v) Scheduled to receive a single-day regimen of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (i.e. any dose of carboplatin, epirubicin, idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, mitoxantrone; methotrexate (&gt;250 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (&lt;1500 mg/m2), doxorubicin (&gt;25 mg/m2) or cisplatin (&lt;50 mg/m2) infused over 1-4 hours.

Exclusion criteria: (i) Tumours of the head, neck or stomach; (ii) Received radiation therapy involving the abdomen or pelvis within the 48 hours period prior to, or were scheduled to receive such radiation, during the treatment period.

Unlike Study 15/C, the exploratory 8/C study was designed without CS use.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving TC of CINV for the period 24 to 120 hours following chemotherapy administration (i.e. delayed CINV). This was a superiority study for delayed CINV: based on a logistic regression model (with treatment, centre, gender and use of nicotine as factors), the 2-sided hypothesis that the granisetron TDS is not different to the single oral dose of granisetron (2 mg) was tested with an α level of 0.0499 on data from the intention-to-treat (ITT) population.

Secondary endpoints were: (i) proportion of patients achieving TC of CINV during the 0-24 hour time period post chemotherapy; (ii) proportion of patients achieving TC of CINV during the 0-120 hour time period post chemotherapy.

Oral active and oral placebo were taken 1 hour before the administration of ME chemotherapy. Patches were applied 24 hours before chemotherapy and remained in-situ for 4 days after chemotherapy - 5 days in total.

Originally a total of 210 patients were planned to be randomised. However, an interim analysis of the results all patients enrolled until 31 March 2005 (133 patients) suggested that although the granisetron TDS showed comparable efficacy to oral granisetron for the first 24 hours, there was no evidence of superiority during the period 24 - 120 hours post chemotherapy. Therefore, patient recruitment was halted at the end of April 2005, at which time 179 patients had been randomised.

## 2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The efficacy of granisetron TDS has been studied in ten clinical studies involving 1,386 subjects (576 healthy subjects and 810 cancer patients with CINV), of whom approximately 58 % were the target patient population - cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The clinical development strategy was designed to bridge to the previous findings of efficacy and safety for the reference product. The performed study program as well as the size of the database is considered adequate for this hybrid application.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

During the procedure the design of the pivotal study was challenged mainly due to a wide variety of chemotherapy regimens administered, likely regional differences in patient care and concerns that the randomisation and the statistical analysis not considering the influence of emetogenicity potential of primary diseases possibly confounding the complete control positives or negatives giving rise to concerns about the comparability of treatment groups and the assay sensitivity of the study.

The applicant argued that the development of granisetron was not based on NME but on new route of administration and could show that from 28 categories with similar emetogenic chemotherapies, the most important variables - the fact of cisplatin administration and the emetogencity (MEC or HEC) were balanced between the study arms.

Using logistic regression analysis for effect modification in the pivotal Study taking account the five most relevant selected factors (regimen (cisplatin present/absent); emetogenicity of regimen (MEC or HEC); Country, Region and emetogenic potential of two essential primary diseases (gynecology and GI) the applicant could show that the P value for the interaction did not achieve statistical significance (P &gt; 0.05).

Regional differences in patient care were addressed through standardized management without any findings indicating regional differences in care.

The challenging of the assay sensitivity of the pivotal study was addressed by conducting several sensitivity analyses to confirm non-inferiority, in particular, examining subgroups of patients who received cisplatin-containing regimens and showing consistent results. The CHMP acknowledged that in this case the pivotal trial shows non inferiority versus the 2mg tablet for the overall population providing valuable information close to a real live scenario and making the study sufficiently informative for a new mode of administration in a substance with established benefit risk profile.

The applicant provided relevant arguments why the difference in plasma levels between granisetron oral and granisetron TDS should not be clinically relevant concerning efficacy overall and specially during the first day of chemotherapy arguing that the observed statistically significant difference of 2.2 times in mean plasma levels on D1 is close to the difference observed in another approved posology for oral granisetron (1mg BID vs 2 mg QD), that the probabilities to achieve CC on D1 for TDS and oral formulation are quite close each to other (0.844 vs 0.864, respectively) and that there are inconsistencies in changes in plasma concentrations as compared to changes in respective CC proportions highlighting the lack of a clear dependency of CC on granisetron levels.

The CHMP acknowledged that the gradual increase in plasma levels of granisetron following application of the transdermal patch and possible slower onset of efficacy compared to 2 mg oral granisetron at the start of chemotherapy can be managed with clear instructions in the SmPC that the TDS should be applied 24-48 hours before chemotherapy.

The slower onset of efficacy can be balanced restricting the indication to patients having swallowing difficulties where the benefits of a transdermal system are obvious.

The CHMP recommended including QoL (Functional Living Index of Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire) as an assessment in the future clinical programme, including the ongoing paediatric studies.

## 2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

For this Hybrid application the applicant performed one clinical pivotal study to show non inferiority of the granisetron TDS to 2mg tablet. Concerns of heterogeneity in the design of the pivotal study and inferior plasma levels at day 1 leading to inferior efficacy at day 1 were adequately addressed by the applicant.

## 2.6. Clinical safety

## Introduction

The safety of granisetron TDS is based on the clinical studies performed with this formulation and the available post-marketing safety data for this medicinal product. The main source for the integrated safety profile is based on two studies with cancer patients (8/C and 15/C); the integrated summary for healthy subjects is also presented. In addition, the safety profile of the reference product is taken into consideration.

## Patient exposure

In the original studies 796 (392 healthy subjects, 404 cancer patients) were exposed to granisetron TDS. Across these studies, durations of exposure varied from 1 day to 23 days. The majority of healthy subjects wore the 52 cm² TDS for a minimum of 6 days (range 1-23 days) with 202 healthy subjects exposed to granisetron TDS for 23 days. All the cancer patients were exposed to the 52 cm² TDS, the majority for 5, 6, or 7 days with 246 cancer patients treated for 7 days.

The mean age of the cancer group was 55 years and the healthy population was 37 years. The overall age range in studies was 16 - 86 years and the populations were predominantly of Caucasian ethnicity.

In addition, post-marketing safety data covering a 21 months period of use in the US (12 September 2008 through 11 June 2010) was also provided.

## Adverse events

In the main study the most commonly reported adverse reaction was constipation, occurring in approximately 10.4% of patients. The majority of adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity.

KEY:n=number ofpatients;%=percentageofpatients:E=numberofevents:TDS=transdermaldelivery system

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

During the assessment process the applicant acknowledged a potential underreporting of the adverse events headache, constipation, dizziness and asthenia/fatigue and argued that comparisons across trials are cofounded by study-specific differences such as schedules of chemotherapy and patient visits, dose and study design as well as possibly by the higher familiarity of physicians with granisetroncontaining products compared to the initial trials. Therefore the MAH included in addition, adverse reactions reported for other formulations of granisetron as class effects into the SmPC.

## Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

The application included reports of two serious adverse events (SAEs) that were observed in the healthy subject studies - a cerebrovascular accident in Study 26/C (considered by the investigator to be unrelated) and atrial fibrillation case in Study 40/C (considered possibly related).

Twenty-two granisetron TDS patients recorded 33 SAEs (5.45%) compared with twenty patients in the oral granisetron group who recorded 32 SAEs (4.9%). Four cancer patients reported related events three patients in the oral granisetron group had QTc prolongation reported as an SAE and one subject in the granisetron TDS group had constipation.

Eighteen cancer patients died as a result of AEs during the clinical trials; ten of the patients were treated with granisetron TDS and eight received oral granisetron. None of the deaths was considered related to granisetron TDS.

## Laboratory findings

Overall, there were no significant consistent patterns of alterations in biochemistry, haematology and urinalysis measurements for the cancer population .  Changes in vital signs data were not considered significant.

## Other significant events

## Skin irritation and sensitisation

The evaluation of skin irritation and sensitisation was primarily based on an analysis of 201 healthy volunteers included in study 26/C.

Generally, in all studies healthy subject population 46 AEs were recorded for application site erythema of granisetron TDS, seven AEs for application site pruritus, four AEs for application site irritation, four

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

AEs for application site reaction, two AEs for application site papules, one for application site dryness, one for application site eczema and one for application site pain.

Dermal tolerance in cancer patients was formally assessed in study 8/C. In addition, skin tolerance data were collected as AEs in study 15/C. In the cancer patient safety population three AEs were recorded for application site pruritis with one case of oedema. Of these, one case of pruritis and the oedema case were reported as related to study medication.

All cases were reported as of mild severity and none led to withdrawal from the studies.

The results of the dermal tolerance studies in both patients and healthy subjects suggest that mild irritant and hypersensitivity reactions are possible with granisetron TDS. As a consequence of this the precaution has been included in the EU SmPC Section 4.4.

## Phototoxicity

Granisetron TDS did not show any potential for photoirritation or photosensitivity when tested in vivo in guinea-pigs. Granisetron was not phototoxic when tested in vitro in a mouse fibroblast cell line. When tested for potential photogenotoxicity in vitro in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, granisetron increased the percentage of cells with chromosome damage following photoirradiation.

Although, the clinical relevance of this finding is not completely clear, it was recommended to advise patients to avoid exposure to sunlight in section 4.4 and to mention the finding in 5.3 of the SmPC

## Possible hypersensitivity/local tolerance

Hypersensitivity-type adverse events were reported in a total of 65/784 (8.3%) subjects treated with granisetron TDS in the clinical programme, including application site erythema (46 [5.9%]); application site pruritus (10 [1.3%]); application site irritation (4 [0.5%]); application site reaction (4 [0.5%]) and hypersensitivity (1 [0.1%]). With the exception of the case of hypersensitivity and two cases of application site pruritus, all hypersensitivity type adverse events were considered by the Investigator to be related to study treatment.

In addition, as of 11 June 2011, 13 adverse event reports of hypersensitivity reactions were received in the global safety database since launch, including application site erythema (3); application site rash (3); application site reaction (3); application site irritation (2); and application site pruritus (2). There were no SAE reports of hypersensitivity in the clinical trials for granisetron TDS, and all 13 post marketing cases of hypersensitivity type reactions reported were non-serious.

The CHMP considered that although reports of hypersensitivity reactions in the global safety database are rare, the possibility of such an event occurring cannot be ruled out. Hypersensitivity has therefore been added as a potential risk in the Risk Management Plan, including appropriate pharmacovigilance and risk minimization activities.

## Safety in special populations

Special attention was given to subgroups of patients with impaired hepatic or renal function and no new information has been gathered during the course of the development programme for granisetron TDS with respect to this patient population. As no studies were performed in children no information is available for the paediatric population.

An analysis of age among granisetron TDS-treated patients was performed and no association with increased frequency of occurrence of AEs was found.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No studies were performed on drug interactions with regard to safety.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

Adverse events were recorded as the reason for withdrawal in 24 subjects overall: 10 cancer patients from the granisetron TDS group, 7 cancer patients from the oral granisetron group and 6 healthy subjects from study 26/C and one healthy subject from 40/C.

In the healthy subject group, five of the withdrawals were considered related to study medication - (3 cases constipation, 1 case of atrial fibrillation and 1 case of abdominal pain) and one possibly related (atrial fibrillation). Three additional cases were unrelated, including an SAE of a cerebrovascular accident.

In cancer patients, most AEs leading to withdrawal were assessed as not related to study medication, but instead related to the underlying medical condition or the chemotherapy administered.

## Post marketing experience

Granisetron TDS was first authorised on 12 September 2008. An Integrated Post-marketing Safety Report for granisetron TDS (patch 3.1 mg/24 hours) has been provided in support of the EU licensing application. This report covers the 21 month period from 12th September 2008 (IBD) to 11th June 2010. An estimated 80,940 patches have been distributed since launch through 11 June 2010. Based on the distributed patches of 80,940 units into the US market, the patient exposure has been estimated at 1,552 treatment years.

Overall, during this review period, the MAH has received 71 case reports: 34 from HCP, 36 from consumers and 1 from clinical trials. Seven reports were serious, two of those concerned cardiac disorders: sick sinus syndrome and atrial fibrilation. The MAH concluded that a review of all new safety information identified during this review period did not reveal any new safety signals.

Ongoing review of the reported detachment rate from the market gives no indication that this rate may be any higher than that reported in the Phase 3 clinical trial.

One unexplained case of epilepsy was observed postmarketing. The epileptogenicity is one of the observed effects in the acute non-clinical toxicity study. The applicant explained that the particular patient had a history of complex partial seizures and possible precipitating factors for TEAE. This is explanation was considered acceptable CHMP.

## 2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety of granisetron TDS is based on a database generated in 796 healty subjects and cancer patients (392 and 404 cancer respectively). In addition to this, post marketing experience estimated at 1,552 treatment years and is contributing to the safety profiling. Thus, the size of the safety data base and the exposure over time could in principle be acceptable for an application for a new pharmaceutical form of a known active substance as it is the case with this application.

In the clinical studiers granisetron TDS, like other 5-HT3-antagonists, showed an increased risk of constipation, headache and hepatotoxicity. The post marketing experience did not reveal any new important risk identified and the safety concerns listed as potential risks are endorsed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The  CHMP  noted  a  lower  then  historically  expected  reporting  rate  for    oral  granisetron  2mg  in  the clinical studies which was explained by the applicant by possible higher familiarity with the granisetron product  compared  to  the  initial  trials  and  that  comparisons  across  trials  are  confounded  by  studyspecific differences such as schedules of chemotherapy and patient visits, dose and study design.

It  was  therefore  considered  adequate  to  add  granisetron  class  effects  seen  with  other  formulations (oral and intravenous) in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been associated with QT interval prolongation. However, no clinically relevant effects on ECG have been observed in clinical studies with SANCUSO, including a thorough QT study in 240 healthy subjects.

Although no cases of phototoxicity were observed in man, findings in a laboratory model using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are suggestive of a potential photogenotoxic effect. As a consequence a warning regarding exposure to sunlight has been included in sections 4.4 and 5.3 of the SmPC.

Effects of photogenotoxicity observed in the pre-clinical tests and hypersensitivity reactions as observed in the safety database were added to the RMP as important potential risks and were reflected adequately in the relevant sections of the SmPC.

Taking into account the experience with the active substance in other formulations, the CHMP considers the safety profile of the patch acceptable.

The safety profile is reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

## 2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

The clinical studies with granisetron TDS and the post marketing experience with the medicinal product did  not  reveal  any  new  important risk.  The  known safety profile of granisetron has been taken into consideration  and  the  CHMP  concludes  that  the  safety  profile  for  Sancuso  is  acceptable.  The  SmPC adequately reflects this body of information.

## 2.7. Pharmacovigilance

## Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the legislative requirements.

## Risk Management Plan

The applicant submitted a risk management plan.

Although no evidence of an increased incidence of adverse reactions have been observed in hepatically-impaired patients receiving granisetron orally and intravenously, based on granisetron pharmacokinetics, a degree of caution must be exercised in this population. Cardiac disorders: 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists, such as granisetron, may be associated with arrhythmias or ECG abnormalities. This potentially may have clinical significance in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders or patients who are being treated with antiarrhythmics or beta-blockers.

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

Granisetron TDS delivers over 7 days an average of 3.1 mg of granisetron per day resulting in effective plasma concentrations 24-48h after application. Compared to the tablet granisetron TDS has the advantage of requiring only a single administration. It can be self applied by the patient at home and can be worn for up to 7 days, removing the need for repeated oral doses of granisetron. For Patients

with difficulties in swallowing the tablet is not a treatment option. These patients could benefit in an outpatient setting from granisetron TDS as they would otherwise have to attend a clinic or be admitted for daily i.v. CINV medication. Furthermore applying oral medications if at all possible is difficult and uncomfortable for these patients therefore the TDS formulation might might also have positive effects on treatment compliance.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.

There is no established relationship between granisetron plasma levels and control of CINV. However in the absence of measurements of concentrations at receptor level they are the best surrogate available to indicate that sufficient exposure to granisetron has been achieved to be of therapeutic benefit.

Non inferiority to the originator has been robustly demonstrated for the overall population an for all days of chemotherapy however the gradual increase in plasma levels of granisetron following application of the transdermal patch and the lower median plasma concentration with regards to the tablet at the first day of chemotherapy might be indicative for a slower onset of efficacy compared to 2 mg oral granisetron at the start of chemotherapy. Therefore reference was made in the indication to 5.1 of the SmPC where this relevant pharmacodynamic property is explained. Furthermore TDS is considered to be used in patients where the tablet is not a treatment option.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

Granisetron is a known active substance used for CINV; its general safety profile can be considered established. There are few new safety concerns regarding granisteron TDS compared to the tablet.

The results of the dermal tolerance studies in both patients and healthy subjects suggested that mild irritant and hypersensitivity reactions are possible with granisetron TDS. Reports of hypersensitivity reactions in the global safety database are rare but the possibility of such an event occurring cannot be ruled out. In addition to that findings in a laboratory model using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells are suggestive of a potential photogenotoxic effect although no cases of phototoxicity were observed in man. These new safety issues with the TDS  are acceptable and considered manageable as reflected in SmPC and RMP.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The safety profile of granisetron can be considered established. The clinical relevance of potential photogenotoxicity seen in vitro in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line not completely clear and was not observed in non clinical in vivo studies or man. This finding is considered manageable as reflected in SmPC and RMP

## Benefit-risk balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Nausea and vomiting still remain a major issue for patients receiving chemotherapy. The distress resulting from these symptoms can escalate over time, and can potentially lead to a patient's refusal to continue with the most effective anti-tumour therapy. Complications can include dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, malnutrition or aspiration pneumonia and can be life-threatening. Failure to control these side effects can lead to 25% - 50% of patients delaying or refusing possible life saving

chemotherapy, or can result in increased demands and costs for the healthcare team if chemotherapy has to be rescheduled.

Patients with upper aerodigestive tumours following surgery or radiotherapy can have dry mouth, mucositis and/or difficulty in swallowing making oral medications difficult and uncomfortable, or impossible in some patients. The possible impact on treatment compliance is reasonable to expect.

Such patients, when in the outpatient setting, could benefit from granisetron TDS as they would otherwise have to attend a clinic or be admitted for daily i.v. CINV medication.

Therefore the need for new and more convenient administration of antiemetics used for multiday CINV is high and the favourable effects of an effective TDS reasonable to expect.

The safety profile of granisetron is well known and there are only few new safety concerns regarding granisteron TDS compared to the tablet such as hypersensitivity reactions and observations of photogenotoxicity in the non clinical model.

## Benefit-risk balance

## Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

Granisetron is licensed for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic cancer therapy, including high-dose cisplatin, which has a strong emetic effect in more than 90 % of patients. Oral and i.v. formulations of granisetron have been available for over fifteen years. Granisetron has a well established safety profile and the safety concerns specific for the transdermal formulation can be adequately managed in clinical practice.

Nausea and vomiting still remain major issues for patients receiving chemotherapy. Failure to control these side effects can lead to delaying or refusing possible life saving chemotherapy. For patients with difficulties in swallowing the tablet is not a treatment option. These patients could benefit in an outpatient setting from granisetron TDS as they would otherwise have to attend a clinic or be admitted for daily i.v. CINV medication. Furthermore applying oral medications if at all possible is difficult and uncomfortable for these patients therefore TDS formulation might have also positive effects on treatment compliance.

In a pivotal, randomised, double-blind, Phase III efficacy study the applicant could show non-inferiority of granisetron TDS to 2 mg oral granisetron once daily in the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving multi-day chemotherapy for 3 to 5 consecutive days.

There is no established relationship between granisetron plasma levels and control of CINV and non inferiority against the originator has been shown for all days of treatment. However the gradual increase in plasma levels of granisetron TDS following application and the lower median plasma concentration shown in the pharmacokinetic studies with regards to the tablet at the first day of chemotherapy might be indicative for a slower onset of efficacy at the start of chemotherapy compared to 2 mg oral granisetron. Therefore reference was made in the indication to 5.1 of the SmPC where this relevant pharmacodynamic property is explained. Furthermore TDS is considered to be used in patients where the tablet is not a treatment option.

Considering the apparent benefit having this effective treatment of post chemotherapy nausea and vomiting also available for patients who have difficulties to swallow the CHMP consider the risk benefit balance for granisetron positive for the following indication:

SANCUSO transdermal patch is indicated in adults for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy, for a planned duration of 3 to 5
