## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Roflumilast is a selective phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor. PDE4 is an important regulator of cyclic  AMP  in  most  cell  types  involved  in  inflammatory  processes.  Inhibition  of  PDE4  reduces  the breakdown of cAMP, which in turn down-regulates the inflammatory process.

This Marketing Authorisation Application has been submitted as an informed consent application to the marketing authorisation for Daxas in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. Therefore, consent from the marketing authorisation holder of the Daxas application, which had been submitted as a full application under Art 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, has been given allowing  access  to  Module  2  to  Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any subsequent postmarketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. The application for Daliresp consists only of Module 1 information

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Daliresp medicinal product are identical to the upto-date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Daxas. Information on the scientific discussions can be found in the Daxas CHMP assessment report and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).

Daliresp  500  micro-grams  film-coated  tablets  is  indicated  for  the  maintenance  treatment  of  severe chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  (FEV1  post-bronchodilator  less  than  50%  predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis in adult patients with a history of frequent exacerbations as add on to bron-chodilator treatment.

The medicinal product is a film-coated tablet containing 500 microgram roflumilast. The recommended dose is one 500 microgram tablet once daily.

## 2.2. Quality aspects

Since the application is an informed consent of the Daxas marketing authorisation, the quality data in support of the Daliresp application are identical to the up-to-date  quality data of the  Daxas dossier which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

<!-- image -->

Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Daxas  marketing  authorisation,  the  non-clinical data in support of the Daliresp application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Daxas dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

## 2.3.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An environmental risk assessment has been provided in 1.6.1 Non-GMO. The Applicant refers to the Guideline  on  the  environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use  (June  2006, EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) to demonstrate that on the basis of the data provided it is not considered that roflumilast has a risk to the environment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Roflumilast is highly metabolized, with no parent compound detected in urine. Low dosages result in a PEC (0.0025 μ g/L) below the action limit of 0.01 μ g/L, and acute short-term studies from each of the 3 trophic levels (fish,  Daphnia, algae) show, that the algae is the most sensitive species. The derived PNEC is 0.024 μ g/L and the PEC/PNEC ratio is below 1 (0.104). Furthermore, the log P (o/w) was also found  to  be  below  the  action  limit.  A  comparison  of  calculated  plasma  levels  in  fish  with  those measured at NOAELs in rats showed sufficient safety margins towards adverse reproductive effects. Thus,  it  is  concluded  that  the  use  of  roflumilast  is  unlikely  to  represent  a  risk  to  the  environment following its prescribed usage in patients, and no further actions have to be taken.

## 2.4. Clinical aspects

Since this application is an informed consent of the Daxas marketing authorisation, the clinical data in support of the Daliresp application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Daxas dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

| Weight decrease           | Routine PV Close follow-up of reported cases and special section in PSUR. Long-term comparative observational post-marketing study Medicinal | Section 4.4 of the SmPC: In 1-year studies (M2-124, M2-125), a decrease of body weight occurred more frequently in patients treated with Daliresp compared to placebo-treated patients. After discontinuation of Daliresp, the majority of patients had regained body weight after 3 months. Body weight of underweight patients should be checked at each visit. Patients should be advised to check their body weight on a regular basis. In the event of an unexplained and clinically concerning weight decrease, the intake of Daliresp should be stopped and body weight should be further followed-up. SmPC Section 4.8: Weight decreased is included as common adverse reaction. |

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  MA  application  is  of  the  opinion  that  the following  risk  minimisation  activities  are  necessary  for  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the  medicinal product:

The Member States must ensure that all conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product described below are implemented in their national territory:

Medicinal product no longer authorised

-  Prior  to  launch  of  the  product  in  the  Member  State,  the  national  competent  authority  shall agree  the  content  and  format  of  the  educational  material  with  the  Marketing  Authorisation Holder
-  The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  should  ensure  that,  at  launch,  all  Healthcare Professionals who are expected to prescribe Daliresp are provided with an Educational pack.

The educational pack should contain the following:

-  Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet for Daliresp
-  Educational material for the physician.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

-  Copies of the patient card to be given to patients before they receive Daliresp

The educational material for the prescriber should include information on the following key elements:

-  The specific indication  approved. The fact that Daliresp is not indicated for the treatment of COPD patients other than those covered by the approved indication, nor for use in patients with asthma or alpha 1 anti trypsine deficiency.
-  The need to inform patients about the risks of Daliresp and the precautions for safe use.
-  The risk of weight decrease in underweight patients and the need to monitor the body weight at each visit and to stop the treatment in the event of an unexplained and clinically concerning weight  decrease.  Patients  should  be  advised  to  weigh  themselves  at  regular  intervals  and record the weight in the patient card.
-  The  lack  of  experience  in  patients  with  HIV  infection  or  active  hepatitis,  with  severe immunological diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematous, multifocal leukoencephalopathy)  or  treated  with  immunosuppressive  therapy  (other  than  short-term systemic  corticosteroids)  and  that  Daliresp  should  not  be  initiated  or  should  be  stopped  in these patients.
-  The  risk  of  psychiatric  disorders  such  as  insomnia,  anxiety,  depression  in  patients  receiving Daliresp and the potential risk of suicide. Hence, the need to carefully assess the benefit risk balance  of  this  treatment  in  patients  with  existing  psychiatric  symptoms  or  with  history  of depression and to inform patients to report any changes in behaviour, mood and any suicidal ideation. Daliresp is not recommended in patients with a history of depression associated with suicidal ideation or behaviour.  The potential risk of malignant tumours and the lack of experience in patients with past history of  cancer.  Daliresp  should  not  be  initiated  or  should  be  stopped  in  patients  with  cancers (except basal cell carcinoma).  That increased exposure might occur in certain populations and increase the risk of persistent intolerability: o Special  populations  who  have  increased  PDE4  inhibition  such  as  black  non  smoking females o Patients  concomitantly  treated  with  CYP1A2  inhibitors  (such  as  fluvoxamine)  or  dual CYP3A4/1A2 inhibitors (such as enoxacin and cimetidine)  The  potential  risk  of  infections:  Daliresp  should  not  be  initiated,  or  treatment  should  be stopped, in patients with severe acute infectious diseases. The limited experience in patients with latent infections such as tuberculosis, viral hepatitis or herpes infections. Medicinal product no longer authorised
-  The potential cardiac risk: Daliresp has not been studied in patients in congestive heart failure (NYHA grade 3 and 4); hence, it is not recommended in this population.
-  The limited or missing information in patients with liver impairment. Daliresp is contraindicated in  patients  with  moderate or severe liver impairment (Child Pugh B or C).  Clinical data are considered  insufficient  to  recommend  dose  adjustment  and  caution  should  be  observed  in patients with mild liver impairment (child Pugh A).
-  The  lack  of  clinical  data  to  support  the  combination  with  theophylline  and  that  such combination is not recommended.

## Patient Card

The patient card should contain the following key elements:

That they should tell their doctor if they have a history of any of the following conditions

-  cancer
-  insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation or behaviour
-  multiple sclerosis or SLE
-  infection with tuberculosis, herpes, hepatitis, HIV

That patients should tell their doctor if they develop symptoms indicative of:  insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation or behaviour  severe infection That patients should tell their doctor if they are taking any other medicines. That Daliresp may cause weight loss and patients should weigh themselves regularly and record their weight on the patient card. The  patient  card  should  include  an  area  where  patients  can  record  their  weight  and  the  date  they weighed themselves and they should be asked to bring the patient card with them at each visit 2.6. Recommendation Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Daxas  marketing  authorisation,  the  CHMP considered that the risk-benefit balance of Daliresp was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indication: Medicinal product no longer authorised
