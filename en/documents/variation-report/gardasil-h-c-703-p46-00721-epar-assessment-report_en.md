## I.INTRODUCTION

On February 27, 2013 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Gardasil in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use. The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Gardasil and that there is not a consequential regulatory action.

However, in the Preliminary assessment report of this study the Rapporteur stated that the paediatric procedure was not fulfilled until a satisfactory clarification regarding the identified protocol violations was received. Additional clarifications were requested.

According to this request the MAH has now provided a clarification to the identified protocol violation.

In summary the following background data were discussed in the Preliminary assessment report.

## II.SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The same formulation as the commercial formulation was used in the study.

## Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

The MAH had submitted a final report for:

- -V501-046  Evaluation  of  Safety  and  Immunogenicity  of  GARDASIL™  in  Healthy  Females Between 9 and 26 Years of Age in Sub Saharan Africa;

## 2. Clinical study

V501-046  Evaluation  of  Safety  and  Immunogenicity  of  GARDASIL™  in  Healthy  Females Between 9 and 26 Years of Age in Sub Saharan Africa;(Phase A)

##  Description

## Methods

##  Objectives

Immunogenicity: To estimate the percentage of subjects who seroconvert to each of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 at Month 7 (4 weeks Postdose 3)

-  Safety: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of GARDASIL in females 9- 26 years of age in Sub Saharan Africa

## · Study design

Protocol 046 was conducted in two phases.

- -Primary phase : the base study of immunogenicity and safety
- -Vaccination of placebo subject
-  Study population /Sample size

## · Treatments

Subjects received one 0.5-mL intramuscular dose of GARDASIL or placebo at Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

Immunogenicity:  The  primary  endpoint  of  interest  in  this  study  was  the  percentages  of GARDASIL recipients who seroconvert to each of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 at Week 4 Postdose 3. Safety: The primary safety objective was to demonstrate that GARDASIL was generally well tolerated when administered in a 3-dose regimen.

##  Statistical Methods

Immunogenicity: The primary hypothesis was the percentage of subjects receiving GARDASIL who seroconvert to each of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 at week 4 Postdose 3 was acceptable. Safety:  Safety  and  tolerability  were  assessed  by  clinical  review  of  all  relevant  parameters including adverse experiences (AEs).

##  Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

A  total  of  257  subjects  were  screened  for  inclusion  in  this  study  and  250  subjects  were randomized. The disposition of subjects from Day 1 to Month 7 by age strata is presented in Table 10-1. Among the 250 randomized subjects, a total of 27 subjects (10.8%) discontinued during the study period Day 1 through Month 7.

Among the 27 subjects discontinued subjects:

- Eighteen (18) randomized subjects were discontinued due to a protocol violation.
- Eight (8) subjects were lost to follow-up.
- One (1) subject withdrew consent.
- None of the subjects randomized were discontinued prior to their first vaccination.
- No subject discontinued due to an adverse event.

A total  of  224  subjects  (89.6%)  completed  the  3  study  vaccinations  regimen,  including  207 subjects who received GARDASIL and 17 subjects who received placebo. Many subjects in the 9  to12  year  old  age  group  have  unknown  Protocol  Milestone  status  because  there  was randomization to GARDASIL or placebo and enrollment to Phase B had not been initiated at the time of this database lock.

Assessor's comment: The protocol violations were explained in the CSR, and were due to either subject consented by legal guardian without legal guardianship documentation (N=18) or subjects not native to  Sub  Saharan  Africa  (N=7)  (one  subject  had  both  protocol  violations,  i.e.  24  subjects  were excluded). It is unclear why only 18+5=23 subjects are included in the table 10-1 as excluded due to protocol  violations,  and  what  the  difference  between  Study  Disposition  and  Study  Medication Disposition is. The Applicant is asked to explain the discrepancy between Table 10-1 and the list of protocol violations in the CSR.

##  Immunogenicity results

Overall, 100% of the subjects seroconverted by Week 4 Postdose 3, in all populations (all age strata and the All Type-Specific Naïve subjects with serology population), for each of the 4 HPV types  summarized.  The  results  support  the  results  in  the  per  protocol  immunogenicity population.

## · Safety results

The adverse events reported in this study are in agreement with data from previously reported studies and no new safety signal was raised in this study

## 3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The current study included healthy Sub Saharan girls and women 9-26 years. The study results were in agreement with results from previously assessed studies in the same age groups from other parts of the world. The immune responses are considered robust, and the safety profile did not raise further questions. The study is continuing into phase B, i.e. vaccination of the placebo group, and a report of that phase is expected when available as a separated article 46 procedure. However, a clarification is requested regarding the number of subjects excluded due to protocol violations in the study.

## III.CLARIFICATION TO THE QUESTION POSED BY THE RAPPORTEUR IN THE PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT REPORT

Based on the data submitted the MAH was requested to provide a response to the following question as part of this procedure P 46 072. The MAH has accordingly presented the requested clarification.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1 Rapporteur Additional Clarification requested:

The protocol violations were explained in the CSR, and were due to either subject consented by legal guardian  without  legal  guardianship  documentation  (N=18)  or  subjects  not  native  to  Sub  Saharan Africa (N=7) (one subject had both protocol violations, i.e. 24 subjects were excluded). It is unclear why only 18+5=23 subjects are included in the table 10-1 as excluded due to protocol violations, and what the difference between Study Disposition and Study Medication Disposition is. The Applicant is asked to explain the discrepancy between Table 10-1 and the list of protocol violations in the CSR.

## 2  MAH Response :

The  MAH  would  first  like  to  provide  clarification  about  the  data  in  the  subject  disposition  table including: explaining the difference between Study Disposition and Study Medication Disposition and clarifying that 18 subjects (not 23) had discontinued the study by Month 7 due to protocol violations. (Of note, Month 7 is the final visit for this CSR, the study continued after Month 7.) The MAH would then like to clarify the difference between protocol violators on the subject disposition table and those on the protocol violator list.

## Subject Disposition Table Clarifications

The  subject  disposition  table  includes  two  related  sections:  Study  Disposition  and  Study  Medication Disposition. The Study Disposition section includes subjects who discontinued from the study prior to the final scheduled visit (i.e., subjects who discontinued at or before the Month 7, the final scheduled visit for this CSR). These subjects may or may not have completed vaccination per protocol. The Study Medication  Disposition  section  includes  subjects  who  discontinued  study  medication  early  (i.e., reported  as  not  completing  all  3  doses  of  vaccine).  (Typically  subjects  who  discontinue  study medication early are a subset of subjects who discontinue from the study early). The 5 subjects who appear as discontinuing study medication due to protocol violation are a subset of the 18 subjects who discontinued  the  study  due  to  a  protocol  violation,  i.e.,  only  18  subjects  (not  23)  are  listed  as discontinuing the study due to protocol violation at the time point for this CSR (Month 7). These 18 subjects are the subjects with the protocol violation of 'legal guardianship documentation.'

## Subject Disposition Table vs. Protocol Violator List

The MAH would like to clarify that the Subject Disposition table (Table 10-1, enclosed) only specifies  the  number  of  subjects  (18)  who,  by  Month  7,  reported  discontinuing  the study/study medication due to a protocol violation. This table does not provide a comprehensive accounting of subjects who were excluded from the primary analysis due to protocol violation. Twenty-four (24) subjects were excluded from the primary analysis due to protocol violation (see Table 14-2 enclosed).

The reason there is an apparent discrepancy in number of subjects between Table 10-1 (18) and the list  of  protocol  violations  (24)  is  that  6  subjects  continued  to  be  followed  for  safety  after  Month  7. These are the 6 subjects who only had protocol violation of 'not native to Sub Saharan Africa.' Thus, they appear on Protocol Violators table (as they were excluded from immunogenicity analysis) but do not appear as discontinued due to protocol violation on Table 10-1 (as they continued in the study and were followed for safety).
