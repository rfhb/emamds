The primary objective was to assess overall tumour response in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who have failed prior therapies and are unsuitable for curative therapy with radiotherapy, surgery or systemic therapy. The secondary objectives of the study were to assess complete tumour response; duration of tumour response; time to disease progression, quality of life, survival, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and weight, patient global assessment of treatment benefit, and the toxicity, tolerability and safety of Foscan-photodynamic therapy (PDT). A total of 43 patients were enrolled in the study, 39 patients were treated and analysed of which 19 achieved a complete response (CR) and 2 patients a partial response (PR), resulting in an overall response rate of 54% (95% 37%; 70%). Median progression free survival (PFS) for responding patients was 131 weeks while PFS was 31 weeks for all patients studied. The estimated 40-week |

Therefore, the CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit yearly PSURs. Furthermore, Foscan remains under exceptional circumstances due to two unresolved specific obligations, which will generate further efficacy and safety data in the future. The benefit-risk balance of the product will continue to be reviewed annually as part of the Annual Re-assessments. Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Foscan, which requires the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time. As part of the renewal procedure, the following statement was added to section 4.4 of the SPC and the PL has been updated accordingly: \"For 6 months following Foscan treatment avoid prolonged direct sunlight exposure of the injection site arm. As a precautionary measure, if prolonged outdoor activity is planned, the injection arm should be protected by wearing a long sleeved, coloured shirt.\" |
