## 1. Introduction

On 8 January 2025, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Januvia and duplicates (Xelevia, Tesavel and Ristaben), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

Sitagliptin is a selective DPP-4 inhibitor. DPP-4 inhibitors improve glycemic control by preventing the enzymatic degradation and inactivation of GLP-1 and GIP, the major incretins involved in glucose homeostasis. These hormones lower glucose levels through enhancement of insulin biosynthesis and release when blood glucose levels are elevated, and through suppression of glucagon.

## Indication

Januvia was approved in the EU in 2007 for the following indications:

For adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Januvia is indicated to improve glycaemic control: as monotherapy:

- in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance.

as dual oral therapy in combination with:

- metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.
- a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance.
- a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) when use of a PPARg agonist is appropriate and when diet and exercise plus the PPARg agonist alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

as triple oral therapy in combination with:

- a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic control.
- a PPARg agonist and metformin when use of a PPARg agonist is appropriate and when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

Januvia is also indicated as add-on to insulin (with or without metformin) when diet and exercise plus stable dose of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

Sitagliptin is not registered for paediatric patients with T2DM due to lack of efficacy in patients aged 10 to 17 years of age and has not been studied in patients under 10 years of age, and no indication is sought for this population.

## Clinical development program

The current report concerns a submission in accordance with the requirements of Article 46 of Regulation No. 1901/2006 of the European Commission and includes results of the MK-0431 Protocol

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

351 study (hereinafter referred to as P351), a noninterventional follow-up study of participants from the MK-0431 Protocol 083 study (hereinafter referred to as P083). P083 was a 54-week, 2-part (Phases A and B), multinational, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study assessing the safety and efficacy of sitagliptin once daily in pediatric participants (aged 10 to 17 years, inclusive at initiation of therapy) with T2DM and inadequate glycemic control. P351 was designed to provide an up to 5-year noninterventional observational assessment of the safety of participants who participated in P083. In P083, participants were randomized to receive sitagliptin ± insulin (in Phases A and B), metformin (in Phases A and B), placebo in Phase A followed by sitagliptin in Phase B (placebo/sitagliptin) or placebo ± insulin in Phase A followed by metformin in Phase B (placebo ± insulin/metformin). P351 was conducted at the request of the PDCO of the EMA as a required component of the PIP (EMEAC-00470-PIP01-08-M11).provides an overview of each clinical trial in the sitagliptin pediatric program, including P351. P351 is the last Sponsor-planned study in the clinical development program of sitagliptin. Table 1 provides an overview of each clinical trial in the sitagliptin pediatric program, including P351. P351 is the last Sponsor-planned study in the clinical development program of sitagliptin. Regulatory guidance and advice EMA and was part of the 28-FEB-2020 positive opinion of the PDCO in compliance with the sitagliptin

No scientific advice was received from the EU regulatory authorities regarding the conduct of this noninterventional study. This follow-up study has been conducted at the request of the PDCO of the PIP EMEA-C-000470-PIP01-08-M11 (EMA/PDCO/98616/2020).

Study P351: A Five-year, Observational, Non-interventional Follow-up to: A Phase III, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Sitagliptin in Pediatric Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with Inadequate Glycemic Control

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study P351: A Five-year, Observational, Non-interventional Follow-up to: A Phase III, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Sitagliptin in Pediatric Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with Inadequate Glycemic Control

## Description

P351 was an observational, noninterventional, multisite, follow-up study to provide an up to 5-year observational assessment of safety for participants with T2DM who were 10 to 17 years of age (inclusive) when randomized to therapy in the MK-0431-083 (hereinafter referred to as P083). P083 is a multinational, placebo- and metformin-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study of approximately 56 weeks' duration. Subjects are randomized to receive sitagliptin and metforminplacebo, metformin and sitagliptin-placebo, or the sequence of placebo (for the 16-week Phase A period) followed by metformin (for either rescue or the 38-week Phase B period, whichever came first), or the sequence of placebo (for the 16-week Phase A period) followed by sitagliptin (for either rescue or the 38-week Phase B period, whichever comes first). P083 will be completed at Visit 13/Week 54. A telephone contact is performed 14 days after the last dose of study medication to assess for any serious adverse events (SAEs).

The request of the PDCO for P351 stated: 'Patients included in the study must be offered at least annual follow-up examinations, to include assessment of all infections, auxological and pubertal parameters, for at least 5 years or for at least two years after reaching Tanner stage V (whichever occurs first).'

Participants who completed P083 were eligible to provide assent/consent for P351 at or within 6 months of the Week-54 visit of P083; participants who did not complete P083 were eligible to provide assent/consent for P351 at the time or within 6 months of when their Week-54 visit for P083 would have occurred.

Participants observed in P351 received standard of care as provided by their usual care physician. During P351, participants attended annual onsite visits and received telephone calls at 6-month intervals between visits for up to 5 years or for 2 years after reaching Tanner Stage V, whichever occurred earlier. Regardless of when the assent/consent for P351 was obtained, the last possible visit (Year +5) occurred no later than 5 years after the participant was scheduled to complete the Week-54 visit for P083.

Following the implementation of amendment P083-05, the duration of the placebo-controlled Phase A was modified to 20 weeks and the number of treatment groups to which subjects could be randomized was reduced from 4 to 2: sitagliptin and placebo/metformin. Randomization of subjects to the metformin group and to the placebo/sitagliptin group was discontinued with amendment P083-05 due to recruitment challenges and because the safety and efficacy profiles of metformin in paediatric patients had already been established. Subjects randomized to receive metformin or to placebo/sitagliptin before the implementation of amendment P083-05 continued in the study according to their originally planned treatment assignment.

## Methods

## Study participants

## Inclusion criteria:

- -Participant and/or parent/guardian provided documented informed assent and/or consent for the study..
- -Completed P083 or stopped study medication during P083.

## Exclusion criteria:

- -Did not agree to refrain from participating in any double-blind interventional study while participating in P351.
- -Was unlikely to adhere to the study procedures and appointment schedule.

## Treatments

This was a noninterventional study, there was no exposure to study intervention.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Objective(s)

Primary Objective: To assess safety for up to a 5-year period in pediatric subjects (ages 10 to 17 years at initiation of therapy in P083) with T2DM who participated for up to one year in P083.

## Endpoints

Adverse events (AEs), BMI (body mass index), BMI SDS (body mass index standard deviation score), height, body weight, Tanner Staging (pubertal progression), growth velocity, blood pressure, and heart rate.

## Sample size

P083 is scheduled to enroll approximately 360 pediatric subjects with T2DM who were 10-17 years of age (inclusive) at initiation of therapy in P083. Randomized subjects from P083 (both those who have completed P083 and those who stopped study medication during P083) are eligible to participate in the follow-up study P351 if they meet enrollment criteria. The number of subjects enrolled in this study is not pre-specified. Subjects and/or their parent/legal guardians who are unable to or choose not to provide assent/consent when the subject completes or discontinues from P083, may do so at a later date.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

This was a noninterventional study, participants retained their randomization numbers assigned for study P083. Participants in P351 remained blinded to treatment assignment from P083 while P083 was ongoing. Investigators could inform participants about treatment assignment in P083 after P083 was completed.

## Statistical Methods

Statistical summaries by originally-assigned treatment groups from P083 were provided for the followup study only (i.e., without pooling with P083) because the follow-up study is an observational study with no treatment. The treatment group assignments from P083 are: sitagliptin, metformin, placebo/sitagliptin, and placebo/metformin.

Safety endpoints for the follow-up study were summarized by treatment group from P083, with no between-group comparisons. Safety endpoints were analysed descriptively.

## Results

## Participant flow

A total of 80 participants enrolled in P351 across 39 study sites in 16 countries. All participants enrolled in P351 completed P083 on or off study medication. Of the 80 participants enrolled in P351, 36 were in the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group and 44 in the Not Exposed in P083 group (Table 1).

A total of 57/80 (71.3%) of the enrolled participants completed P351 per protocol. In the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group 12/36 (33.3%) participants and in the Not Exposed in P083 group 11/44 (25.0%) participants, discontinued the study. The specific reasons for discontinuation were not notably different between the groups. The most commonly reported reason for study discontinuation in both groups was withdrawal by participant.

Treatment groups in this follow-up study (P351) reflect the originally assigned treatment groups in P083.

- The Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 includes 35 participants who were randomized to the Sitagliptin +/- insulin group, and 1 participant who was randomized to the Placcbo followed by Sitagliptin group in Po83. 1 participant from this group reccived sitagliptin as concomitant medication during P351.
- b The Not Exposed in P083 includes 39 participants who were randomized to the Placebo +/- insulin followed by metfomin group, and 5 participants who were randomized to the Metfommin group in P083. 4 participants fiom this group reccived a DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin or vildagliptin) as concomitant medication during P351.

## Recruitment

Clinical investigator study sites were located in 16 countries: Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, and the US.

## Baseline data

Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally comparable between groups. The mean duration of T2DM at Year 0 in P351 was 2.0 years. The mean age was 14.9 years and the majority of participants (85.0%) were &lt;18 years of age at Year 0. The proportion of female participants was lower in the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group compared with the Not Exposed in P083 group, while baseline body weight and baseline BMI were higher in the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group compared with the Not Exposed in P083 group. The proportion of participants from EU and EU-like countries was similar between the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group and the Not Exposed in P083 group.

## Safety results

Summary measures of AEs were generally similar between groups (Table 2). The FAIRs of SAEs were generally similar for both groups. No participant discontinued this study due to an AE. One participant death was reported during this study and occurred in the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group. The death was due to leukaemia and was considered not related to study intervention by the investigator.

FAIR: Follow-up adjusted incidence rate = (Number of participants with ≥l cvent during the follow-up study) / (Total participant-years of follow-up).

Treatment groups in this follow-up study (P351) reflect the originally assigned treatment groups in P083.

* The Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 includes 35 participants who were randomized to the Sitagliptin +/- insulin group, and 1 participant who was randomized to the Placcbo followed by Sitagliptin group in Po83. 1 participant from this group received sitagliptin as concomitant medication during P351.
- b The Not Exposed in P083 includes 39 participants who were randomized to the Placebo +/- insulin followed by metfomin group, and 5 participants who were randomized to the Metfomin group in P083. 4 participants from this group reccived a DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin or vildagliptin) as concomitant medication during P351.
- For participants who have an cvent, the participant-years of follow-up will be calculated as (Date of the first event First day of the follow-up study + 1)/365.25. For participants without an cvent, the participant-ycars of follow-up will be calculated as (Last day of the follow-up window - First day of the follow-up study + 1)/365.25. The total participant-years for a treatment group will be the sum of the participant-ycars of follow-up of all participants in the treatment group.

The FAIRs of AEs by SOC were generally similar between the groups in P351. AEs in the Infections and Infestations SOC were the most frequent in both groups. The FAIR for this SOC was higher in the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group than in the Not Exposed in P083 group; however, there was no clinically relevant pattern or remarkable imbalance in specific AEs reported under this SOC. Seven unique participants (3 in the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group and 4 in the Not Exposed in P083 group) reported AEs of upper respiratory infections (a composite of AE terms of laryngopharyngitis, nasopharyngitis, acute otitis media, pharyngitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and viral upper respiratory tract infection) Four AEs were in the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group and 6 were in the Not Exposed in P083 group.

Two AEs initially reported during P083 were reported as having worsened during P351. Both AEs (hypertriglyceridemia [1 participant in the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group] and granuloma annulare [1 participant in the Not Exposed in P083 group]) were nonserious and moderate in intensity.

## Serious adverse events

One death, in the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group, was reported during P351. This participant had an SAE of leukaemia reported on Day 71 of P351 (Day 451 of P083) and died on Day 714 of P351 (Day 1094 of P083). This death was considered not related to study intervention by the investigator. The FAIR of SAEs reported in P351 was low and similar in both groups. Appendicitis was the only SAE reported by more than 1 participant (2 in the Not Exposed in P083 group). No specific SAE was reported in &gt;1 participant in the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group. No participant discontinued the study due to an SAE (Table 3).

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

No participant reported an AE that led to discontinuation in P351.

## Adverse Events of Special Interest

No AEs of special interest were identified for this study.

## Vital Signs, Physical Examinations, and Other Observations Related to Safety

Vital signs:

No meaningful differences in blood pressure and heart rate between patients exposed to sitagliptin and patients not exposed to sitagliptin were observed. (Table 5, Table 6, Table 7)

## Physical examination

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Auxological and pubertal parameters

There were no clinically meaningful differences in weight, height and BMI between patients exposed to sitagliptin and patients not exposed to sitagliptin, although the number of patients in each group was small over time (Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table 11).

Tanner Stage progression (percentage of participants that reached Tanner Stage V by year) was similar between groups throughout this study (Table 12). At study initiation, most participants (67/80 [31/36 in the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group and 36/44 in the Not Exposed in P083 group]) were in late puberty (ie, Tanner Stage IV or Tanner Stage V). Tanner Stage V was not reported for 13 participants when they completed or discontinued prematurely; of these, 8 discontinued or were lost to follow-up. Pubertal progression (yearly proportion of participants progressing to Tanner V) showed minor variations between the 2 groups, but by Year 5, all male participants in both groups had progressed to Tanner V. Slightly higher growth velocities were observed in females in the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group compared with the Not Exposed in P083. This may reflect the slightly lower yearly proportion of female participants progressing to Tanner Stage V in the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 group compared with the Not Exposed in P083. The variability observed across groups in growth velocity and pubertal progression is not considered clinically meaningful.

## Pregnancy

Pregnancies were reported for 3 participants in this study (1 in the Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 and 2 in the Not Exposed in P083 group), none of the participants were exposed to sitagliptin during pregnancy.

FAIR: Follow-up adjusted incidence rate = (Number of participants with ≥l event during the follow-up study) / (Total participant-years of follow-up).

Treatment groups in this follow-up study (P351) reflect the originally assigned treatment groups in P083.

- The Exposed to Sitagliptin in P083 includes 35 participants who were randomized to the Sitagliptin +/- insulin from this group reccived sitagliptin as concomitant medication during P351.
- b The Not Exposed in P083 includes 39 participants who were randomized to the Placebo +/- insulin followed by metfommin group, and 5 participants who were randomized to the Metfommin group in P083. 4 participants from this group received a DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin or vildagliptin) as concomitant medication during P351.
- For participants who have an event, the participant-years of follow-up will be calculated as (Date of the first cvent First day of the follow-up study + 1)/365.25. For participants without an event, the participant-years of follow-up will be caleulated as (Last day of the follow-up window - First day of the follow-up study + 1)/365.25. The total participant-years for a treatment group will be the sum of the participant-ycars of follow-up of all participants in the trcatment group.

- For participants who have an event, the participant-years of follow-up will be calculated as (Date of the first event First day of the follow-up study + 1)/365.25. For participants without an event, the participant-years of follow-up will be calculated as (Last day of the follow-up window - First day of the follow-up study + 1)/365.25. The total participant-years for a treatment group will be the sum of the participant-years of follow-up of all participants in the treatment group.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The present study P351 was an observational, noninterventional, multisite, follow-up study to provide an up to 5-year observational assessment of safety for participants with T2DM who were 10 to 17 years of age (inclusive) when randomized to therapy in P083. In study P083, participants were randomised to receive sitagliptin and metformin-placebo, metformin and sitagliptin-placebo, or the sequence of placebo, followed by metformin), or the sequence of placebo followed by sitagliptin. This study was to provide follow-up of patients who participated in study P083, without (new) interventions, patients received only standard of care as provided by their usual care physician. Therefore, it was considered to be appropriate that the study was designed as an observational study. Only patients who participated in study P083 were eligible for inclusion in the current study, therefore the inclusion and exclusion criteria seem appropriate. The primary objective was to assess safety or up to a 5-year period in pediatric subjects (ages 10 to 17 years at initiation of therapy in P083) with T2DM who participated for up to one year in P083. The study design and inclusion criteria are considered appropriate for the study objective.

Baseline criteria were generally comparable between groups, which is expected as these patients were previously included in an RCT.

The study does not contain efficacy data, since no intervention was studied.

Safety data were derived from the patients included in this study over 5 years of follow-up or for 2 years after reaching Tanner Stage V, whichever occurred first. Safety data of patients who were exposed to sitagliptin were compared with patients have not been exposed to sitagliptin.  The number of adverse events and serious adverse events is comparable between the two groups. One death was reported in the study (in the Sitagliptin group), this was considered not related to the intervention. The number and type of adverse events were comparable between the patients exposed to sitagliptin and not exposed to sitagliptin. Thus, no new safety issues arise from the current study. Sitagliptin is currently not authorised for paediatric patients, therefore no amendments to the SmPC are needed.

## 3. CHMP's overall conclusion and recommendation

The results of the present study P351 do not raise new issues regarding the safety of sitagliptin in paediatric patients with T2DM. The MAH's commitment is fulfilled, and no regulatory action is required at this stage.
