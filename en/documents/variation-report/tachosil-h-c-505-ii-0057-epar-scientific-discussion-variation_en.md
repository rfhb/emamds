## 1. Background information on the procedure

## 1.1. Type II variation

Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Takeda Austria GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 9 October 2014 an application for a variation.

The following variation was requested:

| Variation requested   | Variation requested                                                                                                            | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a               | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I                  |

Extension of indication to add the use of TachoSil as suture line sealing in dura mater closure where standard techniques are insufficient.  As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are proposed to be updated. The MAH also took the opportunity to make minor editorial corrections to the SmPC. An updated RMP version 6 was provided as part of the application.

The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

## Information on paediatric requirements

Not applicable.

## Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

## Similarity

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the proposed indication.

## Scientific advice

The MAH received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 30 May 2013 (EMEA/H/SA/2546/1/2013/II). The Scientific Advice pertained to clinical aspects of the dossier.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

In neurosurgery, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is considered to be one of the most challenging and potentially dangerous complications. Among the envelopes which contain and protect the neural structures, the dura mater is the only one that can be surgically repaired. Watertight closure of the dura is the first line of protection from postoperative CSF leakage, which can lead to other serious complications such as meningitis and delayed wound healing. (1)

Fibrin sealants -generally containing two major components, fibrinogen and thrombin - manufactured from pooled human plasma have been used in surgery since the 1970s both  for haemostatic purposes but also for sealing, reinforcement of sutures and tissue adhesion (2, 3, 4).

TachoSil is a sealant matrix coated with two active substances human thrombin and human fibrinogen. TachoSil is currently approved for use in adults for supportive treatment in surgery for improvement of hemostasis, to promote tissue sealing, and for suture support in vascular surgery where standard techniques are insufficient. The current tissue sealing label is based on study data for the sealing efficacy and safety in lung and cardiovascular surgery, demonstrating tight sealing against physiological pressures in the lung and the arterial circulation.

The Applicant is seeking to expand the indication in neurosurgery to include supportive sealing of the dura mater to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following neurological surgery , and thereby, to remove the warning currently included in Section 4.4 concerning lack of data for use in neurosurgery.

Study TC-2402-038-SP, or TachoSil against Liquor Leak (TASALL), is a recently completed study evaluating the use of TachoSil for the prevention of postoperative CSF leaks in skull base surgery.

The effect of TachoSil in preventing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is primarily attributed to the fibrinogen/thrombin components. The mechanism of action of TachoSil is based on the interaction of the thrombin and fibrinogen components leading to the deposition of a local fibrin clot with pronounced adhesive properties, thus gluing the patch to the dural membrane.

The current indication of TachoSil is proposed to be extended by adding:

TachoSil is indicated in adults for supportive treatment in surgery for improvement of haemostasis, to promote tissue sealing, for suture support in vascular surgery where standard techniques are insufficient, and for supportive sealing of the dura mater to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following neurological surgery.

## 2.2. Non-clinical aspects

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, some relevant data from the original application are summarised here:

A neurosurgery study was performed in rabbits in which TachoSil (named TachoComb S in this report) was compared to TachoComb H (SR5130; corresponding histopathology report SR5130a). In this study, the skull as well as the dura mater were opened and 6 cortical brain wounds were created in each animal. The wounds were treated with the test items and the bleeding time was measured. After hemostasis was achieved, arterial hypertension was induced and wounds were observed for rebleeding. Animals were necropsied 3 and 7 days after treatment.

Hemostasis was achieved with TachoSil and TachoComb H significantly faster (p&lt;0.001) than in controls; there was no difference in bleeding times between the 2 products. Both TachoSil and TachoComb H prevented rebleeding during severely increased arterial pressure.

High-resolution magnetic resonance images showed similar edema formation in all animals. Histology revealed that TachoSil and TachoComb H did not induce any specific morphological changes in the brain tissue. Comparison of the histological findings in the animals sacrificed on Day 3 and Day 7 showed evidence of degradation of the fleece, as the mean level of degradation increased from 1 to 1.3 (0=absent; 1=slight; 2=moderate; 3=marked; 4=severe). The lysis of the fibrin clot was not further described. No adhesions with the surrounding tissues were reported.

TachoSil did not induce any specific histological or neuroradiological changes in rabbit brain tissue following 3 and 7 days of implantation.

The non-clinical data are rather limited, especially in regard to the longer term effect of TachoSil in neurosurgical procedures and the potential for adhesions. However, data from the clinical studies, in which subjects were followed up for 6 months, did not reveal any issues in regard to neurotoxicity.

TachoSil undergoes biodegradation by (1) phagocytosis and infiltration of granulation tissue and (2) degradation of the fibrin clot by endogenous fibrinolysis. The biodegradation of TachoSil was investigated macroscopically and microscopically in minipigs.

In a study in female Goettingen minipigs, the biodegradation of TachoSil was compared to that of TachoComb H after application onto a defined liver and spleen lesion (study SR28/2008). Small remnants were observed 3 months after administration of either TachoSil or TachoComb H.

A further single dose study (SR R-CP1363) investigated the toxicity and biodegradation of TachoSil in minipigs over 12 months following application to liver wounds. The use of TachoSil had no effect on local and systemic safety over 12 months. Complete degradation of TachoSil was seen in some animals 12 months after its administration to a liver wound, whereas small remnants were still observed in others.

Safety pharmacologic aspects for TachoSil are based on the results obtained from nonclinical studies with TachoSil and its predecessor products.

As the active constituents of TachoSil, ie, human fibrinogen and human thrombin are well established in clinical use, formal studies addressing clinical pharmacology are not applicable.

## 2.2.1. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The mechanism of action of TachoSil follows the principles of physiological fibrin clot formation. Upon contact with a bleeding or leaking wound surface or by the presence of physiological saline, the coating of the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

collagen patch dissolves and the subsequent thrombin-fibrinogen reaction initiates the last step of the coagulation cascade: Fibrinogen is converted by the action of thrombin into fibrin monomers which spontaneously polymerize to a fibrin clot. Subsequently endogenous factor XIII, activated by thrombin, covalently cross links the fibrin to create a firm and stable network.

Pharmacodynamic and safety pharmacologic aspects for TachoSil are based on the results obtained from non-clinical studies with TachoSil and its predecessor products.

TachoSil is for epilesional use only and thus pharmacokinetic investigations do not apply.

No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

## 2.2.2. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

Currently available non-clinical data are adequate to support use of TachoSil in the extension of the indication for supportive sealing of the dura mater to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following neurological surgery.

## Study TC-2402-038-SP (TASALL - TachoSil® Against Liquor Leak)

TachoSil versus current practice in dura sealing techniques for the prevention of post-operative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks in patients undergoing skull base surgery: An open-label, randomised, controlled, multi-centre, parallel-group efficacy and safety trial.

## Methods

This was an open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, phase 3 (therapeutic confirmatory) study comparing TachoSil versus Current Practice as an adjunct in sealing the dura mater.

Patients were evaluated for pre-operative eligibility at the Screening visit up to 5 days before randomisation. Final eligibility (randomisation) of patients was dependent on the fulfilment of intra-operative eligibility criteria.

During surgery, immediately prior to application of primary dura closing techniques (primary suture of the dura, duraplasty, or both), eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either TachoSil or current practice. The randomised trial treatment was applied intra-operatively and dosing of randomised trial treatment (quantity, size of patch, amount [e.g. mL]) was according to the choice of technique and the size of the dura opening. TachoSil was applied during surgery as an adjunct to the closure of the dura, as a single layer or a sandwich (double layer), and was not removed after application. If used the sandwich technique the first layer of TachoSil was applied on the inside of the dura. The primary suture of the dura or duraplasty was then performed prior to the second application of TachoSil. The second layer of TachoSil was applied on the outside of the dura.

In case of insufficient dura sealing after the first application of TachoSil (both for single layer and for the second TachoSil application in sandwich application), a second application of TachoSil could have been applied on top of the first application on the outside of the dura.

The sealing efficacy was evaluated post-operatively as clinically evident CSF leaks and clinically evident and non-clinically evident pseudomeningoceles. Sealing efficacy was collected post-operatively until the Efficacy Follow-up (Week 7 ± 1 week). Non-clinically evident pseudomeningoceles were evaluated by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans performed prior to surgery (up to 4 months) and any day prior to discharge and according to local practice from Day of Discharge until Safety Follow-up (Week 28 ± 2 weeks).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Safety data were collected from when the patient signed the Informed Consent Form until the Safety Follow-up (Week 28 ± 2 weeks). Any visits to out-patient physicians (e.g. General Practitioners, specialists, physiotherapists), hospital staff and hospitals were documented on the Patient Card with which the patient was provided at the time of informed consent, thus empowering the trial staff to investigate and classify/document relevant events appropriately.

The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) patient assessments were conducted at Screening, Day 2, Day of Discharge, Efficacy Follow-up and Safety Follow-up. Home readiness was assessed daily from Day 4 until Day of Discharge from the surgical ward.

An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board was set-up to monitor the safety data during the conduct of the trial. The trial was not to be stopped prematurely based on efficacy reasons.

## Study participants

## · Study participants

The study population consisted of subjects undergoing elective skull base surgery. A total of 778 subjects were enrolled in the study at 35 sites across 10 countries. Of these 778 subjects, a total of 726 subjects were randomly assigned to trial treatment, with 361 and 365 subjects randomized to TachoSil and Current Practice group, respectively.

The main inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented below, and are as per Version 6.0 of the trial protocol onwards.

## Intra-Operative Inclusion Criteria

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

4. The Surgical Wound Classification Class was class I (Clean surgical wound. Clean wound definition: uninfected surgical wounds in which no inflammation was encountered and the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or uninfected urinary tracts were not entered. In addition, clean wounds were primarily closed, and if necessary, drained with closed drainage) (Garner et al, 1986))

- f) Approach to the midline posterior fossa

## Pre-Operative Exclusion Criteria

1. The patient had evidence of an infection within 5 days of surgery indicated by any one of the following: fever &gt;101ºF/38.5°C, white blood cells (WBC) &lt;3.5/GL or &gt;13.0/GL (if patient was on steroid treatment &gt;20.00/GL), positive urine culture, positive blood culture, positive chest X-ray

2. The patient had a known coagulopathy

3. A history of allergic reactions after application of human fibrinogen, human thrombin and/or collagen of any origin

4. The patient had been subject to neurosurgery involving opening of the dura mater within the last 3 months before Screening

10. The patient had more than 1 dura opening (not including dura openings from extraventricular or lumbar drains)

11. TachoSil, fibrin or polymer sealants had been used during the current surgery prior to randomisation

## Treatments

TachoSil was applied during surgery as an adjunct to the closure of the dura, as a single layer or a sandwich (double layer).To avoid selection bias random allocation was performed prior to application of primary dura closing techniques. Reason for this decision was to allow the sandwich technique.

This study allowed the treating surgeon to apply a number of standard dura closing techniques alone or in combination. Non-investigational medicinal products included all trial treatments with medicinal products or medical devices utilised by the individual surgeon to seal the dura, including fibrin sealants, polymer sealants and any artificial dura substitutes.

## Objectives

## Primary Objective

To demonstrate superiority of TachoSil compared to current practice as an adjunct in sealing the dura mater.

## Secondary Objective

To evaluate the safety of TachoSil as an adjunct in sealing the dura mater.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary endpoint was the occurrence of clinically evident, verified postoperative CSF leaks, a clinically evident pseudomeningocele, or study treatment failure defined as an event that occurred no later than 8 weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was considered to have been reached if a clinically evident verified CSF leak or clinically evident pseudomeningocele had occurred post-operatively until Efficacy Follow-up (Week 7 ± 1 week), or if trial treatment failure had occurred upon dura closure.

Verification of CSF leaks was to be done by performing a glucose (glucose level of CSF is one-third lower than in serum), alternatively a β-2 transferrin test.

The secondary endpoint was defined as the presence of nonclinically evident pseudomeningocele, ie, CSF accumulation found by CT or MRI scanning, postoperatively until Day of Discharge without occurrence of the primary endpoint.

The occurrence of clinically evident verified post-operative CSF leaks or a clinically evident pseudomeningocele chosen as part of the primary endpoint are generally considered adequate to allow an assessment of the efficacy of the dura sealing.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sample size

Anticipating a control group leak rate of 17%, a TachoSil group leak rate of 8.5% and a drop-out rate of 5% and a type I error of 0.05 (2-sided) it was calculated that an asymptotic chi-square test with 726 patients (363 per group) would provide 90% power to detect such a response difference.

Based on the assumptions made, the trial was sufficiently powered. However, the discrepancy between the anticipated leak rate in the control group (according protocol: based on feedback from neurosurgeons) and the observed leak rate in the trial is astonishing.

## Randomisation

Patients were randomised in an 1:1 (TachoSil : current practice) ratio by means of an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) or Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). Permuted block randomisation (with varying block length) was applied.

## Blinding (masking)

The trial was planned as an open label trial.

## Statistical methods

In general data were summarised by means of descriptive statistics (continuous data: number of patients, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, lower quartile (25%), upper quartile (75%), minimum and maximum; categorical data: absolute and relative frequencies). Treatment effects were described by means of point estimates (e.g. odds ratio, difference of proportions) including their 95% confidence intervals. To describe time to event data, Kaplan-Meier plots were used.

A logistic regression model (factors treatment and pooled centre) was used to compare both treatment groups with regard to the primary endpoint (occurrence of clinically evident verified post-operative CSF leaks, clinically evident pseudomeningocele or trial treatment failure up to the efficacy follow-up visit (week 7±1)). The null-hypothesis of no treatment effect was to be rejected in case of a (2-sided) p-value &lt; 0.05. The primary analysis was based on the Full Analysis Set of all randomized subjects. This analysis was replicated for the Per Protocol Population. Graphical methods were applied to assess the homogeneity of treatment effects across centres.

Missing primary endpoint values were in general accounted for as non-leaks: It was assumed that an event of the primary endpoint was likely to prompt the patient to contact the investigator. If a patient died after randomisation and before the efficacy follow-up visit (week 7±1) and death could be definitively explained by reasons other than the indication then this was also defined as a non-leak.

To assess the impact of missing value on the primary analysis the following approaches were used in addition:

1. All drop outs counted as leaks
2. 50% of drop outs counted as leaks, i.e. 50% of the patients who dropped out were randomly assigned counting as a leak and 50% were assigned counting as a non-leak (stratified by treatment group).
3. Assuming identical leak rates for drop outs and completers, i.e. patients who dropped out were randomly assigned as counting to be a leak or not a leak using this rate (stratified by treatment group).

Additional analyses were performed to assess the impact of potentially predictive variables on the primary outcome, to compare TachoSil to each of 2 current practice subgroups (fibrin and polymer sealants and other methods of dura closure) and to assess the treatment effect across surgical approaches (i.e. interaction between surgical approaches and treatment group) was analysed

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The same approach as for the primary endpoint was applied to analyse the secondary endpoint (presence of non-clinically evident pseudomeningocele post-operatively until day of discharge without occurrence of the primary endpoint).

Only the primary endpoint was to be tested in a confirmatory manner. Thus no multiplicity adjustment was necessary.

All treatment emergent AEs (TEAE) were summarised by providing the number of patients, the proportion of patients with an event, and the number of events, using preferred term (PT) grouped by system organ class (SOC). In addition TEAEs were summarised by seriousness, severity and relationship to trial treatment and trial procedure.

Laboratory data were standardised to account for the differences between local laboratories by relocating each original, locally recorded value to the corresponding value on the chosen reference range. Absolute laboratory values and changes from baseline were summarised by parameter and visit.

Vital signs data were summarised and presented by treatment group for each parameter and visit.

In general the statistical methods applied are considered adequate.

(a) One subject's data for the final follow-up visit and End of Trial CRF page is missing; completion status could not be confirmed.

The eligibility of subjects according to protocol-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria was evaluated prior to surgery. Discontinuations at Baseline (prior to randomization) are expected to have affected both treatment arms equally, thus introducing no selection bias. No discontinuations occurred after randomization and prior to surgery.

The reasons for discontinuation were varied and did not show any clear pattern.

## Recruitment

Studied Period: 28 April 2011 (first patient enrolled) to 27 June 2013 (last patient completed)

## Conduct of the study

The original protocol (dated 27 July 2009) was amended as follows: Substantial Amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6: dated 21 September 2009, 14 October 2010, 16 November 2010, 25 November 2011 (Version 2.0), 25 November 2011 and 19 October 2012, respectively. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were updated during the trial

A large number of substantial amendments were made to the protocol during the course of the study. Most were not likely to have introduced significant variability into the study, and were made to clarify the protocol. Limited transpetrosal surgical approaches (translabyrinthine, retrolabyrinthine, transcochlear) were specifically excluded in amendment 4.

## Baseline data

The mean age of the patients was 53.1 years (range 18-87 years). The majority of patients were white or Caucasian (98.6%) and the most common ethnicity was non-Hispanic and non-Latino (80.4%). A higher proportion of male patients was randomly assigned to the Current Practice group (42.2%) than to the TachoSil group (35.5%) - see table

The mean age of the patients was 53.1 years (range 18-87 years). The majority of patients were white or Caucasian (98.6%) and the most common ethnicity was non-Hispanic and non-Latino (80.4%).

Baseline characteristics were generally similar across the 2 treatment groups based on evaluation of demography, medical history, concomitant illness, concomitant medication, leak rate predictive variables, surgery times and intra-operative variables.

The proportion of females in the study was substantially larger than that of males: 444 (61.2%) of the 726 enrolled subjects were female (TC-2402-038-SP CSR Table 14.1.3.1). Females represented 64.5% of the TachoSil arm and 57.8% of the Current Practice arm. This preponderance is largely due to the fact that the most common primary indication for surgery was benign meningioma (CSR Appendix 16.2, Listing 16.2.4.1.2), which occurs more frequently in females. Benign meningioma was identified as the primary indication in 130 female subjects (17.9% of the 726 enrolled) and 47 male subjects (6.5%). The next largest gender imbalance was seen in intracranial aneurysm, which represented the primary indication in 66 female (9.1%) and 19 male subjects (2.6%).

Baseline variables considered predictive of leak rate are summarised below.

1. Evidence of hydrocephalus in screening computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging  scan.
2. Patients had received treatment within 5 years prior to the Day of Surgery (Day 1).
3. If duraplasty was applied alone it was counted as missing.

Surgery times (skin incision to randomisation time, time from randomisation time to dura closure start, dura closure start to dura closure completion time, dura closure completion time to skin closure time and time from skin incision to skin closure) were similar in the 2 treatment groups.

Intra-operative variables (dura incision length, dura incision shape, side of surgery, closure of skull and cranioplasty type) were generally similar across both treatment groups.

For the primary suture, the proportion of patients for whom only sutures were used was higher in the TachoSil group (63.2%) than in the Current Practice group (45.5%). The proportion of patients for whom suture and duraplasty were used was lower in the TachoSil group (35.7%) than in the Current Practice group (49.6%). Dura closure variables (dura application) were otherwise generally similar across both treatment groups.

Post-operative variables were generally similar across both treatment groups. The mean (SD) length of stay as an in-patient in the original hospital was 11.0 (13.60) days in the TachoSil group (range 1-49 days) and 16.2 (15.12) days in the Current Practice group (range 2-61 days). The proportion of patients who visited a General Practitioner or out-patient specialist, were re-admitted to hospital, or who had a surgical re-intervention were similar in the TachoSil and Current Practice groups.

Only a small proportion (5%) of patients had received prior radiotherapy to the head within the past 5 years.

FAS, full analysis set; n, the number of patients within the analysis set; PP, per-protocol analysis set; SAF, safety analysis set.

The enrolled total includes all patients enrolled in the trial, including those who were not randomly assigned.

A patient was considered enrolled if they were given a patient identification number and had given informed consent. Percentages are based on all patients enrolled by received treatment, with the number of patients in the SAF as the denominator. The summaries for all enrolled, PP and SAF are presented by treatment received. The summaries for FAS are presented by randomised treatment. One patient (Patient ES3860004) was randomised to current practice but received TachoSil. This results in a percentage greater than 100% for the FAS in the Current Practice group.

A total of 6.9% (25/361) of subjects in the TachoSil group and 8.2% (30/365) of subjects in the Current Practice group (full analysis set [FAS]) had clinically evident, verified postoperative CSF leaks, clinically evident pseudomeningocele, or were treatment failures at efficacy follow-up.

The primary analysis of the incidence of clinically evident verified post-operative CSF leaks, clinically evident pseudomeningocele or treatment failure (FAS) showed an estimated OR of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.43, P=0.485). The proportion of patients in the TachoSil group without clinically evident verified post-operative CSF leaks, clinically evident pseudomeningocele or treatment failure was therefore not superior to the Current Practice group for the FAS. A significant centre effect was found (P=0.046); this effect appeared to be driven by a higher leak rate in Russia. Care must be taken when interpreting the centre effect, however,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

given the small sample size of the Russian subgroup. Similar results were obtained when all CSF leaks (including non-verified leaks) were included in the analysis: 27 (7.5%) patients in the TachoSil group and 34 (9.3%) patients in the Current Practice group had clinically evident post-operative CSF leaks, clinically evident pseudomeningocele or treatment failure (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.46, 1.33, P=0.360); however, the centre effect was not statistically significant (P=0.066).

The proportion of patients with clinically evident post-operative CSF leaks, clinically evident pseudomeningocele or treatment failure was analysed by demographic subgroup category for the FAS. For verified CSF leaks, the estimated OR was 0.43 for male patients and 1.38 for female patients, implying a greater likelihood of a female TachoSil patient experiencing a CSF leak (compared with a female Current Practice patient) and conversely a lower likelihood of a male TachoSil patient experiencing a CSF leak. The 95% CIs for both OR estimates included 1 and no statistically significant difference between treatments could be concluded for either gender. (summarised in Section 14, Table 14.2.3.3 study report)

The proportion of patients with incidence of clinically evident post-operative CSF leaks, clinically evident pseudomeningocele or treatment failure by 2 Current Practice subgroups (fibrin and polymer sealants and other methods of dura closure): For the analysis of the primary endpoint by Current Practice subgroup, the estimated OR for the Fibrin and Polymer Sealant subgroup compared with TachoSil was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.4, 2.0, P=0.820). For the Other Dura Closure Methods subgroup compared with TachoSil, the estimated OR was 1.47 (95% CI: 0.8, 2.8, P=0.241).

Of the 87 patients in the Current Practice group who had suturing alone, 8 (9.2%) patients had clinically evident post-operative CSF leaks, pseudomeningocele or treatment failure. Of the 361 patients in the TachoSil group, 25 (6.9%) had clinically evident post-operative CSF leaks, pseudomeningocele or treatment failure. The estimated OR for suturing alone compared with TachoSil was 1.29 (95% CI: 0.6, 3.0, P=0.559).

## Secondary Efficacy Variable

The primary analysis of the incidence of non-clinically evident post-operative pseudomeningocele (FAS) showed an estimated OR of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.43, 2.36, P=0.979). No difference between the TachoSil and Current Practice groups could be concluded.

PvaluesWere2-sided.

In the TachoSil arm of study TC-2402-038-SP, 1 of the 11 nonclinically evident postoperative pseudomeningoceles reported as a secondary efficacy measure occurred in the postdischarge period. The remaining 10 occurred before discharge. In the Current Practice arm, 2 of the 11 nonclinically evident postoperative pseudomeningoceles occurred in the postdischarge period, and 9 occurred before discharge.

In the TachoSil arm, 26 scans were conducted in the post-discharge period. The time range of the scans (between 2 to 250 days after discharge) showed no particular trend. Only 1 of the 26 scans was positive for non-clinically evident postoperative pseudomeningoceles. One subject had 2 scans at different times and both were negative. Another subject with positive pre-discharge scan findings on Day 8 remained positive for non-clinically evident postoperative pseudomeningoceles on a repeat scan on post-discharge Day 98.

In the Current Practice arm, 27 scans were conducted in the post-discharge period. The time range of the scans was 1 to 179 days after discharge and showed no particular trend. Four of the 27 scans were positive for non-clinically evident postoperative pseudomeningoceles.

## Exploratory Analyses

A total of 34 (9.4%) subjects in the TachoSil group and 38 (10.4%) subjects in the Current Practice group (FAS) had either the primary endpoint or nonclinically evident pseudomeningocele. The exploratory analysis of the combined endpoint (FAS) showed an estimated OR of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.44, p=0.609).

For the analysis of the primary endpoint by Current Practice subgroup, the estimated OR for the Fibrin and Polymer Sealant subgroup compared with TachoSil was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.4, 2.0, p=0.820). For the Other Dura Closure Methods subgroup compared with TachoSil, the estimated OR was 1.47 (95% CI: 0.8, 2.8, p=0.241).

For the primary suture, the proportion of patients for whom only sutures were used was higher in the TachoSil group (63.2%) than in the Current Practice group (45.5%). The proportion of patients for whom suture and duraplasty were used was lower in the TachoSil group (35.7%) than in the Current Practice group (49.6%). Dura closure variables (dura application) were otherwise generally similar across both treatment groups.

A subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint by TachoSil application type (sandwich or single layer) is shown in Table 8. The odds ratio values do not provide support for use of the double-layer (sandwich) technique.

(a)   Subjects with incidence of clinically evident postoperative CSF leaks, clinically evident pseudomeningocele, or treatment failure.

The first analysis of the primary endpoint only includes the verified leaks. However, including the non-verified leaks does not change the picture of a very low number of events in both treatment groups.

The company had expected an event rate of 5-6% in the TachoSil group, however they had assumed a much higher (15-20%) event rate in the current practice group than found in this study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The proportion of patients for whom only sutures were used was higher in the TachoSil group than the Current Practice group whereas the proportion of patients for whom suture and duraplasty were used was lower in the TachoSil group than in the Current Practice group. It was discussed that the current practise group was too broad and probably the dura closure was more thorough than in a normal clinical setting. But this isn't verified and it can be supposed that if a surgeon carefully performs the dura closure such results would be obtained.

According to the subgroup analysis provided in Table 7 there is no statistically significant difference between the TachoSil and Current Practice groups for any surgical approach.

A total of 8.2 % (30/365) of subjects in the Current Practice group and 6.9% (25/361) of subjects in the TachoSil group had clinically evident, verified postoperative CSF leaks, clinically evident pseudomeningocele, or were treatment failures at efficacy follow-up.

The subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint showed an estimated OR of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.51, 2.24, P=0.855) for TachoSil sandwich and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.32, 1.25, P=0.1845) for TachoSil single-layer.

Therefore, the proportion of patients treated with double-layer technique was therefore not superior to the the single-layer group.

The use of rescue treatment was very low in both treatment groups (5 [1.4%] patients in each group).

## Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

The company performed a meta-analysis using high-level data from the Hutter (2014) trial. According to the documents results from \"suture alone\" from the TASALL trial and the Hutter trial were pooled.

The primary dural closure in the TASALL and Hutter [10] studies was defined as primary suture of the dural membrane and/or duraplasty with a dural patch, hence the techniques were the same. 'Dural patch' is a general term used to describe the various types of materials used for duraplasty in the primary closure. 'Dural patch' should not be confused with medicinal product like some sealants or TachoSil. The technique of duraplasty in all cases involves suturing to attach the dural patch to the edges of the residual dural membrane. The dural patch materials used in the TASALL and Hutter [10] studies were the same. They included autologous tissue (galea, muscle, pericranium) or an artificial membrane material.

Accordingly, the primary treatments consisting of suturing and duraplasty to close the dura were the same in the 2 studies.

The secondary, randomized treatment in control subjects in the Hutter study was suture [10]. This is comparable to the treatment in the subgroup of subjects receiving suturing alone in the TASALL study. Since the primary endpoint was the same in both studies (discussed in Response to the 2nd RSI; sequence 0066), it is therefore justified and appropriate to combine the 2 studies in a meta-analysis comparing TachoSil treatment with suturing alone across the 2 studies. The objective of the meta-analysis was to increase the statistical power. The similarity of the subject populations, procedures, and efficacy endpoints in both the studies ensured a robust meta-analysis. The result of the meta-analysis showed statistical superiority of TachoSil, with a leak event rate reduction of -5.6 percentage points (95% CI, -11.1%, -0.2%; p=0.035) over suturing, corresponding to a clinically relevant relative reduction of 43%.

## 2.4.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

The purpose of this application was to present data in support of the efficacy of TachoSil for supportive sealing of the dura mater to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following neurological surgery based on the results obtained from neurosurgery Study TC-2402-038-SP.

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Study TC-2402-038-SP was designed as an open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, phase 3 (therapeutic confirmatory) study comparing TachoSil versus Current Practice as an adjunct in sealing the dura mater.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria are appropriate to generate an adequate patient population. Only adult patients were included in the pivotal study in neurosurgery.  Just under half of the patients were enrolled using the selection criteria from an earlier version of the protocol, which differed in regard to a smaller number of allowed surgical approaches. However, this is not considered to have had a major impact on the results of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The randomization procedure was comprehensible and sufficiently described. It is agreed, based on the differences in the applied treatment modalities (patch versus 'current practice') applied to the dura mater during surgery - that use of placebo or blinding is practically impossible. It was planned to show a difference in CSF leak or pseudomeningocele rates between TachoSil (8.5%) and the control group (17.0%) with a fixed sample size of 726 patients. 362 patients were randomised to treatment with TachoSil, which was applied over the suture line in a single layer, or as a double sandwich layer, inside and outside of the dura, where a sufficient overlap of the suture line was not possible with a single layer application. 364 control patients were randomised to best standard of care, at the discretion of the Investigator (eg, duraplasty, fibrin/polymer sealant, sutures alone, etc.). The use of a broad range of standard of care treatments in the control group was appropriate since there is no gold standard treatment, and since there were ethical concerns with restricting control subjects to sutures alone when CSF leakage has been shown to occur in almost 20% of cases. Together with this, the eligibility criteria were broad, and included those with previous local radiotherapy, which may predispose to CSF leakage.

There was no specified reference product in this clinical trial. The control treatment in the trial is defined as current practice, which is primary suture and in addition whatever means of dura closure is deemed necessary by the investigator (except of TachoSil treatment). This is noted, since there is no defined gold standard and in current clinical practice several alternatives are applied, e.g. fibrin glue, hydrogel, dura substitute. However, as requested by the 'European guideline on the clinical investigation of plasma derived fibrin sealant/haemostatic products' (CPMP/BPWG/1089/00), the efficacy of fibrin sealant should be investigated in comparison  to standard treatment without fibrin sealant to allow for demonstration of haemostatic properties and clinical benefit of the investigational medicinal product.

To avoid selection bias random allocation was performed prior to application of primary dura closing techniques. Reason for this decision was to allow the sandwich technique.

Only adult patients were included in the pivotal study in neurosurgery. The occurrence of clinically evident verified post-operative CSF leaks or a clinically evident pseudomeningocele chosen as part of the primary endpoint are considered adequate to allow an assessment of the efficacy of the dura sealing.

Baseline characteristics were generally similar across the 2 treatment groups based on evaluation of demography, medical history, concomitant illness, concomitant medication, leak rate predictive variables, surgery times and intra-operative variables.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The results for the primary analysis show that approximately 7% of TachoSil subjects experienced a CSF leak, a pseudomeningocele, or treatment failure during surgery, compared with 8% of control patients. Although the point estimate of the odds of failure in dural sealing was 0.82 compared with current practice (over half of whom received an adjunctive sealing technique), the confidence interval was wide (0.47 to 1.43).  The sensitivity analyses for different methods of handling missing data do not change the conclusions from the primary analysis. Regarding the secondary endpoint, non-clinically evident post-operative pseudomeningocele occurred in 3% of subjects in each treatment group, giving an odds ratio of 1.01 (0.43, 2.28).

The results of the additional comparisons of TachoSil treatment and a number of treatment modalities in the Current Practice treatment arm showed that TachoSil prevented more postoperative leak events than any of the subgroups. Values for the reduction in postoperative leak events ranged from 1.53 to 4.75 percentage points at postoperative Week 7 and from 3.12 to 5.35 percentage points at Week 28, corresponding to clinically relevant relative reductions of 20% to 44% and 34% to 47%, respectively. All of these comparisons support the use of TachoSil in neurosurgery to prevent CSF leaks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

For the largest subgroup (Current Practice excluding suturing alone) in the post-hoc analysis, superiority of TachoSil was demonstrated with statistical significance at Week 28 (p=0.050).

In order to increase the statistical power, a meta-analysis of data from TASALL and the published study by Hutter et al was done and carefully discussed. This meta-analysis comparing TachoSil treatment with suturing alone showed statistical superiority of TachoSil with a reduction in leak rate of 5.6 percentage points (95% CI, -11.1%, -0.2%, p=0.035), corresponding to a clinically relevant relative reduction of 43%.

Study TC-2402-038-SP was planned to show a difference in CSF leak or pseudomeningocele rates between TachoSil (8.5%) and the control group (17.0%) with a fixed sample size of 726 patients.

In the Current Practice group, a total of 87 (23.8%) patients received suture alone/suture, 171 (46.8%) patients received sealant and 156 (42.7%) patients received duraplasty.

In the TachoSil group, a total of 241 (66.8%) patients received single layer treatment and 113 (31.3%) patients received sandwich treatment for the first application of TachoSil.

The proportion of patients without clinically evident CSF leak, clinically evident pseudomeningocele or treatment failure in the TachoSil treatment group was not different from the Current Practice treatment group (OR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.47, 1.43 for the FAS); therefore, TachoSil was not shown to be superior to current practice as an adjunct in sealing the dura mater. The results were supported by the Per-Protocol Analysis Set and sensitivity analyses.

The first analysis of the primary endpoint only includes the verified leaks. However, including the non-verified leaks does not change the picture of a very low number of events in both treatment groups.

Furthermore, the company has presented an additional post hoc analysis which is not based on the original primary endpoint because the MAH has considered any CSF leak is clinically relevant. This method has to be taken into consideration when interpreting this subgroup analysis.  The results of this further analysis are not statistically significant except one of twelve subgroup analysis (CP excluding suturing alone). At least, it can be evaluated as a positive signal for treatment efficacy. Moreover, the MAH refers to a clinically relevant relative reduction in all subgroups. But these data are presented without a confidence interval which might a hint to non-significant results. This can only be considered as a positive signal, too. Therefore, Efficacy was not conclusively demonstrated in the TASALL trial.

The company had expected an event rate of 5-6% in the TachoSil group; however they had assumed a much higher (15-20%) event rate in the current practice group than found in this study. The proportion of patients for whom only sutures were used was higher in the TachoSil group than the Current Practice group whereas the proportion of patients for whom suture and duraplasty were used was lower in the TachoSil group than in the Current Practice group. It was discussed that the current practise group was too broad and probably the dura closure was more thorough than in a normal clinical setting. The MAH believes that the main reason for the statistically nonsignificant result is the overestimation of the expected postoperative CSF leak rate. It is accepted that a number of factors leading to a lower event rate in the standard of care arm may have contributed to this, including the use of another supportive method in addition to suturing in a high proportion of patients in the current practice arm. The results in the subgroup of subjects with a gap ≥5 mm (all leak events, TachoSil single layer only) showed a leak event rate of 0% in TachoSil-treated subjects vs 19.4% in control-treated subjects at Weeks 7 and 28. But these are even more nonsignificant results. Nevertheless the overall trend in favour of TachoSil is observed.

The proportion of patients with non-clinically evident pseudomeningocele was not found to be different in the TachoSil group in comparison with the Current Practice group (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.43, 2.36 for the FAS).

Moreover, results of subgroup analysis couldn't show statistically significant difference between the TachoSil and Current Practice groups.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TachoSil was applied during surgery as an adjunct to the closure of the dura, as a single layer or a sandwich (double layer).  The subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint showed an estimated OR of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.51, 2.24, P=0.855) for TachoSil sandwich and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.32, 1.25, P=0.1845) for TachoSil single-layer.

Therefore, the proportion of patients treated with double-layer technique was therefore not superior to the single-layer group and is no longer part of this variation, because treatment effect could not been demonstrated.

The use of rescue treatment was very low in both treatment groups (5 [1.4%] patients in each group).

A meta-analysis of data from TASALL and the published study by Hutter et al was done and discussed at an Oral Explanation with the CHMP. This meta-analysis comparing TachoSil treatment with suturing alone showed statistical superiority of TachoSil with a reduction in leak rate of 5.6 percentage points (95% CI, -11.1%, -0.2%, p=0.035), corresponding to a clinically relevant relative reduction of 43%.

In accordance with its design the TASALL study failed to demonstrate superiority of TachoSil over current clinical practice in the claimed indication extension. Despite the failure to demonstrate superiority against control, the argument that the standard of care employed in the study produced a higher than expected success rate. It is acknowledged that the results numerically are in favour for TachoSil and when compared against subgroups, the overall trend in favour of TachoSil is observed. Finally, the previously presented meta-analysis of data from TASALL and the Hutter study showed statistical superiority over suturing alone.

## 2.4.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

An overall trend in favour of TachoSil when compared against subgroups, is observed in the TASALL study and supported by the presented meta-analysis of data from TASALL and the published Hutter study showing statistical superiority over suturing alone.

## 2.5. Clinical safety

## Introduction

More recent safety data continue to support the clinical use of TachoSil. Since the approval of TachoSil in the European Union, an estimated number of 3,600,000 patients have been exposed to TachoSil until 08 June 2013 under the assumption of an average use of 1 patch for each surgical procedure. Up to 08 June 2013, a total of 261 spontaneously reported ADRs were recorded. A total of 184 ADRs were considered to be serious and 77 were non-serious.

The safety of TachoSil for suture line sealing in dura mater closure is based on the results obtained from neurosurgery Study TC-2402-038-SP.

## Patient exposure

In the present study TC-2402-038-SP to support the neurosurgical indication applied for, a total of 726 subjects were randomized to treatment, thereof 362 to TachoSil and 364 to control.

61% of patients required 0.25-1 patches, 33% required .125-2 patches, 4% required 2.25-3 patches, and 2% required 3.25-4 patches. In the TachoSil group, a total of 241 (66.8%) patients received single layer treatment and 113 (31.3%) patients received sandwich treatment for the first application of TachoSil.

Adverse events were reported for 250 (69.1%) patients in the TachoSil group and 250 (68.7%) patients in the Current Practice group. The majority of AEs in each treatment group were considered by the Investigator to be not related to trial treatment or trial procedure. In the TachoSil group, AEs considered by the Investigator to be related to trial treatment were reported for 5 (1.4%) patients.

The types and frequencies of AEs were generally similar in the 2 treatment groups. Adverse events were most frequently reported in the nervous system disorders SOC in both treatment groups (152 [42.0%] patients in the TachoSil group and 149 [40.9%] patients in the Current Practice group). The most frequently reported AEs by PT for patients in the TachoSil group were constipation (24 [6.6%] patients), pneumocephalus (21 [5.8%] patients) and hypokalaemia (20 [5.5%] patients). The most frequently reported AEs by PT for patients in the Current Practice group were pneumocephalus (25 [6.9%] patients), pyrexia (24 [6.6%] patients) and hypokalaemia (23 [6.3%] patients). The majority of AEs were considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to trial treatment.

The proportion of patients with severe AEs was similar in the 2 treatment groups, occurring in 80 (22.1%) patients in the TachoSil group and 80 (22.0%) patients in the Current Practice group. The severe AE PTs most frequently reported for patients in the TachoSil group were hydrocephalus (8 [2.2%] patients), VIIth nerve paralysis (6 [1.7%] patients) and pneumonia (5 [1.4%] patients). The severe AE PTs most frequently reported for patients in the Current Practice group were sepsis (6 [1.6% patients]) and hydrocephalus and pneumonia (5 [1.4%] patients each).

The proportion of patients with serious AEs (SAEs) (excluding those that led to death) was similar in the 2 treatment groups. In the TachoSil group the most frequently reported were hydrocephalus (10 [2.8%] patients) and meningitis (5 [1.4%] patients). In the Current Practice group the most frequently reported were hydrocephalus (8 [2.2%] patients) and pneumonia (6 [1.6%] patients). The proportion of patients with

E, total number of events; N, number of patients in the SAF; n, number of patients with at least 1 event; SAF, safety analysis set; %, number of patients with at least 1 event as % of the SAF. Adverse events with missing relationship to the trial treatment were categorised as related.

In the TachoSil group, overall nine AEs have been considered by the Investigator to be related to trial treatment. The proportion of patients with at least 1 AE considered by the Investigator to be related to trial treatment was low (n=5, 1.4 %). Apart from air embolism, all AEs (i.e. Infections, Nervous system disorders) are considered to be consequences of the surgical procedure and/or the underlying disease. There were no treatment-related AEs reported for patients in the Current Practice group.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

Adverse events leading to death were reported for 19 (5.2%) patients in the TachoSil group and 24 (6.6%) patients in the Current Practice group. No AEs leading to death were considered by the Investigator to be related to trial treatment. The AEs leading to death reported for more than 1 patient in the TachoSil group were cardio-respiratory arrest, pneumonia, neoplasm progression and cerebral ischaemia (2 [0.6%] patients each). AE leading to death reported for more than 1 patient in the Current Practice group was sepsis (2 [0.5%] patients).

Serious AEs were reported for 94 (26%) patients in the TachoSil group and 97 (26.6%) patients in the Current Practice group.

In the TachoSil group, SAEs considered to be related to trial treatment were reported for 3 (0.8%) patients. No patients in the Current Practice group experienced SAEs that were considered by the Investigator to be related to trial treatment.

E, total number of events; N, number of patients in the SAF; n, number of patients with at least

1 event; SAE, serious adverse event; SAF, safety analysis set; %, number of patients with at least

1eventas%of theSAF.

The majority of SAEs were severe. The proportion of patients with severe SAEs was similar in the 2 treatment groups (63 [17.4%] patients in the TachoSil group and 72 [19.8%] patients in the Current Practice group). Severe SAEs were most frequently reported in the nervous system disorders SOC in both treatment groups (35 [9.7%] patients in the TachoSil group and 34 [9.3%] patients in the Current Practice group). The severe SAE PTs most frequently reported in the TachoSil group were hydrocephalus (8 [2.2%] patients) and pneumonia (5 [1.4%] patients). The severe SAE PTs most frequently reported in the Current Practice group were hydrocephalus, pneumonia and sepsis (5 [1.4%] patients each).

No AE leading to death was considered by the Investigator to be related to trial treatment. The AEs leading to death were assessed by the sponsor to be due to post-operative complications or the patient's underlying disease or general condition.

It is agreed that serious adverse events as observed in the trial might be related to surgical complications and underlying medical conditions.

## Laboratory findings

As expected due to the nature of the underlying disease in this patient population, several patients in each treatment group had clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results at certain visits and several patients in each treatment group had AEs related to abnormal laboratory results. Similar proportions of patients in each treatment group experienced AEs in the blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC, which comprised anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, leukopenia and neutropenia; none of these AEs were considered related to trial treatment.

Mean vital sign results (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature) were similar across both treatment groups and there was little change from Baseline at each time point. Several patients in each treatment group had clinically significant abnormal vital sign results at certain visits and several patients in each treatment group had AEs related to abnormal vital sign results. Similar

proportions of patients in each treatment group experienced AEs of hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia and bradycardia; none of these AEs were considered related to trial treatment.

Clinical laboratory results were generally similar in the 2 treatment groups.

## Post marketing experience

The most recent PSUR was submitted to the PRAC on 11 September 2014, and covered the period June 2011 to June 2014. The Rapporteur preliminary assessment report was circulated on 10 November 2014, and the final PRAC assessment report is expected on 8 January 2015. The preliminary conclusion of the PRAC Rapporteur was that no new safety information had arisen during the reporting period which would change the benefit-risk balance for TachoSil.

## 2.5.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The data obtained from the clinical trial with TC-S indicate no concerns for the safety profile of TC-S when used in neurosurgery to support suture line sealing in dura mater closure. This assessment is supported by the data from studies and postmarketing experience with TachoSil.

In the present study 362 subjects were randomized to treatment with TachoSil and 364 to control. Both treatments were adjunctive to primary suture dura repair.

The most frequent AEs were constipation, pneumocephalus and, which are all commonly associated with this type of surgery. Constipation was more frequently reported in the TachoSil group.

It is agreed that serious adverse events as observed in the trial might be related to surgical complications and underlying medical conditions. No AE leading to death was considered by the Investigator to be related to trial treatment. The AEs leading to death were assessed by the sponsor to be due to post-operative complications or the patient's underlying disease or general condition.

It can be presumed that TachoSil provides a durable dura closure which lasts long enough to enable watertight closure until healing of the dura cut is completed since CSF leaks occur mostly within 30 days postoperatively according to the literature in neurosurgery.

It is not known whether recent radiation therapy affects the efficacy of TachoSil when used for dura mater sealing. This statement has been added under section 4.4. of the SmPC.

Furthermore, a previous statement on lack of data in neurosurgery is now revised following this submission.

## 2.5.2. Conclusions on clinical safety

TachoSil was found to be well tolerated in the context of the surgical procedures performed, with no evidence of increased frequency of AEs compared with patients treated with current practice. The numbers of AEs and SAEs were equally distributed between treatment groups and the type/nature and level were as expected considering the surgery performed and the patient co-morbidities.

The presented results are considered to be acceptable. There were no safety signals due to the use of TachoSil in neurosurgery procedures.

## 2.5.3. PSUR cycle

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

## 2.6. Risk management plan

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 6.0 could be acceptable if the applicant implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 6.1 with the following content (new text marked as underlined, deletions marked as strikethrough):

## Pharmacovigilance plan

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.

The PRAC also considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures.

| Immunological events including hypersensitivity | Current approved SmPC: 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use As with any protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Signs of hypersensitivity reactions include hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur, the administration has to be discontinued immediately. In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment should be observed. 4.8 Undesirable effects, Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the application site, bronchospasm, chills, flushing, generalized urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) may occur in rare cases in patients treated with fibrin sealants/haemostatics. In isolated cases, these reactions may progress to severe anaphylaxis. Such reactions may especially be seen, if the preparation is applied repeatedly, or administered to patients known to be hypersensitive to constituents of the product.

| Transmission of infectious agents               | Current approved SmPC: 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV and for the non-enveloped virus HAV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | None proposed.                          |

Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (fetal infection) and for individuals with immunodeficiency or increased erythropoiesis (e.g., haemolytic anaemia). It is strongly recommended that every time that TachoSil is administered to a patient, the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                         |

Therefore, TachoSil should be administered to pregnant and lactating women only if clearly needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | None proposed.                          |

## 3. Benefit-Risk Balance

## Benefits

## Beneficial effects

The study was designed as an open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, phase 3 (therapeutic confirmatory) study comparing TachoSil versus Current Practice as an adjunct in sealing the dura mater.

Study TC-2402-038-SP was planned to show a difference in CSF leak or pseudomeningocele rates between TachoSil (8.5%) and the control group (17.0%) with a fixed sample size of 726 patients. 362 patients were randomised to treatment with TachoSil, which was applied over the suture line in a single layer, or as a double sandwich layer, inside and outside of the dura, where a sufficient overlap of the suture line was not possible with a single layer application. 364 control patients were randomised to best standard of care, at the discretion of the Investigator (eg, duraplasty, fibrin/polymer sealant, sutures alone, etc.).

The use of a broad range of standard of care treatments in the control group was appropriate since there is no gold standard treatment, and since there were ethical concerns with restricting control subjects to sutures alone when CSF leakage has been shown to occur in almost 20% of cases. Together with this, the eligibility criteria were broad, and included those with previous local radiotherapy, which may predispose to CSF leakage. The results for the primary analysis show that approximately 7% of TachoSil subjects experienced a CSF leak, a pseudomeningocele, or treatment failure during surgery, compared with 8% of control patients. Although the point estimate of the odds of failure in dural sealing was 0.82 compared with current practice (over half of whom received an adjunctive sealing technique), the confidence interval was wide (0.47 to 1.43).  The sensitivity analyses for different methods of handling missing data do not change the conclusions from the primary analysis. Regarding the secondary endpoint, non-clinically evident post-operative pseudomeningocele occurred in 3% of subjects in each treatment group, giving an odds ratio of 1.01 (0.43, 2.28).

The results of the additional comparisons of TachoSil treatment and a number of treatment modalities in the Current Practice treatment arm showed that TachoSil prevented more postoperative leak events than any of the subgroups. Values for the reduction in postoperative leak events ranged from 1.53 to 4.75 percentage points at postoperative Week 7 and from 3.12 to 5.35 percentage points at Week 28, corresponding to clinically relevant relative reductions of 20% to 44% and 34% to 47%, respectively. All of these comparisons support the use of TachoSil in neurosurgery to prevent CSF leaks.

For the largest subgroup (Current Practice excluding suturing alone) in the post-hoc analysis, superiority of TachoSil was demonstrated with statistical significance at Week 28 (p=0.050).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In order to increase the statistical power, a meta-analysis of data from TASALL and the published study by Hutter et al was done and carefully discussed. This meta-analysis comparing TachoSil treatment with suturing alone showed statistical superiority of TachoSil with a reduction in leak rate of 5.6 percentage points (95% CI, -11.1%, -0.2%, p=0.035), corresponding to a clinically relevant relative reduction of 43%.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

The non-clinical data are rather limited, especially in regard to the longer term effect of TachoSil in neurosurgical procedures and the potential for adhesions. However, data from the clinical studies, in which subjects were followed up for 6 months, did not reveal any issues in regard to neurotoxicity.

Methodological issues which led to the failure of the trial to prove superiority have been adequately explained. Further analyses into the data and meta-analysis the results of a published trial showed the efficacy of TachoSil in the final agreed indication. The result of the meta-analysis showed statistical superiority of TachoSil although neither the TASALL study nor the study by Hutter demonstrate a statistically significant treatment effect on their own.

## Risks

## Unfavourable effects

The data obtained from the clinical trial with TC-S indicate no concerns for the safety profile of TC-S when used in neurosurgery to support suture line sealing in dura mater closure. This assessment is supported by the data from studies and postmarketing experience with TachoSil.

The clinical safety of TachoSil for use in surgical haemostasis has been demonstrated in a range of clinical studies in lung, liver, kidney and cardiovascular surgery. In addition, there is a large amount of post-marketing experience for TachoSil in surgical procedures, and the most recent PSUR, covering June 2011 to June 2014, has just been submitted. Only three adverse drug reactions are listed in the SmPC, pyrexia, hypersensitivity, and thromboembolism (if inadvertently applied intravascularly).

The total number of postoperative complications was fewer in the TachoSil group than the Current Practice/Control group (5.2% and 6.3%), ie, meningitis, empyema, and hematomas and the TASALL study has shown a lower frequency for more serious interventions, ie, hospital readmission, surgical revision/reoperation due to leak events in the TachoSil group.

## Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects

The non-clinical data are limited, especially in regard to the longer term effect of TachoSil in neurosurgical procedures and the potential for adhesions. Clinical research into the absorption of and potential tissue reactions to TachoSil in humans is limited due to ethical reasons, since it would involve repeat intervention with open or laparoscopic surgery for follow-up observation and/or to take a biopsy sample for histological examination.

However no issues have been reported from the extensive post marketing experience so far.

## Benefit-Risk Balance

## Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

It is accepted that there is a need for watertight sealing of the dura mater after neurosurgical procedures, in order to prevent CSF leaks and consequent postoperative morbidity due to surgical site infections, meningitis, pneumocephalus and meningocerebral adhesions. Standard closure techniques, such as use of sutures only, have been associated with post-operative leakage in around a fifth of patients. Other techniques, such as grafting of fat, fascia, muscle, or use of fibrin/polymer sealant products have been shown effective in reducing the intra- and post-operative leakage rate.

In the TASALL trial, although the leakage rate in treated patients was low (7%), the leakage rate in control patients, who could receive any available therapy at the discretion of the Investigator, and who may consequently have been over-treated, was also low (8%). The study therefore failed to demonstrate the superiority of TachoSil over current practice. But it is accepted that a number of factors leading to a lower event rate in the standard of care arm may have contributed to this, including the use of another supportive method in addition to suturing in a high proportion of patients in the current practice arm. The results for the analysis in the subgroup of subjects with a gap ≥5 mm showed a leak event rate  of 0% in TachoSil-treated subjects vs 19.4% in control-treated subjects at Weeks 7 and 28. But these are even more nonsignificant results. Nevertheless the overall trend in favour of TachoSil is observed.

In patients treated with the double-layer technique no treatment effect could be demonstrated. Therefore sandwich application is no longer part of this variation.

The safety of TachoSil in neurosurgical procedures appears acceptable, and comparable with the known safety in other surgical procedures. There were no signals of specific events occurring disproportionately in treated patients compared with control patients.

## Benefit-risk balance

Overall, the potential clinical benefit  for use in suture line sealing in dura mater closure where standard techniques are insufficient  are considered to outweigh any unfavourable effect and so the current benefit-risk balance of TachoSil in the claimed indication is considered to be positive.

## Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance

The purpose of this application was to present data in support of the safety and efficacy of TachoSil for supportive sealing of the dura mater to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following neurological surgery based on the results obtained from neurosurgery Study TC-2402-038-SP.

An incomplete sealing of the dura mater intraoperatively implies a risk of developing substantial postoperative complications such as a pseudomeningocele or worse: a fistula leading to postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage presenting as rhinorrhea, otorrhea and/or a CSF leak through the surgical skin incision.

Considering efficacy, taking all data together, in accordance with its design the TASALL study failed to demonstrate superiority of TachoSil over current clinical practice in the claimed indication extension. Despite the failure to demonstrate superiority against control, as it appears that the standard of care employed in the study produced a higher than expected success rate. It is acknowledged that the results numerically are in favour for TachoSil and when compared against subgroups, the overall trend in favour of TachoSil is observed. Finally, the previously presented meta-analysis of data from TASALL and the Hutter study showed statistical superiority over suturing alone.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

TachoSil was found to be well tolerated in the context of the surgical procedures performed, with no evidence of increased frequency of AEs compared with patients treated with current practice. The numbers of AEs and SAEs were equally distributed between treatment groups and the type/nature and level were as expected considering the surgery performed and the patient co-morbidities.

Moreover, the study presented a lower frequency of postoperative complications of CSF leakage including meningitis, empyema and hematoma in the TachoSil group compared with the control groups. This overall trend of reduction of postoperative complications of CSF leaks is supported. Therefore, this data indicates a favourable effect for TachoSil in neurosurgery.

Overall, the potential clinical benefit  for use in suture line sealing in dura mater closure where standard techniques are insufficient  are considered to outweigh any unfavourable effect and so the current benefit-risk balance of TachoSil in the claimed indication is considered to be positive.

## 4. Recommendations

## Outcome

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change:

| Variation accepted   | Variation accepted                                                                                                             | Type    | Annexes affected   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------|
| C.I.6.a              | C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one | Type II | I                  |

Extension of indication to add the use of TachoSil for supportive sealing of the dura mater to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following neurological surgery. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.4, and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The MAH also took the opportunity to make minor editorial corrections to the SmPC. An updated RMP version 6.1 was agreed during the procedure.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).
