## Introduction

On  19  July  2011,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Toviaz,  in  accordance  with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

No critical expert overview has been provided.

The MAH stated that no consequential regulatory action is claimed by the applicant at present.

## Scientific discussion

## Information on the development program

The active substance of Toviaz is fesoterodine, a competitive, specific muscarinic receptor antagonist. It  is  rapidly  and  extensively  hydrolysed  by  non-specific  plasma  esterases  to  the  5-hydroxymethyl derivative  (5-hydroxy-methyltolterodine;  5-HMT),  its  primary  active  metabolite,  which  is  the  main active pharmacological substance of fesoterodine.

Toviaz is available as a prolonged release tablet formulation at doses of 4 and 8 mg. It is indicated in adults for the treatment of the symptoms (increased urinary frequency and/or urgency and/or urgency incontinence) that may  occur in patients with overactive bladder syndrome. Toviaz is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy. There are no pharmacokinetic data in paediatric patients.

A PIP application for Toviaz was submitted on 5 December 2008 and then voluntaryly withdrawn by MAH on 16 September 2009.

The  MAH  is  submitting  new  data  referring  paediatric  population  in  accordance  to  article  46  of Regulation 1901/2006. This information consist on the results of the study A0221066 (An Open-Label, Dose-Escalating  Study  of  the  Pharmacokinetics,  Safety  and  Tolerability  of  Fesoterodine  in  Pediatric Overactive Bladder Patients Aged 8-17 Years).

## Assessor comment:

At the time of the PIP evaluation Study A0221066 had already started. Two additional studies in paediatric patients were planned: Study A0221047 (safety and efficacy study in neurogenic detrusor overactive patients of ages 6-16 years and body weight &gt;25 Kg) and Study A0221074 in younger and lighter children (&gt;6 yrs of age and &lt;25 Kg). No information regarding these two clinical trials is included in the documentation submitted. The MAH is requested to provide the status of any other existing paediatric study of fesoterodine related with this condition.

## Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Fesoterodine fumarate is authorised as 4 mg and 8 mg sustained release tablets for once-daily dose. Fesoterodine is not indicated for use in children and no suitable paediatric formulation is available.

The study drug was provided in the form of 4 mg and 8 mg Sustained Release Tablets. The dose for all subjects was fesoterodine 4 mg once daily (QD) escalated to 8 mg QD.

## Clinical aspects

## 1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for study A0221066: An Open-Label, Dose-Escalating Study of the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of Fesoterodine in Pediatric Overactive Bladder Patients Aged 8-17 Years.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2. Clinical study

Study A0221066: An Open-Label, Dose-Escalating Study of the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of Fesoterodine in Pediatric Overactive Bladder Patients Aged 8-17 Years.

This was an 8-week, open label, multicenter, uncontrolled study of fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg once daily in male and female paediatric subjects with Overactive Bladder (OAB); approximately 50% of the study population was targeted to be subjects with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO).

## Methods

##  Objectives

## Primary

-  To determine the PK of 5-hydroxy-methyltolterodine (5-HMT) in paediatric OAB subjects aged 8 to 17 years.

## Secondary

-  To examine the influence of subject covariates on the PK of 5-HMT.
-  To  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  fesoterodine  in  pediatric  OAB  subjects  aged  8  to  17 years.

## Exploratory

-  To assess the feasibility and utility of a 3-day bladder diary in pediatric OAB subjects aged 8 to 17 years.

##  Study design

This was an 8-week open label, uncontrolled study in male and female patients with OAB (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. StudyOverview

<!-- image -->

Screening evaluations (Visit 1) were to occur within 28 days prior to the first dose. If the subjects were previously receiving anticholinergic or other medications for OAB, there was a washout of 1 week, or other appropriate period as determined by the investigator prior to the enrolment visit.

##  Study population /Sample size

## Inclusion Criteria

Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrolment into the study:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1. Male or female subjects between the ages of 8 and 17 years inclusive and total body weight &gt;25 kg.
2. OAB as defined by:
3.  Symptoms  of  urinary  frequency  (8  micturitions  on  average  per  24  hours)  and  urgency (defined as a sudden and compelling desire to pass urine which is difficult to defer), with or without urgency incontinence, for at least 6 months prior to enrolment,

OR

-  Subjects with stable neurological disease and urodynamically confirmed detrusor overactivity,  who  may  require  intermittent  catheterization  for  management  of  urinary drainage.

## Exclusion Criteria

## 1. General exclusion criteria

Patients  with evidence or history of clinically significant disease; a positive urine drug screen; clinically significant abnormality in ECG or laboratory values; any condition possibly affecting drug absorption, previous treatment with an investigational drug (4 weeks or 5 half-lives); history of recreational use of drugs of abuse, alcohol and tobacco, were excluded from the study.

Subjects required to take concomitant medications that can interact with the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of fesoterodine  or  patients  who  have  received  any  electrostimulation  therapy  or bladder retraining within 4 weeks of Visit 1 or who are expected to start such therapy during the study period, were already excluded.

## 2. Urinary exclusion criteria

Subjects  with  monosymptomatic  nocturnal  enuresis  or  giggle  incontinence,  a  relevant  disease  with which  their  urinary  symptoms  may  be  associated,  continuous  use  of  indwelling  urinary  catheter;  a clinically  significant  urinary  tract  infection  at  screening;  subjects  with  greater  than  1+  hematuria on dipstick  test    and  subjects  not  requiring  intermittent  catheterization who have  a  post-void  residual volume &gt;40 mL were excluded.

## Sample size

A total of 20 paediatric OAB subjects, aged between 8 and 17 years, were to be enrolled in the study. Approximately  50%  of  the  study  population  was  targeted  to  be  subjects  with  neurogenic  detrusor overactivity.

##  Treatments

For  Weeks  1  to  4,  the  dose  for  all  subjects  was  to  be  fesoterodine  4  mg  QD.  Based  on  the investigator's  assessment  of  individual  subjects'  tolerability  and  safety,  the  study  dose  was  to  be escalated to 8 mg QD for the next 4 weeks.

##  Outcomes/endpoints

## Endpoints

- o Primary

Model-based  pharmacokinetic  parameter  estimates  for  absorption  rate  constant,  apparent  oral clearance  and  volumes  of  distribution  to  predict  the  AUC,  Cmax,  Tmax  and  half-life  of  5-HMT  in pediatric OAB patients aged 8-17 years, and weighing more than 25 kg.

- o Secondary Laboratory tests, post-void residual volume, ECG, and adverse events.
- o Exploratory

## Change from baseline in:

- -mean number of micturitions or catheterizations per day
- -mean number of incontinence episodes per day
- -mean urgency episodes per day
- -mean volume voided per micturition or mean volume per catheterization

## Measures

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- o Pharmacokinetic measures
- o PK parameter estimates: absortion rate constant (Ka), apparent oral clearance (CL/F), volumes of distribution (VC/F)
- o Individual concentration data: plasma 5-HMT concentrations
- o PK parameters predicted: AUC, Cmax, Tmax, half-life of 5-HMT.

Blood  samples  (2  mL  each)  were  collected  according  to  the  following  schedule:  Visit  3  (Week  4) predose and at 0.5-2, 2-4, 4-6 hours postdose (relative to dose on that morning), Visit 4 (Week 8) at 8-10, 10-14, and 14-16 and 16-20 hours postdose (relative to dose on the previous night).

In order to limit the blood sampling in paediatric subjects, PK samples at earlier time points postdose (absorption phase) were to be collected after dosing in the morning up to Visit 3 (Weeks 1 to 4), and the  samples  at  later  time  points  postdose  (terminal  elimination  phase)  were  to  be  collected  after dosing in the evening after Visit 3 up to Visit 4 (Weeks 5 to 8).

Variations  in  the  CYP2D6  gene  play  a  role  in  metabolism  of  active  metabolite  of  fesoterodine.  The alleles  which  were  to  be  genotyped  are  *3,  *4,  *5,  *6,*7,  *8,  *10,  *14,  *18,  *21,  *36,  *41,  and duplication. Homozygous or combination of *3,*4, *5, *6, *7, *8, *14, *18, and *21 were classified as a poor metabolizer of CYP2D6; all other genotypes were classified as an extensive metabolizer.

## o Efficacy measures

A bladder diary, noting the number of micturitions/catheterizations events, volume of urine of each micturition or catheterization, urinary urgency and incontinence episodes, was to be completed for 3 consecutive days during the week prior to Visits 2, 3, and 4.

## o Safety measures

Safety parameters included clinical laboratory evaluations, physical examination, vital signs, post-void residual volume (PVR) in subjects who were not performing clean intermittent bladder catheterization (CIC) and the frequency and intensity of AEs were collected according to the Schedule of Activities..

##  Statistical Methods

Four populations were considered:

- o Pharmacokinetic Analysis Sets:
- o the  PK  concentration  population  was  defined  as  all  subjects  randomized  and  treated who had at least 1 concentration during the study.
- o the  PK  parameter  analysis  population  was  defined  as  all  subjects  randomized  and treated who had at least 1 of the PK parameters of primary interest during the study.
- o Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS consisted of all randomized subjects who had taken at least 1 dose of study medication. This was a secondary analysis population. Withdrawn subjects might have been included in these analyses if considered appropriate.
- o Per  Protocol  Analysis  Set  (PPAS):  The  PPAS  consisted  of  all  randomized  subjects  who  have completed the study and who were not serious protocol violators. This was also a secondary analysis population. The PPAS was defined prior to unblinding the study.

## Pharmacokinetic Analysis

The population PK (PPK) modelling approach was used to analyze the plasma concentration-time data for  the  fesoterodine  4  mg  QD  and  8  mg  QD  doses  for  the  estimation  of  PPK  parameters  (apparent systemic  clearance  [CL/F],  Ka,  and  apparent  volumes  of  distribution  [VC/F])  in  paediatric  subjects. Population mean estimates for the PK parameters were obtained by fitting the PK and variance models to  the  whole  data  set  of  all  individuals.  Confidence  intervals  (CIs)  were  computed  for  means  and variances  of  estimates.  Individual  estimates  of  PK  parameters  were  obtained  using  an  empirical Bayesian Estimation Method.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The inter-subject variability was estimated and 95% CIs were reported for all population parameter estimates.  For  the  residual  variability,  various  models  were  fitted,  including  but  not  restricted  to additive and proportional models.

Exploratory analyses were performed to investigate the effect of covariates including, but not limited to,  age,  weight,  CYP2D6  status,  and  sex.  The  PK  parameter  estimates  in  paediatric  subjects  were compared descriptively to those previously obtained in the adult population.

Nonlinear Mixed-Effects Modelling: Modelling PPK analyses were conducted via nonlinear mixed-effects modelling with the NONMEM® software, Version VII (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD). The first-order  conditional  estimation  (FOCE)  method  in  NONMEM  was  employed  for  all model  runs, assuming  that  convergence  was  successful.  If  convergence  was  problematic,  the  first-order  (FO) method was employed.

Base Model: Different structural models such as 1- or 2- compartment PK models for fesoterodine were considered  as  dictated  by  the  data.  In  all  models,  estimation  of  CL/F  and  VC/F  were  of  primary interest.  Model  selection  was  driven  by  the  data  and  based  on  various  goodness  of  fit  indicators, including  comparisons  based  on  the  minimum  objective  function  value  (OFV),  Akaike  Information Criterion (AIC), visual inspection of diagnostic scatter plots and evaluation of estimates of population.

Final Model: The population modelling approach was used to analyze plasma concentration time data for the fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg doses for the estimation of PPK parameters (CL/F, Ka, and VC/F) in paediatric subjects. Population mean estimates for the PK parameters were obtained by fitting the PK and variance models to the whole data set of all individuals. CIs were computed for means and variances of estimates. Using NONMEM, the FO or FOCE methods were employed for all model building. Individual  estimates  of  PK  parameters  were  obtained  using  POSTHOC,  an  empirical  Bayesian Estimation Method.

Assessment of Model Adequacy (Goodness of Fit): The inter-subject variability was estimated and 95% CIs reported for all population parameter estimates. For the residual variability, various models were fitted, including but not restricted to additive and proportional models. Adequacy of model fitting was judged by the objective function, goodness of fit plots and parameter precision estimates.

## Safety analyses

No formal hypothesis testing of safety data was performed. Results from the safety assessments and any AE were presented in tabular and/or graphical format adhering to the Sponsor's standards.

## Exploratory analyses

No formal efficacy evaluations were conducted in this study, although the bladder diary assessment provided exploratory measures of clinical effect.

##  Changes on the conduct of the study / planned analyses

The  protocol,  finalized  10  December  2008,  was  amended  3  times.  The  date  of  the  initiating  of  the study is March 2009. Last subject visit was done on December 2010

-  First amendment (23 November 2009):Change in inclusion criteria: expansion of the age range in Study A0221066 to 8 to 17 years, as long as the patient body weight is above 35 kg.
-  Second amendment (26 May 2010): Change in exclusion criterion 15 to allow participation of subjects  who  are  incapable  of  independent  toileting  or  have  assistance  with  intermittent catheterization.
-  Third amendment (28 July 2010): Change in inclusion criteria: the body weight requirement for inclusion in this study is lowered from 35 kg to 25 kg.

## Changes on the planned analyses:

- o To update the age-range of subjects in the study, in line with the amended protocol.
- o To clarify the derivation of diary endpoints.
- o To clarify how gaps in diary completion were handled.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This amendment was made following the review of unblinded tables (as this was an open label study), however,  all  updates  were  to  provide  further  detail  and  clarification,  and  not  to  change  any  of  the planned analyses.

## Results

##  Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 20 subjects were planned, and 21 subjects were assigned to study treatment and treated (Table S3). Twenty subjects completed the study; 1 subject was no longer willing to participate and discontinued from the study. All enrolled and treated subjects were analyzed for safety.

The primary diagnosis for 10 subjects was idiopathic OAB (hypertonic bladder), with a mean duration since onset of 9.5 years (range 4.3 years to 17.5 years). The primary diagnosis for 11 subjects was neurogenic bladder, with a mean duration since onset of 9.0 years (range 0.6 years to 17.4 years).

Each of the 21 subjects enrolled and treated received at least 1 dose of study medication. Subjects 10051002 and 10111004 were &lt;80%  compliant with study medication. Subject 10051002 discontinued  prior  to  escalation  to  the  8  mg  dose.  Seven  subjects  missed  no  doses  of  study medication, while other subjects missed occasional doses.

##  Pharmacokinetic results

The results excluding the concentrations in the three 17-year-old subjects were evaluated to assess the  influence  of  these  subjects  on  the  overall  interpretation  of  study  results  for  paediatric  subjects across  the  age  range  of  8  years  to  16  years  and  11  months.  As  expected,  based  on  the  mature development stage across this age range, there was no apparent difference in the PK results when the 17-year-old subjects were included in the analysis dataset (Table S5). Based on these findings, it was further decided to include these subjects in the PPK analysis dataset to allow robust modelling of 5HMT population PK.

Abbreviations: CV=coefficient of variation; Min=minimum, Max=maximum; 5-HMT=5-hydroxymethyltolterodine; PK=pharmacokinetic, N=Number of observations (non-missing concentrations) Summary statistics were calculated by setting concentration values below the lower limit of quantification to zero.

The lower limit of quantification is 0.0200 ng/mL.

PK samples were collected at Visit 3 (Week 4) and Visit 4 (Week 8).

Subjects with &lt;80% compliance with dosing, or concentrations with sampling time deviation &gt;20%

from nominal time were excluded for summary statistics; these data were included in Population PK analysis if dosing on 3 days prior to PK sampling was confirmed and accurate PK sampling was recorded.

Two subjects were excluded due to &lt;80% compliance with study drug.

Subjects with NDO did not appear to have any remarkable differences in 5-HMT PK when compared with subjects with idiopathic OAB (Figure 3). Somewhat higher exposures in NDO subjects may have been due to the generally lower body weights in this subject group compared with idiopathic subjects.

PPK analyses were conducted via nonlinear mixed-effects modelling with NONMEM® software; the data were adequately described by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. PPK parameters (CL/F, VC/F) were standardized to a 70 kg person, using the allometric size model. Age and sex were not included as covariates in the final PPK model due to convergence failure and lack of improvement to explain PK variability. Importantly, the available data from this study contained a small number of children with a limited age range.

In  the  PPK  analysis  (Table  S6),  all  PK  parameters,  intersubject´s  variability,  and  residual  variability were  well  estimated  as  reflected  in  reasonable  %  relative  standard  error  (RSE).  Inter-individual variability  in  PK  parameters  calculated  as  the  square  root  of  inter-individual  variance  ( ω 2)  and expressed as % coefficient of variation (CV), ranged from 38% (CL/F) to 43% (VC/F).

The  actual  observed  plasma  concentrations  from  this  study  were  in  agreement  with  the  simulation results,  based  on  the  adult  population  PK  parameters  and  allometric  scaling  of  the  adult  population parameters applied to a distribution of paediatric subjects meeting the age and body weight criteria for this  study,  that  were  used  to  determine  paediatric  doses.  This  agreement  of  the  simulated  and observed concentration value represents an external validation of the model used to predict exposures.

## Pharmacokinetic Modelling Results

PK  modelling  and  simulation  (M&amp;S)  results,  based  on  the  adult  population  PK  parameters  and allometric  scaling  of  the  adult  population  parameters  applied  to  a  distribution  of  paediatric  patients meeting  the  age  and  body  weight  criteria  for  this  study,  were  used  to  determine  paediatric  doses. These  M&amp;S  analyses  predicted  that  following  administration  of  fesoterodine  4  mg  and  8  mg  QD  to children aged 6 to 16 years and &gt;25 kg, exposures would be similar to those in adults given the same doses.

Clinical trial simulation with this study design was performed. Figure 5 shows the projected outcome of 1000 virtual clinical trials (median and 95% prediction intervals) for fesoterodine 4 mg QD followed by fesoterodine  8  mg  QD  doses  in  the  intended  population.  The  actual  observed  5-HMT  plasma concentrations from this study (open circles in Figure 5) were in agreement with the simulation results.

##  Pharmacogenomic results

The CYP2D6 metabolizer status based on genotyping results was classified as poor metabolizer for 1 subject, missing for 2 subjects (due to lack of sample), and extensive or ultra-rapid metabolizer in all others.

##  Safety results

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

There were no deaths, severe adverse events , or permanent withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs) reported. One subject receiving fesoterodine 8 mg QD temporarily discontinued study treatment due to a serious AE (SAE) (Table S7). A total of 8 subjects receiving fesoterodine 4 mg QD and 13 subjects receiving fesoterodine 8 mg QD reported AEs (all causalities).

There was 1 treatment-related SAE: a 15-year-old female subject temporarily discontinued study drug fesoterodine 8 mg QD due to constipation. Study drug was temporarily stopped during hospitalization; the subject recovered and the event resolved. The event was considered an important medical event and related to study drug by the investigator.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Treatment-related AEs were 1 AE each of dry mouth (mild), constipation (moderate), dry eye (mild), and blurred vision (moderate), and 2 AEs each of nausea (mild) and residual urine volume increased (mild).

Post-Void Residual volumes at baseline and following treatment with fesoterodine 4 mg QD and 8 mg QD  doses  in  subjects  not  performing  clean  intermittent  bladder  catheterization  are  summarized  in Table S9.

Treatment-related  AEs  of  the  central  nervous  system,  such  as  behavioural  change,  aggression, drowsiness  or  cognitive  dysfunction  were  not  reported  by  patients  in  this  study.  Intermittent inattentive behaviour was observed on Days 2-5 of treatment with 4 mg fesoterodine in one subject (10111005); the causality of this AE was not deemed treatment-related by the principal investigator as it was consistent with the patients behaviour history.

The  mean  increase  from  baseline  pulse  rate  was  14.6  bpm  (Week  1,  4  hours  post-dose),  4.6  bpm (Week  4,  0  hours  post-dose),  12.4  bpm  (Week  4,  4  hours  post-dose)  during  fesoterodine  4  mg treatment and 8.2 bpm (Week 8, 4 hours post-dose) during fesoterodine 8 mg treatment. The increase did  not  appear  dose-related.  Following  fesoterodine  4  mg,  two subjects  had  pulse  rates  &gt;120  bpm. Patient heart rate will be monitored in the planned paediatric studies with fesoterodine.

There were no ECG abnormalities of clinical significance at Screening or at the end of treatment.

##  Efficacy results

No efficacy evaluations were performed in this study.

Based on feedback from investigators and subjects, and qualitative assessment of usable diary data, the 3-day bladder diaries in this study were deemed feasible and useful for assessing OAB symptoms in paediatric subjects (see Table S4). However, considering the small number of subjects in this study, these results should be interpreted with caution.

## 1. Discussion on clinical aspects

Fesoterodine is indicated for the treatment of the overactive bladder in adults. The use was restricted for children and no pharmacokinetic data for paediatrics were available.

The MAH has submitted the results of a open label study to characterize the pharmacokinetics of 5HMT in children aged to 8-17 years following 4 and 8 mg once-daily regimens, and identify potential covariates  that  could  explain  the  inter-individual  variability  in  5-HMT  pharmacokinetics  in  this paediatric population.

Plasma  concentrations  data  from  21  paediatric  patients  (10  suffering  idiopathic  OAB,  11  with neurogenic  detrusor  overactivity)  from  9  to  17  years  were  collected  and  used  for  a  population pharmacokinetic analysis. The PK of 5-HMT following the administration of fesoterodine once daily to paediatric  patients  were  simulated  using  an  allometric  scaling  method  via  nonlinear  mixed-effects modelling using the final adult population PK parameters. Pediatric patients, aged 8-17 years and body weight &gt;25 kg, representing the population of study A0221066 were used for PK simulations to select paediatric doses.

Results of modelling and simulations predicted that 5-HMT exposures in paediatric patients (aged 1117 years, weighing &gt;35 kg or aged 6-16 years, weighing &gt;25 kg) are within the range of exposures observed in adults given the same doses in Phase 2-3 studies. Patients with NDO did not appear to have  any  remarkable  differences  in  5-HMT  PK  when  compared  with  patients  with  idiopathic  OAB. Somewhat higher exposures were observed in NDO patients, which may be due to the generally lower body weights in this patient group compared with idiopathic patients.

Currently, the wording of the SmPC of fesoterodine reflects the lack of data in paediatric population. No amendment derived from this study is proposed by the MAH in this application.

However, there seems to be two ongoing additional studies in paediatric population: Study A0221047 (safety  and  efficacy  study  in  neurogenic  detrusor  overactive  patients  of  ages  6-16  years  and  body weight &gt;25 Kg) and Study A0221074 in younger and lighter children (&gt;6 yrs of age and &lt;25 Kg). No information regarding these two clinical trials is included  in  the  documentation. Since  the  results  of these two studies could impact the current assessment, the MAH is requested to address this issue, i.e, whether  the  SPC  may  be  updated  with  the  information  already  provided  or  whether  it  should  be preferable to wait for the outcome of these two trials.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In the assessor's view, the results of Study A0221066, although limited, could be of use for prescribers when  a  treatment  with  fesoterodine  is  considered  for  a  paediatric  patient.   Safety  data  and pharmacokinetic  results  of  patients  treated  in  this  study  can  allow  a  better  dose  approach  in  this population. The inclusion of this information in the SmPC (Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties) if appropriate (please see above), should be discussed by the MAH.

## Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

Having assessed the data submitted for this procedure, it is considered that the information provided could be of help for prescribers. Whether it is more appropriate to include the data in this moment in section 5.2 of the SPC or whether it would be preferable to wait for the results of the two ongoing studies related to this procedure should be discussed by the MAH.

Also, a short clinical overview, lacking in the current submission, should be provided by the MAH.

NOTE  FOR  READER'S: After  circulating  PAR,  Pfizer  informed  of  the  following  timelines:  study A0221047 is planned to start 2Q2012 with CSR availability 1Q2014 and Study A0221074 is planned to start  2Q2014  with  CSR  1Q2016.  As  proposed  by  the  EMA  it  is  agreed  that  this  procedure  can  be considered concluded (no additional clarifications are therefore requested) and that the results of the two  remaining  studies  as  well  as  any  potential  update  of  the  SPC  will  be  discussed  in  a  future commitment, once the data are available.
