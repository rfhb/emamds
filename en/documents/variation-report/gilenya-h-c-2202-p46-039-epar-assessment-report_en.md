## 1. Introduction

On 5 th  of August 2021, the MAH submitted a final report of Gilenya study CFTY720D1401 for the 14 pediatric patients that completed this study in Japan, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that CFTY720D1401 is part of a clinical development program.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

Gilenya is already indicated in Europe as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting  Multiple  Sclerosis  for  the  following  groups  of  adult  patients  (since  2011)  and  paediatric patients aged 10 years and older (since 2018) :

-Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy or

-Patients  with  rapidly  evolving  severe  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  defined  by  2  or  more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.

Gilenya is available as capsules of 0.5 mg and 0.25 mg (for pediatric patients ≤ 40 kg) which are taken orally once-daily. Same formulation was used in the present study.

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The MAH submitted a final report for the 14 pediatric MS patients that were included in CFTY720D1401 (hereafter  referred  to  as  D1401).  Data  in  adult  were  not  assessed  since  only  pediatric  data  are concerned in this Preliminary assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of regulation.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Study D1401: a drug use investigation (all-case surveillance) study conducted in Japan

Description

Study D1401 was conducted jointly by Novartis and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, based on the  conditions  for  approval  of  fingolimod  in  Japan.  Study  D1401  was  a  drug  use-results  survey  in Japanese  MS  patients  (all-case  surveillance)  that  started  in  November  2011  when  the  drug  was launched in Japan.

In study D1401, a total 6,765 patients were enrolled. After removing the number of patients with multiple registration before and after hospital transfer, 6,642 patients as the actual number of patients enrolled. It was agreed with Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) that CRFs would be

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

collected from 1,792 patients who started treatment with fingolimod by May 31, 2013. Data from these 1,792 patients were analyzed and reported in the CSR. Of these, there were 14 pediatric MS patients (defined as below 18 years of age at the study participation).

## Methods

## Objective(s)

The primary purpose of the study was to collect and evaluate information on the safety and efficacy of fingolimod in patients with multiple sclerosis under long-term clinical use in Japan

## Study population /Sample size

The  overall  population  was  defined  as  one  consisting  of  patients  whose  CRFs  were  collected.  This population consisted of patients who received Gilenya/Imusera for the first time and patients who had a  history  of  use  of  an  investigational  drug/post-marketing  clinical  study  drug  containing  the  same active ingredient as Gilenya/Imusera.

## Treatments

## Outcomes/endpoints

Efficacy analysis set:

The efficacy analysis set is defined as a population consisting of patients for efficacy analysis in the overall population. No summary/analysis was performed for this population.

## Statistical Methods

N/A

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total 6,765 patients were enrolled. Of these, there were 14 pediatric MS patients (defined as below 18 years of age at the study participation).

## Baseline data

Patients  enrolled  in  the  study  D1401  included  14  pediatric  patients  (3  males  and  11  females)  with RRMS. At treatment initiation, these patients were 12-17 years of age with mean and median age of 15.6  and  16,  respectively  and  a  mean/median  body  weight  of  53.3/50.4  kg  (no  patient  had  a bodyweight &lt;40 kg).

Seven patients completed the study duration of 2 years. The remaining 7 patients discontinued the study due to reasons as reported in the case report form (CRF): Adverse event(s) (2 patients), this includes  lymphocyte  count  decrease  (non-serious)  and  optic  neuritis  (serious),  Lack  of  efficacy  (1 patient), Transferred to another hospital (2 patients) or other (2 patients).

## Efficacy results

## Summary of efficacy results

The following sections present the descriptive data of the key efficacy measures of the survey (Clinical relapse,  Physician's  assessment  of  efficacy  and  Expanded  Disability  Status  Scale  (EDSS))  in  the  14 pediatric patients.

## Annualized relapse rate

Study D1401 was an observational study, hence no confirmation of relapse was conducted and ARR were calculated based on ALL relapses as reported by the investigators. In the 14 pediatric patients, before  the  start  of  treatment  with  fingolimod,  the  annualized  relapse  rate  (ARR)  was  1.93  (95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.33 - 2.81). The ARRs at 12 months and 24 months after treatment with fingolimod were 0.52 (95% CI 0.24 - 1.13) and 0.35 (95% CI 0.17 - 0.71) respectively (Table 6-5).

# Population: patients with relapse assessments before and after treatment with Gilenya/Imusera (incl. rela pse-free patients)

* Including data with umknown relapse dates

The Applicant concluded that due to the very limited number of patients, the observed ARR has a high variation, however the reduction of relapse activity after treatment was overall consistent to what has been observed in the pediatric Phase 3 trial D2311.

## Physician's efficacy evaluations

The study included an efficacy measure of physician's evaluation, which is a comprehensive evaluation of  multiple  sclerosis  symptoms/findings  (considering  recurrence  rate/severity  of  recurrence,  EDSS, neurological findings, MRI findings, etc.) by the physician to categorize the patient as a 'responder' or 'non-responder'  to  fingolimod  treatment.  The  assessment  was  performed  at  the  time  points  of  6 months, 12 months, 24 months and last observation after treatment with fingolimod.

Of the 14 pediatric patients, 10, 9 and 8 patients at Months 6, 12 and 24 respectively, were assessed as 'responders'. At Months 6, four patients were categorized as 'not assessable'. No non-responders were identified at any time point (please refer to Table 6-6).

The physician subjectively determines responders/non-responders based on the evaluation of multiple sclerosis symptoms/finding. In addition, \"not assessable\" was provided as an option in the Case Report Fonm (CRF).

The evaluation infonmation at Month 24 descnibes infonmation from Month12 to 24 months

## EDSS

The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) evaluations were performed at the start of treatment with Gilenya/Imusera,  every  3  months  after  the  start  of  treatment  with  Gilenya/Imusera  and  treatment discontinuation based on expanded disability statuses of MS observed within routine care.

Of the 8 pediatric patients for whom this assessment is available at the start of treatment, the mean EDSS  score  was  2.06  (median  1.75,  minimum  0  and  maximum  5.5),  the  average  EDSS  score throughout the survey remained in the range of 0.92 - 1.44 with fingolimod treatment. Of note, the number of patients with available data is very low; however, there is no trend of worsening in EDSS over time (Table 6-7).

Overall,  data  collected  from  these  limited  number  of  pediatric  patients,  in  an  observational  setting, showed results consistent  with  the  known  benefits  of  fingolimod  in  this  population  according  to  the applicant.

# Population: patients with data at the start and at least one data after the start of treatment with Gilenya/I musera

## CHMP comments:

This drug used study (CFTY720D1401 or D1401) was conducted only in Japan. This study is submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006 and therefore only paediatric  patients  are  considered.  14  paediatric  patients  were  included  (3  males  and  11 females) with RRMS. All these patients were between 12 and 17 year old at initiation. They were all with a body weight &gt; 50 kg and were treated at the dose of 0,5 mg/day.

Study  D1401  was  an  observational  study.  Some  efficacy  parameters  were  collected  at  6 months, 1 year, 2 years from the start of treatment with fingolimod: relapse rate, EDSS, MRI findings.

7/14 patients completed the study duration of 2 years. Reasons of discontinuation for the 7 other patients were: Adverse event(s) (2 patients: this includes lymphocyte count decrease (non-serious)  and  optic  neuritis  (serious),  Lack  of  efficacy  (1  patient),  Transferred  to another hospital (2 patients) or other (2 patients). Of note, 9 patients were treated during one year.

These  data  are  informative  only,  it  is  difficult  to  conclude  anything  regarding  efficacy considering the very limited number of Japanese patients and the design of the study e.g. open with no comparative arm.

Overall  these  very  limited  data  are  consistent  with  efficacy  results  of  the  pivotal  study  in paediatric  patients  more  than  12  year-old  and  with  a  body  weight  &gt;  50  kg  (PARADIGMS D2311) on MS relapse.

## Safety results

The median exposure for these 14 patients was 626.5 days, the mean (min, max) exposure was 482.6 (21, 720) days, 9 and 6 patients have exposure for at least 1 and 2 years, respectively.

## Adverse events

8/14  pediatric  patients  reported  at  least  one  adverse  event.  The  most  frequently  affected  System organ  class  (SOCs)  were  Investigations  (4  (28.6%)  patients)  and  Nervous  system  disorders  (4 (28.6%) patients) followed by respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (3 (21.4%) patients).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Serious adverse events

Three  of  the  14  patients  experienced  SAEs.  Two  patients  reported  SAEs  under  the  SOC  of  nervous system disorders (preferred Term (PT) of Multiple sclerosis and Optic neuritis, respectively), 1 patient reported SAEs under the SOC of Investigations (PT Lymphocytes count decreased) (Table 6-10).

| -Total                                      | 2 ( 14.3)           |
| Multiple sclerosis relapse                  | 1( 7.1)             |
| Optic neuritis                              | 1( 7.1)             |

There were no deaths reported in this group of 14 pediatric patients.

## CHMP comments:

Analysis of PTs by SOC of adverse effects reported in the 14 pediatric patients retrieves mainly central nervous  system  adverse  effects,  non-serious  investigations  AE,  mainly  decreased  lymphocytes, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders.

The reported adverse events are consistent with the EU SmPC and the RMP of fingolimod.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

This drug used study (CFTY720D1401 or D1401) was conducted only in Japan. This study is submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006 and therefore only paediatric patients are considered. 14 paediatric patients were included (3 males and 11 females) with RRMS. All these patients were between 12 and 17 year old at initiation. They were all with a body weight &gt; 50 kg and were treated at the dose of 0,5 mg/day.

Study D1401 was an observational study. Some efficacy parameters were collected at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years from the start of treatment with fingolimod: relapse rate, EDSS, MRI findings.

7/14 patients completed the study duration of 2 years. 9 patients were treated during one year.

Considering the very limited number of Japanese patients and the design of the study e.g.  open study with no comparative arm, it is difficult to conclude anything regarding efficacy considering.

Overall these very limited data are consistent with efficacy and safety results of the pivotal study in paediatric patients (PARADIGMS) on MS relapse.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To remember, D2311 study enrolled patients from 10 to 18 years old. The number of patients aged 10-12 years, with a weight &lt;40 kg and / or pre-pubertal (&lt;2 Tanner stage scoring) enrolled in this study was underrepresented.  Further long term safety data was requested especially in this specific population. No new information was reported in this D1401 study since the 14 patients were more than 12-year-old and &gt; 40 kg.

## 3. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

This Japanese open drug use study is submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006 and therefore only paediatric patients are considered. 14 MS paediatric patients were included: these patients were between 12 and 17 year old at initiation with a body weight &gt; 50 kg and were treated at the dose of 0,5 mg/day. 7/14 patients completed the study duration of 2 years. 9 patients were treated during one year. Data are therefore limited.  No  new  information  was  reported  regarding  the  14  patients  observation  in  this  drug  use study.

The benefit/risk balance of Gilenya remains positive in the approved indications.
