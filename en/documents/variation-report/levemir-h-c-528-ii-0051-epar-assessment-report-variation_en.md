## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

Insulin detemir (Levemir) received marketing authorisation from the European Commission on 1 June 2004 and by the Food and Drug Agency (FDA) on 16 June 2005, and has since been marketed in more than 60 countries worldwide. It was originally approved for use in the treatment of diabetes mellitus as a  long-acting  basal  insulin  in  combination  with  meal-related  insulin  and  subsequently  also  in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs. Insulin detemir is to be administered s.c. once or twice daily, and the dose is to be adjusted individually, depending on the subjects' needs.

In the EU, the indication was subsequently extended to include paediatric subjects ≥ 6 years of age on 29  March  2005  (Commission  Decision)  based  on  the  results  of  a  confirmatory  clinical  efficacy  and safety trial in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years (NN304-1379).

In the US, Levemir was initially approved for once- or twice-daily subcutaneous administration for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who require basal (long acting) insulin for the control of hyperglycaemia. As with the EU label, the indication for paediatric subjects between ages 6-17 years was also based on clinical trial NN304-1379.

The paediatric clinical development programme for the use of insulin detemir consists of four trials: One completed clinical pharmacology trial (NN304-1222), one completed phase 3a clinical efficacy and safety trial (NN304-1379), one completed phase 3b clinical efficacy and safety trial (NN304-1689) and a phase 3b clinical efficacy and safety trial (NN304-1690), which is an extension trial to Trial NN3041689.

The  long-term  safety  trial  (NN304-1689)  was  performed  with  children  and  adolescents  with  type  1 diabetes  to  investigate  the  long-term  safety  of  the  product  in  paediatric  subjects  including  the development of insulin antibodies in children during at least 52 weeks of treatment. Since the time for peaking of insulin antibodies in children was not known, an extension trial of a further 52 weeks (Trial NN304-1690) was performed. Children with Type 1 diabetes in the insulin detemir treatment group were followed for the development in insulin antibodies for a total of 104 weeks of treatment.

The present application for extension of the indication to include children 2-5 years of age is based on these  2  trials  NN304-1689  and  NN304-1690.  The  studies  were  discussed  with  the  EMA  through scientific  advice  as  part  of  a  post-approval  commitment.  Consequently,  both  trials  have  been submitted as part of a FUM and the paediatric article 46, where the Agency has assessed the trials and found  them  adequate  to  fulfill  the  FUM.  In  addition,  the  2  trials  are  included  in  the  PIP  that  was approved by PDCO and verified for compliance.

The application implies changes in section 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SPC, a minor change in the RMP and changes in section 1 and 3 of the Package leaflet.

The variation submitted is the following:

Extension of indication for the use of Levemir in children aged 2-5 years affecting sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC. Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Also Annex II has been updated to reflect new version number of the Risk Management Plan.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA decision P/269/2010 for the following conditions:

-  Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
-  Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

On the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

The PIP is not yet completed.

## 1.2. Clinical pharmacology

No new data.

## Discussion on clinical pharmacology

PK and PD data in the population below six years are needed, as agreed on with the PDCO. Study NN1250-3561,  a  6  +  6  months  multi-national,  open-label,  randomised  trial  to  investigate  (among other  objectives)  the  pharmacokinetics  of  insulin  detemir  in  different  age  groups  using  a  sparse sampling approach and population PK modelling will be performed. Results are awaited.

## 1.3.2. Main studies

Trial  NN304-1689 was  a  52-week  open-label  randomised,  multi-national,  controlled  trial  designed both to confirm the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir treatment in children and adolescents aged 216  years  diagnosed  with  type  1  diabetes,  and  to  evaluate  the  potential  effects  of  long-term  insulin antibody development. Young children aged 2-5 years were included in this long-term trial in order to obtain  clinical  data  in  this  age  group.  Subjects  were  treated  with  either  insulin  detemir  or  Neutral Protamine  Hagedorn  (NPH)  insulin  in a basal-bolus regimen  with rapid acting insulin aspart (NovoRapid)  at  meals.  Parameters  were  both  efficacy  (glycaemic  control)  and  safety  including development of insulin antibodies. The trial included 10 visits at the clinical trial site.

Trial  NN304-1690 was an open-label, multi-national, multi-centre, single arm, 52-week extension of Trial NN304-1689 of insulin detemir administered once or twice daily to children and adolescents (3-17 years)  diagnosed  with  type  1  diabetes.  At  entry  to  this  trial  the  subjects  had  finalised  52-week treatment with insulin detemir in NN304-1689. Subjects treated with NPH insulin in Trial NN304-1689 were  not  offered  to  continue  in  the  extension,  due  to  the  fact  that  the  primary  endpoint  of  the extension trial was to study the development of insulin detemir-insulin aspart cross-reacting antibodies following  a  104-week  period  (52  weeks  in  NN304-1689  and  52  weeks  in  NN304-1690)  of  insulin detemir  treatment.  All  subjects  in  the  insulin  detemir  arm  who  continued  their  insulin  detemir treatment also received insulin aspart as bolus insulin before main meals and larger snacks. The key

efficacy and safety parameters were the same as in Trial NN304-1689. The trial included a total of 5 visits to the clinical trial sites, of which the first was at the same time as the last visit in Trial NN3041689.

## Treatments

Insulin detemir or NPH insulin were to be administered once or twice daily at the same time as the basal  insulin  was  given  prior  to  randomisation.  The  insulin  detemir  and  NPH  insulin  injections administered s.c. in the thigh using the NovoPenJunior Green injection device. The injection area was to  remain  unchanged  throughout  the  trial  even  if  a  single  dose  was  delivered  as  more  than  one injection.  Subjects  were  instructed  to  rotate  the  site  of  injection  within  the  area  chosen  in  order  to prevent lipohypertrophy. Subjects on a previous once-daily basal insulin regimen were to continue on a once-daily regimen. Likewise, subjects on previous twice-daily or more frequent basal insulin regimens were to continue on a twice-daily regimen. However, subjects were permitted to switch from a oncedaily  to  a  twice-daily  regimen  (and  vice  versa)  based  on  the  investigators'  judgement  in  relation  to titration targets.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All  subjects  received  insulin  aspart  as  bolus  insulin  immediately  before  or  after  main  meals.  Insulin aspart was administered s.c. in the abdomen preprandially 2-4 times a day, in connection with main meals using the NovoPenJunior Yellow injection device. Extra doses were permitted in connection with larger snacks. Subjects taking bolus insulin postprandially before randomisation were to continue to do so. All subjects were switched from their previous insulin regimen to randomly allocated trial treatment with insulin detemir or NPH insulin on a unit-to-unit basis. If subjects were on a mixed insulin regimen (once or twice daily), the corresponding basal insulin dose was calculated and used as the initial dose. If mixed insulin was used three times daily, the basal component was calculated, and the equivalent dose was administered as one third in the morning and two thirds in the evening.

All  subjects  were  to  be  individually  titrated  on  a  continual  basis  according  to  pre-specified  plasma glucose  (PG)  targets  adopted  from  the  International  Society  for  Paediatric  and  Adolescent  Diabetes (ISPAD) Guidelines (see Table below).

PG: plasma glucose

## Comparator:

In Trial N304-1689, NPH insulin was chosen as the comparator because it is conventionally used as basal insulin in children and adolescents on a basal-bolus regimen, and because NPH insulin has a well established  efficacy  and  safety  profile.  As  one  of  the  secondary  objectives  of  this  trial  was  to investigate antibody development during long-term treatment, a comparator with a well-known safety profile was considered important. No comparator was included in NN304-1690 as only insulin detemir treated subjects were offered to continue in the extension trial.

In  both  Trial  NN304-1689  and  NN304-1690 insulin  aspart  was  chosen  as  the  bolus  component  of a basal-bolus regimen. The rapid-acting property of insulin aspart is a particular advantage in this trial population  due  to  a  more  variable  and  unpredictable  life  style  pattern  in  children  and  adolescents. Furthermore, insulin detemir is most likely to be used together with a fast-acting insulin analogue in clinical practice.

The  algorithm  used  for  basal  insulin  doses  is  shown  in  Table  below  and  indicates  the  suggested increase  in  the  basal  insulin  dose  based  on  the  average  of  the  three  PG  values  measured  before breakfast and dinner. If a subject had only measured PG values on 2 of the last 3 days prior to the contact, titration of the basal insulin dose was to be based on these values. If only one measurement was available, this was used to assess the need for insulin dose adjustment at the discretion of the investigator. The algorithm was only to be used if there had been no major hypoglycaemic episodes and/or PG values ≤ 4.0 mmol/L ( ≤ 72 mg/dL) without obvious explanations between two consecutive contacts.

## Sample size

The primary objective of Trial NN304-1689 was to confirm efficacy of insulin detemir in combination insulin aspart in terms of glycaemic control. This was done by showing that insulin detemir + insulin aspart is non-inferior to NPH + insulin aspart in terms of glucose lowering effect as assessed by mean change from baseline in HbA1c after 52 weeks of treatment using a non-inferiority margin of 0.4% (absolute). Sample size was determined based on this primary objective.

The non-inferiority margin of 0.4% (absolute) was chosen in accordance with the FDA guidance. Let D be the mean treatment difference for change in HbA1c (insulin detemir + insulin aspart minus NPH + insulin aspart). The null-hypothesis was tested against the alternative hypothesis of noninferiority as given by H0: D &gt; 0.4% against HA: D ≤ 0.4%

Operationally  the  null-hypothesis  was  rejected  and  non-inferiority  considered  confirmed  if  the  upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the mean HbA1c treatment difference was below or equal to 0.4%. This is equivalent to using a one-sided test of size 2.5%.

Sample size is determined using a t-statistic under the assumption of a one-sided test of size 2.5% and a zero mean treatment difference (i.e. D=0%). Based on experience from previous insulin detemir trial  with  children  and  adolescents  (aged  6-17  years)  a  conservative  estimate  for  the  standard deviation (SD) of 1.1% for HbA1c was used in the sample size calculation.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

As NN304-1689 is a non-inferiority trial sample size was determined such that the anticipated power is at least 85% in the evaluation of the PP analysis set. The number of subjects excluded from the PP analysis set is dependent on the trial design. In this trial an estimate of 20% was used and sample size was ceiled in the FAS to have integer sample size for each group that adheres exactly to the group allocation  weights  (1:1).  Hence  the  total  number  of  subjects  to  be  randomised  was  344  subjects  in order to have at least 85% power in the evaluation of the PP analysis set.

A total sample size of 344 subjects and a drop-out rate of 20% would yield 274 subjects for evaluation of HbA1c. No separate sample size was calculated for young children between 2-5 years, since it was considered very difficult to include enough young children in the trial to have sufficient statistical power for statistical analysis, due to the low prevalence of diabetes in young children below 6 years.

Since  the  primary  endpoint  in  Trial  NN304-1690  was  a  safety  endpoint,  only  secondary  efficacy endpoints were included in this trial. The secondary efficacy endpoints in this trial were HbA1c and FPG at end of the trial (after 104 weeks of treatment). As NN304-1690 was an extension to trial NN3041689,  no  sample  size  calculation  has  been  made  for  this  trial.  However,  assuming  that  120  were treated with insulin detemir in the trial with a drop out rate of 15%, it would be possible to detect, with more  than  80%  power,  a  slope  of  0.06  in  cross-reacting  antibody  reduction  over  time  at  a  5% significance level. Standard deviation for the cross-reacting antibody measurements was estimated to 23%.

## Efficacy Analysis Sets

In Trial NN304-1689 two efficacy analysis sets were defined:

1. Full  analysis  set  (FAS)  implemented  according  to  the  intention  to  treat  principle,  used  for efficacy analyses: All randomised subjects exposed to at least one dose of trial product with a post baseline observation, classified according to randomised treatment.
2. Per-protocol analysis set (PP): All exposed  subjects who  completed  the  trial without significantly violating the inclusion/exclusion criteria or other aspects of the protocol considered to  potentially  affect  the  efficacy  results  and  who  fulfilled  the  prespecified  criteria  for  being included in the PP analysis set.

The primary efficacy analysis was based on both the FAS and the PP analysis set. All secondary efficacy analyses were based on the FAS.

In Trial NN304-1690 one efficacy analysis set was defined:

-  Full analysis set (FAS , NN304-1690) implemented according to the intention to treat principle. The FAS is normally defined as all randomised subjects exposed to at least one dose of trial product with a post observation, classified according to randomised treatment. In Trial NN3041690, the specific definition of FAS is different, since the subjects are not randomised, namely subjects with signed informed consent who are exposed to trial drug in the extension period. Since the NN304-1690 trial is an extension to the NN304-1689 trial, the FAS in NN304-1690 is a subset of the FAS in NN304-1689.

## Results

## Subject Disposition

A total of 381 children and adolescents were screened for inclusion in NN304-1689 (see figure below). Thirty-three  of  these  were  excluded  because  of  failure  to  meet  all  the  selection  criteria.  The  main reason for exclusion was failure to meet the inclusion criterion of HbA1c ≤ 11%.

## Subject disposition for Trial NN304-1689 and Extension Trial NN304-1690

In total, 348 children and adolescents were enrolled in the trial and randomly allocated to treatment with either insulin detemir or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, in a basal-bolus regimen with insulin aspart as the bolus insulin. One subject allocated to the NPH insulin treatment arm withdrew consent prior to initiating treatment. Thus, 347 subjects were exposed to trial products and therefore included in the FAS. Both the proportion of subjects withdrawn and reasons for withdrawal were similar in  the  two  treatment  arms.  The  primary  reason  for  withdrawal  in  both  treatment  arms  was  'other' which included unspecified unwillingness to continue (14 subjects).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The proportion of subjects completing the trial was similar with both treatments, as was the proportion of subjects who completed the trial without significantly deviating from the protocol in ways that could potentially affect the efficacy results (i.e., the PP analysis set).

In  total  146  out  of  164  insulin  detemir  treated  subjects,  who  completed  Trial  NN304-1689,  were included in Trial NN304-1690. Only subjects who were treated with insulin detemir in Trial NN304-1689 were offered participation in the extension Trial NN304-1690. The majority of the 18 subjects who did not wish to participate in Trial NN304-1690 were in the age group 6-12 years.

The subjects were distributed between the three age groups with 37 young children (2-5 years), 59 children (6-12 years) and 50 adolescents (13-16 years).

Five subjects were withdrawn during the extension trial NN304-1690, of these one subject from the 25  years  age  group  (other  reasons:  Parents  decision),  one  subject  from  the  6-12  years  age  group (inefficient therapy) and three subjects from the 13-16 years age group (non-compliance). No subjects were withdrawn from the extension trial due to adverse events.

## Primary Endpoint - HbA1c, End of Trial

The primary objective in Trial NN304-1689 was to compare the glycaemic control after 12 months of treatment  with  insulin  detemir  or  NPH  insulin  administered  once  or  twice  daily  in  combination  with mealtime  insulin  aspart  in  children  and  adolescents  with  type  1  diabetes.Treatment  with  insulin detemir was shown to be non-inferior to NPH insulin as measured by HbA1c after 52 weeks. The upper confidence  interval  for  the  estimated  treatment  differences  in  HbA1c  was  less  than  the  prespecified criterion of 0.4%. The estimated mean absolute change in HbA1c was 0.34% with insulin detemir and 0.22% with NPH insulin, Table below. These results were consistent with the corresponding analysis for the PP analysis set.

Mean  HbA1c  increased  over  52  weeks  in  both  treatment  arms,  Figure  below.  Although  HbA1c decreased initially with NPH insulin over the first 12 weeks of treatment, the mean level was similar to that with insulin detemir after 52 weeks. The initial decrease in HbA1c in the NPH insulin treatment arm observed over the first 12 weeks of treatment was not sustained. Similar observations were made for the PP analysis set.

The slight increase in HbA1c observed with both insulin detemir and NPH insulin described for the total group  is  largely  attributable  to  suboptimal  glycaemic  control  in  the  subgroup  of  adolescents  (13-16 years). The figure below shows the mean HbA1c over time for age-group 2-5 years (full analysis set):

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

<!-- image -->

As for subjects who continued insulin detemir treatment in the extension trial NN304-1690 for a total of  104  weeks,  glycaemic  control  measured  as  mean  HbA1c  was  relatively  stable  during  the  whole treatment period with a slight increase in observed mean HbA1c from 8.4% at baseline of Trial NN3041689 to 8.7% by the end of Trial NN304-1690.  Mean HbA1c was lowest for the young children (2-5 year)  and  highest  for  the  adolescents  (13-16  year)  throughout  the  whole  treatment  period  of  104 weeks.

## Secondary Endpoint - Fasting Plasma Glucose

Mean FPG varied over time for all age groups and treatment. There was a consistent trend towards lower mean FPG values after 52 weeks with insulin detemir compared to NPH insulin in all three age groups.

When looking at mean FPG for the insulin detemir group throughout the whole treatment period of 104 weeks,  mean FPG was highest for the children  (6-12  year),  whereas  mean  FPG  was  lowest  for  the young children (2-5 year) except at end of trial where mean FPG for subjects in the young children was similar to the mean FPG for the total group and lowest for the adolescents (13-16 year).

## Secondary Endpoint - Nine-point Self-measured Plasma Glucose Profiles by Age Groups

The mean 9-point SMPG profiles appeared similar after 52 weeks of treatment with insulin detemir or NPH insulin.  The  mean  pre-breakfast  SMPG  level  at  the  end  of  the  profile  tended  to  be  lower  with insulin detemir than with NPH insulin in young children aged 2-5 years Figure below, but this trend was not evident in older children or adolescents.

## Secondary Endpoint - Nocturnal Self-measured Plasma Glucose

Although there were some differences between treatments over time, particularly in young children (25 years) and children (6-12 years), mean nocturnal SMPG levels remained similar to baseline after 52 weeks with insulin detemir.

## Target Plasma Glucose by Age Groups

Based on the latest 9-point SMPG profile in the trial, the proportion of subjects who achieved the target pre-breakfast and pre-dinner plasma glucose concentration of 4.0-7.0 mmol/L (72-126 mg/dL) and the nocturnal plasma glucose concentration of ≥ 3.6 mmol/L ( ≥ 65 mg/dL) after 52 weeks is shown in Table  below.  The  percentage  of  subjects  reaching  the  targets  varied  somewhat  between  the  age groups,  but  in  general,  young  children  aged  2-5  years  and  children  aged  6-12  years  were  more successful at achieving the target pre-breakfast PG values with insulin detemir than with NPH insulin after 52 weeks, whereas more subjects treated with NPH insulin reached pre-dinner target.

FAS: Full analysis set; PG: Plasma glucose

With regard to the target plasma glucose values after 104 weeks of treatment 45.9% of the subjects in the youngest age-group reached the pre-breakfast plasma glucose target, whereas approximately one third  of  the  children  and  adolescents  reached  the  pre-breakfast  and  approximately  one  third  of  all subjects reached the pre-dinner SMPG targets of plasma glucose levels between 4.0 and 7.0 mmol/L. Between 6.8% and 14% of the subjects in the three age groups reached both plasma glucose targets.

## Results analysed by sex

The overall observed mean change in HbA1c from baseline to 52 weeks differed slightly for boys and girls  in  both  treatment  groups:  females  0.10  (SD  1.18),  males  0.35  (SD  1.37).  By  the  end  of  104 weeks of treatment the change in mean HbA1c for insulin detemir treated girls was 0.33% and 0.40% for insulin detemir treated boys.

## Dose Development by Age Group

The development of mean daily basal insulin doses for the young children (2-5 years), the children (612 years) and adolescents (13-16 years) was generally consistent with that observed with the total group.

## Discussion on efficacy

The persistence of efficacy in young children, children and adolescents was evaluated over a period of 52 weeks in Trial NN304-1689 and for a subset of insulin detemir treated children over a period of 104 weeks in Trial NN304-1690.

The trial NN304-1689 populations in the two treatment arms were generally well matched, with the exception of differences for sex and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). The proportion of girls allocated to insulin detemir (53%) was higher than in the NPH insulin treatment arm (43%) - and this was true for all  age  groups. Also, a slightly lower mean FPG was reported at baseline in the insulin detemir arm (8.36 mmol/L) compared with the NPH insulin arm (8.70 mmol/L). Both of these imbalances might be 'favourable' for the detemir treatment evaluation; however it is shown to be without significance.

The subjects included in the extension study NN304-1690 did not differ significantly with regard to any of the baseline characteristics from the population in the detemir arm of study NN304-1689. A higher percentage of girls was included in the two lowest age groups (young children 2-5 years and children 6-12 years), while the opposite was observed for adolescents 13-16 years).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Mean HbA1c developed similarly in both treatment arms, increasing slightly from 8.4% to 8.5-8.6% by the  end  of  52  weeks  of  treatment.  For  subjects  treated  with  insulin  detemir  mean  HbA1c  remained relatively stable during the additional 52 weeks of treatment. By the end of 104 weeks of treatment mean HbA1c in the insulin detemir arm was 8.7%. When entering the extension period, HbA1c was lower for the young children (8.15%) than for the children (8.52%) and adolescents (8.93%).

Mean daily basal and bolus insulin doses were similar with insulin detemir treatment and NPH insulin treatment throughout the trial. Mean daily doses of insulin detemir and NPH insulin increased most markedly during the first 12 weeks of treatment, possibly reflecting dose titration at the beginning of the trial. The mean daily basal insulin doses continued to increase at a lower but steady rate for the remaining 40 weeks of the trial. This might be related to the normal growth of the children.

In both detemir and NPH insulin treatment groups, HbA1c levels increased during the 52 weeks of the study.  Detemir  was  non-inferior  to  NPH  insulin  in  HbA1c  values,  using  a    non-inferiority  margin  of 0.4%. Numerically, the HbA1c values were lower in the NPH insulin group, compared to the detemir treatment group. The efficacy of insulin detemir in the young age subset of 2-5 years was comparable with the total group (including young children). In this subgroup, insulin detemir showed numerically lower HbA1c levels over time in comparison with NPH insulin group.

In Study NN304-1689 the secondary endpoint FPG in the detemir group was similar to the FPG in the NPH insulin group. In young subject, age 2-5 years old, the same trend was seen in FPG-values.

In Study NN304-1689 the secondary endpoint 9-point SMPG in the detemir group was similar to the 9point SMPG in the NPH insulin group. In the young subject group, age 2-5 years old, the same trend was seen in 9-point SMPG profiles.

There were no evident differences in the overall persistence of efficacy among the three age groups, and no notable differences in insulin dosing or HbA1c development between insulin detemir and NPH insulin  for  young  children  (2-5  years),  children  (6-12  years)  or  adolescents  (13-16  years).  Similarly when looking at HbA1c and insulin dosing for the insulin detemir treated subjects of 104 weeks overall persistence of efficacy was preserved in all three age groups . No statistical tests were performed due to the relatively small number of subjects in the subpopulations.

## 1.4. Clinical safety

In this efficacy and safety Trial NN304-1689 347 patients were included, eligible subjects were insulin detemir naïve, 2-16 years of age and diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for a minimum of 12 months prior to inclusion in this trial. Furthermore, the subjects were to have a total daily insulin dose ≤ 2.00 units (U)/kg and the screening HbA1c was to be ≤ 11%. Criteria set for maximum BMI correlated to age  were  to  be  fulfilled.  Subjects  with  clinically  significant  concomitant  diseases,  including  impaired renal and hepatic function, were not to be included in this trial. Since a stable diabetes treatment for at least 1 year was wanted in this trial, children below the age of 2 years were not included. Since Trial NN304-1689, plus the extension trial (Trial NN304-1690) were to run for a total of 2 years, subjects above 16 years were excluded to avoid having adult subjects in the trial.

The  key  safety  parameters  were  insulin  antibodies,  incidence  of  hypoglycaemia,  standard  deviation (SD) score for weight, adverse events (AEs), incidence of ketoacidosis requiring hospitalisation, safety laboratory parameters and insulin dose. Trial NN304-1689 included a total of 10 visits to the clinical trial  sites  and  8  telephone  contacts  during  the  treatment  period.  At  the  final  visit,  subjects  in  the insulin detemir treatment arm were offered to continue in the 52-week extension efficacy and safety trial  in  which  the  treatment  and  the  key  efficacy  and  safety  parameters  were  the  same  as  in  Trial NN304-1689. The trial included a total of 5 visits to the clinical trial sites, of which the first was at the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

same time as the  last  visit  in  Trial  NN304-1689.  Safety  surveillance  was  performed  on  an  ongoing basis by an internal safety committee in Novo Nordisk A/S, headed by Global Safety.

## 1.4.1. Patient exposure

In Trial NN304-1689 the number of subject years of exposure and the mean number of treatment days were similar in the two treatment groups for the total group as well as for the three age subgroups (see table below).

## Insulin dose

The ratio of insulin detemir/NPH insulin mean daily insulin doses at end of trial was close to 1 for both basal and bolus insulin, meaning that mean doses were similar in the two treatment groups.

Mean  daily  insulin  detemir  doses  per  kg  body  weight  continued  to  increase  throughout  the  whole treatment period, whereas the mean daily insulin aspart doses were relatively stable throughout the trial.

## 1.4.2. Adverse events

In Trial NN304-1689 the overall percentage of subjects with events and the event rates of all AEs and of non-serious AEs were similar in the two treatment groups, while the percent of subjects with events and the event rate (events per 100 years of exposure) of SAEs were lower with insulin detemir (8% and 9.5, respectively) than with NPH insulin (12% and 14.7, respectively). Few of the AEs in either treatment group were severe, and the event rate of severe AEs was lower with insulin detemir (4.2)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

than with NPH insulin (9.2). The event rate of AEs possibly or probably related to trial product was similar in the two treatment groups.

Throughout the whole treatment period of 104 weeks, 116 (79.5%) of the 146 subjects experienced 714 AEs and 12 (8.2%) subjects experienced 17 SAE; 4 of the SAEs were assessed as being possible or probable related to insulin detemir and 1 SAE as being probable related to insulin aspart. No SAEs were assessed as possible for insulin aspart.

In the age groups 2-5 years and 13-16 years the rate of AEs per 100 years of exposure with insulin detemir (294.9 and 207.0, respectively) was lower than with NPH insulin (432.4 and 357.2), while the rate of AEs was higher with insulin detemir (412.4) than with NPH insulin (286.5) in the age group 612 years. For subjects continuing insulin detemir treatment in the extension trial NN304-1690 the rate of  AEs  were  also  higher  in  the  young  children  and  children  age  subgroups  (243.1  and  325.9, respectively) than in the adolescent age subgroup (155.4).

Table below shows that injection site disorders, skin disorders and metabolic disorders were the most frequently reported AEs considered possibly or probably related to basal insulin with more injection site erythema in the insulin detemir group and more hypoglycaemia in the NPH insulin group. The display of AE by relation to basal insulin was similar for subjects continuing insulin detemir treatment in the extension Trial NN304-1690 for up to 104 weeks.

The most common SAEs were within infections, gastrointestinal disorders and metabolic disorders in both treatment groups and age subgroups.

No deaths were reported in any of the 2 trials.

## Body weight

In  Trial  NN304-1689 the mean change in body weight from baseline to 52 weeks of treatment was lower with insulin detemir (3.2 kg) than with NPH insulin (4.1 kg).

To be able to compare weight between the two treatment groups in the various age groups of children, weight  SD  scores  were  used.  The  SD  score  is  a  standardisation  by  age  and  sex  of  a  reference population to show the variation of a measured value from the mean value of the reference population for the relevant age and sex. An SD score of '0' represents the mean value for the relevant age group of the chosen reference population, and a score of '-2' represents a value being 2 SDs below the mean value for the relevant age group of the chosen reference population.

The  weight  SD  score  was  planned  to  be  based  on  local  standard  growth  curves,  since  there  are differences between the participating countries in the trial, but in several countries, these data were not available to use for this purpose. The central derivation of the SD scores based on standard growth curves from the UK is therefore an approximation with a certain amount of uncertainty included.

SAS:Safety analysis set

The mean change in weight SD score from baseline to 52 weeks of treatment was -0.07 with insulin detemir and 0.07 with NPH insulin. This means that the mean weight with insulin detemir decreased towards the standard mean value, while the mean weight with NPH insulin increased during the trial.

As for subjects treated with insulin detemir continuing treatment for 104 weeks the mean body weight increased 6.8 kg from baseline (Visit 2) and the mean change in weight SD score from baseline to 104 weeks was -0.07.

Of the subjects continuing insulin detemir treatment for 104 weeks, 99.3% experienced one or more hypoglycaemic  episodes.  In  total  16074  hypoglycaemic  episodes,  corresponding  to  a  rate  of  55.6 episodes  per  exposure  year,  were  reported  during  the  whole  insulin  detemir  treatment  period.  The majority of the hypoglycaemic episodes occurred during the day (diurnal) and were mild in severity or were biochemical hypoglycaemic episodes (PG&lt;3.6mmol/L with no signs or symptoms). A total of 6 subjects reported 7 severe hypoglycaemic episodes of which 4 were nocturnal events:

Young children: Two severe hypoglycaemic episodes in two subjects: Subject 202002 experienced one severe  event  of  hypoglycaemic  unconsciousness  after  545  days  of  treatment.  Subject  352010 experienced  one  nocturnal  event  of  severe  hypoglycaemic  unconsciousness  after  406  days  of treatment.

Children:  Two  severe  hypoglycaemic  episodes  in  two  subjects:  Subject  152002  experienced  one nocturnal event of severe hypoglycaemia after 459 days of treatment and Subject 603007 experienced one event of severe hypoglycaemia after 63 days of treatment.

Adolescents: Three severe hypoglycaemic episodes in two subjects: Subject 403006 experienced two nocturnal  events  of  severe  hypoglycaemia  after  493  and  503  days  treatment.  Both  events  were reported  as  SAEs  and  assessed  as  being  possibly  related  to  insulin  detemir  and  unlikely  related  to insulin  aspart  treatment.  The  subject  recovered  from  the  events  on  the  same  day.  Subject  301005 experienced one event of severe hypoglycaemia after 250 days of treatment.

The rate of hypoglycaemic episodes was lower with insulin detemir than with NPH insulin in all three age subgroups, Table below.

N: Number of subjects; e: Fezcentage of subjects; E: Number of events; R: Events per 1o0 exposure years; Sas: Bafety analysis set

The number of treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes for subjects treated with insulin detemir for 104 weeks, were slightly higher in the children (6-12 year age group) compared with the young children (2-5 year age group) and the adolescents (13-16 year age group).

## Laboratory findings

There were no significant findings among haematology and biochemistry tests.

## Antibodies

Estimated cross-reacting antibodies over 104 weeks of treatment with insulin detemir are presented in figure  below.  As  illustrated,  the  development  of  antibodies  over  104  weeks  could  be  modelled  by  a parabola,  with  a  positive  slope  of  the  parabola  during  the  first  year,  maximum  observed  after  52weeks  and  then  a  negative  slope  of  the  parabola  during  the  extension  period.  In  other  words,  the estimated level of cross-reacting antibodies increased during the first year of treatment with insulin detemir  and  insulin  aspart,  peaked  after  1  year  and  then  decreased  during  the  second  year  of treatment.

## Estimated Cross-Reacting Antibodies (% B/T) over time, Time interval 3h, Corrected Data, SAS, Insulin Detemir Treated Subjects in Trial NN304-1690 Whole Treatment Period

Mean cross-reacting antibodies, mean insulin detemir and mean insulin aspart antibodies over time by age group for subjects in both trials are presented in figures below. The development of mean crossreacting  antibodies  was  similar  for  all  three  age  groups  during  the  trial.  A  slight  increase  in  mean cross-reacting  antibodies  for  the  young  children  and  a  slight  decrease  for  the  adolescents  was observed towards the end of the trial. Mean insulin detemir specific antibody levels were slightly higher for the children (6-12 year age group) compared to the total mean level, whereas the mean insulin detemir  specific  antibody  levels  in  adolescents  (13-16  year  age  group)  were  slightly  lower.  Mean insulin  aspart  specific  antibody levels were slightly  higher  for  the  adolescents  compared to the total mean level, whereas the mean insulin aspart specific antibody levels in the young children (2-5 year age group) were slightly lower.

The post-marketing safety information for insulin detemir received by Novo Nordisk A/S is reported in Periodic Safety Update Reports according to the regulatory requirements.

## Discussion on safety

The safety profile of insulin detemir was in the 2 studies included in this application in agreement with the safety profile shown in previous insulin detemir studies.

The estimated weight SD score at the end of the trial was statistically significantly lower with insulin detemir than with NPH insulin, which means that the weight returned towards the mean value for the reference  population  instead  of  continuing  towards  relatively  higher  levels  with  increasing  risk  of obesity. The lower weight SD score with insulin detemir corresponds to the lower BMI reported in the previous children trial. The central derivation of the SD scores based on standard growth curves from the UK was used, since in several countries standard growth curves were not available. Therefore, an approximation with a certain amount of bias was included in this measurement.

The  estimated  level  of  cross-reacting  antibodies  increased  during  the  first  year  of  treatment  with insulin detemir and insulin aspart, peaked after 1 year and then decreased during the second year of treatment. The development of cross-reacting antibodies was similar for all 3 age-groups.

The  overall  percentage  of  subjects  with  adverse  events  were  similar  among  children  treated  with insulin  detemir  and  NPH  insulin,  and  in  the  age-group  2-5  years  the  rate  of  AEs  per  100  years  of exposure with insulin detemir was lower than with NPH insulin.

During both studies, most subjects experienced hypoglycaemic events. Percentages of subjects who experienced hypoglycaemic events and their overall rates were lower for subjects treated with insulin detemir  in  comparison  with  the  NPH  insulin  treated  children,  in  study  NN304-1689.  Seven  severe hypoglycaemic events occurred during the 104 weeks period in the detemir insulin treated children. In the children aged 2-5 years, the rate of hypoglycaemic events was comparable with the whole group and the detemir group experienced less hypoglycemic events, compared to young children in the NPH treatment group.

The  current  data  suggests  that  insulin  detemir  has  a  numerically  lower,  although  not  statistically significant, rate of all nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes. As discussed in the PDCO, the collection of nocturnal  hypoglycaemic  events  is  not  considered  optimal.  Many  children  are  not  symptomatic  and may sleep apparently calmly, while in hypoglycaemia. However, this phenomenon is only detectable by multiple (2-3) time points or by using CGM devices.

Furthermore the rate of hypoglycaemic episodes was lower with insulin detemir than with NPH insulin in  all  three  age  groups  and  within  the  insulin  detemir  arm  the  number  of  treatment  emergent hypoglycaemic episodes was lower in the young children than in children 6-12 years.

In the longer term there have been associations and concerns raised by an increased prevalence of cancers in those receiving long acting insulin analogues. These are appropriately addressed in the Risk Management plan.

## Significance of paediatric studies

This application was based on two studies:

Study NN304-1689 was a 52-week, Multinational, Multi-Centre, Open-Labelled, Randomised, Parallel, Efficacy and Safety Comparison of Insulin Detemir and NPH Insulin in Children and Adolescents 2-16 years  with  Type  1  Diabetes  on  a  Basal-Bolus  Regimen  with  Insulin  Aspart  as  Bolus  Insulin.  Young children aged 2-5 years were included in this long-term trial in order to obtain clinical data in this age group.

Study NN304-1690 was  a  52-Week,  Multinational,  Multi-Centre,  Open-Labelled  Extension  to  trial NN304-1689 of  Insulin  Detemir  in  Children  and  Adolescents  3-17  years  with  Type  1  Diabetes  on  a Basal-Bolus Regimen with Insulin Aspart as Bolus Insulin. Subjects treated with NPH insulin in Trial NN304-1689 were not offered to continue in the extension.

The persistence of efficacy in young children, children and adolescents was evaluated over a period of 52 weeks in Trial NN304-1689 and for a subset of insulin detemir treated children over a period of 104 weeks in Trial NN304-1690.

The effect of insulin detemir on HbA1C was similar when compared to NPH; HbA1c increased slightly from 8.4% to 8.5-8.6% by the end of 52 weeks of treatment. For subjects treated with insulin detemir mean HbA1c remained relatively stable during the additional 52 weeks of treatment. Mean daily basal and bolus insulin doses were similar in between the two groups throughout the trial. There were no evident  differences  in  the  overall  persistence  of  efficacy,  in  insulin  dosing  or  HbA1c  development between  insulin  detemir  and  NPH  insulin  for  young  children  (2-5  years),  children  (6-12  years)  or adolescents (13-16 years).

The safety profile of insulin detemir was similar to that observed in previous insulin detemir studies. The overall percentage of subjects with adverse events was similar among children treated with insulin detemir and NPH insulin. In the age-group 2-5 years the rate of AEs per 100 years of exposure with insulin detemir was lower than with NPH insulin. Furthermore the rate of hypoglycaemic episodes was lower with insulin detemir than with NPH insulin in all three age groups (2-5, 6-12 and 13-16 years) and within the insulin detemir arm the number of treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes was lower  in  the  young  children  than  in  children  6-12  years.  The  estimated  level  of  cross-reacting antibodies increased during the first year of treatment with insulin detemir and insulin aspart, peaked after  1  year  and  then  decreased  during  the  second  year  of  treatment.  The  development  of  crossreacting antibodies was similar for all 3 age-groups.

Based on the results described above the efficacy and safety data for the 2-5 years old and safety data for the 6-16 years old generated from studies NN304-1689 and NN304-1690 (completed after the entry into force of the paediatric regulation) are considered of importance and clinical relevance for the paediatric population (Guideline on  the format  and  content  of applications  for  agreement  or modification of a paediatric investigation plan and requests for waivers or deferrals and concerning the operation of the compliance check and on criteria for assessing significant studies (2008/C 243/01)). It has to be noted that insulin detemir is already authorised for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 6-17 years.

The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that NN304-1689 ,  which  is  contained  in  the  agreed  Paediatric Investigation Plan and has been completed after 26 January 2007, is considered significant.

| Hypoglycaemia    | Ongoing routine pharmacovigilance (single case reporting, PSURs, ASRs/DSURs) | Addressed in the SmPC, Sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.7 and 4.8. Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use: Omission of a meal or unplanned, strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Patients, whose blood glucose control is greatly improved, e.g. by intensified insulin therapy, may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia, and should be advised accordingly. Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes. Concomitant illness, especially infections and feverish conditions, usually increases the patient's insulin requirements. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or affecting the adrenal, pituitary or thyroid gland can require changes in insulin dose. When patients are transferred between different types of insulin medicinal products, the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may change or become less pronounced than those experienced with their previous insulin. Section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction: Beta- blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Alcohol may intensify or reduce the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin. Section 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines : The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia. This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or operating machinery). Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances. Section 4.8 Undesirable effects: The most frequently reported adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia. It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually occur suddenly. They may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation. From clinical investigations, it is known that major hypoglycaemia, defined as requirement for third party intervention, occurs in approximately 6% of the patients treated with Levemir. Hypoglycaemia is listed as very common ( ≥ 1/10) adverse reaction. |

| Injection site reactions                | Ongoing routine pharmacovigilance (single case reporting, PSURs, ASRs/DSURs)                                                | Addressed in the SmPC, Sections 4.4 and 4.8. Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use: As with any insulin therapy, injection site reactions may occur and include pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching. Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions. Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. On rare occasions, injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Levemir. Section 4.8 Undesirable effects: Injection site reactions are seen more frequently during treatment with Levemir than with human insulin products. These reactions include pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling and itching at the injection site. Most of the injection site reactions are minor and of a transitory nature, i.e. they normally disappear during continued treatment in a few days to a few weeks. Listed as common ( ≥ 1/100 to <1/10) adverse reactions.   |

| Lipodystrophy                           | Ongoing routine pharmacovigilance (single case reporting, PSURs, ASRs/DSURs)                                                | Addressed in the SmPC. Section 4.8 Undesirable effects: Lipodystrophy is reported as uncommon. It may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area. Listed as uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to ≤ 1/100) adverse reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.

No  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product information.

## 1.4.5. Changes to the Product Information

The following changes are proposed for the Product Information (deleted text strikethrough, new text in bold underlined):

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 6-17 2 years and above .

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

[. . . ]

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Based on study results, the following titration guideline is recommended for adult diabetes patients : [. . . ]

## Paediatric population

The efficacy and safety of Levemir were demonstrated in children and adolescents and children aged 6 to 17 2 years and above in studies up to 6 12 months (see section 5.1).

As  with  all  insulin  medicinal  products,  in  children  and  adolescents,  glucose  monitoring  should  be intensified and the insulin detemir dose adjusted on an individual basis.

Levemir has not been studied in children below the age of 2 years.

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

[. . . ]

In  long-term  treatment  trials  in  patients  with  type  1  diabetes receiving  a  basal-bolus  insulin therapy , fasting plasma glucose was improved with Levemir compared with NPH insulin when given as basal/bolus therapy including in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Glycaemic control (HbA1c) with Levemir was is comparable to NPH insulin, with a lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia and no associated weight gain.

In clinical trials using basal bolus insulin therapy, the overall rates of hypoglycaemia with Levemir and NPH insulin were similar. Analyses of nocturnal hypoglycaemia in patients with type 1 diabetes showed a  significantly  lower  risk  of  minor  nocturnal  hypoglycaemia  (able  to  self-treat  and  confirmed  by capillary blood glucose less than 2.8 mmol/l or 3.1 mmol/l if expressed as plasma glucose) than with NPH  insulin,  whereas  no  difference  was  seen  in  type  2  diabetes.  Furthermore,  the  overall  risk  of nocturnal  hypoglycaemia  in  children  and  adolescents  aged  6  to  17 years  with  type  1  diabetes  was significantly lower with Levemir compared to NPH insulin.

Antibody development has been observed with the use of Levemir. However, this does not appear to have any impact on glycaemic control.

## Paediatric population

The efficacy and safety of Levemir has been studied for up to 12 months, in two randomised controlled  clinical  trials  in  adolescents  and  children  (n=694  in  total);  one  of  the  studies included in total 82 children aged 2-5 years. Both trials demonstrated that glycaemic control (HbA1c) with Levemir is comparable to NPH insulin when given as basal-bolus therapy, using a non-inferiority margin of 0.4%. In addition less weight gain (SD score, weight corrected for gender and age) was observed with Levemir than with NPH insulin.

The trial including children above 2 years was extended for an additional 12 months (total of 24 months treatment data) to assess antibody formation after long-term treatment with Levemir. After an increase in insulin antibodies during the first year, the insulin antibodies decreased  during  the  second  year  to  a  level  slightly  higher  than  pre-trial  level.  Results indicate that antibody development had no negative effect on glycaemic control and Levemir dose.

The Packade Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

Also Annex II has been updated to reflect new version number of the Risk Management Plan

## 2. Overall discussions and benefit-risk assessment

In support of the extension of indication 2 clinical studies were submitted.

The already completed Trial NN304-1689 and ongoing extension Trial NN304-1690 at submission were agreed on, during the paediatric investigation procedure by the PDCO. The SA, provided in 2005 by the CHMP, was not followed completely. As agreed on during the PIP procedure three additional studies, including NN1250-3561, will cover the currently missing data regarding PK-data in small children and nocturnal hypoglycaemia data in children using CGM devices.

The data that were collected in the studies from the whole 2-year treatment period suggest that insulin detemir is safe and efficacious and can be used in children between 2 and 16 years of age.

In the basal-bolus treatment regimen, the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir was compared to NPH insulin when both were used once or twice daily according to pre-trial regimen, in combination with insulin  aspart  as  mealtime  insulin.  Insulin  detemir  was  as  safe  and  efficacious  as  NPH  insulin  in treatment of children and adolescents from 2-16 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Children treated with insulin detemir had less hypoglycaemia, less weight gain and fewer SAEs than children treated with NPH insulin.

Potential benefits that may be expected from the use of insulin detemir compared with NPH insulin in young children (2-5 years) are related to a lower within-subject variation in fasting plasma glucose, less hypoglycaemia (both 24h and nocturnal hypoglycaemia, which was not off-set by an increase in diurnal  episodes)  and  less  inappropriate  weight  gain.  The  overall  AE  profile  for  young  children  was similar to that of NPH insulin.

Obtaining good glycaemic control is a challenge for children and adolescents, due to growth, variable lifestyle, hormonal changes, and the need of assistance with insulin injection. The titration of insulin doses  to  obtain  the  target  plasma  glucose  values  led  to  similar  HbA1c  and  fasting  plasma  glucose values with similar insulin doses per kg body weight in the two treatment groups. The ratio of insulin detemir/NPH insulin mean daily insulin doses at end of trial was close to 1 for both basal and bolus insulin, meaning that mean doses were similar in the two treatment groups. For the insulin detemir treated  subjects  continuing  treatment  for  the  complete  2-year  period  mean  HbA1c  levels  were relatively stable, with a slight increase over time (mean HbA1c for all subjects at baseline was 8.43% and  at  end  of  trial  8.74%).  Throughout  the  2-year  period,  mean  HbA1c  was  lowest  for  the  young children and highest for the adolescents. Overall, children in the 2-5 years of age group maintained better glycaemic control, compared to the older children.

The  increase  in  HbA1c  seen  in  both  treatment  groups  may,  as  suggested  by  the  MAH,  reflect  the general difficulties in treating children for whom many factors, including: fear of hypoglycaemia, social status, different country distribution, available help in day care or school and highly variable lifestyle, influence the glycaemic control. It might be speculated whether the titration of the insulin doses was sufficient or whether further intensification of the insulin treatment was hindered by hypoglycaemia or fear of, especially nocturnal, hypoglycaemia.

The observed changes in the insulin antibodies of children with type 1 diabetes treated with insulin detemir in a basal-bolus regimen with insulin aspart as mealtime insulin over two years do not seem to present  a  safety  concern.  The  estimated  antibody  profile  based  on  data  from  the  whole  2-year treatment period showed that after an increase in insulin antibodies during the first year, the insulin antibodies decreased during the second year to a level slightly higher than pre-trial level.

In conclusion, although the number of children 2-5 years of age exposed to detemir was only 41 the data  from  Trial  NN304-1689  and  NN304-1690  support  the  extension  of  the  current  indication  for

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

insulin  detemir  to  include  the  use  of  insulin  detemir  in  children  2-5  years.  The  number  was  in agreement with the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan saying: 'In the insulin detemir group, at least 40 between 2 and 5 years …. at randomisation'. These young children, irrespective of gender, did as well  as  the  older  children ≥ 6  years  for  whom  insulin  detemir  was  approved  in  EU  in  2005.  Insulin detemir was as safe and efficacious as NPH insulin in treatment of children and adolescents from 2-16 years with diabetes mellitus. Children treated with insulin detemir had similar glycaemic control, less hypoglycaemia,  few  severe  nocturnal  hypoglycaemia  episodes,  less  weight  gain  and  fewer  serious adverse events than children treated with NPH insulin. The longer duration of action, the lower withinsubject variation in fasting blood glucose, the lower risk of hypoglycaemia and the lower body weight gain of s.c. insulin detemir compared to NPH insulin may offer advantages for the treatment of young children with diabetes mellitus. The proposed indication for Levemir use is children aged 2-5 years is therefore considered as approvable.

## 3. Conclusion

On 21 September 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package Leaflet.

Furthermore,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  available  paediatric  data  subject  to  the  agreed  Paediatric Investigation  Plan  and  the  results  of  these  studies  are  reflected  in  the  Summary  of  Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate the Package Leaflet.

In accordance with Article 45(3) of Regulation EC(No)1901/2006 as amended, significant studies in the agreed paediatric investigation plan have been completed after the entry into force of that Regulation.
