At the clinical dose the contrast agent has no T2-effect, and pre- and post- T2-weighted images are equivalent. The clinical use of TESLASCAN has been investigated at field strengths from 0.5 to 2.0 Tesla.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Dosage for adults

The recommended dose is 0.5 ml/kg bodyweight (5 µmol/kg bodyweight). This corresponds to a dose of 35 ml for a 70 kg person. Above 100 kg body weight, 50 ml is usually sufficient to provide a diagnostically adequate contrast effect.

## Dosage for elderly

edicinal product no longer authorise Pharmacokinetics in the elderly has not been investigated. However, clinical studies to date do not suggest that a dose adjustment is required. Use in children There are limited data available on the use of Teslascan in children. The available data do not support safety and efficacy in the paediatric population and therefore such use is not recommended. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. Pregnancy and lactation. Phaeochromocytoma. Severely reduced liver function (Child - Pugh class C), especially severe obstructive hepatobiliary disease. Severely reduced renal function. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Rarely, hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria and other possible allergic phenomena) or anaphylactoid reactions may occur. Familiarity with the practice and technique of resuscitation and treatment of anaphylaxis is essential. Appropriate medicinal products and instruments should be readily available. Care should be exercised in patients with severe cardiac disease and in patients with injuries of the blood brain barrier and severe cerebral disease. The fact that long term parenteral nutrition with manganese supplementation can cause manganese accumulation in the basal ganglia should be considered when administering TESLASCAN to patients on such treatment. This medicinal product contains 5.5 mmol (126 mg) sodium per normal dose of 35 ml. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy The safety of TESLASCAN in human pregnancy has not been established. TESLASCAN must not be used during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Prior to administration of TESLASCAN to women of child bearing potential, pregnancy should be excluded.

The  frequency  of  mild  and  moderate,  non-serious  adverse  reactions,  mainly  transient  warmth  and flushing,  is  likely  to  increase  when  TESLASCAN  is  administered  at  the  faster  rate  advised  (4-6 ml/min).

edicinal product no longer authorise No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 4.8 Undesirable effects Most of the adverse reactions reported were transient and of mild intensity. Those most commonly reported were: feeling of warmth/flushing, headache and nausea. In clinical trials with Teslascan, adverse reactions have been reported with the following frequencies given in the table below (very common ≥ 1/10; common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt;1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000 to &lt;1/100); rare ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt;1/1,000); very rare &lt;1/10,000, not known (cannot be estimated from the available  data).  Within  each  frequency  grouping,  undesirable  effects  are  presented  in  order  of decreasing seriousness. Mangafodipir can cause transient increases of bilirubin and liver transaminases and transient decreases in plasma zinc.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

Serious adverse events have not been reported in healthy subjects with dosages up to 5 times the normal clinical dose (maximum dose investigated).

High doses of manganese can have negative inotropic and vasodilatory effects as well as effects on heart rhythm and conduction because of calcium antagonism.

The mean initial plasma half-life of manganese is 20 minutes or less, with significant uptake into the liver, pancreas, kidneys and spleen. The initial plasma half-life of ligand is about 50 minutes. The volume of distribution for manganese is between 0.5 and 1.5 l/kg, and for fodipir 0.17 to 0.45 l/kg. Following its metabolism, nearly all of the ligand (fodipir) is excreted in urine within 24 hours, with negligible amounts being eliminated via the faeces. About 15-20 % of the manganese is eliminated in the urine within the first 24 hours, most of the remainder is excreted in the faeces over the following 4 days.

edicinal product no longer authorise Treatment of an overdose should be symptomatic and directed towards the support of vital functions. There is no antidote to this contrast medium. Mangafodipir and its metabolites are dialysable whereas manganese is not dialysable because of protein binding (see also section 5.2). 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Paramagnetic MRI contrast medium, ATC Code: V08C A05 Mangafodipir is a chelate containing the metal manganese - which has paramagnetic properties and is responsible for the contrast enhancement effect in MRI - and the ligand fodipir (dipyridoxyl diphosphate). Manganese is preferentially taken up by normal liver parenchyma and also in the pancreas so that contrast enhancement between abnormal and normal tissue can be expected. The effect of mangafodipir is to shorten the longitudinal relaxation time (T1) of targeted tissues during MRI, leading to an increase in signal intensity (brightness) of, for example, pancreas and liver parenchyma. Enhancement in both organs is near maximal for up to approx. 4 hours after the end of administration. Lesion-related enhancement of certain types of lesions, such as liver metastases and hepatocellular carcinomas, may be detectable for up to 24 hours. Clinical studies have demonstrated that mangafodipir facilitates the detection of liver lesions in patients with such lesions. TESLASCAN is isotonic with blood and normal body fluids. Paediatric use An uncontrolled observational study assessed the use of mangafodipir in the radiological assessment of infant patients with suspected bilary atresia. 23 consecutive patients aged 24-139 days (mean 69 days) with prolonged jaundice and lightened stool colour in whom bilary atresia had not been ruled out underwent MR cholangiography with contrast. The dose of mangafodipir used was 5 μ mol/kg. No safety concerns arose from this study, although the numbers were too small to be useful in this regard. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Mangafodipir trisodium is metabolised (dephosphorylated) and manganese ions are released from the mangafodipir by exchange with plasma zinc (mainly) after intravenous administration. Manganese and the ligand (fodipir), which have different pharmacokinetics, are eliminated by different routes.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In whole human blood in vitro , the protein binding of manganese is approximately 27 % but binding of fodipir to protein is negligible.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical studies reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of genotoxicity, safety pharmacology and validating kinetics and metabolism. Relevant adverse effects from repeated dose toxicity studies were liver toxicity (cholangiohepatitis) observed at relatively low dosages in dogs, while sufficient margins of safety were determined in rats and monkeys.

edicinal product no longer authorise Mangafodipir is teratogenic in rats; it causes increased foetal skeletal abnormalities when given daily by intravenous injection to female rats at dosages slightly greater than clinical dosages . Embryo- and foetotoxicity has been observed in rabbits. 6.
