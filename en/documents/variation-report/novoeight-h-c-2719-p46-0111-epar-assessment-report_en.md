## 1. Introduction

On 20 September 2019, the MAH submitted Guardian 10 NN7008-4304, a completed study for NovoEight, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

The trial was a post-approval commitment to the Indian Health Authorities and should have at least 50 haemophilia A patients to complete the trial. The goal of this trial was to provide documentation on the safety and efficacy of turoctocog alfa in patients in India as no study had previously been conducted with turoctocog alfa in India.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

NovoEight (turoctocog alfa) is a third-generation recombinant coagulation factor VIII (rFVIII) product indicated for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with Haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). Turoctocog alfa can be used for all age groups.

In the European Union (EU), NovoEight was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on the 13 November 2013 for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with Haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency).

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The trial product, turoctocog alfa (NovoEight), was supplied as a sterile, freeze-dried powder in single-use vials of 2000 IU/vial to be reconstituted with 4.3 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection provided in prefilled syringes (Table 1). Once reconstituted, turoctocog alfa had to be used within 4 hours if stored at room temperature (&lt;30°C) or 24 hours if stored in refrigerator at 2-8°C.

Turoctocog alfa was given i.v. as prophylaxis at a frequency of 'every second day' or '3 times a week' at a dose in the range of 20-50 IU/kg. The individual regimen was chosen by the investigator, considering the patient's wishes, clinical status and readiness to comply with frequent dosing.

Bleeding episodes were treated with one or more turoctocog alfa i.v. bolus injections. The individual dose was determined by the investigator, using the recommendations in the World Federation of Haemophilia (WFH) guidelines and according to approved prescribing information.

- Dose (IU) = weight (kg) x desired factor level (IU/dL) x 0.5.

Batch numbers and expiry date of trial products are as follows (Table 2):

## 2.3. Clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

Haemophilia A is a recessive X-linked congenital bleeding disorder, caused by mutation in the coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) gene on the long arm of the X-chromosome. Patients with haemophilia A lack or have a reduced production of FVIII, or they produce biochemically defective FVIII molecules. With a deficiency or absence of these factors, the activation of coagulation factor X becomes severely impaired, and consequently, the thrombin burst becomes delayed and insufficient for normal haemostasis. The severity of bleeding in haemophilia A is generally correlated to FVIII level in the plasma. Haemophilia A is classified as 'severe (&lt;1%)', 'moderate (1-5%)' or 'mild (&gt;5%)' according to the residual plasma activity of the affected clotting FVIII.3 The mainstay of management of haemophilia A is replacement of deficient FVIII.

Main therapeutic schedules include treatment of bleeding episodes and regular prophylaxis.

The estimated number of haemophilia patients in India is over 70,000. However, less than a quarter of these patients were diagnosed and registered in India. The registered number of haemophilia patients in India is 17,470 which include 14,450 patients with haemophilia A and 2281 patients with haemophilia B. It is reported that among 14,450 patients, 30% belong to ≤ 18 years of age and 33% belong to age group of 19 -44 years. The main modality of management of haemophilia in India is on-demand regimen (i.e. administration of clotting factor after each bleeding episode). Patients visit their respective treatment centres for management of each individual bleeding episode. Less than 1% of haemophilia A patients under age of 18 years receive prophylactic replacement in selected centres.

Among FVIII concentrates used in India in 2014, 98% consumption was plasma derived FVIII (pd-FVIII) and the remaining 2% was recombinant FVIII (rFVIII). This partly explains the inadequate supply and delay in supply of FVIII as pd-FVIII alone is not able to meet the patients' requirements as elsewhere in the world. Hence a significant proportion of haemophilia A patients in India are still treated with blood or blood derived products, mainly fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate. The currently available first generation rFVIII uses albumin and other human/animal serum or proteins in various stages of production process which lowers their final purity.

Turoctocog alfa (NovoEight) is a '3rd generation' recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) similar to other marketed FVIII products of recombinant origin, intended for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes in haemophilia A patients. This report describes results from a clinical trial designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of turoctocog alfa used for both prevention (prophylaxis) and treatment of bleeds in Indian population of previously treated patients (PTPs) with moderate or severe haemophilia A.

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

## Clinical study number and title

Title of the Trial is 'Safety of turoctocog alfa for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes in previously treated patients with moderate or severe haemophilia A in India.

Clinicaltrials.gov. identifier is NCT03449342, and EudraCT number is 2017-002281-46.

The trial was conducted at 10 sites in India.

Trial period was 23 Feb 2019 to Primary completion at 25 Mar 2019 and Global completion at 22 Apr 2019.

Final CSR is dated 26 Aug 2019.

## Description

## Methods

Guardian 10 was a Phase 4 single-country, multi-centre, open-label and non-randomised trial with a single treatment arm.

In this trial, previously treated moderate or severe haemophilia A patients received routine prophylaxis treatment and treatment of bleeding episodes. A treatment period of 8 weeks, which corresponded to at least 20 exposure days (EDs) on standard prophylaxis with turoctocog alfa, provided an opportunity to detect an inhibitory response after initiation of treatment.

All patients attended an information visit and a screening visit, prior to their baseline visit. Patients completed the trial by attending a follow-up visit 12 weeks after the baseline visit.

## Objective(s)

## Primary objective:

To assess safety of turoctocog alfa during treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in previously treated patients with moderate or severe haemophilia A in India.

## Secondary objectives:

To assess efficacy outcomes with turoctocog alfa during treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in previously treated patients with moderate or severe haemophilia A in India.

## Study design

<!-- image -->

## Study population /Sample size

A sample size of minimum 50 patients to complete the trial was based on Indian Health Authorities (HA) requirements. 62 previously treated patients (PTPs) with haemophilia A were screened, of which 2 were screening failures due to exclusion criterion, 'positive result to FVIII inhibitor test.' The remaining 60 patients

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

completed the treatment with turoctocog alfa and attended the follow-up visit. None of the patients withdrew from the trial.

All the patients were males with moderate or severe haemophilia A, p reviously treated (≥150 documented EDs with any FVIII containing product) and ≥12 years in age by the time of their informed consent.

3 patients with moderate haemophilia (1.6%, 2%, 4.6% residual FVIII activity) were included, all other patients had severe type (&lt;1% residual FVIII-activity). 10 Patients were below 18 years of age (3 pts 12y, 2 pts 13y, 2pts 14, 1 pt 15, 2pts 17 y/o age).

In the year prior to trial participation, 32 patients had prophylactic treatment and 45 patients had on-demand therapy f or a mean (SD) period of 9.10 (3.38) (range: 0.26-12) months and 9.46 (3.75) (range: 0.53-12) months respectively. Seventeen (17) patients received both, prophylactic and on-demand therapy at different time periods in the year prior to trial participation. Previous prophylaxis employed a variety of dose levels (ranging from 8.6 IU/kg to 68 IU/kg) and dosing schedules (ranging from once daily to once weekly).

The mean number of prophylaxis-injections per patient was similar between adolescents (24.50) and adults (23.80).The total mean number of injections for treatment of bleeds per patient was 1.48. The mean prophylactic dose of turoctocog alfa was 45.12 IU/kg BW in adolescents and 37.66 IU/kg BW in adults (refer to EOT Table 14.2.3). The dosing was within the range of the prescribed prophylactic dose mentioned in the protocol (20-50 IU/kg BW).

## Assessors comment:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH provided information on treatment-exposure (Table 10-4) with respect to total number of injections per patient, total exposure days (EDs) per patient, number of injections per bleed per patient, and prophylactic dose per patient as 'mean' values. However in general, median and range instead of mean and SD more adequately reflect results with cutting off outlayers.

3 adult patients with moderate haemophilia are included in the analysis and might falsify the results.

## Details of treated bleeds

49 treatment-requiring bleeds were reported in 19 patients during the entire trial treatment period and included 3 bleeds in 2 adolescents and 46 bleeds in 17 adults.

Except for 1 severe spontaneous bleed in an adult patient which occurred at his left shoulder joint, all the remaining 48 bleeds were mild/moderate in severity.

Of the 49 bleeds, 40 (81.6%) were spontaneous and 9 (18.4%) were traumatic. 3 patients experienced 21 treatment-requiring bleeds during the trial that all were of mild/moderate severity. Of these 21 bleeds, one patient experienced 10 bleeds, another experienced 5 bleeds and the 3rd patient experienced 6 bleeds.

## Injections to treat bleeds

89 injections of turoctocog alfa were administered to treat 49 bleeds. Fifty-six (56) of these were administered in 3 patients who together experienced 21 bleeds.

Of the 49 bleeds, 40 were treated with 1-2 injections and remaining 9 bleeds were treated with 3-12 injections.

## Haemostatic effect

In the overall trial treatment period from visit 2 to visit 4, the haemostatic response was successful in 81.6% (40/49) of the bleeds. Nine (9) bleeds were considered as haemostatic failures. Haemostatic response was successful in 80.0% (32/40) of spontaneous bleeds and 88.9% (8/9) of traumatic bleeds.

## Total annualised consumption of turoctocog alfa

The total mean (SD) annualised consumption of turoctocog alfa calculated based on the 8-week treatment period was 6244 (1672) IU/kg BW/year/patient for all patients, 7030 (1053) IU/kg BW/year/patient for adolescents, and 6086 (1735) IU/kg BW/year/patient for adults (Table 11-3). The difference between adolescents and adults was partly driven by higher prophylaxis doses in adolescents (45.12 IU/kg) compared to adults (37.66 IU/kg) which was at the investigator's discretion. The total mean (SD) annual consumption per patient used for prophylaxis was 5801 (1461) IU/kg BW/year/patient and that for treatment of bleeds was 442.3 (1519) IU/kg BW/year/patient

## Safety:

## Primary endpoint: Occurrence of confirmed FVIII inhibitors

There was no occurrence of FVIII inhibitors (≥0.6 BU) after 8 weeks of treatment with turoctocog alfa.

## Adverse events by system organ class/preferred term

All AEs were treatment emergent and were within the below listed MedDRA system organ classes:

- 'Infections and infestations' (5 events reported in 4 patients)
- 'General disorders and administration site conditions' (2 events reported in 2 patients)
- 'Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders' (1 allergic reaction reported in 1 patient)
- 'Nervous system disorders' (1 event reported in 1 patient)

## There were no deaths or SAEs reported during the trial.

The clinical laboratory evaluations comprised FVIII inhibitor, FVIII activity, immunology, biochemistry, haematology, CD4+ T cells and genotype assessments.

## FVIII inhibitor results

All patients were tested for FVIII inhibitors at screening visit (visit 1) and at end of trial visit (visit 4) with a 48-hour wash out period of turoctocog alfa. Apart from two screening failures, all patients showed a re sult of &lt;0.4 BU; (a positive inhibitor is implied if the result was ≥0.6 BU), indicating no formation of FVIII inhibitors. As a result, no further antibody characterisation was done.

## Antibodies

No patients developed FVIII, HIV, hepatitis B or C antibodies throughout the trial.

## Statistical Methods

## Determination of sample size

Sample size was based on Indian Health Authorities (HA) requirements. Indian HA had mandated Novo Nordisk to perform a trial with 50 patients (completers). Based on Hanley's formula 'the rule-of-3' we know that with approximately 95% power we would be able to observe at least 1 patient with FVIII inhibitor (≥0.6 BU) if the incidence rate was as low as 6%. The same held for any other type of adverse events.

## Definition of analysis sets

All main descriptions and analyses of efficacy are based on the Full Analysis Set, as defined in the protocol in accordance with ICH E9 Guidelines (Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials):

Full analysis set (FAS): The FAS included all dosed patients with data after dosing. The observation period for the efficacy analysis is the on-treatment period. The observation period was therefore from first treatment with trial drug (visit 2) until then end of trial visit (visit 4).

Safety analysis set (SAS): The SAS is identical to the FAS. The analyses of the safety endpoints were based on the SAS. The observation period for safety analysis is the on-treatment period with a post treatment window till the follow-up visit to capture all treatment emergent events. The observation period was therefore from first treatment with trial drug (visit 2) until the follow-up visit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Missing inhibitor test was not to be counted as a positive result. This was based on the plausible assumption that in case of any clinical signs of inhibitor development, inhibitor testing would have been performed in practice, so missing test was unlikely to indicate a positive inhibitor.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects (Assessment)

Evaluation of this post-authorization trial is hampered by a very short study-interval of 8 weeks, only. This does not form a valid base neither for efficacy evaluation nor for detection of inhibitors and other safety issues. However, the aim of the Indian Authorities was a 'bridging' of clinical experience with the haemophilia population of India, not a pivotal investigation for marketing authorization. Therefore, the study is considered to contribute to clinical experience under clinical trial conditions. The results show no relevant deviations or signals compared to similar factor concentrates or NovoEight, itself.

Further shortages of the trial-design comprise the inclusion of 3 patients with documented moderate haemophilia and use of only one batch of NovoEight in this trial.

With regard to the Article 46 procedure, main aspect should be the evaluation of paediatric patients (here: adolescents). Respective 10 patients have been documented in a comparative manner.

The MAH provided information on treatment-exposure (Table 10-4) with respect to total number of injections per patient, total exposure days (EDs) per patient, number of injections per bleed per patient, and prophylactic dose per patient as 'mean' values. However in general, median and range instead of mean and SD more adequately reflect results with cutting off outlayers.

3 adult patients with moderate haemophilia are included in the analysis and might falsify the results.

## Efficacy:

Presentation of efficacy results covers presentation of haemostatic response (Table 11-2) and consumption of FVIII (Table 11-3). Haemostatic response is considered to be within the range of similar replacement products. Analysis of consumption is, however, hampered by presentation of 'mean and SD' instead of 'median and range' - similar as discussed above for the treatment-exposure. Results show relevant differences between adults and adolescents, e.g. consumption per bleed of 46 IU/kg for adolescents and 100 IU/kg for adults, or consumption for prophylaxis of 7000 IU/kg/year for adolescents versus 5500 for adults.

Furthermore, 3 adult patients with moderate haemophilia are included in the analysis and might falsify the results.

9 out of 49 haemostatic responses were assessed to be 'failures'. 6 were observed in 3 patients who experienced 21 treatment-requiring bleeds. Reason for theses failures remains open.

## Safety:

No safety signal has been observed. AE profile is in line with similar settings.

Presentation of efficacy results rely on 'mean' and 'SD' which might produce invalid data due to potential outliers. Update and comment are requested

Reason for 'failures' in haemostatic responses remains open.

No safety signal has been observed. AE profile is in line with similar settings.

## Not fulfilled: refer to RfSI Section 4

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Request for supplementary information (RfSI)

- (1) Presentation of efficacy results rely on mean and SD (Table 11.3). The MAH is asked to provide an updated table, based upon raw-data from tables 14.2.2 and 14.2.3, and reflecting median and range. Relevant efficacy-parameters for assessing differences between adolescents and adults are the Total number of EDs, Number of injections per bleed, Prophylaxis dose (IU/kg per dose), Treatment of bleed (IU/kg) Consumption during bleed (IU/kg per bleed), Total consumption per year and per patient (IU/kg/year/patient). The MAH is asked to briefly comment on the respective results.
- (2) 3 adult patients with moderate haemophilia are included in the analysis and might falsify the results. An additional column should represent respective data from these patients. The MAH is asked to comment on the results.
- (3) 9 out of 49 haemostatic responses were assessed to be 'failures'. 6 were observed in 3 patients who experienced 21 treatment-requiring bleeds. Reason for these unexpected failures including inhibitor follow-up should be discussed, as far as available.
- (4) Clinical overview statement should be updated, accordingly.
- (5) The MAH is asked to provide an updated 'Line listing of all the studies included in the development program' (refer to Annex)

The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 5. Assessment of the MAH responses to RfSI

## Question 1

Presentation of efficacy results rely on mean and SD (Table 11.3). The MAH is asked to provide an updated table, based upon raw-data from tables 14.2.2 and 14.2.3, and reflecting median and range. Relevant efficacy-parameters for assessing differences between adolescents and adults are the Total number of EDs, Number of injections per bleed, Prophylaxis dose (IU/kg per dose), Treatment of bleed (IU/kg) Consumption during bleed (IU/kg per bleed), Total consumption per year and per patient (IU/kg/year/patient). The MAH is asked to briefly comment on the respective results.

## MAH's responses

The MAH submitted a Critical Expert Overview but no separate Response Document for addressing the raised questions.

## Assessment of the MAH's responses

Overall 60 patients, 47 adults with severe haemophilia, 3 adults with moderate haemophilia, and 10 adolescents with severe haemophilia are included in Table 1-1 (see below). These numbers allow for descriptive analysis, only.

Most relevant finding is the difference in consumption for 'severe' adolescents (7000 IU/kg/year) versus adults (5560 IU/kg/year).

Numbers of bleeds are considered to be low, and respective consumptions confounded by outliers.

## Conclusion

Point solved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Question 2

3 adult patients with moderate haemophilia are included in the analysis and might falsify the results. An additional column should represent respective data from these patients. The MAH is asked to comment on the results.

## MAH's responses

The MAH submitted a Critical Expert Overview but no separate Response Document for addressing the raised questions.

## Assessment of the MAH's responses

Submitted Table suggests similar bleeding phenotype within the adult patient group.

## Conclusion

Point solved.

## Question 3

9 out of 49 haemostatic responses were assessed to be 'failures'. 6 were observed in 3 patients who experienced 21 treatment-requiring bleeds. Reason for these unexpected failures including inhibitor follow-up should be discussed, as far as available.

## MAH's responses

Forty (40) of the total 49 bleeds (81.6%) were treated successfully. Nine (9) of the total 49 bleeds were reported with a moderate haemostatic response (rated as failure), of which 6 were observed in 3 patients who experienced a total of 21 treatment-requiring bleeds. lt is not unusual that patients respond differently to the same treatment, and some patients with a reduced response are expected.

When treating a bleeding episode, the patient was asked to evaluate the effect after 8 hours from first treatment. If 'definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding episode', or better, was achieved at this time point the treatment would be recorded as successful. If, however, a 'probable or slight beneficial effect' (or worse) was achieved the treatment would be recorded as a failure. lt is likely that patients who do experience many bleeds in possibly worsened joints would experience less improvement already 8 hours after having initiated the treatment which would imply a failure outcome.

The patients were negative for neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors).

## Assessment of the MAH's responses

The MAH's explanation is considered to be acceptable. Of note, definition of 'failure' has significant influence on the outcome.

## Conclusion

Point solved.

## Question 4

Clinical overview statement should be updated, accordingly.

## MAH's responses

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MAH submitted an updated Critical Expert Overview.

Assessment and Conclusion: Point solved.

## Question 5

The MAH is asked to provide an updated 'Line listing of all the studies included in the development program' (refer to Annex)

## MAH's responses

The MAH submitted an updated Line-listing.

Assessment and Conclusion: Point solved.

## 6. Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation

Evaluation of this post-authorization trial is hampered by a very short study-interval of 8 weeks, only. This does not form a valid base neither for efficacy evaluation nor for detection of inhibitors and other safety issues. However, the aim of the Indian Authorities was a 'bridging' of clinical experience with the haemophilia population of India, not a pivotal investigation for marketing authorization. Therefore, the study is considered to contribute to clinical experience under clinical trial conditions. The results show no relevant deviations or signals compared to similar factor concentrates or NovoEight, itself.

Further shortages of the trial-design comprise the inclusion of 3 patients with documented moderate haemophilia and use of only one batch of NovoEight in this trial.

With regards to the Article 46 procedure, main aspect should be the evaluation of paediatric patients (here: adolescents). Respective 10 patients have been documented in a comparative manner.

Presentation of efficacy results has been updated within a 'Critical Expert Overview of 22Jan2020 Version 2.0.' Median and range have been amended to revised Table 1-1.

Reason for high numbers of 'failures' in haemostatic responses are considered to be explained by the chosen definition for 'failures'.

No safety signal has been observed. AE profile is in line with similar settings.
