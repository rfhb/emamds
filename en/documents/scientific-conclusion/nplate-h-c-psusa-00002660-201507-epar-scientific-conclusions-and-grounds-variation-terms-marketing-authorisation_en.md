## Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations

During the PSUR reporting period a signal originated from the Marketing Authorisation Holder's (MAH) Product Complaints database where 9 product complaints regarding reconstitution and administration guideline were identified, indicating that the potential for confusion over vial overfill for Nplate exists. In  relation  to  this  concern  the  MAH  performed  a  review  of  all  available  sources  (safety  database, clinical trial database, nonclinical data review, literature review…) where a total of 13 cases from postmarketing  sources  were  identified.  In  addition,  one  case  from  a  literature  report  was  identified regarding the potential for confusion when preparing the solution for injection. In view of the available data, the PRAC recommends an update of the product information in order to clarify the vial overfill and how to reconstitute the product safely.

Therefore, in view of available data regarding romiplostim, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted.
