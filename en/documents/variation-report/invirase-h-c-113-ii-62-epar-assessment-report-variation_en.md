## Antiviral activity in vitro :

Saquinavir demonstrates antiviral activity against both laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV-1 with  typical EC50  and EC90  values  in  the  range  1-10  nM  and  5-50  nM,  respectively,  using  acutely infected T  cell  lines  or  primary  human  lymphocytes/monocytes.  In  vitro  antiviral  activity  was observed against a panel of HIV-1 group M non-clade B isolates (A, AE, C, D, F, G and H) and HIV-2 with  EC50  values  ranging  from  0.3-2.5  nM.  In  the presence  of  50%  human  serum  or  alpha-1  acid glycoprotein (1 mg/ml) the antiviral activity of saquinavir decreases by an average factor of 25-fold and 14-fold respectively.

The most commonly reported mutations observed to develop during in vitro passage of HIV-1 wild type  virus  in  the  presence  of  increasing  concentrations  of  saquinavir  are  G48V  and  L90M. Recombinant virus harbouring the G48V or L90M mutations respectively, exhibited 7.9 and 3.3-fold reduced susceptibility to saquinavir. Additional protease mutations observed to develop less frequently were M36I, I54V, K57R, and L63V.

## In vivo resistance:

Treatment naïve patients: Four studies have investigated ritonavir boosted saquinavir regimens in ART naïve patients (saquinavir/ritonavir 1600 mg/100 mg once daily n=349; 1000 mg/100 mg twice daily n=92).  Baseline  and  on-therapy  resistance  analyses  were  available  for  26  patients  experiencing virological rebound, and not harbouring resistance mutations at baseline (n=1) or developing signature protease  mutations  associated  with  other  PIs  (n=1).  Virus  from  two  patients  developed  protease mutations  (M36I  and  M46i/m  respectively)  not  typically  associated  with  saquinavir  resistance.  No saquinavir-associated protease mutations were observed to develop following virological failure.

Treatment experienced patients: Baseline and on-therapy genotype was available for 22 previously PIexperienced  patients  experiencing  virological  failure  after  receiving  a  ritonavir  boosted  saquinavir regimen  (MaxCmin1  &amp;  2  studies;  1000/100mg  twice  daily,  n=171).  Virus  from  eight  (8/22;  36%) patients developed additional protease mutations following virological failure. The relative incidence of each mutation was: I84V (n=4, 18%); F53L, A71V or G73S (n=2, 9%); L10V, M46I, I54V, V82A or L90M (n=1, 4.5%). Medicinal product no longer authorised
