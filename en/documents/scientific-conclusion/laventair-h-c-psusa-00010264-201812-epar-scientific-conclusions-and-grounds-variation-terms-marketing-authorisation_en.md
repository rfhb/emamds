## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSURs for umeclidinium bromide / vilanterol, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Following a post-approval regulatory requests in the last PSUR (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010264/201712), the MAH provided a review of the adverse drug reaction (ADR) 'dizziness'. The MAH identified 203 cases of dizziness, 191 were reported as non-serious, and 12 reported as serious. Fifty-eight cases report positive de-challenge. Seven of these 58 cases contained relevant medical history that can cause dizziness. Of the remaining 51 cases, 22 cases reported time to onset (TTO) of 0-2 days, and six of these cases reported no concomitant medications. Of the 203 cases, five cases reported positive re-challenge and two further cases described events that reoccurred the same day after each dose. The MAH reported the details of these 7 cases with positive re-challenge. Though the TTO is not clear in all the cases, 4 cases occurred within 1 day. The PRAC considered that the short TTO reported in the 48% of the cases (0 - 1 day) is suggestive of a possible causal relation between the administration of UMEC/VI and the event. The undesirable effect 'dizziness'  is  known  and  included  with  an  uncommon  frequency  in  the  PI  of  aclidinium,  suggesting  a possible class effect for anticholinergics. Based on the above and also taking into account that serious cases have been reported, a product information (PI) update with regard to the adverse reaction 'dizziness' is  warranted.  Update  of  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  to  add  'dizziness'  with  a  frequency  not  known  is recommended. The package leaflet should be updated accordingly.

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for umeclidinium bromide / vilanterol the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal products containing umeclidinium bromide / vilanterol is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisations should be varied.
