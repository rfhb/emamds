| II/0037              | Update of section 4.9 of the SmPC in order to revise information regarding overdose to indicate \"Not Applicable\" following review of overall safety data.

1  Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are issued for all other procedures.

2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The

CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

|           | C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data                                           |            |     | since the proposed changes have no impact on the safety profile, risk minimisation measures or additional pharmacovigilance requirements. A review of the overall safety dataset as well as all adverse events reported in the Global Safety Database performed by the MAH did not identify any trends in safety events resulting from the administration of an extra dose of HEPLISAV B given per administration or cumulatively; there is no evidence to support the inclusion of information concerning both observed and theoretical signs and symptoms of overdose. Additionally, no recommendations are required for clinical management including the provision of antidotes and proper supportive therapy concerning an overdose of HEPLISAV B. As a result, the following revised wording of section 4.9 of the SmPC was endorsed by the CHMP, aligning with other SmPC texts for vaccines: 4.9 Overdose 'Cases of overdose have been reported during post- marketing surveillance. In general, the adverse event profile reported with overdose was comparable to that observed with the recommended dose of Heplisav B.' The overall benefit-risk balance of Heplisav B remains positive.   |

| II/0031 Update of section 4.6 information on pregnancy study DV2-HBV-28 - Post-marketing surveillance study to among women who receive B; HBV-28 was conducted population as two observational surveillance studies designed incidence of AMI (HBV-25) immunemediated diseases, anaphylaxis (HBV-26) compared with recipients objective of this study pregnancy outcomes recipients of Engerix-B.The updated accordingly. been submitted. In addition, opportunity to bring the template version 10.3.   | 08/02/2024   | 26/02/2025   | SmPC and PL   | This procedure entails amendments to the product information (PI) and the risk management plan (RMP) of HEPLISAV-B regarding the use of the product during pregnancy based on the results of the completed pregnancy registry HBV-28. The primary objective of study HBV-28 was to describe and compare the risk of pregnancy outcomes among women exposed to HEPLISAV-B with pregnant patients exposed to Engerix-B during the 28 days prior to conception or during pregnancy. Therefore, pregnancy outcomes and outcomes among live births were compared. In the analysis of the safety of administration of HEPLISAV- B compared to Engerix-B no different safety profile between both vaccine groups could be observed. A comparison of the number of events, the percentages or event rates in both groups, as well as the adjusted relative risk showed a comparable profile between both vaccine groups. Even if the data in pregnant women are very limited, no safety concern could be identified, neither from clinical nor non-clinical data. Besides, in general, no enhanced risk for the vaccination of pregnant women with non-live vaccines is known. In this light, the MAH proposed to delete the sentence 'As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of HEPLISAV B during pregnancy.' in the section 4.6 of the SmPC whilst the current wording regarding pregnancy remains with a statement that vaccination should only be performed if the benefit for the mother clearly outweighs the risk. This is acceptable to the PRAC. The MAH also proposed amendments to the RMP by removing (1) 'Safety in pregnancy and lactation' as missing information in the summary of safety concerns,   |

There is no known causality mechanism. The final study results of study HBV-26 (category 3 PASS study in the RMP) confirm that there is a similar safety profile for these disorders as for the comparator product. Based on the evidence in this study, the important potential risk 'Potentially immune- mediated disorders (including inflammatory disorders)' was removed from the RMP as a safety concern.
