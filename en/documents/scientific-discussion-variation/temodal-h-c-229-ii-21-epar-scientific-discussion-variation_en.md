## III. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 3.1. Introduction

Glioblastoma  multiforme  (GBM)  is  the  most  common  and  most  aggressive  of  the  primary  brain tumors in adults. It represents 15% to 20 % of all brain tumors and about 50 % of all gliomas. It is highly malignant, infiltrates the brain extensively, and at times may become enormous before turning symptomatic.

The current World Health Organization (WHO) classification of primary brain tumors lists GBM as a Grade  IV  astrocytoma.  GBM  is  slightly  more  common  in  men  than  in  women;  the  male-to-female ratio is 3:2. While GBM occurs in all age groups, its incidence is increasing in elderly patients. A true increase  in  incidence  of  primary  brain  tumors  exists,  which  cannot  be  explained  by  the  aging population, better imaging techniques, or earlier detection at surgery.

GBM is an anaplastic, highly cellular tumor with poorly differentiated, round, or pleomorphic cells, occasional multinucleated cells, nuclear atypia, and anaplasia. Under the modified  WHO classification, GBM differs from anaplastic astrocytomas (AA) by the presence of necrosis under the microscope.

The  incidence  of  GBM  is  fairly  constant  worldwide.  Among  primary  brain  tumors,  malignant astrocytomas are the most common in all age groups (however, brain metastases are more common). GBMs are the most common primary brain tumors in adults, accounting for 12-15% of intracranial tumors and 50-60% of primary brain tumors. GBM may develop de novo (primary GBM) or through secondary  progression  from  a  previously  diagnosed  low-grade  or  anaplastic  glioma;  most  patients have primary GBM.

Morbidity is depending on the tumor location, progression, and pressure effects. The overall prognosis for  GBM  has  changed  little  in  the  past  2  decades,  despite  major  improvements  in  neuroimaging, neurosurgery,  radiation  treatment  techniques,  supportive  care  and  new  chemotherapy  agents  and regimens. Prognosis for GBM remains poor, the median survival is 9 to 12 months, the 2-year survival rates are between 8% and 12%.

The  standard  treatment  of  malignant  gliomas  includes  maximum  surgical  resection,  when  feasible, followed by partial brain radiotherapy. Radiotherapy can be combined or followed by chemotherapy. Although  clinical  benefit  of  chemotherapy  is  only  small,  chemotherapy  agents  are  used  for  the treament of GBM: Cytotoxic agents most commonly applied for chemotherapy are nitrosourea-based regimens  such  as  BCNU  (carmustine)  and  procarbazine,  furthermore,  vinca  alkaloids,  platinum compounds, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate are used.

## 3.2. Toxico-pharmacological

In vitro studies that explored the effect of temozolomide combined with X-irradiation on cell killing have shown the interaction was at least additive in 3 of 4 human tumor cell lines tested, with a strong potentiation  seen  in  the  D384  glioma  line.  Temozolomide  also  was  shown  to  inhibit  irradiationinduced glioma cell invasion in vitro.

## 3.3. Clinical aspects

Several clinical trials have already been performed to analyse the efficacy and safety of the treatment of  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  GBM  using  radiotherapy  and  temozolomide  as  concomitant  and subsequent monotherapy therapy. A summary is presented in table 1.

## Clinical Pharmacology

Temodal is an oral cytotoxic alkylating agent, a prodrug which undergoes nonenzymatic hydrolysis at physiological pH to its active metabolite 3-methyl-(triazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC), as same  as  dacarbazine  (DTIC).  The  cytotoxicity  of  temozolomide  is  thought  to  be  due  primarily  to alkylation of DNA.

Temozolomide can cross the blood brain barrier with a concentration in the cerebral spinal fluid of approximately 20% to 40% of that found in plasma.

## Dosage

In Phase 1 studies, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of temozolomide administered for days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle was 200 mg/m 2 , with myelosuppression being the dose-limiting toxicity; for patients with extensive prior chemotherapy, the MTD was 150mg/m 2 daily for days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle. The MTD for the extended-dose schedule was found to be 85 mg/m 2 /day over 42 days, with a recommended starting dose for newly diagnosed patients receiving concomitant RT of 75 mg/m 2 /day for further investigation of temozolomide for the treatment of malignant gliomas.

The dosage recommended for relapsed glioma (one of the licensed indications ) is 150 mg/m 2 for the initial cycle, 200 mg/m 2 for the second and subsequent cycles for pretreated patients. Chemotherapynaive patients can begin with the higher dosage (200 mg/m 2 ) from the first cycle. Duration of 1 cycle is 28 days and temozolomide is given orally the first 5 days, then after 23 days a new cycle is to begin if no haematological occurs.

## Clinical Efficacy

## Main study

One clinical trial, (EORTC 26981/22981) was performed to prove the efficacy and safety for the broadened indication for temozolomide, in the  treatment of patients with newly diagnosed GBM, as concomitant therapy to radiotherapy followed by monotherapy in comparison to radiotherapy alone.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This was a controlled, open-label, randomised multicenter phase 3 trial which included 573 patients (ITT population), 287 in the experimental arm (Radiotherapy + temozolomide: RT+TMZ) and 286 patients in the control arm (radiotherapy alone: RT). 85 study centers throughout Europe, Canada and Australia were involved. The studied period was from 17 th August 2000 to 14 th April 2004. The applicant declares that the trial was conducted in accordance with principles of Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and local laws and regulations.

## Objectives and endpoints

The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of temozolomide administration as a concomitant treatment to radiotherapy followed by monotherapy treatment for up to 6 cycles with respect to overall survival in subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme compared to radiotherapy alone. Secondary objectives were to compare the two treatment arms with respect to toxicity profile, progression free survival and quality of life.

Overall survival was the primary efficacy endpoint.

Duration of survival was defined as time interval between the date of randomisation and the date of death. Subjects who were still alive when last traced were censored at the date of last follow up. Progression free survival was the secondary endpoint. Progression free survival was defined as radiological, neurological or clinical progression, whatever occurs first, and as the time interval between the date of randomisation and the date of disease progression or death, whichever comes first. If neither event has been observed then the patient is censored at the date of the last follow-up examination.

The treatment schedule for both arms is summarized in the table 2 below.

## Randomisation

Randomisation was based on the local pathology review. A central pathology review was performed either jointly by the three EU neuropathologists or by the one Canadian neuropathologist. Treatment allocation was done centrally directly on the EORTC Data Center Computer through the

INTERNET network or by telephone to the EORTC Data Center.

## Stratification

The protocol-specified prognostic factors for stratification at randomisation were: age (&lt; 50 years vs ≥ 50 years), WHO-ECOG-performance status (0-1 vs.2) and extent of resection at surgery (biopsy only vs. complete/incomplete resection). Stratification by age was not conducted 'due to an operational oversight'. Stratification was also made by study center.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Interim analysis

An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) was established to meet when the interim analyses or the final analysis had been performed by the statisticians to consider all aspects of the trial and, if necessary, to recommend changes in the conduct of the trial.

Two interim analyses were planned, at least only the first was performed in concordance with the study protocol after 236 patients were accrued and only 21 deaths had occurred. The independent committee decided to continue the trial without changes.

## Statistical evaluation

Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival functions were obtained for the primary (OS) and secondary (PFS) endpoint. Differences between both treatment arms were compared using 2-sided log-rank test. The primary analysis was conducted on the intent-to-treat population (ITT). Subjects were analysed according to the treatment they were assigned to receive. In order to quantify the treatment effect, for each endpoint an unadjusted overall hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% 2-sided confidence interval (95% CI) were computed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model (Cox regression) with treatment arm as the sole explanatory variable. Furthermore, a protocol-available population was defined and the results were compared to those obtained from the ITT population.

## Patient characteristics

## Baseline demographic data:

103 female and 185 male patients were included in the trial arm (RT+TMZ) and 109 female and 175 male  patients  were  included  in  the  RT  Only  arm.  Most  patients  were  50  years  or  older  and  had  a performance status of 0 or 1. Median age of patients was 55 (range 18-70) and 56 (range 23-70) years in the trial and in the control arm. Baseline disease characteristics are resumed in table 3:

## Concomitant medication

Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis during the concomitant phase was mandatory in all patients receiving concomitant daily temozolomide regardless of lymphocyte count.  If lymphopenia occurred, the PCP prophylaxis was  continued until lymphopenia recovered to &lt;= grade 1. Antiemetic therapy was used for patients receiving temozolomide. Corticosteroid usage was similar in both trial groups during the trial period. Antiepileptic agents like valproic acid were allowed to be used during the trial.

## Efficacy Results

The hazard ratio for overall survival was 1.59 (95% CI for HR=1.33-1.91). Kaplan Meier estimates of the survival distributions show an improvement achieved with RT + TMZ compared to RT alone. The median overall survival is 14.6 months for the trial arm and 12.1 months for the control arm. The oneyear-survival was 61% for the RT + TMZ arm and 50% for the RT Only arm. The most significant results were obtained for the 2 year survival which was 26% for the RT + TMZ arm and 10 % for the RT Only arm.

## Clinical studies in special populations / Examination of subgroups

The EORTC trial showed improvement for temozolomide in rather all subgroups. Those patients classified having ECOG performance status 2 showed less or no improvement.

## Discussion of clinical efficacy

The EORTC trial 26981/2298 is a well designed and adequately sized study. However, this study does not distinguish the relative contribution of  drug  administration  during  radiotherapy  from  the contribution  of  monotherapy,  as  the  ideal  design  would  have  been  a  4  arm  trial  (better  still  a  2x2 factorial). Nevertheless,  the  results show  significant  and  consistent,  thus  convincing  efficacy, supporting  the  beneficial  effect  of  temozolomide  administered  concomitantly  with  radiotherapy followed by monotherapy in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Superior overall survival  and  progression-free  survival  compared  with  treatment  with  radiotherapy  alone  have  been demonstrated.  The  median  survival  improvement  from  12.09  to  14.59  months  is  less  impressive, although  highly  significant,  than  the  more  than  double  (26  vs.  10%)  survival  at  2  years  or  more. According to the Kaplan-Meier plots the survival curves diverge during approximately 28 months.

Patients outcome was assessed for patients with brain biopsy only and with debulking therapy. Following a CHMP request the MAH provided additional data on the outcome of patients with debulking therapy with either partial resection or with complete resection demonstrating that treatment with temozolomide concomitant to radiotherapy (RT + TMZ) and subsequent monotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) subjects was superior to radiotherapy alone (RT Only) with respect to overall survival across all resected patients regardless of the extent of resection.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The overall survival results is consistent in all subgroups analysed with the exception of those with a poor performance status (ECOG PS=2). It raises some concern whether this subgroup should be treated with temozolomide. However no unacceptable safety issues were identified in this group of patients.

Comparison  of  the  two  treatment  arms  with  respect  to  quality  of  life  was  one  of  the  secondary objectives of the study. However quality of life was not assessed by the MAH during the trialQuality of life data of temozolomide such as assessed in the EORTC Trial 26981/22981 should be provided and  be  in  support  of  the  reported  improvement  in  progression-free  and  overall  survival.  A  small negative impact of quality of life was seen in patients treated with combined radio- and chemotherapy. A positive influence on QOL could not be proven. However, a benefit in overall survival is important in  the  treatment  of  glioblastoma  multiforme  with  a  very  limited  prognosis.  The  final  report  will  be provided by the applicant when it is accepted for publication

## Clinical Safety

## Patient exposure

More than 80% of patients received between &gt;90 and 120 % of the planned dosage of temozolomide (% of 75mg/m 2 /day for 42 days) during the concomitant phase.

Of the 237 patients who received &gt; 90% of the intended dose intensity, 22 subjects had to interrupt due to toxicity or for reasons unrelated to study drug.

RT+TMZ= radiotherapy plus temozolomide, N(%)= Number (percentage) of subjects

## Extent of exposure to radiotherapy

Of the 285 subjects int the RT Only arm, 256 subjects (90%) received between &gt;90% and 110% of the intended RT dose, 22 subjects (8%) received ≤ 90% of the intended dose and 7 (3%) subjects did not receive radiotherapy. Reasons for subjects receiving ≤ 90% was premature discontinuation due to worsening clinical status or radiological progression. Reasons for not receiving radiotherapy were subject´s refusal (N=5) and disease progression and other reason (N=1 each).

## Temozolomide Exposure, Monotherapy Phase

Generally more than 70% of subjects received temozolomide approximately every 28 days according to the protocol.

Across all 6 cycles, the monotherapy temozolomide dose was reduced for 4% to 9% of the subjects and dosing was delayed for 13% to 25% of the subjects. During cycles 1 and 2, the dose reductions and delays were primarily for nontreatment related reasons, such as physician subject, and/or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

institutional errors, administrative issues, subject's personal reasons and subject's health, During cycles 3-6, the percentage of subjects with dose reductions and delays were primarily due to hematological toxicity. While the percentage of dose delays due to hematological toxicity increased in the later cycles, the protocol-specified dose could be delivered on schedule for the majority of subjects during the monotherapy phase.

## Adverse events

Adverse events during the Concomitant Phase

Adverse events were reported in 91% and 92 % of the subjects in the RT Only and RT+TMZ arms, respectively. Severe/life threatening events were reported in 26% and 28% of the subjects in the RT Only and RT+TMZ arms, respectively.

The most frequently reported adverse events and their incidence in the RT Only and RT +TMZ arms respectively were: alopecia (63% vs. 69%), fatigue, (49% vs. 54 %), nausea (16% vs. 36%), vomiting (6% vs. 20 %), headache (17% vs. 19%), rash (15% vs. 19%), anorexia (9% vs. 19%) and constipation (6% vs. 18%).

Severe /life-threatening AEs were reported infrequently during the concomitant phase. The most common, with their incidence in the RT Only and RT+TMZ arms, respectively, were: fatigue (5% vs. 7%), convulsions (3% vs. 3%), thrombocytopenia (0 vs. 3%) and headache (4% vs. 2%).

Adverse events during the Monotherapy phase

Adverse  events  were  reported  in  92%  of  the  patients  during  the  monotherapy  phase,  with  37% reporting  severe/life-threatening  events,  consistent  with  the  safety  profile  seen  in  the  concomitant phase.

Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity (CTC grade 1 or 2). The most common AEs were:  fatigue:  (61%),  alopecia  (55%),  nausea  (49%),  vomiting  (29%),  anorexia  (27%)  headache (23%), constipation (22%), rash (13%), convulsions (11%) and diarrhea (10%).

The most common severe/life-threatening AEs were: fatigue (9%), headache (4%), thrombocytopenia (4%), convulsions (3%), infection (3%), weakness (2%), confusion (2%), dysphasia (2%), hemiparesis (2%), neutropenia (2%), vomiting (2%) and deep venous thrombosis NOS (2%).

Adverse events with Temozolomide for the Concomitant and Monotherapy Phases Combined

Most subjects in the RT+TMZ arm reported AEs.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Considering  the  temozolomide  concomitant  and  monotherapy  treatment,  for  both  treatment  phases together,  the  most  frequent  treatment-related  adverse  events  were  alopecia  (72%),  fatigue  (71%), nausea  (57%),  vomiting  (37%),  anorexia  (32%),  headache  (30%),  constipation  (30%),  rash  (26%), convulsions  (13%),  diarrhea  (13%),  stomatitis  (13%),  blurred  vision  (11%),  and  thrombocytopenia (10%).

Additionally, 49% of subject reported severe/life-threatening AEs. The most common of these AEs were fatigue (13%), convulsions (6%), headache (5%) and thrombocytopenia (5%).

Two confirmed cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) were noted, one in each treatment arm. Also two possible cases of PCP were noted, one in both arms.

Neutropenia  Grad 3/4 based on AE and/or laboratory results occurred in 8% of the subjects in the RT+TMZ arm. Thrombocytopenia Grade 3/4 based on AE and/or laboratory results, occured in 14 %: No subjects in the RT Only arm reported neutropenia or thrombocytopenia Grade 3 or 4. Lymphocyte counts were not collected.

## Serious adverse events and deaths

Of the 573 patients randomized to the pivotal trial, 480 subjects died at time of database lock; most of the subjects had died due to disease progression. In six subjects treated with temozolomide, death was attributed by the investigators to, or temporally associated with, serious adverse events (SAEs) considered at least possibly related to temozolomide, and occurred within 30 days of stopping therapy. These included pulmonary infection, respiratory insufficiency, aspiration pneumonitis and thrombocytopenia, pneumonia and coma, decreased consciousness and pneumonia. Thrombosis in the leg and a lung embolism were considered by SPRI to be possibly contributory in an additional patient's death.

Discontinuations  due  to  hematological  toxicity  were  observed  in  0,4%  (N=1)  of  RT  Only  treated patients and in 9% (N=26) of RT + TMZ treated patients (5,2% for hematological and 3,8% for nonhematological toxicity).

## Laboratory findings

Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are the dose-limiting toxicities for temozolomide. When the laboratory results and reports for adverse events were combined, Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutrophil abnormalities, including neutropenic events were observed in 8% of patients and Grade 3 or grade 4 platelet abnormalities, including thrombocytopenic events were observed in 14% of patients treated with temozolomide during the trial.

Elevated SGPT level occurred with an incidence of 5% in the RT+TMZ arm across the concomitant and monotherapy phases; however, increases in liver transaminases were infrequent in the relapsed glioma studies included in the original marketing application. During the concomitant phase of the EORTC study, the incidence of elevated SGPT level was 4% in the RT+TMZ arm compared with 2% in the RT Only arm. Grade 3/4 \"liver function abnormalities' in the RT+TMZ arm were more common during the concomitant phase (3%) than during the monotherapy phase (1%). In the RT Only arm, there was one subject with a Grade 3 \"liver function abnormality\" (elevated SGPT level). In addition to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, patients in the RT+TMZ arm were receiving multiple concomitant medications, including PCP prophylaxis during the concomitant phase and antiemetic therapy during the monotherapy phase. Some of these concomitant medications are also associated with abnormal liver function tests, therefore conclusions regarding the relationship of these laboratory abnormalities to temozolomide treatment are difficult.

## Safety in special populations

No differences were observed concerning influence of age of patients on the safety of temozolomide. Among subjects receiving RT+TMZ, more female subjects than male subjects reported alopecia (78% vs 64%), nausea (50% vs 29%), anorexia (29 vs 14%), vomiting (25% vs 17%) and radiation injury (12% vs 4%).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Discussion of safety

The  safety  profile  of  temozolomide  is  well  known  from  other  clinical  trials  and  from  the  clinical experience of treatment of patients with GBM showing recurrence or progression. The overall pattern of events during the monotherapy  phase was consistent with the known  safety profile of temozolomide.

The dose-limiting factor for temozolomide is hematological toxicity. No medical important new safety findings were made during the trial. The dosage used for the monotherapy treatment phase during the trial  is  consistent  with  the  recommended  dosage  for  the  licensed  indication,  treatment  of  advanced GBM. It was to be expected that frequency of adverse events was higher in the RT+TMZ arm than in the RT Only arm. PCP prophylaxis was required during the concomitant phase and is recommended when temozolomide is administered with radiotherapy. This is already reflected in Section 4.4 of the SPC.

## Benefit - risk assessment

The  results of the EORTC  trial  have  demonstrated  a  significant efficacy  for  temozolomide administrated as concomitant and subsequent monotherapy for the treatment of patients suffering from newly diagnosed GBM.

Concerning  the  investigated  clinical  endpoints  of  overall  survival  and  progression  free  survival, clinical  benefit  was  shown  for  the  RT  +  TMZ  arm  in  comparison  to  the  RT  Only  arm:  The  2-year survival for the trial arm was 26% in comparison to 10% for the control arm. Median progression free survival was improved in the trial arm: 6,9 months for patients with RT + TMZ treatment and 4,98 months for patients with RT Only therapy. For the indication of GBM with a poor prognosis, this is a small  but  relevant  clinical  benefit.  Side  effects  and  toxicity  of  treatment  are  well  known  and  are acceptable.
