## I. SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

## 1.1 Introduction

Following a request from the EMEA regarding the obligation to submit all paediatric data, the MAH submitted  the  results  two  Phase  I  studies,  including  pharmacokinetic  data,  and  one  clinical  doseranging study of ibersartan in paediatric patients with hypertension. Further to the assessment of these data, the CHMP requested an update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SPC.

The MAH has applied to update the SPC in line with the conclusions adopted by the CHMP on 14 December 2005, with the exception of the wording for section 4.8. In addition, the MAH has proposed a minor change to the wording of a sentence in section 2 of the PL for clarity. Also, to be in alignment with the QRD templates, the MAH would like to make a correction in the section 9 of the SmPC of the film-coated tablets.

## 1.2 Clinical aspects

The MAH has submitted 2 pharmacokinetic studies in hypertensive children and adolescents and 1 study assessing the dose-response relationship in hypertensive patients aged 6 - 16 years - see table below.

## Study CV131076

Study CV131076 was an open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of irbesartan capsules (12.5, 25, 37.5, 50, 75 and 100 mg) in hypertensive children and adolescents. The secondary objective  was  to  evaluate  the  change  from  baseline  in  seated  systolic  (SeSBP)  and  diastolic  blood pressure (SeDBP) on days 1 and 29 of the second study period. The study had 2 treatment periods. In period A subjects were withdrawn from antihypertensive medication for 7 days (or 14 days if a longer washout  period  was  needed).  A  stable  dose  of  nifedipine  and/or  hidrochlorotiazide  was  allowed  if

necessary. In period B, subjects received approx 2 mg/kg irbesartan qd for 4 weeks (or 2 wks if subject participation for 4 weeks was not possible) up to a maximum dose of 150 mg qd. For each individual patient the dose was kept constant throughout the study. PK sampling was performed on the first day of  period  B  and on day 15 (or on any day between days 15 and 29). The dissolution profile of the irbesartan  capsule  formulation  was  equivalent  to  that  of  irbesartan  capsule  granulation  mixed  with apple sauce. Subjects whose BP could not be adequately controlled were discontinued.

Subjects included were hypertensive male or non-pregnant female children/adolescents, 1 to 16 years of age with a SeSBP and/or SeDBP ≥ 95th percentile for the child's sex/age/height.

The primary efficacy endpoints were; AUC ∞ on day B1, AUC τ on day B15 (trapezoidal area under the concentration-time  curve  in  one  dosing  interval),  C max adjusted  to  that  of  a  70kg  adult,  Clt  t 1/2  and accumulation  index  (AUC τ on  day  B15/AUC τ on  day  B1).  Regarding safety ,  a  complete  physical examination  and  a  12-lead  ECG  were  performed  at  screening  and  prior  to  study  discharge. Additionally safety assessment was based on adverse events (AE) reports and clinical laboratory tests.

The sample size was calculated based on the 37.9% reported coefficient of variation CV(%) for AUC after 29 days of treatment from a previous study where 100 mg qd of irbesartan was administered to male  and  female  adult  subjects  with  mild  to  moderate  hypertension.  According  to  the  MAH  the proposed sample size of 24 subjects allowed approximately 95% confidence that the estimated AUC mean would differ from the true population mean by at most 16%.

## Results

Of the 23 subjects enrolled and randomised, 22 completed the study. Of those 12 were adolescents &gt;12 years, 9 were children between 6-12 years and 2 were children &lt; 6 years. The majority of them were black and all 3 age groups were balanced regarding gender.

## Pharmacokinetic results

Plasma samples were collected immediately prior to dosing, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24  hours  after  dosing  on  Days  1  and  15  (or  later).  The  samples  were  assayed  for  irbesartan  by  a validated HPLC/fluorescence method with a lower limit of quantitation of 1.0 ng/ml.

Irbesartan pk parameters and the dose-normalised AUC and Cmax were tabulated and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were constructed around the dose-adjusted mean parameter. Pk parameters were pooled by  age  groups  as  the  MAH  states  that  no  specific  trend  for  gender-related  difference  in  the  pk  of irbesartan  was  evident.  An  accurate  estimation  of  the  terminal  elimination  half-life  could  not  be obtained after the first dose because the plasma samples were collected only up to 24 hours post-dose (less than three half-lives) in most of the subjects.

The results for the 2 children &lt; 6 years included in this study have been omited. A summary of the pharmacokinetic parameters (single dose and steady state) in the 6-12 years age group and in the 13-16 years age group are shown in the tables below.

CV131-076

- 1 TAUC is TAUC(0-T) for single dose and TAUC(0-24h) for steady state.
- 3 C.I.: Confidence Interval.
- 2 The parameters CMAX and AUC were dose normalized based on the actual dose given to the subjects.

According  to  the  MAH,  pk  parameters  were  comparable  between  the  6-12  year  and  the  13-16  age groups. The absorption of irbesartan was rapid, with peak plasma concentrations attained 1.5-2 hours after dosing. Limited accumulation of irbesartan (18%) was observed in plasma upon repeated once daily dosing in these subjects.

These  plasma  concentrations  were,  in  general,  associated  with  decreases  in  SeDBP  and  SeSBP, irrespective if the subject  was  receiving  other  concomitant  antihypertensive medications  (see pharmacodynamic results).

According  to  the  MAH,  in  the  light  of  the  results  provided  a  2  mg/kg  dose  in  paediatric  patients resulted  in  an  exposure  comparable  to  that  of  adults  receiving  the  150  mg  dose.  For  reference,  the mean Cmax and AUC values of irbesartan following a single 150 mg oral in young adults (18-40 years) were 1854 ng/ml and 9715 ng/ml respectively.

In both treatment groups (patients receiving and not receiving concomitant antihypertensive medication),  the  administration  of  2  mg/kg  irbesartan  was  associated  with  decreases  in  SeSBP  and SeDBP,  except  for  2  subjects;  one  on  day  B15  (004/014)  and  one  on  day  B29  (004/003).  Subject 004/003  showed  an  increase  in  SeSBD/SeDBP  of  +35/+22  mmHg  at  B29  that  was  attributed  to medication non-compliance.

Mean decreases in SeSBD/SeDBP for the 12 subjects that did not receive concomitant antihypertensive therapy were -8/-7 and -16/-10 mmHg after 14 and 28 days of dosing with ibersartan, respectively, while the 11 subjects who continued to receive concomitant antihypertensive therapy had additional mean decreases in SeSBD/SeDBP of -5/-8 and -5/-4 mmHg after 14 and 28 days of dosing with ibersartan, respectively.

## Safety

There  were  14  AEs  reported  by  9  subjects.  The  most  frequently  reported  were  headache  and pahryngitis;  2  headaches  (1  reported  as  severe)  were  judged  as  possibly  related  to  the  study  drug. Urinary red blood cells was the most frequently reported laboratory abnormality in 3 out of 14 notified marked abnormalities. There were no deaths and no subjects discontinued from the study because of vital sign, ECG or laboratory abnormalities.

## Study CV131154

This  was  a  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  dose-ranging  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and effectiveness of 3 irbesartan oral tablet dose regimens in the treatment of children (6 years - Tanner stage &lt; 3) and adolescents (Tanner stage ≥ 3 - &lt; 17 years) with hypertension or high-normal BP. After a lead-in period lasting a maximum of 14 days (Period A), patients were randomised to one of three doses of irbesartan (0.5, 1.5 or 4.5 mg/kg) that they received for 3 weeks (Period B). Then patients were  re-assigned  at  random  to  either  placebo  or  irbesartan  at  the  dose  taken  previously  during  a maximum period of 4 weeks (Period C). In adittion, for safety reasons, a 6 month open-label extension was also included (period D). The study 4 study periods are described below in more detail:

Period A: During this lead-in  period,  previous  antihypertensive  therapy  and  prohibited  concomitant medications were withdrawn. At all visits during the study, BP measurements were obtained using the Device for Indirect Noninvasive Automatic Mean Arterial Pressure (DINAMAP).

Period  B:  Subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to  double-blind  treatment  with  one  of  3  irbesartan regimens (see study scheme). Following the initial dose, subjects showing signs/symptoms associated with hypotension or decreases of ≥ 20 mmHg from baseline in SeSBP/SeDBP were to be discontinued from the study. Study medication was titrated up to the assigned target dose after the first week (Visit B8); this  dose  was  continued  for  the  remaining  2  weeks  of Period  B.  Subjects  who  were  unable to tolerate up-titration to the assigned target dose were eligible for open-label therapy (Period D).

Period  C:  Subjects  were  re-assigned  to  either  placebo  or  irbesartan  at  the  assigned  target  dose  last taken during Period B. BP measurements were taken at the end of Week 1 and Week 2. Subjects who discontinued  from  Period  C  could  be  enrolled  directly  into  Period  D,  if  the  investigator  felt  that continuing in Period C was no longer in the best interest of the subject, the subject experienced an increase in BP, or if the subject showed clinical signs or symptoms of uncontrolled hypertension.

Period  D:  Subjects  who  completed  Period  C  and  subjects  who  met  the  Period  B  or  Period  C discontinuation criteria for direct enrolment into Period D entered the open-label extension period of 26 weeks. Subjects were reintroduced to irbesartan at 0.5 mg/kg. After the initial dose of open-label treatment, irbesartan could be titrated from 0.5 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg to achieve BP control. The dose could be titrated again from 1.5 mg/kg to 4.5 mg/kg 24 ± 3 hours after the previous titration. Irbesartan doses  were  adjusted  upward  or  downward  as  needed  throughout  Period  D.  The  use  of  adjunctive antihypertensive agents was allowed only during Period D.

The primary  objective was  to  evaluate  the  dose-response  relationship  in  change  from  baseline  in trough  SeSBP  at  the  end  of  treatment  Period  B  with  low,  medium,  or  high  doses  of  irbesartan. Secondary objectives were; i) to evaluate the change in trough SeSBP for irbesartan (all 3 dose levels combined) versus placebo from the end of treatment Period B to the end of the Period C. ii) to evaluate the dose-response relationship in change from baseline in trough SeDBP at the end of Period B. iii) to evaluate the change in trough SeDBP for irbesartan (all three dose levels combined) versus placebo from the end of Period B to the end of Period C. iv) to evaluate the percentage of subjects who reach a target BP of &lt; 90th percentile for both SeSBP and SeDBP at the end of the treatment Period B v) to assess the safety and tolerability of irbesartan in the paediatric population (Periods B and C and D).

The target  population included  children  and  adolescents  (male  and  female,  aged  6  -  16  years inclusive) with hypertension (SeSBP or SeDBP ≥ 95th percentile for age, gender, and height) or with high-normal BP (SeSBP or SeDBP ≥ 90 to &lt; 95th percentile for age, gender, and height) and either diabetes mellitus, or family history of hypertension, or any other condition for which, in the opinion of the  investigator,  the  reduction  of  BP  would  be  in  the  best  interest  of  the  child  or  adolescent.  Study participants  entering  the  study  based  on  hypertension  criteria  were  to  have  3  qualifying  BP measurements ≥ 95 th percentile for gender, age, and height.

The sample size was based on the primary analysis, which tested linear trend across the low, medium, and high doses of irbesartan in adjusted mean change from baseline in through SeSBP after 3 weeks of double-blind  treatment  during  period  B.  During  the  course  of  the  study,  the  number  of  adolescents exceeded  the  planned  number.  To  keep  the  intended  children:adolescent  balance  as  per  the  FDA request the planned number of 189 evaluable subjects was increased to 270 (90 per dose level). This number would provide a power of 80% to detect a significant trend across the 3 dose groups assuming the  smaller  difference  of  5.0  mmHg  between  high  and low  groups.  A  standard  deviation  of  change

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

from  baseline  in  SeSBP  of  12  mmHg  was  assumed.  A  10%  dropout  rate  between  the  original randomisation and the end of Period B was factored in.

Doses of irbesartan were selected based on the adult daily dose, the comparable pk profile between children and adults observed in the CV131076 study and the safety of irbesartan.

a Maximum allowable dose

The primary efficacy outcome measure was the change from baseline in trough SeSBP at Week 3 of Period B. The most important secondary efficacy outcome measure was the change in trough SeSBP from the end of Period B to the end (Week 2) of Period C. Other efficacy measurements were the changes from original baseline at each visit in trough SeSBP and SeDBP, and the number of subjects normalised at each visit during the study. Normalised (target) BP was when the trough SeSBP and SeDBP were each less than the respective 90th percentile for a subject's age, gender, and height.

The primary statistical analysis was  a  test  for  linear  trend  across  the  3  dose  groups  with  respect  to changes from baseline in trough SeSBP at Week 3 of Period B. The analysis was carried out using a linear  contrast  applied  to  the  adjusted  mean  changes  from  an  ANCOVA  model  having  a  term  for group and baseline value as covariate. As this test was not significant, a comparison of the changes in trough SeSBP between the two groups, any placebo and any irbesartan, from the end of Period B to Week 2 of Period C was carried out to evaluate the effect of withdrawal from irbesartan over the 2week  period.  This  comparison  was  also  carried  out  for  changes  in  trough  SeDBP  using  a  similar ANCOVA model. Missing efficacy  assessments  were  not  imputed  in  any  way  except  for  the  lastobservation-carried-forward (LOCF) analyses. Thus, subjects were excluded from treatment comparisons of changes from baseline at any visit for which they had a missing baseline value and/or a missing assessment at that visit. Similarly, the proportion of therapeutic responders at each visit was based only on those subjects with available BP values at that visit. Since the number of subjects who discontinued  from  Period  B  in  each  of  the  treatment  groups  was  less  than  10%  of  the  number randomised to the group, LOCF analyses were not performed.

## Results

A total  of  441  subjects  were  enrolled  into  the  study.  The  figure  below  shows  the  disposition  of  all randomised patients.

N = mumber of subjects randomized into Period C

n =mumber of subjects with available efficacy data at Week 2 (Period C)

From the end of Period B to Week 2 of Period C small mean changes in SeSBP and SeDBP were noted in the group remaining on irbesartan, whereas increases of 2.4 mmHg and 2.0 mmHg for SeSBP and SeDBP, respectively, were observed in the group withdrawn from irbesartan (Any Placebo).

The proportion of subjects reaching target BP at the end of Week 3 in Period B was 55% in the 0.5/0.5 mg/kg group, 41% in the 0.5/1.5 mg/kg group, and 51% in the 1.5/4.5 mg/kg group. By the end of Period C, only 35% of subjects randomised to placebo achieved target BP, whereas 46% of subjects remaining on irbesartan achieved target BP.

For  Period  D,  when  all  irbesartan  subjects  were  combined,  starting  on  0.5  mg/kg  and  titrating  as required, the mean reductions from original baseline were between 12.3 and 16.4 mmHg for trough SeSBP and between 4.1 and 5.6 mmHg for SeDBP at the various timepoints over a 26-week period. Proportions of subjects reaching target BP ranged from 53%-66%. These proportions were sometimes comparable to and sometimes slightly higher than the proportions reaching target BP during Period B.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

No  deaths  were  reported  during  the  study.  One  subject  in  Period  B  and  two  subjects  in  Period  C experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) during double-blind therapy. One subject was discontinued from  Period  B  because  of  an  SAE  (erythema  multiforme)  attributed  to  irbesartan.  SAEs  in  two subjects  (diabetic  ketoacidosis  and  syncope)  were  categorised  as  unrelated  and  unlikely  related  to study drug.

AEs in Period B led to discontinuation of study drug in 8 subjects; 4 subjects were enrolled directly in Period D and 4 subjects discontinued the study. Hypotension led to discontinuation of study drug in 5 subjects and was reported as severe in 3 of them. Another subject was discontinued from Period B because of dizziness and enrolled in Period D.

Period B : Headache of mild to moderate intensity was the most frequently reported AE, occurring in 14.5% of subjects receiving any irbesartan treatment. Other AEs that occurred in ≥ 3% of subjects in any  treatment  group  were  upper  respiratory  infection  (URI),  nasopharyngitis  (both  considered unrelated) and cough. AEs in 44 (13.8%) subjects receiving any irbesartan treatment were attributed to the study drug. Headache (25 subjects; 7.9%) was most frequently reported AE categorised as related to irbesartan; other related AEs were hypotension (2.2%), dizziness (1.9%) and cough (0.9%).

Period C :  The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  greater  in  the  placebo  group  (32.9%)  than  in  subjects treated  with  any  irbesartan  (26.8%).  Among  the  irbesartan  treatment  groups,  the  incidence  of  AEs appeared to increase with each dose of irbesartan, a trend not observed for the related AEs. Headache was the most common AE reported during Period C. The incidence of study drug-related headache was  similar  in  the  placebo  subjects  (5.5%)  and  in  the  combined  irbesartan-treated  subjects  (5.4%). Three  subjects  receiving  irbesartan  had  mild  elevations  of  blood  potassium  levels,  which  resolved spontaneously within 13 to 89 days post onset. Other AEs that occurred in ≥ 3  % of subjects in any treatment group were cough, nasopharyngitis, URI, and pharyngitis.

Period D : The following table presents a summary of AEs during Period D.

Subsets of all AEs: Subjects maybe represented in more than one AE category.

SAEs were generally of mild to moderate intensity and deemed by the investigator as unrelated or not likely  related  to  irbesartan.  One  subject  discontinued  the  study  because  of  mild  elevations  of  blood bilirubin  categorised  as  possibly  related  to  irbesartan.  Consistent  with  the  double-blind  treatment phase,  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  were  headache  (27.2%),  and  nasopharyngitis  (10.5%). Generally, headache was of mild to moderate intensity, although in 3 subjects (1.0%), headache was categorised as severe. It was also the most frequently occurring AE that was categorised as related to study  drug  (39  subjects;  13.3%).  Other  AEs  that  occurred  in ≥ 3  %  of  subjects  were:  URI,  cough, rhinitis, dizziness, pharyngitis, epistaxis, and viral infection.

## Laboratory Evaluations:

Period B :  During Period B, laboratory marked abnormalities (MAs) were most commonly observed for serum creatinine (ie, &gt;1.5 times pretreatment) and creatine kinase (CK, ie, &gt; 4 times pretreatment). In 3 subjects, creatinine marked abnormalities (MA) continued into Period C. Creatinine returned to baseline levels at the end of Period C in 1 subject, and 2 subjects did not continue in the study beyond Period  B.  Six  subjects  had  elevated  CK  levels  that  met  the  MA  criteria.  There  were  no  reports  of concurrent myalgia, muscle aches, or myositis in any of the subjects.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Period C: Four subjects, 3 assigned to placebo and 1 subject in the irbesartan high-dose group, had elevated  CK  levels  that  met  the  MA  criteria.  There  were  no  reports  of  concurrent  myalgia,  muscle aches or myositis in any of the subjects. Four subjects (2 placebo group and 2 irbesartan 1.5 mg/kg group) had creatinine levels that met the MA criteria.

Period D: The most frequently observed MAs during Period D were elevated creatinine levels (19 subjects;  6.5%).  Generally,  creatinine  MAs  did  not  exceed  the  laboratory  reference  range.  In  12 subjects, creatinine MAs were single occurrences that returned to baseline levels at the end of Period D. In one subject creatinine increased from baseline, 0.7 mg/dl, to 3.0 mg/dl at the end of open-label dosing.  Fourteen  subjects  (4.8%)  had  low  haemoglobin  (Hb)  levels  that  met  the  MA  criteria  (ie,  &gt; 3g/dl  decrease  from  pretreatment).  In  8  subjects,  Hb  MAs  were  single  occurrences  and  returned  to baseline levels at the end of open-label treatment. Five subjects also had low Hb MAs during Period B or Period C. Six subjects (2.0%) were found to have MAs of CK at the end of open-label treatment. There were no associated AEs of myalgia, muscle aches, or myositis.

## Discussion

## Efficacy

Limited pharmacokinetic data of irbesartan in children and adolescents were obtained from a small study of 23 hypertensive children and adolescents (CV131076) with an inadequate representation of children under 6 years of age. Although some PK parameters of interest, like Cmin and T1/2, were not evaluated, the results showed that Cmax, AUC and clearance rates were comparable to those observed in adults receiving 150 mg irbesartan daily. A limited accumulation of irbesartan (18%) in plasma was observed upon repeated once daily dosing. A brief summary of these findings has been included in section 5.2 of the SPC.

Regarding pharmacodynamic effects in study CV131076, greater reductions in SBP and DBP were observed in  patients  taking  concomitant  antihypertensive  medication.  These  drugs  probably  did  not affect  the  pharmacokinetics  of  irbesartan  but  a  possible  effect  of  these  antihypertensive  on  the reduction  of  BP  observed  in  this  trial  cannot  be  ruled  out.  Thus,  this  study  provides  no  conclusive information on the pharmacodynamics of irbesartan in children and adolescents.

Study CV131154 was a dose ranging clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of a range of doses of irbesartan in 318 children and adolescents with hypertension or borderline hypertension. The analysis of the main endpoint showed a positive effect of irbesartan on the reduction of SeSBP at the end of the double-blind period. This effect was not dose-dependent and a similar reduction of SeSBP was observed with the 3 doses administered (-11.7 mm Hg for the lowest dose, -9.3 with the medium dose and -13.2 with the highest dose). As this period did not include a placebo arm it is difficult to know whether this flat response to irbesartan was due to the fact that all doses selected were in the flat portion of the dose-response curve or to a relative lack of efficacy of irbesartan in this population.

When the effect of irbesartan both in SeSBP and SeDBP was analysed over the subsequent 2-week period where patients were re-randomised to either irbesartan or placebo, an increase in trough SeSBP and SeDBP towards baseline was observed. The placebo group showed a 2.3 mm Hg greater increase in  the  adjusted  mean  change for SeSBP and SeDBP versus irbesartan. Although the difference was statistically significant, the small magnitude of the effect casts doubt on the true effect of irbesartan on BP in hypertensive children, suggesting that irbesartan would not constitute a useful antihypertensive regimen for paediatric patients. These findings have been included in section 5.1 of the SPC.

Regarding the responder rate, 55%, 41% and 51% of patients in the low, middle and high dose groups, respectively,  reached  the  target  BP  at  the  end  of  Week  3  in  Period  B  reflecting  the  lack  of  doseresponse  relationship.  At  the  end  of  Period  C,  35%  of  subjects  randomised  to  placebo  and  46%  of subjects  remaining  on  irbesartan  achieved  target  BP.  These  results  are  in  line  with  the  data  on  BP reduction.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To conclude, the efficacy results from this study are inconclusive and cannot determine the adequate therapeutic doses to be administered in hypertensive children. Moreover, these results do not establish the efficacy of irbesartan in hypertensive children and adolescents and are insufficient to support the use of irbesartan in children, as reflectected in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SPC.

## Safety

Overall,  the  incidences  of  AEs  and  related  AEs  did  not  appear  to  be  dose  related.  The  following related  AEs  occurred  in  the  3-week  double-blind  phase:  headache  (7.9%),  hypotension  (2.2%), dizziness  (1.9%),  cough  (0.9%).  Mean  changes  from  baseline  in  standard  laboratory  tests  within treatment  groups  were  generally  small  and  clinically  unremarkable;  the  most  frequent  laboratory abnormalities observed n the 26-week open-label period of this trial were creatinine increases (6.5%) and elevated CK values (2%). This information has been included in section 4.8 of the SPC.

## Conclusions and benefit risk assessment

Only  limited  information  on  the  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  of  irbesartan  in  children and adolescents has been provided. Results from the dose-ranging study showed a positive effect of irbesartan on the reduction of BP but this effect was not dose-dependent. When the effect on BP was analysed  in  the  withdrawal  period,  an  increase  in  BP  towards  baseline  was  observed.  The  placebo group showed a 2.3 mm Hg greater increase in the adjusted mean change for systolic and diastolic blood pressure versus irbesartan. This difference was statistically significant, but its magnitude was small,  casting  doubt  on  the  true  effect  of  irbesartan  in  hypertensive  children.  These  results  are insufficient  both  to  demonstrate  the  efficacy  of  irbesartan  on  hypertensive  children  and  adolescents and to determine the adequate therapeutic doses to be administered in this population.

The  adverse  events  seem  to  be  similar  to  those  reported  in  adults  receiving  irbesartan  but  data  on safety in children is still limited.

In summary, the data provided on the effect of irbesartan in children and adolescents are limited and insufficient to support the use of irbesartan in children. However, the CHMP considers that it would be useful for practising paediatricians to have a summary of the data from the studies included in the SPC (sections 5.1 5.2, 4.8 and 4.2), provided that a statement explaining that existing data are insufficient to recommend its use in children is included in sections 4.2. and 4.4. of the SPC. Therefore, the SmPC has been updated to reflect the data provided, in accordance with the currently approved Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics (October 2005).
