## 1. Scientific discussion

## 1.1. Introduction

## About the product

Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody which binds to both soluble and transmembrane forms of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF α ) and inhibits TNF α bioactivity. Simponi was authorised in the EU on 1 October 2009 for the treatment of adults who have responded inadequately to previous therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in combination with MTX; active and progressive PsA, alone or in combination with MTX; and severe, active AS.

The currently approved dose in RA is: 50 mg given once a month, on the same date each month. Simponi should be given concomitantly with MTX. For PsA and AS, the approved dose is 50 mg given once a month.

Across all indications, in patients weighing more than 100 kg who do not achieve an adequate clinical response after 3 or 4 doses, increasing the dose of golimumab to 100 mg once a month may be considered. Continued therapy should be reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of therapeutic benefit after receiving 3 to 4 additional doses of 100 mg.

## Scope of the variation

With this Type II variation, the applicant proposes the following addition to the indication section 4.1 (underlined text is the wording applied for in this variation):

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

Simponi, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for:

-  the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients not previously treated with MTX.
-  the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients when the response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy including MTX has been inadequate.

Simponi has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by Xray and to improve physical function, when given in combination with methotrexate.

The applicant also proposes related additions of study data in section 5.1.

Available safety data up to at least 2 years are also assessed within the current variation. In addition, the MAH has proposed changes to the product information related to the revised SmPC guideline and the implementation of the most recent QRD template. Furthermore, an updated EURMP (v.3.0, dated 24 February 2010) has been submitted.

## Information on Paediatric requirements

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA decision (P/84/2010) on a paediatric investigation plan with a deferral and with a waiver.

The following conditions are covered in the paediatric investigation plan:

-  Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
-  Psoriatic arthritis
-  Ankylosing spondylitis
-  Rheumatoid arthritis

The PIP is not yet completed.

## 1.2. Clinical aspects

## General Comments on Compliance with GCP

The Clinical trials submitted in support of this variation were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

Furthermore, the applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

## 1.2.1. Clinical pharmacology

Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody with an immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 heavy chain isotype (G1m allotype) and a kappa light chain isotype. Golimumab binds with high affinity to both soluble and transmembrane forms of tumor necrosis factor alpha and inhibits TNF bioactivity.

## 1.2.2. Clinical efficacy

## Main studies

## Introduction

The submitted documentation consists of results from two of the Phase 3 RA studies, (C0524T05 and C0524T06) including 6- plus 12 month efficacy and safety data (already evaluated in the initial submission), new 1-year radiographic data (study C0524T05 and C0524T06), as well as 2 year safety data.

In the response to the 1 st  RSI, the MAH has provided 104-week radiographic analyses from the RA studies C0524T05 and C0524T06.

In response to the 2 nd RSI and to address the major objections still outstanding, the MAH provided retrospective efficacy analyses of study C0524T05 in a subset of patients representative of the applied for indication (i.e. patients with severe, active and progressive RA). In addition, a comparision of golimumab data in this subset of patients with data from another TNF-inhibitor, infliximab (Remicade) has been provided.

## Study C0524T05 (GO-BEFORE)

## Methods

This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-arm, parallel-group study with the aim to assess the efficacy, safety, and clinical pharmacology of golimumab alone or in combination with MTX in MTX-naïve subjects (and no prior treatment with an anti-TNF agent), who had RA for at least 3 months.

Active RA was defined as persistent disease activity with at least 4 swollen and 4 tender joints at the time of screening and baseline and met at least 2 of the following 4 criteria: CRP ≥ 1.5 mg/dL, ESR ≥ 28 mm; Morning stiffness of ≥ 30 minutes; Bone erosion by x-ray and/or MRI prior to first administration of study agent; anti-CCP antibody-positive or RF-positive at screening.

The study design excluded subjects with other inflammatory diseases; who had previously been treated with anti-TNF α therapy at any time and/or received disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)/systemic immunosuppressives; intra-articular, IM, or IV corticosteroids; or anakinra within 4 weeks prior to the first study dose were to be excluded from participation.

## Treatment

Four treatment groups were used:

- 1) Placebo+MTX, 2) Golimumab 100mg+placebo, 3) Golimumab 50mg+MTX or 4) Golimumab 100mg+MTX.

Golimumab was administered as sc injection every 4 week. MTX was to be administered orally at a dose of 10 mg/week starting at week 0, with dose escalation to 20 mg/week by Week 8.

Early escape: At Week 28, any subject with &lt;20% improvement from baseline in both swollen and tender joint counts could enter early escape in a double-blinded fashion.

Two distinct periods were applied:

- 1) Double-blind, placebo-controlled period (Weeks 0 through 52), including early escape at Week 28. This period has been completed.
- 2) Long-term extension period (Weeks 52 through 268). Open-label after the Week 52. This period has been completed through Week 104.

Figure 1 Study schema Panel A shows study treatments; Panel B shows key time points during the

study.

The primary objective: Efficacy of golimumab in subjects with active RA who have not been previously treated with MTX as measured by reduction of the signs and symptoms at Week 24 and Inhibition of progression of structural damage at Week 52.

## Two co-primary endpoints were used:

- 1) The proportion of subjects achieving ACR 50 response at Week 24.
- 2) Change from baseline in van der Heijde Modified Sharp (vdH-S) score at Week 52.

## ACR 50 response was reached if the following was achieved:

1. Improvement of ≥ 50% from baseline in both the swollen joint count (66 joints) and tender joint count (68 joints) and
2. Improvement of ≥ 50% from baseline in ≥ 3 of the following 5 assessments:
- a. Patient's assessment of pain
- b. Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity
- c. Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity
- d. Patient's assessment of physical function as measured by the HAQ disabilityindex
- e. CRP

The total vdH-S score is the sum of joint erosion score and joint-space narrowing (JSN) (van der Heijde et al, 1992).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Joint erosion score:  Each joint is scored according to the surface area involved, from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no erosion and 5 indicating extensive loss of bone from more than one half of the articulating bone. Therefore, the maximum erosion score for a hand joint is 5 and the total maximum erosion score for hands is 160. Because each side of a foot joint is graded on the scale of 0 to 5, the maximum erosion score for a foot joint is 10 and the total maximum erosion score for feet is 120. Thus, the maximal erosion score is 280. Joint-space narrowing (JSN) score: The JSN score summarizes the severity of JSN in 30 joints of the hands and 12 joints of the feet. Assessment of JSN, including subluxation, is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (bony ankylosis or complete luxation). Therefore, the maximum JSN score for a hand joint as well as a foot joint is 4, and the maximal JSN score is 168. The maximal erosion score of 280 combined with the maximal JSN score of 168 gives worst possible vdH-S score as 448. Major secondary endpoint: Change from baseline in van der Heijde Modified Sharp (vdH-S) score at Week 52 in subjects with abnormal CRP at baseline. Other secondary endpoints were: Major Clinical Response (MCR), i.e. meeting ACR 70 response criteria continuously for 6 month.

Change from baseline in HAQ (physical function) at week 52 and 104.

Statistical methods Descriptive summary statistics, such as n, mean, SD, median, interquartile range, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for discrete variables were used to summarize data. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test or chi-square test was to be used as appropriate to compare the proportion of subjects responding to treatment. Continuous response parameters were to be compared using an analysis of variance on the van der Waerden normal scores (Conover, 1980). All statistical tests were 2 sided and performed at α = 0.050. In addition to statistical analyses, graphical data displays (eg, line plots) and subject listings were also used to summarize or present the data. In the analyses of efficacy endpoints, the first test compared the combined golimumab + MTX group versus placebo + MTX. If the results were significant, then pairwise comparisons were performed between each golimumab treatment group (50 mg + MTX, 100 mg + MTX, and 100 mg + placebo) and placebo + MTX. All statistical testing was 2-tailed, at a significance level of 0.050. Dataset for analysis: Prespecified efficacy analyses were based on randomized subjects. The primary efficacy and selected secondary efficacy analyses were based on all subjects who were randomized at Week 0. Subjects were to be included in the efficacy analyses according to their assigned treatment group regardless of whether they received the assigned treatment. After unblinding the data, an additional analysis was performed. This analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of having included subjects who were randomized but not treated in the primary analysis. Accordingly, an analysis similar to the primary analysis was conducted using a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, which excluded those subjects who were randomized but did not receive treatment. A last-observation carried forward (LOCF) procedure was to be used to impute the missing ACR components if subjects had data for at least one ACR components at Week 24.  In the primary analysis of structural damage data linear extrapolation was used to impute 52 week ratings for patients escaping early at 28 weeks, provided that at least two ratings were available. Otherwise,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the imputations were based on median ratings from all patients in the same CRP stratum. In alternative sensitivity analyses the LOCF approach and an approach where patients were analysed as randomised ignoring the early escape were used.

## Results

A total of 637 subjects were randomized. The figure below shows subject disposition at Week 54; randomized subjects.

There were 28 (17.5%) subjects who met the criteria for EE at Week 28 in the placebo + MTX treatment group. Additionally, 22 (14.0%) subjects in the golimumab 100 mg + placebo and 20 (12.7%) subjects in the golimumab 50 mg + MTX treatment groups also qualified for EE.

Subject disposition at Week 52; randomized subjects

Through Week 52, discontinuation of SC study agent occurred in 12.6% of randomized subjects and discontinuation of oral study agent occurred in 13.2% of randomized subjects. Treatment groups were generally well balanced with respect to the overall proportions of subjects who discontinued SC and/or oral study agent. The main reason for discontinuation of either the SC or oral study agent was AEs for all treatment groups. Golimumab + MTX treatment groups had a greater proportion of subjects that discontinued either SC or oral study agent due to AEs.

## Study Participants

Median age was 50 years, the majority of subjects were women (82.9%), and the study population was predominantly Caucasian (72.4%). Patients had moderate disease, with most subjects having relatively short duration of disease (median from 1.0 to 1.8 years), although some subjects had long disease duration. The mean number of swollen joints at baseline ranged from approximately 15 to 16 and the mean number of tender joints ranged from approximately 27 to 29.

Treatment groups were generally well balanced with respect to baseline disease characteristics, and similar with respect to the proportion of subjects taking medications for RA at baseline. Oral corticosteroids were taken by approximately half of all subjects, with the median prednisone equivalent dose ranging from 5.0 to 5.5 mg/day. NSAIDs were taken by about 85% of subjects.

## Week 24 Co-primary endpoint ACR 50

The statistical analyses were undertaken firstly for the combined 50 and 100 mg golimumab + MTX groups compared with MTX, and if significance was reached, pair-wise comparisons for doses were done.

The primary endpoint ACR50 did not reach statistical significance (combined golimumab vs. MTX). Non-inferiority testing between the golimumab 100 mg + placebo and placebo + MTX groups was preplanned according to the protocol. The results showed that the proportion of subjects who achieved an ACR 50 response was similar in the golimumab 100mg+ placebo and placebo + MTX groups which suggest that there are no clinical advantages of golimumab monotherapy in treatment naïve RA patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## ACR 20 Response at Week 24 - secondary endpoint:

For the endpoint ACR20, statistical significance was reached for the two combination groups but not for monotherapy. At week 24 the ACR responders at higher response levels are similar for all treated groups. Golimumab monotherapy was similar to MTX monotherapy.

## ACR response at Week 52 - secondary endpoint

The proportion of subjects who achieved ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses at Week 52 were significantly greater in the combined group and in 100 mg golimumab+MTX group, but not for the 50mg golimumab+MTX. As the approach for imputation of missing values in the analyses of ACR data could be anti-conservative (biased in favour of experimental treatment) the MAH was asked to present sensitivity analyses counting all discontinuing patients as non-responders. The results of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the required sensitivity analyses showed that the number of responders and the difference in response rate slightly diminished between the golimumab+MTX groups' vs. MTX+placebo group. However the overall results of these sensitivity analyses are consistent with those of the CSR analyses.

## Disease Activity Score, DAS28 (CRP) Response and Remission

RP values in mg/dL instead In the response to the 1st RSI, the MAH informed that inadvertently C of mg/L had been used when originally deriving the DAS28 response and remission values for golimumab studies in RA and PsA. As a result, all DAS28-related endpoints were re-analysed and submitted with the response.

To test the robustness of the co-primary endpoint analysis of change from baseline in van der Heijde modified Sharp score at Week 52, four sensitivity analyses were performed. The first sensitivity analysis included only those subjects who completed SC study agent administrations through Week 52, did not miss any dose, and had no missing data either at baseline or at Week 52. For the second analysis, LOCF rules were applied. For the third sensitivity analysis, no EE rules were applied. The fourth sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of using only data from original readers (no adjudication) adjudications were reported. The results of these 4 analyses were consistent with that noted for the primary analysis.

The cumulative probability plot for change in vdH-S score at week 52 is shown below.

## Radiographic progression based on smallest detectable change

The Smallest Detectable Change (SDC) is defined as the amount of difference for which any score smaller cannot be reliably distinguished from random error in measurement, and is determined by the variation of the difference in vdH-S change scores between two readers of the same film.

The placebo + MTX treatment group had a statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects ith radiographic progression above the level of smallest detectable change (SDC, 3.82) in vdH-S score compared with subjects in the golimumab 100 mg + MTX treatment group. The golimumab w 50 mg + MTX treatment group had 9 such subjects but this proportion was not statistically different from that of the placebo + MTX treatment group.

## Reduction in the rate of radiographic progression over time

The analyses for the change in the vdH-S score from baseline to Week 28 and from Week 28 to Week 52 showed that most progression occurred prior to Week 28. From Week 28 through Week 52, structural damage continued to progress in subjects in the MTX alone treatment group, whereas minimal progression was observed in subjects in both golimumab treatment groups as measured by the mean values. Linear extrapolation was used to calculate the vdH-S score for subjects who had changed treatment due to early escape

## Effects on structural damage

Effects on structural damage was evaluated by determining whether joints with no damage a baseline began to erode or show joint space narrowing (JSN t ), and by determining whether a the MAH has resubmitted the week 52 to clarify the number and type of impuations in the primary analysis. Three kinds of eek subject had no increase in vdH-S score. In response to the 1st RSI imputations have been used: linear extrapolation, LOCF and imputation with the median change. Overall, the results of the additional analyses are consistent with that of the primary analysis for the effect of golimumab on reducing the rate of progression of structural damage through W 52.

## Subjects with no newly involved joints

A significantly greater proportion of subjects in the golimumab 50 mg + MTX treatment group compared with MTX alone, had no new erosions in joints that were uninvolved at baseline. The proportion of subjects in the golimumab 100mg+MTX group was numerically higher but the difference did not reach statistical significance. At least 83.0% of the subjects who had a JSN score of 0 at baseline (across all treatment groups) did not have new JSN at Week 52.

Because sensitivity analysis 2 differs from the primary analysis only in the methods of missing data imputation (Table MO2-1), the number of subjects with an imputed score remains the same as for the primary analysis. The results of the analyses above are nearly identical to those of the primary analysis.

In the analysis of Week 104 data, scores of 6 of the 131 subjects in the placebo + MTX group and 3 of the 133 subjects in the golimumab 50 mg + MTX group were imputed. The treatment difference between these 2 treatment groups is apparent from the cumulative distribution plot. When the data are displayed with the cuts of &lt; 0, = 0, and &gt; 0, the treatment difference between the placebo + MTX and golimumab 50 mg + MTX groups is largely driven by the increase in the proportion of subjects with change in vdH-S score &lt; 0 in the golimumab 50 mg + MTX.

## Ancillary analyses

To address the concerns that the controlled data on effects on signs and symptoms in MTX-naive RA patients (study C0524T05) did not show robust and consistent treatment effects through week 52, and that the clinical relevance of the treatment effect of golimumab + MTX in the population of early RA was questioned, the MAH has provided results from retrospective analyses in a subset of patients that who are representative of the patient population for which labeling has been proposed, namely patients with severe, active and progressive RA not previously treated with MTX. This patient population is expected to derive the most benefit from an early treatment with an TNF α blocker in combination with MTX, particularly with regard to prevention of progression of structural damage. In addition, safety was also evaluated in a single subset considered representative of patients with severe, active, and progressive RA (ie, screening CRP &gt;1.5 mg/dL) (see section on clinical safety below).

The treatment effect of golimumab + MTX on signs and symptoms of disease at week 52 in this patient population was assessed using multiple validated outcome measures in several subsets of the C0524T05 population. The MAH performed analyses using several baseline disease characteristics and multiple outcome measures in order to assess the consistency of treatment benefit for golimumab 50 mg + MTX in MTX-naïve subjects with severe, active, and progressive RA regardless of how the subset was defined.

## Methods

## Outcome Measures:

in the population subsets most representative of subjects with severe, active and progressive disease. American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria are used to distinguish a treatment effect of an active therapy compared with placebo in clinical trials. However, benefit to patients should be judged using a variety of outcome measures, especially those that reflect more profound responses. Since the CHMP expressed the most concern about the 52-week signs and symptoms data, the focus of the analyses presented in the MAH's responses was on outcomes for signs and symptoms measured at 52 weeks. The outcome measures used for the new analyses are as follows : The outcome measures for the new analyses were chosen to provide clinically relevant information

- -ACR 20/50/70
- -Major clinical response (MCR; maintenance of ACR 70 response over a continuous 6-month period)
- -Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 (CRP) response and remission
- -Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), improvement from baseline &gt;0.25
- -van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) score, change from baseline &lt; 0.

## Subsets of Interest:

Since there are no standard definitions for severe active progressive RA, several baseline disease characteristics were used to define the subsets of the entire study population most li ly to have severe, active, and progressive RA. These criteria are listed below along with the rationale for oosing them. The criteria chosen for analyses are: ke ch

-  C-reactive protein (CRP):
- -&gt;1.5 mg/dL
- -&gt;3.0 mg/dL

-

-  Swollen and tender joints:
- -swollen joint count (SJC) &gt;10 and tender joint count (TJC) &gt;12

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- -SJC&gt;20 and TJC&gt;12
- P):  DAS28 (using CR
- -&gt;5.1
- -&gt;6.5
-  Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) positive

## Analyses

Point estimates of the difference between golimumab 50 mg + MTX group and MTX alone was t focus in order to demonstrate a robust and clinically relevant treatment effect. No tests for statistical significance were performed. he

Of note, study C0524T05 was sized to assess the primary signs and symptoms endpoint at Week 24. The analysis of data in subsets with smaller sample sizes may result in point estimates that are unstable (wide confidence intervals).

## Study C0524T06

This study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with ek 0e active RA despite ongoing MTX. The study population included 444 randomized subjects. We 24 was the placebo-controlled portion. At week 24,  patients given MTX + placebo injecions were switched to golimumab 50 mg SC injections and q4wk thereafter through Week 48. Additional groups were treated with golimumab 100 mg+placebo MTX, golimumab 50 mg + MTX or golimumab 100 mg + MTX. There was an option for early escape after week 16, following the sam criteria as in T05. Thus, there are only controlled data up to week 24. For further details see assessment report of initial MAA.

No significant differences in the change from baseline in vdH-S score at Week 24 were observed between the golimumab + MTX treatment groups and placebo + MTX. The results at Week 52 w similar to what was observed at Week 24.

## Radiographic progression based on smallest detectable change

At Week 24, the proportion of subjects with radiographic progression based on the SDC was low (3.6% to 5.8%) across all treatment groups. No significant differences between treatment groups were observed.

At Week 52, the proportion of subjects with radiographic progression based on the SDC was assessed by early escape or crossover status. Among golimumab-treated subjects, there was a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

higher proportion of subjects with radiographic progression based on the SDC for those who early escaped compared with those who did not early escape.

## -Subjects with no newly involved joints

The proportion of subjects with no newly eroded joints at Week 24 (range 76.7% to 83.2%) and the proportion of subjects with no new JSN at Week 24 (range 90.5% to 95.2%) were high in all treatment groups, including the placebo + MTX group. There were no significant differences observed between the golimumab treatment groups and the placebo + MTX group.

The proportion of subjects with no newly eroded joints at Week 52 (range 70.3% to 80.7%) and the proportion of subjects with no new JSN at Week 52 (range 80.0% to 94.6%) were similar between golimumab treatment groups and the placebo + MTX group.

## -Subjects with no change from baseline in vdH-S Score

The majority of subjects in the golimumab + MTX treatment groups had a change in vdH-S score of &lt; 0 at Week 24 and Week 52. There were no significant differences across treatment groups at eek 24. During the assessment, the MAH submitted data from the week 104 evaluation of X-ray data. W

A plot of the empirical cumulative distribution function of the change from baseline in the total vdH-S score at Week 104 is presented in the Figure below, where with missing data were excluded. An alternative plot, where missing imputation rules were applies showed a similar picture. Most subjects had no change in vdH-S score. Overall, the cumulative probability curves for the placebo + MTX group, the golimumab 50 mg + MTX group, and the golimumab 100 mg + MTX group were similar. It should be noted that subjects randomized to the placebo + MTX group began receiving golimumab at Week 16/24. At the right tail (&gt; 90%), the cumulative probability curves for the golimumab + MTX groups appear slightly separated from the curve for the golimumab 100 mg + placebo group, suggesting radiographic progression (positive change in vdH-S score) was less in the combination treatment groups.

The CHMP concludes that there is no difference in terms of progression of structural joint damage between the group originally treated with placebo + MTX, compared with the approved golimum 50 mg + MTX group, which could be due to the fact that all placebo + MTX patients crossed over t golimumab + MTX treatment by week 16 /24. ab o

## CHMP discussion of clinical efficacy

Golimumab 50 mg sc once a month, in combination with methotrexate, is approved in the EU in adults suffering from moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy. Several similar biological agents on the EU market have achieved approval also for a first line indication in early RA. In this variation, the applicant applies for an extended indication in early RA, using the same wording which has previously been accepted for other biologics.

As support, the applicant has submitted study data from a phase III study in MTX naïve RA patients (C0524T05). This study data was partly evaluated in the initial application for approval. Overall, the study design was considered acceptable, the inclusion/exclusion criteria, dosing and administration of the study drugs were considered relevant. The original application contained 24 weeks data, and subsequently, controlled data on signs and symptoms up to week 52 were submitted. At that time point, the study data were not considered sufficient for an approval in early RA, mainly due to lack of supportive X-ray data in this population.

In this variation, efficacy data up to week 52 has initially been evaluated, whereas efficacy data beyond week 52 (through week 104) has been evaluated within a parallel variation (II/09) concerning claims for maintenance of improvement in sign and symptoms. In its response to the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

1 st  RSI for procedure II/08, the MAH has provided 104-week radiographic analyses from studies C0524T05 and C0524T06. In study T05, golimumab, as monotherapy or in combination with MTX, was tested against MTX alone. The increase of the MTX dose is made according to clinical practice However, given the dose titration, the concern was raised that the MTX only arm was not on optimal dosage until week 8. In the response to the 1 st  RSI, the MAH has further addressed how this may have impacted efficacy. The MAH has adequately described the MTX regimen used in study T05 which included that subjects in all treatment groups had their dose of MTX/placebo rapidly escalated to a dose of 20 mg /week. The dose was then maintained until Week 52. There was no protocol-allowed adjustment dependent on clinical response. Further, the median dose of MTX was the same for all treatment regimens (except the golimumab monotherapy arm). The CHMP agrees that any delayed effect of MTX should be controlled for across all treatment arms, and the issue is therefore considered resolved. Short-term and long-term efficacy in MTX naive RA patients was evaluated at week 24 and week 52, using several clinically validated efficacy endpoints, i.e. ACR response, Change from baseline in HAQ (physical function), MCR (Major Clinical Response) and DAS (Disease Activity Score) 28 (CRP) Response and Remission. From week 28, any subject with &lt;20% improvement from baseline in both swollen and tender joint counts could enter early escape in a double-blinded fashion. The ACR 50 at week 24 and Change from baseline in van der Heijde Modified Sharp (vdH-S) score at Week 52 was chosen as co-primary endpoints. ACR 50 represents a higher level of response as compared to other studies, which used ACR 20 as primary endpoint. The total vdH-S is an accepted parameter for assessment of x-ray data evaluating the rate of progression of structural damage. The primary efficacy endpoint (ACR 50) was not reached in the first test, whic he ent (n=3). In this analysis statistical significance as reached. In general, it is dubious to make changes to the statistical analysis plan after breaking the randomization code and the suggested sensitivity analysis ('modified ITT') cannot replace the pre-planned analysis. It is, however, considered that the suggested sensitivity analysis s for CR 50 6.5%; p=0.24). only week analysis) in study C0524T05 disadvantaged the result for the 50 mg+MTX group and that the h compared t combined golimumab + MTX group versus placebo + MTX (p=0.053) at week 24. However, comparisons using ACR 20 achieved p-values below 0.05. These results were also supported by a post-hoc analysis using a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population which excluded those subjects who were randomized but did not receive treatm w ('modified ITT') is reasonable. Compared with Week 24, the number of ACR 50 responders has increased somewhat at Week 52 (6% for MTX, &lt;2% for 50 mg+ MTX, about 12% for 100 mg +MTX).  Week 52 data analyse ACR 20 and ACR 50 resulted in statistically significantly differences between golimumab combined and MTX. However, the 50 mg + MTX dose, which is the dose approved and applied for, was not statistically different from MTX at any ACR level, and the observed differences were small (ACR 20 7.8%, p=0.16, A Overall, the submitted study data shows a clear trend of better treatment effect for the s non-responders in the 52also analysis. Furthermore, the SPC contains a recommendation that for a patient who does not golimumab+MTX groups as compared with MTX alone. Results for nearly all efficacy endpoints show a numerically greater number of responders in the golimumab+MTX groups. However, the magnitude of treatment effect is small. The MAH has argued that the overall treatment effect of golimumab is comparable to other anti-TNF agents, even though comparison across trials can be made with great caution. The MAH argues that the early escape and prespecified analysis rules (subjects who were non-responders Week 28 were also considered a ACR response rate for the 50 mg+MTX arm may not be a true reflection of response in the 50 mg dose-group at Week 52. However, the same reasoning regarding disadvantages would apply for the MTX+placebo group, in which non-responders also were carried forward to the 52-week

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

respond by 14 weeks, continued treatment should be carefully be reconsidered, and thus to continue treatment beyond 28 weeks without a response would be questionable.

reflect er, they To address the CHMP's major objections, in the response to the 2 nd  RSI the MAH has submitted a subgroup analyses of patients belonging to the intended target population (i.e. patients with severe, active, progressive RA). These subgroups have been selected retrospectively, and there is no established definition of severe, active and progressive disease. However, the MAH has used several different parameters for defining severe disease, and it is agreed that the subgroups such population. As pointed out by the MAH, given e.g. the small numbers in the respective subpopulations, these subgroup analyses should be interpreted with some caution. Howev are helpful for review of the overall picture.

get population, than in the overall population in the study. There also d In the new, post-hoc subgroup analyses provided by the MAH during the procedure, a larger degree of response is seen with golimumab + MTX than with MTX monotherapy in subgroups reflecting the intended tar appears to be a larger difference between golimumab + MTX vs. MTX monotherapy for patients with the highest disease activity, within each definition of subgroups (e.g. DAS &gt; 5.1 or DAS &gt; 6.5; CRP &gt;1.5 mg/dL vs CRP &gt;3.0 mg/dL). These observations support the restriction of the indication of anti-TNF agents in the MTX-naïve RA population to the subset with severe, active, an progressive disease to optimize patient benefit.

The MAH has submitted subgroup analyses from ASPIRE, the study in MTX naïve subjects with Remicade (infliximab). The observed differences between MTX monotherapy and infliximab+ MTX in these subgroups are of the same magnitude as seen with golimumab for the same parameters.

Thus, taken together, there overall picture shows a considerably more convincing, clinically meaningful effect based on analyses of data from the patients belonging to the intended target population. These effects seem to be of a similar magnitude as for infliximab in similar subpopulations.

## Structural damage:

The X-ray data from T05 presented in the initial application (up to week 52) indicated that golimumab has a positive effect on progression of structural damage. Statistically significant effects have been demonstrated for the primary x-ray endpoint Change from baseline in van der Heijde Modified Sharp (vdH-S) score as well as in different responder analyses based on the change in vdH-S score.

e changes calculated based on linear extrapolation or LOCF imputation tend to be zero or very small (well within the measurement error) and very polation no Three kinds of imputations have been used: linear extrapolation, LOCF and imputation with the median change. They all tend to underestimate the progression rate since the duration between baseline and the first on study treatment radiologic examination seem to be too short to detect a real progression of structural damage. Th similar. This explains the almost identical results in the primary analysis with linear extra and the LOCF sensitivity analysis (1.37 vs. 0.74 for placebo and golimumab 50 mg and 1.37 vs. 0.75, respectively). In case of insufficient data for linear extrapolation or LOCF, imputation of median change (i.e. zero) was used. Thus for the vast majority (75%) of patients escaping early change or very small changes have been imputed.

p Since there were more imputations in the placebo group compared to the golimumab 50 mg grou (43 vs. 37) the primary analysis with linear extrapolation as well as the sensitivity LOCF analysis will, if anything, have a tendency to favour the placebo group. This tendency is valid for the mean comparison as well as for the comparison of percentage of patients with no progression (change&lt;0). Thus the positive effects on structural damage at 52 weeks are considered robust. About 16 % units more patients have experienced no change in the golimumab 50 mg group

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

compared to the placebo group. These results are further supported in the responder analysis counting discontinuing patients as non-responders.

ab 50 b 50 mg treatment compared with the placebo group. ts In addition, week 104 data from T05 have been provided to support the claim of substained effect over time beyond week 52; the method for analyzing change from baseline in vdH-S score for week 104 was different from that of week 52. The 104 week analysis is based on patients with at least one radiologic examination after week 52. Patients switching from placebo to golimumab at week 52 or later are in the analysis kept in the initially randomised treatment. The number of imputations (LOCF and median change, i.e. zero) was small (6 on placebo and 3 on golimum mg). Again, if anything this analysis should be conservative. There are about 10% units more patients with no progression in the golimuma This difference remained unchanged in an ITT analysis including all initially randomised patien counting patients without radiologic examination after week 52 as having progressed. In the responder analysis with patients escaping prior to week 52 counted as non-responders but using available week 104 data for patients switching at or after week 52, the difference between treatments was 17.4% (95% CI 5.6;29.2).

is approved golimumab 50 mg + MTX group, which In the response to the first RSI, the MAH submitted also week 104 X-ray data from T06. There no difference in terms of progression of structural joint damage between the group originally treated with placebo + MTX, compared with the could be due to the fact that all placebo + MTX patients crossed over to golimumab + MTX treatment by week 16 /24.  Thus, these data are not helpful for assessing whether golimumab reduces the rate of progression of joint damage in the second line population.

d. The damage. Any conclusions on long-term patient benefit must be onsidered based on assumptions. Given that with the responses to the 2 nd  RSI a meaningful -naive patients was observed, it is accepted to include a claim regarding f the In conclusion, a positive effect on structural damage up to two years has been demonstrate difference in mean change and percentage of patients with no progression cannot be easily interpreted in terms of clinical relevance. As for what has been demonstrated for similar products, the results should merely be seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis that these type of drugs have a positive effect on structural c clinical effect in MTX reduction of the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray into section 4.1 o SPC. There is sufficient support for this claim from Study C0524T05, in MTX naïve subjects.

## Clinical safety

## Introduction

The applicant has submitted 2-year cumulative safety data from the 3 ongoing 5-year Phase 3 studies in RA patients: methotrexate (MTX)-naïve subjects with active RA in C0524T05, subjects with active RA despite MTX therapy in C0524T06, and subjects with active RA who were previo treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents in C0524T11. usly

Safety data from these studies up to week 52 was already submitted and evaluated in the initi procedure. Data from study T05 will again be presented in this AR as it represents key placebocontrolled safety data, for the population applied for al . Of note is that there was no control group after week 24 in T06 and T11 or after week 52 in T05. AEs through 100/104 weeks were summarized by the treatment subjects were receiving at the time of an AE.

In addition, SAE from all ongoing golimumab studies, from the most recent DBL (data base lock) or cumulatively through 15 may 2009 has also been submitted.

The proportion of subjects with an in golimumab 100 mg + placebo (15.9%) group was greater than in all other golimumab + MTX treatment groups. Injections were generally well tolerated

## Injection site reaction in study T05 through Week 104

In the C0524T05 study though Week 104, injection-site reactions to golimumab occurred in the following proportion of subjects: Golimumab 100 mg + placebo: 16.6%, Golimumab 50 mg + MTX: 5.1%, Golimumab 100 mg + MTX: 8.7%, Combined Golimumab + MTX group: 7.6%.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most commonly reported reaction was injection-site erythema. No injection-site reaction was severe. One subject receiving golimumab 100 mg + MTX had a serious injection-site reaction of erythema, and due to this AE, discontinued study agent.

## Injection site reaction in All RA Phase 3 SC studies through Week 100/104

The proportions of subjects with injection-site reactions were higher in the golimumab 100 mg group (12.5%) compared with the placebo group (2.9%) and the golimumab 50 mg group (7.3%). The majority of the injection-site reactions were of mild intensity.

Based on the total number of injections, 0.3% of injections in the placebo group, 0.6% of injections in the golimumab 50 mg group, and 1.2% of injections the golimumab 100 mg group injections resulted in injection-site reactions.

## Serum Sickness-like and Anaphylactic Reactions

There were no serum sickness-like reactions or anaphylactic reactions in subjects treated with SC golimumab in the Phase 3 RA studies through Week 100/104.

## Hepatobiliary Adverse Events

Hepatobiliary AEs are presented by the applicant based on the following criteria for clinically important hepatic AE:

- -Elevated ALT &gt;3 x ULN associated with total bilirubin increase &gt; 2 x ULN irrespective of the presence of hepatobiliary system-organ class AEs.
- Elevated ALT &gt;3 xULN associated with a hepatobiliary system-organ class SAE.

Based on those criteria, through Week 100/104 in the RA Phase 3 SC studies, there were no subjects in the placebo group, 1 subject (0.1%) in the golimumab 50 mg group, and 2 subjects (0.2%) in the golimumab 100 mg group who developed 1 or more clinically important hepatobiliary AEs.

## These subjects included:

- Subject C0524T06-2205-60689 in the golimumab 100 mg + MTX group had an ALT 3 x ULN and bilirubin 2 x ULN. This was a subject from Chile who had elevations in liver enzymes and total bilirubin due to hepatitis E infection. This case was previously reported in the initial 24-Week d submission. ata
- Subject C0524T06-5805-60569 in the golimumab 100 mg + placebo group in South Korea had elevations in liver enzymes and an SAE of hepatitis (verbatim term was acute hepatic failure). The subject has died, and the case was previously reported in the initial 24-Week data submission.
- Subject C0524T06-1202-60043 in the golimumab 50 mg + MTX had an elevation in ALT and a SAE of cholelithiasis. -

## Neoplasm/malignancies

## Introduction

Increased risk for malignancies is an identified concern with the long-term use of TNF-alpha inhibitors.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

To evaluate the potential impact of golimumab on the risk of malignancy, the applicant has analysed the incidence of lymphoma, NMSC (basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers), malignancies other than lymphoma and NMSC, and all malignancies in different subpopulations but also in all subjects treated with golimumab.

## Malignancies in study T05 through Week 52

Through Week 52, a total of 4 golimumab-treated subjects were reported to have malignancies.

For notice: the 2 malignancies reported through Week 24 are not presented in the week 52/104 data submission and is not included in the table below.

Week 24 through Week 52: Malignancies were reported for 2 subjects from

## Lymphoma

In the initial submission of study data through week 52 an increased incidence for lymphoma was observed.

After the analyses for the Week 100/104 cut-off were performed, the applicant was notified of 3 new additional cases of lymphoma in the T11 RA study (subjects previously treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents). All 3 cases occurred in subjects receiving golimumab 100mg+MTX. Based on this new data additional analysis was performed using data cutoff date of August 2009 which is presented below.

## Additional Analysis as of August 2009 (median follow-up of up to 3.1 years):

In the entire golimumab clinical program, there were 8 cases of lymphoma or possible lymphoma reported as of August 2009. Of these 8 cases, 7 were reported in the golimumab RA studies, and one case was reported in the severe, persistent asthma study (C0524T03). In the Phase 2b/3 studies in rheumatologic indications, this resulted in an incidence per 100 subject-years of followp (95%CI) of 0.00 (0.00, 0.84) in the placebo group, 0.04 (0.00, 0.24) in the golimumab 50 mg roup, 0.18 (0.06, 0.38) in the golimumab 100 mg group, and 0.12 (0.05, 0.25) in the combined r u g golimumab group, with the 95% CI for the golimumab groups fully contained within the 95% CI fo the placebo group (Table OC7-3).

Confidence intervals based on an exact method.

In order to obtain an independent assessment of the lymphoma data in the golimumab program, e Applicant consulted external experts in rheumatology, epidemiology, and oncology in the form of an Advisory Board meeting held in November 2009. These advisors concluded that based on the available data, the lymphomas seen in the golimumab studies do not suggest a pattern different from that seen with RA-associated lymphomas, and that a golimumab dose response in the number of cases of lymphoma cannot be confirmed or refuted due to multiple confounding factors. th

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant's rationale for this conclusion is that Lymphoma is known to occur more frequently in subjects with RA and other chronic inflammatory disorders, even in the absence of anti-TNF-alpha therapy. According to the applicant, the risk of lymphoma in RA is increased with the observed relative risk ranging from 2 to 23 and an odds ratio of 25.8 in patients with high inflammatory activity compared with those patients with low disease activity (Mikuls, 2003, Baecklund et al, 1998). All of the 6 subjects with lymphoma in the RA golimumab program had active disease at baseline and long-standing RA (ranging from 4.7 to 31.4 years). Five of the 6 subjects had functional Class II or III at baseline indicating physical function impairment, 5 of the 6 subjects received concomitant MTX, and 4 of the 6 subjects had prior exposure to anti-TNF-alpha agents.

## Safety in subgroup of patients with severe, active, progressive disease

In the new subset efficacy analyses presented in the response to the 2 nd RSI, a greater treatment effect for golimumab 50 mg + MTX compared with MTX alone in the more severe disease subset of the study population has been observed. In order to be able to evaluate the benefit-risk in these subsets, additional safety analyses were performed to determine if there were clinically meaningful differences in the safety profile of golimumab + MTX compared with MTX alone in subjects with severe, active, and progressive RA. The rates of AEs, deaths, SAEs, infections, serious infections, AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent, malignancies, and injection-site reactions in C0524T05 have been analyzed according to only one measure of baseline disease activity: subject screening CRP levels (&lt;1.5 mg/dL or &gt; 1.5 mg/dL).

There were no clinically meaningful differences in the rates of safety events in subjects based upon screening CRP levels. The safety profile of the C0524T05 population in a representative subset of more severe disease is consistent with the overall safety profile of golimumab.

## Safety in special populations

Among the 20 pregnancies that occurred in subjects in the golimumab studies, 17 pregnancies occurred in subjects who were treated with golimumab or blinded study agent with the following outcomes:

- 2 pregnancies ongoing
- 7 healthy deliveries
- 1 premature delivery at 36 weeks of gestation (twin pregnancy)
- 6 miscarriages in the first trimester (up to 12 weeks of pregnancy), including 1 miscarriage whose pathology was suspicious for, but not diagnostic of, a partial molar pregnancy
- 1 pregnancy with an unknown outcome.

The remaining 3 pregnancies occurred in subjects in the golimumab studies who did not receive golimumab (randomized to placebo or conception occurred prior to the first SC study agent) with the following outcomes:

- 1 healthy delivery -
- 1 miscarriage in the first trimester
- 1 elective abortion

(6 out There were no congenital anomalies reported as an outcome among the pregnancies that occurred in either study subjects or their partners through 15 May 2009. Among the subjects receiving golimumab or blinded study agent in the clinical studies, the first trimester miscarriage rate

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

of 17 pregnancies, ie, 35%) is comparable to the background incidence (7% to 52%) of spontaneous abortions (Wilcox et al, 1999; Speroff and Fritz, 2005).

## CHMP discussion of clinical safety

In relation to this variation, the MAH has submitted cumulative safety data through approximatel 2 years from the ongoing phase 3 studies with SC golimumab in different subsets of subjects with RA. Available data from other studies in rheumatologic and non-reumatologic indications has also been presented. y include MTX naïve patients, the safety profile in RA subjects and particularly early RA is of special interest. Since the main scope of this variation is an extension of the RA indication to also

The safety database for the RA Phase 3 SC studies includes 1,475 subjects of which 825 subjects were treated with golimumab for approximately 2 years with slightly more subjects exposed to golimumab 100 mg than golimumab 50 mg. The number and extent of exposure is still too limited to view the total picture of golimumab long term safety but will allow for an acceptable safety evaluation at this time point.

wed e. The increased number of TB cases In the initial application for approval, safety data through week 52 was evaluated which sho that the short-term safety profile was in line with the safety profile of other anti-TNF agents. Additional 2 year data shows an overall similar pictur occurring during the second year, as well as the overall number of lymphoma (mainly from the study in subjects previously treated with another anti-TNF agent, T011; and thus in RA subjects with long duration of disease) are specifically noted.

In addition, for additional risk minimisation activities was requested. In st RSI, the MAH sufficiently clarified the baseline history and the circumstances around the detection of new TB cases. It seems that the majority of the cases are ed There are a number of additional TB observed during the second treatment year.

During the placebo controlled phase there was a higher incidence of injection site reaction associated with golimumab than with placebo. However, for the major ity of cases were the reaction d. This pattern was consistent over time with the majority of reactions of mild intensity. was mil the number of deaths has increased since the latest total of 22 subjects (21 subjects treated with (100 mg+MTX) dose group, compared with the other dose groups. The nown As expected given longer time of follow up, data cut-off, from a total of 13 subjects to a golimumab and 1 subject treated with placebo) in all golimumab studies. Of those 22 deaths, 13 deaths occurred in the combined RA phase III studies (8 subjects in T05, 4 subjects in T06 and 1 subject in T11). In the 2 year data there appears to be an increase in the number of deaths in the highest golimumab reported causes of deaths were: malignancies, sepsis or septic shock, hypoglycemic coma resulting from suicide by insulin self-injection, tramadol overdose, cardiac arrest secondary to intracerebral hemorrhage, respiratory distress, circulatory insufficiency, fulminant hepatic failure and unk causes. During the controlled part of T05, there were three deaths for golimumab and none with MTX.

d mumab treated subjects (0.0 [0.00, 1.25] for placebo and 0.29 ] or er, the phoma or possible lymphoma reported as of n The potential risk for malignancy is a well known concern associated with the use of TNF-alpha inhibitors. In the placebo controlled phases of the rheumatologic studies, there was an increase incidence of lymphoma in goli [0.04, 1.05] for golimumab), while the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers (1.25 [0.26, 3.66 for placebo and 0.58 [0.16, 1.49] for golimumab) and other malignancies (0.83 [0.10, 3.00] f placebo and 0.44 [0.09, 1.28] for golimumab) was increased in the placebo groups. Howev numbers are overall small, and it is therefore difficult to draw a definitive conclusion. Additional 52 weeks and 104 week data shows a similar picture. With respect to lymphoma, in the entire golimumab clinical program, there were 7 cases of lym August 2009. Of these 7 cases, 6 were reported in the golimumab RA studies (1 in C0524T05, 1 i C0524T06, and 4 in C0524T11), and 1 case was reported in the severe, persistent asthma study (C0524T03). For study T05, no table has been found that summarizes all the reported malignancies in the different treatment arms, in relation to total subject-years of follow-up, during the placebo controlled part of study T05.

ic ated data, which contains sfactorily addressed. Although lymphoma is known to occur more frequently in subjects with RA and other chron inflammatory disorders, the more frequent occurrence of lymphoma in RA subjects exposed to golimumab 100 mg and in subjects previously exposed to TNF blockers is of concern. In the response, the MAH has submitted more details regarding malignancies/lymphoma in the studies with golimumab. The previous picture remains, including that the lymphoma incidences appear increased to some extent. One more case has been identified in the upd more extensive duration of exposure. One additional fatal case (in total 2) has occurred. In the SPC, section 4.8, Neoplasms (such as skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and melanocytic naevus); Lymphoma and leukaemia' are labelled. There are also class warnings related to malignancy/lymphoma included in section 4.4 of the SPC. These events are also followed via PSUR and the RMP; therefore, the CHMP considers this issue sati

To conclude, the safety profile of golimumab is comparable with that already well established for anti-TNF agents. The MAH's conclusion regarding safety is endorsed. There does not appear to be any meaningful difference with respect to safety based upon CRP screening levels (&gt;1.5 mg/dL or &lt;1.5 mg/dL).

As per the signed Letter of Undertaking, dated 15 February 2010, the Applicant addressed paediatric malignancy, leukaemia and psoriasis (new onset or worsening o pre-existing) in the new revised risk management plan as appropriate.

It was noted that during the assessment procedure of variation II/08, the MAH has submitted RMP version 3.1 (dated 25 May 2010) together with PSUR 2. The conclusion of the assessment of this RMP, which supersedes version 3.0, was adopted by CHMP on 19 August 2010.

The summary of changes to the RMP has been reviewed and the revisions to the safety specification such as inclusion of additional data from both post marketing experience and clinical trials, updates of frequency of occurrence, and updates of MedDRA PTs used in database searches have been noted.  Revisions to the pharmacovigilance plan include status updates of the ongoing studies and other minor editorial changes.  Revisions to the risk minimisation plan include inclusions of warnings in the SPC related to leukemia and paediatric malignancies  which were included in variation II/003 submitted in December 2009. No additional risk minimisation measures have been noted to be required.

## OVERALL CONCLUSION AND Benefit-risk assessment

and long-term efficacy in MTX naïve RA patients in study , The applicant has evaluated short-term C0524T05 using several clinically validated efficacy endpoints (ACR response, HAQ, DAS 28). Although the results for the complete study population, particularly at week 52, were questioned additional subgroup analyses focussed on the target population (severe, active, progressive disease) are sufficiently convincing to support a clinically meaningful effect of golimumab 50 mg + MTX in the applied for indication.

Two years radiographic data from study T05 have been submitted in support of the indication of early RA. These data continue to show a positive effect on progression of structural damage. Thus, there is sufficient data to support a general claim for reduction of progression of structural damage.

ken together, the Overall the safety profile of golimumab, based on at least 2 years of safety follow up in the ongoing clinical studies is in line with the well known safety profile of anti-TNF agents. Ta benefit/risk ratio for the extended indication is considered to be positive.

The following indication is therefore agreed for section 4.1 of the SmPC:

## Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

Simponi, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for:

- the treatment of moderate to severe, active rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the -modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy including MTX has -response to disease been inadequate.
- -the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with MTX.
