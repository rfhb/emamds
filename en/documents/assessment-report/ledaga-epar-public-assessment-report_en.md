## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Introduction

Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative diseases characterised by infiltration of the skin by malignant T-cells. The epidermotropic form of CTCL is the most common and is referred to as mycosis fungoides (MF), accounting for 60% of new CTCL cases. CTCL is a rare type of tumour and the RARECARE cancer 1  registry reports a combined incidence rate of 0.52/100,000 for MF-type CTCL and the more aggressive Sézary Syndrome. It is estimated that the 5-year partial prevalence of MF-type CTCL is 11,735 in EU-28 countries 2 . Overall survival as well as disease-specific survival decrease with advancing clinical stage. In treated patients, median survival with early stage disease (Stage IA, IB and IIA) is reported as 35.5, 21.5 and 15.8 years, respectively 3 . The prognosis for patients with MF-type CTCL is worse when the condition is not limited to the skin at the time of initial diagnosis (Stages IIB through IV). Median survival for late stage disease (Stages IIB, IIIA and IIIB) is reported to be 4.7, 4.7 and 3.4 years, respectively, and decreases further for Stage IV disease 3 .

The etiology of MF is not known. MF commonly begins with a nonspecific scaly eruption that leads to the development of patches/plaques. With further progress, the disease advances with the formation of tumours, generalized erythroderma often with a leukemic phase (Sézary syndrome) and lymphadenopathy. Eventually, wide-spread visceral lymphoma may lead to death from the disease. Ulceration of tumours, with secondary infection with Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is also a common cause of morbidity and death. The diagnosis is made with skin biopsy and is further confirmed with immunophenotyping and DNA analysis of the T-cell receptor gene rearrangement to define the clonal population. Lymph node biopsies may be performed at initial staging in patients with overt advanced disease or if nodes are enlarged on physical examination or imaging studies. Peripheral blood is examined for the presence of circulating malignant cells which would serve to identify the leukemia expression of the Sézary syndrome.

Clinical staging serves to distinguish prognostic groups, where good-risk patients, who have plaque-only disease without lymph node, blood or visceral involvement have a better prognosis than intermediate-risk patients, with tumors, erythroderma or plaque disease with lymph node or blood involvement (with no visceral involvement), and poor-risk patients (with visceral involvement). Staging of patients with MF is essential not only for assessment of prognosis but also for decisions in management. The goals of treatment of patch/plaque disease without lymph node involvement (IA and IB), and those with enlarged but histologically uninvolved lymph nodes (IIA), is to achieve remission, relieve symptoms and achieve cosmetic improvement while avoiding long-term

treatment-related toxicities. For patients with Stage IA, IB or IIA disease, management relies on the applications of skin directed therapies. The therapeutic options include topical corticosteroids, topical chemotherapy with chlormethine (also known as nitrogen mustard (NM) or mechlorethamine) or carmustine (BCNU), ultraviolet B (UVB) therapy, psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA) and total skin electron beam therapy. Targretin (bexarotene), an orally available capsule for systemic therapy, is indicated for advanced stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in adult patients. Topical chlormethine is included in the EORTC (2006), the ESMO (2013) and NCCN (2014) guidelines as a first line therapy for early stage MF-type CTCL and for the treatment of cutaneous lesions in late stage MF-type CTCL.

## About the product

Chlormethine is an alkylating agent that inhibits rapidly proliferating cells (ATC code L01AA05) and is used for the topical treatment of mycosis fungoides (MF)-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF-type CTCL). Chemically, the cytotoxicity of chlormethine is due to its spontaneous conversion to an electrophilic intermediate that covalently binds to cellular components. The highly reactive intermediate is an aziridinium ion formed by cyclisation of one of the side chains and displacement of a chloride ion 4,5,6,7,8 . Chlormethine has two reactive 2-chloroethyl side chains, classifying it as a bifunctional alkylating agent.

Alkylation of DNA is the primary basis for the cytotoxic actions of chlormethine. Chlormethine binds to N7 positions in guanines via its reactive chloroethyl moieties, potentially binding also to N3 positions in adenines 9, 10 . The bifunctional nature of chlormethine along with its small molecular size allows it to form interstrand cross-links within DNA, by alkylation of guanine-N7 positions in opposite DNA strands. Monoadducts and intrastrand biadducts are also formed, but the formation of interstrand cross-links makes chlormethine a more effective tumor chemotherapeutic agent than monofunctional analogues 11 . Unrepaired interstrand cross-links prevent transcription, replication, and segregation of DNA, and ultimately cause cell death 12 . There are numerous reports showing a correlation between the extent of DNA cross-linking and cytotoxicity 13  ; conversely, tumour resistance to bifunctional alkylating agents has been associated with increased capacity to repair DNA cross-links 14 . Defects in cell-cycle regulation that lead to cell-cycle progression before DNA damage can be repaired may also contribute to the sensitivity of cancer cells to these drugs 15,16 . Cell death caused by chlormethine may occur by multiple mechanisms leading to apoptosis or necrosis 17,18,19 .

## Type of Application and aspects on development

The application was submitted under Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. The reference medicinal product is Caryolysine, an aqueous formulation of chlormethine that was first authorised for the treatment of MF-type CTCL in France in 1949. Although Caryolysine still holds a valid license in France, it has not been marketed since 2006. Both Caryolysine and Ledaga contain the same active substance, the same strength, same route of administration and with the same proposed indication. However, the pharmaceutical form is different, whereas Caryolysine is a concentrate solution for dilution in water or sodium chloride, Ledaga is produced as a gel with other excipients. The applicant has claimed that bioequivalence cannot be demonstrated through bioavailability studies as the treatment is for topical use (EMA/CHMP/QWP/558185/2014) and no systemic exposure can be observed (see non-clinical discussion and clinical pharmacology discussion). The application is based on two studies, a multi-center, randomised, active controlled, non-inferiority clinical pivotal trial comparing Ledaga with chlormethine compounded in petroleum-based 0.02% chlormethine HCl ointment  and an uncontrolled, multi-center, open-label extension of the pivotal study.

The Applicant has applied for the following indication:

'Chlormethine gel is indicated for the topical treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in adult patients.'

The agreed indication is as follows:

Ledaga is indicated for the topical treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF-type CTCL) in adult patients (see section 5.1).

Posology is proposed as follows:

A thin film of Ledaga should be applied once daily to affected areas of the skin.

Treatment with Ledaga should be stopped for any grade of skin ulceration or blistering, or moderately severe or severe dermatitis (e.g., marked skin redness with oedema). Upon improvement, treatment with Ledaga can be restarted at a reduced frequency of once every 3 days. If reintroduction of treatment is tolerated for at least 1 week, the frequency of application can be increased to every other day for at least 1 week and then to once-daily application if tolerated.

## 2.2.2. Active substance

## General information

The chemical name of chlormethine hydrochloride is 2-chloro-N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-methylethanamine hydrochloride or 2,2'-dichloro-N-methyldiethylamine hydrochloride or bis(2-chloroethyl)methylamine hydrochloride or N-methylbis(2-chloroethyl)amine hydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula C5H11Cl2N ⋅ HCl and has a relative molecular mass 192.51 g/mol. The structure is shown is Figure 1:

Figure 1: Structure of chlormethine hydrochloride

<!-- image -->

The structure of chlormethine hydrochloride was elucidated by using: chloride titration, elemental analysis, purity by gas chromatography, FT-IR spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy,  1 H NMR spectroscopy, DSC melting point, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-Ray powder diffraction.

Chlormethine hydrochloride is a white to off-white, crystalline hygroscopic solid compound, which is very slightly soluble in water, partially soluble in ethanol and soluble in acetone. The active substance does not exhibit stereoisomerism.

Polymorphism was determined by XRPD (X-ray Powder Diffraction analysis), data shown that although different crystallization principles and solvents were used, the same polymorph was obtained. Therefore, these data demonstrate that the same polymorphic form is constantly produced.

## Manufacture, characterisation and process controls

The  chlormethine  hydrochloride  manufacturing  process  consists  of  one  chemical  step  starting  from  a commercially  available  starting  material,  N-methyldiethanolamine  (MDEA).  During  evaluation,  the  CHMP requested to redefine MDEA as starting material, the applicant performed additional investigations in order to support the definition of MDEA as starting material following the principles of ICH guideline Q11. As a result of these investigations, the specifications for MDEA and chlormethine hydrochloride were significantly revised and in addition the distillation step of MDEA was defined and implemented as the first step of the synthesis of the active substance; these measures were considered satisfactory and MDEA was accepted as a starting material. However,  although  satisfactory,  preliminary  validation  data  have  been  presented  sufficient  to  give  some assurance that full validation is likely to be achievable, the validation data to support the proposed methods for control of impurities in MDEA has not been completed.  Therefore, the CHMP recommends that the validation data should be completed before the marketing of the product.

Adequate in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for starting materials and reagents have been presented.

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The active substance is packaged in an amber glass jar, sealed with a PTFE-lined, threaded polypropylene screw-on cap which complies with the Ph Eur 3.2.1. and Regulation 2023/2006/EC.

## Specification

The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR, colorimetry), meting range (DSC), water content (Karl Fischer), pH, chloride (titration), assay (titration), related substances (GCs and ion chromatography), residual solvents (GCs), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).

Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical  studies  and  appropriate  specifications  have  been  set  taking  into  account  ICH  S9  and  M7  and considering that chlormethine hydrochloride active substance intended for advanced cancer indications and is itself  genotoxic  at  therapeutic  dose.  The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and non-compendia methods were appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. except for titration (chloride content), GC  (related substances), GC (resisual solvents), and ion chromatography (chloride content) Satisfactory preliminary validation data for this analytical methods of active substance and starting materials have been presented but the complete validation has not been completed.  The CHMP recommended completing the validation data for these methods post authorisation. The CHMP also recommended to provide comparative batch  analysis  (for  all  parameters  tested)  by  the  active  substance  and  finished  product  manufacturers. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used has been presented.

Batch  analysis  data  of  the  active  substance  were  provided.  The  results  are  within  the  specifications  and consistent from batch to batch.

## Stability

Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for 48 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.

The following parameters were tested : assay, appearance, water content, pH and levels of individual and total impurities.

At both storage conditions (long term and accelerated) over the storage periods, all parameters complied with specification.

The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest  period  of  60  months  at  the  recommended  storage condition (25°C/60% RH) in the proposed container.

## 2.2.3. Finished medicinal product

The finished product is presented as a clear, free of particles, colourless gel, packaged in a re-sealable, aluminium tube, containing 60 g of gel for cutaneous use.

The goal of the pharmaceutical development was to provide a non-greasy, chemically stable, single phase cutaneous presentation in which the active substance is held in solution, and which dries rapidly upon application to the skin.

The active substance, chlormethine hydrochloride is known to be readily soluble in water and alcohols and therefore hydrophilic alcohol-based solvents were selected for the formulation in order to achieve a uniform

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

product. The physical characteristics of the active substance do not affect the formulation since the active substance is highly soluble in the solvents used in the finished product formulation.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.

The formulation used in the pivotal clinical trial is the same as the proposed commercial formulation.

A  topical  chlormethine  hydrochloride  formulation  was  developed  using  diethylene  glycol  monoethyl  ether (DEGEE),  glycerin,  propylene  glycol  and  isopropanol  base.  Compared  to  other  topical  formulations  the developed formulation was considered improved on a number of characteristics and attributes appropriate for a topically administered anti-cancer product, including viscosity, drying time and lack of greasiness . Satisfactory studies have been performed to assure chlormethine hydrochloride remains solubilised in individual formulation components and final formulation base, during manufacture and over shelf-life.  Data has been provided to assure  that  the  active  substance  does  not  crystallise  and  that  the  formulation  does  not  undergo  phase separation under freeze-thaw conditions. Substantial data have been provided to demonstrate formulation understanding and provide assurance that the formulation is robust and fit for purpose.

The physical and chemical characteristics of the finished product formulation are that of a solution wherein approximately 97.7% (on a mass basis) of the materials are miscible with each other. The vast majority of the solids come from hydroxypropyl cellulose, which is the gelling agent. Optical microscopy was conducted on multiple batches. The samples were examined using a polarizing light microscope at up to 200 × magnification. There was no evidence of chlormethine hydrochloride visible particles observed in the samples. Furthermore, no evidence  of  multiple  phases  was  observed.  Sub-visible  birefringent  crystals  and/or  sub-visible  particles observed  in  the  samples  were  analysed  by  infrared  spectroscopy  and  identified  as  formulation  excipients (glycerol,  edetate  disodium  and  hydroxypropyl  cellulose).  Therefore,  it  was  demonstrated  that  the  active substance is fully soluble in the formulation and therefore the dosage form is considered a gel according to EDQM standard terms and Ph. Eur. monograph on semi-solid preparation for cutaneous application.

This  non-sterile  topical  gel  is  largely  alcoholic,  containing  a  very  limited  amount  of  water  (&lt;  2.0%).    No antimicrobial agents are incorporated as the finished product is acknowledged to be essentially self-preserving. The microbiological requirements of the Ph. Eur. (5.1.4) for preparations for cutaneous use are, therefore, applied. Tests for efficacy of antimicrobial preservation have been performed as part of development studies for clinical batches at 12-32 months following manufacture and on three batches of product, manufactured at the proposed commercial scale and facility at 5-7 months following manufacture.  All results comply with Ph. Eur. requirements and demonstrate efficacy of antimicrobial preservation.

The finished product is packaged into aluminium foil tubes with a white exterior coating and lacquer interior coating. The dispensing end of the tube is sealed with an aluminium film and a white resealable screw-on cap. Product compatibility with the primary packaging components can be extrapolated from the finished release testing and stability testing results which show no indication of incompatibility. The lacquer complies with EU Directive  2002/72/EC  as  suitable  for  food  contact.  Given  the  potential  hazards  of  this  medicinal  product, particularly  to  the  eyes,  coupled  with  its  proposed  use  with  domestic  setting,  a  transparent  sealable child-resistant plastic bag is provided. Each tube will be placed in the transparent plastic bag before being delivered to the patient. To support the claim of child resistance for the re-closable plastic bag, the CHMP recommended providing a certificate demonstrating compliance with BS EN ISO 8317 for re-closable packaging before the marketing of the product.

## Manufacture of the product and process controls

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The finished product is manufactured by producing sub-parts of the bulk gel and combining them followed by tube filling.

In-process controls of critical quality attributes (appearance, viscosity and homogeneity of chlormethine content assay) are described and are considered sufficient. Appropriate process validation has been performed in three batches at the proposed commercial scale.  Process times and mixing speeds are reasonably consistent between batches.  Results  for  in-process  controls  and  ancillary  test  parameters  are  generally  consistent  within  and between batches.  For the bulk finished product, stratified sampling shows chlormethine assay values to be reproducible as are content of butyl hydroxytoluene and water content.  Results for viscosity are similarly reproducible. The filling process is uniform, with fill weight reproducibility demonstrated across a range of filling speeds. However, the CHMP recommended performing quantitative cleaning validation during commercial-scale validation studies to support the proposed process to cleanse finished product residues from the exterior of the tube prior to labelling. Supplementary process validation data was presented for a further three batches which used the minimum, maximum and mid-point respectively of proposed mixing time and tube filling speed ranges. These  data  are  consistent  with  those  of  the  primary  process  validation  batches.  Satisfactory  data  were presented to support the proposed bulk hold times.

All in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.

## Product specification

The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, viscosity  (Ph.  Eur.),  identity  (HPLC/mass  spectrometry),  water  content  (Karl  Fischer),  identification  of butylhydroxytoluene (HPLC), assay (HPLC/mass spectrometry), impurities (HPLC/mass spectrometry), tube uniformity  (HPLC),  minimum  fill  (gravimetry),  uniformity  of  dosage  unit  by  mass  variation  (Ph.  Eur.)  and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards has been presented. The finished product will be released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional final product release testing.

Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  3  commercial  scale  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

## Stability of the product

Stability data on 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 36 months at -25 to -15 °C and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 2 to 8 °C according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

Samples were tested for appearance, viscosity, water content, butylated hydroxytoluene content and assayThe analytical procedures used were the same as for release and are stability indicating.

At the recommended long-term storage condition, all data remain within the proposed specifications. These results showed that the product is stable when stored at the proposed long-term conditions.

Under accelerated storage conditions, no specific change nor trend is observed. However, an increase of several specified impurities and of the total impurities is observed. All data remain below the specification limit.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Studies were conducted to determine the effect of temperature on the finished product when cycled between refrigerated and room temperature conditions. Three batches of the finished product tubes are punctured, finished product content is dispensed from the tube, and then the tube is resealed with the tube cap closure. The tubes were exposed to conditions of 25 °C / 60% RH for 1 hour/day and then returned to refrigeration (2 to 8 °C) for up 16 weeks. No trend was observed. Stability-indicating impurities do show an increase over time, although all results remain within specification.

In order to confirm that the product behaves as predicted by all other stability data when the temperature transition  occurs,  additional  studies  have  been  conducted  in  which  product  has  been  stored  at  long-term conditions (-25 to -15 °C) for up to 18 months and then transferred to + 2 to +  8 °C for 6 months. The obtained stability data demonstrated that all results remain within the finished product specification.

A study of the finished product exposed to light under controlled light exposure per ICH Q1B method-defined conditions was conducted. These data support the conclusion that the primary packaging (tube) adequately protects the finished product from potential light exposure.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months when stored in the freezer (-15°C to 25°C) and 60 days in the refrigerator (+2°C to +8°C) after defrosting as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

## Adventitious agents

No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

## 2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. However a number of issues were recommended by the CHMP in relation to completion of analytical methods of the starting material and active substance, comparative batch analysis (for all parameters tested) by the active substance and finished product manufacturers, validation of cleaning of exterior of the tube and certification of compliance for the child-resistant re-closable bag.  The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.

## 2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

## 2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development

In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

1. Complete full analytical test method validation for:
- MDEA GC method 1 (related substances)

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- MDEA GC method 2 (ethylene oxide)
- GC (NM-OH in the drug substance)
- GC/MS (benzene, carbon tetrachloride and 1,2-dichloroethane in the drug substance)
- Ion chromatography (thionyl chloride in the drug substance)
- GC1 (individual and unspecified impurities in the drug substance)
- Chloride titration 1 (chloride content of the drug substance)
2. Provide comparative batch analysis (for all parameters tested) by the active substance and finished product manufacturers.
3. Perform validation of cleaning of exterior of tube prior to labelling as part of commercial-scale validation studies.
4. Provide certification of compliance to BS EN ISO 8317 for the child-resistant re-closable bag supplied with the finished product before the marketing of the product.

## 2.3. Non-clinical aspects

## 2.3.1. Introduction

The applicant did not submit non-clinical studies. A summary of non-clinical characteristics of chlormethine were presented from the published literature and is described briefly in the following sections.

## 2.3.2. Pharmacology

## Primary pharmacodynamic studies

The cytotoxicity of chlormethine has been investigated in a number of human cell lines, and low IC50 values were shown for all. In the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line LS174T, the IC50 value was 0.27 µM using the sulphorhodamine B assay. The two human colon carcinoma cell lines Colo320DM and Colo320HSR, the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937, and the human leukemic T-cell lymphoblast cell line J6 had IC50 values of 1.0, 0.79, 4.1 and 0.55 µM, respectively, using a tetrazolium (MTT)-based colorimetric assay 20 .

## Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

Not available (see non-clinical discussion).

## Safety pharmacology programme

Systemic administration of lethal or supra-lethal doses of chlormethine consistently produced adverse effects on the central nervous system in experimental animals. An i.v. injection of 20 mg/kg chlormethine to rabbits produced incoordination along with brief convulsive running movements, salivation, urination, defecation, lacrimation, bronchorrhea, and mioisis within 5 to 15 min of dosing. In mice, subcutaneous injection of 20 mg/kg and above produced tremors, depression, and intermittent convulsive activity followed later in survivors by incoordination, severe tremors, over-reaction to stimuli, coldness, diarrhoea, and retropulsive movements. Rats

20 Smith KJ, Smith WJ, Hamilton T, et al. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical features in human skin after exposure to nitrogen and sulphur mustard. Am J Dermatopathol 1998;20:22-8.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

surviving 3 to 4 days after an i.v. injection (dose not specified) exhibited increased irritability and abnormal movements, which was usually followed by death. Among survivors with less severe effects, hyperirritability persisting for weeks remained the only sign of injury. Extensive demyelination of the peripheral nerves was observed in a third of the rats 21 .

In another study 22 , rats receiving a single i.v. dose of 0.16 mM/kg (approximately equivalent to 32 mg/kg) chlormethine HCl exhibited progressive muscular paralysis and terminal convulsive seizures prior to death within 2 to 4 h. i.v. doses of less than 0.02 mM/kg caused some delayed deaths. In cats, single i.v. doses of 0.04 and 0.08 mM/kg (approximately equivalent to 8 and 16 mg/kg) rapidly produced signs of licking, vomiting, salivation, and loose stools. From 20 to 30 min post-dosing, neurological changes starting with an inability to support the head were observed, followed by progressive paralysis with gross incoordination, asynergia, tremors, dilated pupils, profuse salivation, and complete prostration. Knee jerks were observed throughout paralysis, but without signs of muscular fasciculation or specific disturbance of placing or righting reflexes. Deaths occurred in less than 18 h. At 0.02 mM/kg, symptoms within 10 minutes of dosing included licking, vomiting, salivation, and loose stools. No paralysis was observed and convulsions were noted in only 1 of 3 cats at this dose. Deaths occurred between 1 to 3 days following progressive weight loss.

In the same study, a fall in blood pressure was observed in the cat following an i.v. dose of 0.01 mM/kg chlormethine 22 . Responses to vagal stimulation and to injected acetylcholine were not significantly altered by this dose. An i.v. dose of 0.02 mM/kg abolished the circulatory response to vagal stimulation but had no significant effect on responses to i.v. acetylcholine or epinephrine. Chlormethine was shown to stimulate the isolated rabbit and guinea pig duodenum, and these responses were prevented by adequate doses of atropine 22 .

In dogs receiving a single i.v. dose of 1 mg/kg chlormethine (approximately the LD50), cardiovascular effects (decreased blood pressure, marked lack of oxygen saturation of the blood), reduction in body temperature, coldness of extremities, relaxation of anal sphincter, respiratory failure, body weight loss, terminal weakness and coma were observed prior to death usually between days 3 and 5 post-dosing. These effects arose secondary to the significant decrease in plasma and extracellular fluid volume, reduced total plasma proteins and chloride and reduction in red cells. These findings resulted at least in part from excessive emesis, which started within a few hours of dosing and increased in severity through the second and third days, and diarrhoea usually blood stained or frankly haemorrhagic, which occurred on the second to fourth day post-dosing. There was no evidence of renal vasoconstriction and renal blood flow increased in dogs at ≥24 h post-dosing; however, as circulatory failure occurred, renal blood flow decreased with no consistent change in the filtration fraction. No permanent neurological injury was observed in surviving dogs. Leucopenia was most marked on the fourth or fifth day postdosing. Gross pathology showed enteritis mainly in the small intestine along with effects on spleen and thymus, and histopathology also showed intestinal, lymphoid, and myeloid injury 23 .

## 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

## Absorption

Sensitive biomarker-based (mitotic index, protein, RNA and DNA synthesis) studies performed in mice using vaginal, rectal, and dermal administration indicate an absence of systemic or extended local exposure at doses/concentrations relevant to the therapeutic application of chlormethine gel.

In one study, female Swiss mice received a single intravaginal administration of a 1% solution of chlormethine in water and the incorporation of radiolabelled protein ([3H]leucine), RNA ([3H]uridine), and DNA ([3H]thymidine) precursors was measured as indicators of protein, RNA and DNA synthesis. Chlormethine completely inhibited DNA synthesis only in the vaginal cells (i.e., locally at the site of application), without evidence of systemic absorption (as measured by lack of effect on DNA synthesis in the rectum). Chlormethine did not affect RNA or protein synthesis in the vagina or rectum 24 .

Inhibition of mitotic activity in the vaginal mucosa was reported in mice (n=9) receiving an intravaginal dose of 50 μl of 0.01% chlormethine (prepared in water); no evidence of systemic exposure was observed based on an assessment of mitotic activity in the rectal mucosa. Conversely, when mice (n=6) received a single intra-rectal dose of 0.01% chlormethine, mitosis in the rectal mucosa was blocked, but not in the vaginal mucosa, again showing no evidence of systemic exposure 25 .

Another demonstration of local, but not systemic, anti-mitotic effects of chlormethine was reported in an animal model whereby ultraviolet (UV) light was used to induce epidermal hyperplasia in hairless HRS/J mice 26 . Chlormethine reduced the mitotic index and DNA synthesis only at the site of application (i.e., the neck) but had no effect on these parameters on a control area on the back, indicating that chlormethine effects were local and not systemic.

## Distribution

Following i.v. administration, distribution of chlormethine-derived material other than to the local site has been reported. In mice, an i.v. dose of 35 mg/kg produced measurable levels of radioactivity in the brain, spinal cord, lungs, and submaxillary glands as determined by autoradiography, whereas in rats 16% of an administered dose (unspecified) was found in the spleen, lungs, kidneys, liver, and blood 27 ; in dogs, a 3 mg/kg i.v. dose rapidly disappeared from the blood and produced low levels in tissues, with the highest levels in the bone marrow 28 .

## Metabolism

In water or body fluids, chlormethine undergoes rapid chemical transformation and combines with water or reactive compounds of cells, so that the drug is no longer present in active form. A significant loss of toxicity occurred upon incubation of chlormethine in blood ex vivo prior to its injection into rats 29 . The biological potency of chlormethine was shown to decrease rapidly as measured in mouse, cat, and rabbit arterial occlusion

models 29, 30, 31,32 . Longer occlusion times resulted in protection from bone marrow damage; this followed a dose-response 31, 32 .

After topical application, chlormethine may be transformed into three of the most common chlormethine degradation products that are formed in aqueous solutions: the half mustard N-methyl (β- chloroethyl) 2-hydroxyethylamine, the dimer N,N'-dimethyl-N,N' bis(2- chloroethyl)piperazinium, and N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) 4  . With the exception of the dimer, these transformations are likely to occur within minutes after contact with body constituents. The primary transformation product, the half mustard, is reactive 33 and will rapidly cyclize. It was shown to be at least as toxic as chlormethine in older toxicology studies 4,34 . These findings however, were not observed in the arterial occlusion and ex vivo incubation models described earlier in this section, in which degradation products produced significantly less mortality and toxicity. Neither the dimer nor MDEA showed antimitotic activity on mouse vaginal epithelium 33  . MDEA exhibits minimal acute toxicity (oral LD50 in rats of 4.78 g/kg and topical LD50 in rabbits of 6.24 g/kg) 35 .

## Excretion

Information was found on excretion of chlormethine following i.v. dosing at or above the LD50: in dogs administered 0.5-3 mg/kg, low levels of chlormethine were found in the urine; in rats, less than 20% of an administered dose of 3.3 mg/kg was recovered in the urine 28 ; in mice, 15% of the dose (4 mg/kg) was eliminated as CO2, 5% in the urine, and 13% in the feces after 24 h 36 .

## 2.3.4. Toxicology

## Single dose toxicity

Single-dose studies have been performed in mice utilizing vaginal, rectal, or other local routes of application and concentrations ranging from 0.01-2% chlormethine (concentrations comparable to or up to 100-fold higher than those in the clinical studies in MF-type CTCL). Several studies investigated the acute toxicity of chlormethine after dermal application. In these studies the compound was applied at very high doses and was formulated in solvents that increase skin permeability (e.g., DMSO, chloroform).

Significant systemic toxicity, including mortality and local toxicity, were described after topical application of 700-fold the estimated highest daily dose used in the clinical study with chlormethine gel. Signs of systemic exposure to the parent drug were not observed in animals after topical application of aqueous formulations of chlormethine at concentrations up to 100-fold higher than the concentration in chlormethine gel. Margins to the human doses are shown in Table 1

*Assuming human body weight of 60 kg, 0.016% chlormethine per g gel. † In clinical study 201. **For margin calculation, daily human dose was multiplied by 7.

The topical LD50 values for chlormethine free base (≥99% pure) in two vehicles (PEG 300 and DMSO) were determined in female Swiss mice 37  . For chlormethine in PEG 300, the LD50 was 33.6 mg/kg (corresponding to a local concentration of 0.5 mg/cm 2 ). For chlormethine in DMSO, the LD50 was 20 mg/kg (corresponding to a local concentration of 0.3 mg/cm 2 ). Body weights were reduced from 24 h post exposure. Death occurred within 8 to 12 days following topical dosing. In the second phase of the study, chlormethine was administered topically at the LD50 dose in DMSO ( i.e. , at 20 mg/kg).  Body weight was significantly reduced when compared to controls at Days 3 (n=6) and 7 (n=4). In haematology, white blood cells (WBC) were decreased and red blood cells (RBC) were increased (Day 3). In clinical chemistry, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) were increased (Days 3 and 7). At necropsy, decreased relative spleen weight and increased relative kidney weight were observed (Day 3). Furthermore, biochemical analysis of the liver revealed decreased hepatic glutathione (GSH) (Day 3) and oxidized glutathione (glutathione disulfide [GSSG]) (Days 3) and increased malondialdehyde (MDA; a measure of lipid peroxidation) (Days 3 and 7), and DNA fragmentation (Days 3 and 7).

In a second, similar study 38 , chlormethine free base (≥99% pure) was administered in DMSO as a single topical dose at 0 or 20 mg/kg (corresponding to a local concentration on the skin of 0.68 mg/cm 2 ) to female Swiss mice (n=4 on Days 0-4, n=2 on Days 5 and 7, n=3 on Day 6). The following were observed as compared to the controls: body weights declined until Days 5-6; decreased WBC count from 24 h onwards with a maximum effect on Day 3 followed by subsequent increase; no change in RBC count or haemoglobin; decreased hepatic GSH within 24 h, reaching a maximum reduction on Day 7; increased glutathione dioxide at 24 h with progressive decreases below control levels on subsequent days; progressive increases in hepatic MDA (beginning on Day 2) and percent hepatic DNA damage (beginning on Day 1); no effect on liver and kidney weights; progressive decrease in spleen weight beginning on Day 1 until Day 4 with subsequent increase; no significant change in AST and ALT levels until Day 4, when the activities significantly increased; and no effect on alkaline phosphatase activity. In addition, in the same study, single topical doses of 5 or 10 mg/kg (n=5 or 6/group/time point, local concentrations on the skin were 0.17 mg/cm 2  and 0.34 mg/cm 2 , respectively) were applied to female Swiss mice. Effects on WBC count, MDA, DNA damage, and spleen weight were observed, generally less pronounced when compared to 20 mg/kg, indicating a dose-response relationship.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In another study, female Swiss mice were treated with 20 mg/kg or DMSO as previously described 39,40  . Here, histopathology was performed on skin, liver, spleen, and kidney. Significant histopathological findings in liver included granulovascular degeneration with perinuclear clumping of the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Hepatic lesions were characterised by congestion and haemorrhage. Kidneys showed minimal to severe proximal tubule atrophy, minimal to moderate haemorrhage, and necrosis of tubular parenchymal cells. Spleens showed vascular congestion and increases in hematopoietic precursor cells, along with hypocellularity of white pulp follicles. In the treated skin, there was focal keratinocyte swelling and epidermal necrosis in the stratum corneum, with swollen cells throughout the epidermis. Large amounts of inflammatory cells were observed in the dermal region. Histopathology changes were greater by Day 7 compared to Day 3 in liver, skin, and kidneys, but reduced or resolved by Day 7 in the spleen.

Tewari-Singh et al. 41  reported studies in which SKH-1 hairless and C57BL/6 (haired) mice (n=5) were exposed topically to 200 µL acetone alone or to 3.2 mg chlormethine hydrochloride in 200 μL acetone (corresponding to a dose of 160 mg/kg) for 12 h, 24 h, 72 h and 120 h. Untreated controls were included in the study. Following the above mentioned exposures, mice were euthanised, and the dorsal skin was collected and investigated. Chlormethine hydrochloride treatment caused edema, erythema, microblister formation, pigmentation changes, dry skin, and wounding on the skin of SKH-1 hairless and C57BL/6 mice. Histopathologically, effects consisted of increased epidermal thickness, epidermal-dermal separation, necrotic/dead epidermis, epidermal denuding, scab formation, parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis, and acanthosis with hyperplasia 42 .

## Repeat dose toxicity

No repeat dose toxicity studies or publications were submitted (see non-clinical discussion).

## Genotoxicity

Fox and Scott 43 and Povirk and Shuker 44   have published comprehensive reviews of the mutagenicity of chlormethine. Reversions were reported in several bacterial and fungal strains, mutations were reported in plant strains, dominant and recessive lethal mutations occurred in insect strains, and dominant lethal and forward mutations occurred in mammalian strains. In addition, cytogenetic effects (structural and numerical aberrations) have been reported in plant, human, and rodent cells. These data confirm that chlormethine is mutagenic in bacterial, plant, and mammalian cells.

Chlormethine was positive in the Ames assay 45 . Metabolic activation was not required to produce mutagenicity. A dose-related increase in revertant colonies was observed at all concentrations tested (10 to 40 µg/plate). Similar findings were reported by Bruce and Heddle 46 .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Chlormethine has been reported to induce chromosome aberrations 47,48 , DNA damage in vitro 49,50 , and mutations in peripheral human lymphocytes exposed to chlormethine in vitro . The IC50 for induction of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus mutations in the T lymphocytes was 1.34 µM for a 30 min exposure period. The IC50 for growth inhibition was in the range of 0.5-3.7 µM for the individual lymphocyte populations from nine different donors 50 .

In Drosophila flies, chlormethine (0.5 and 1 mM), administered via an abdominal injection, produced an increase in recessive lethal mutations; mutagenic activity observed was mainly a result of the formation of DNA crosslinks whereas DNA monoadducts were responsible for only a minor contribution to the mutagenic activity 51 .

## Mutagenicity

Male Dub:(ICR) mice were treated i.v. with chlormethine at doses ranging from 0.1 to 3.75 mg/kg and were mated to untreated females 7 to 20 days post-treatment to assess the occurrence of dominant lethal mutations 52 . A dose-related increase in mutations was observed in the embryos. Similar findings were reported when male Dub:(ICR) mice were given a single i.v. injection of 2 mg/kg and 5 weeks later were mated to untreated females 53 . The matings continued for 5 weeks. Chlormethine produced a statistically significant increase in dominant lethal mutations in the embryos.

## Carcinogenicity

Zackheim and Smuckler 54  investigated the carcinogenic effect of chlormethine after topical application to mice. Female Swiss mice were exposed topically (to the shaved mid-back) to doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg chlormethine in 95% ethanol (approx. 5 and 15 mg/kg, respectively) for 20 to 33 weeks. When mice were exposed to 0.3 mg chlormethine once per week, 8 of 24 animals developed skin tumours (7 animals with papillomas and 1 squamous cell carcinoma) after 20 weeks of treatment. Administration of 0.1 mg chlormethine once per week produced no tumours in 30 animals after 33 weeks. Administration of 0.1 mg of chlormethine three times per week produced skin papillomas with no squamous cell carcinoma in 6/29 animals after 26 weeks of treatment. No skin tumours developed in the 34 controls. Irritant dermatitis, alopecia, and scarring were observed in a high percentage of the chlormethine-treated animals at 0.1 mg three times weekly and 0.3 mg weekly.

Epstein 55 investigated the effect of chlormethine on UVB irradiation-mediated tumour formation in hairless mouse skin. 0.1 mg chlormethine per animal in 95% ethanol (approx. 5 mg/kg) or vehicle were applied weekly for 52 weeks to the posterior halves of the backs of four groups of Ucsd (Hr) albino hairless mice (n=42 to 54/group) without and with UVB irradiation (1.98 x 102 mJ/cm 2 , 3 times per week). Treatment with chlormethine/UVB resulted in faster cutaneous tumour formation than ethanol/UVB. The first skin tumours were

observed after 21 weeks in the chlormethine/UVB group and after 28 weeks in the ethanol/UVB group. Furthermore, administration of chlormethine/UVB increased the tumour size as compared to ethanol/UVB. Tumours reached 50 mm 3 by 22 weeks and 100 mm 3 by 24 weeks in the chlormethine/UVB group. Tumours reached 50 mm 3 and 100 mm 3 by 32 weeks in the ethanol/UVB group. Neither chlormethine alone nor ethanol alone without UVB irradiation produced skin tumours. The skin of the animals in these groups without UVB irradiation showed no gross evidence of damage, thickening, desquamation or premalignant changes at the termination of the study.

In a second, similar study by Epstein 56  , a higher dose of chlormethine was used compared to the study described above. A dose of 0.1 mg chlormethine per animal applied twice weekly without UVB produced skin tumours in 34% of the mice. The chlormethine treatments plus UVB radiation resulted in a significant acceleration of tumour formation as compared to either carcinogenic stimulus alone. The twice-weekly application of chlormethine in presence of UVB exposure was more tumorigenic than once-weekly application of chlormethine in presence of UVB.

## Reproduction toxicity

## Fertility and early embryonic development

Chlormethine, administered to male Wistar rats via i.v. injection at doses of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 24 weeks (i.e., 12 doses), produced significantly impaired fertility at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg 57 . The effect was generally not reversible after 40 weeks of recovery. No fertility effects were noted at 0.1 mg/kg. Mortality was observed at 0.5 mg/kg, where 31% of the treated males died. There was no significant effect on numbers of foetal implants at any dose level.

When chlormethine was administered as a single i.p. or i.v. injection at doses ranging from 0.02 to 4 mg/kg to male mice, 3 mg/kg was cytotoxic to spermatogonia and spermatocytes as assessed on Day 11. A dose-related decrease in sperm head count occurred at doses of 1 mg/kg and higher on Day 29; this effect was not observed at Day 56 58 .

Chlormethine was administered i.p. to male and female C57 BL/6J mice for 4 consecutive days at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Two weeks later, treated males were mated with treated females. The pregnancy rate was 80% for untreated males paired with untreated females and 12.5% for treated males paired with treated females. In the treated groups, mean litter size was reduced and none of the offspring survived 59 .

## Embryo-fœtal development

Female mice (n=78) received a single i.p. injection of 1 to 2 mg/kg on Gestation Day (GD) 10, 11, or 12 and the fetuses were examined on GD 14 or later 60 . Many of the fetuses died, but 178/475 exhibited malformations, with 150 of the foetuses exhibiting malformations in the foot. A single s.c. injection of 2.5 mg/kg on GD 6 to 13 to female mice produced malformations primarily involving defects of the extremities (i.e., limbs and digits); embryo lethality was also observed mainly on GD 8 to 10 61 .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Pregnant female Swiss mice (n=4/group/timepoint) received a single i.p. injection of chlormethine (0.1 to 1 mg/kg) on GD 11 or 12 and the embryos were harvested on GD 12 62 . The embryo was dispersed into a cell suspension and evaluated for chromosomal aberrations. Following a 6-hour exposure, the frequency of metaphases with chromosomal aberrations was 1.3% (untreated control), 1.2% (saline control), and 6.9, 48.7, and 82.5% (chlormethine at 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg, respectively). In addition, doses of 0.5 and 1 mg/kg increased the number of multiple aberrations and pulverized chromosomes. Similar effects were observed following a 2-hour exposure to 1 mg/kg and continued to be evident at times up to a 24-h exposure. Finally, when 5 females were dosed on GD 11 at 1 mg/kg and sacrificed on GD 19, 47 viable foetuses with a mean body weight of 0.9 grams were obtained with 15 resorptions and 2 late deaths. In the 5 female controls, there were 60 viable foetuses with a mean body weight of 1.27 grams, with 1 early and 2 late deaths. Approximately 40% of the chlormethine-treated foetuses exhibited gross malformations, primarily in the limbs. No malformations occurred in the controls.

Female rats received single s.c. injections of 1 mg/kg on GD 12, 13, 14, or 15 and the foetuses were removed on GD 21. Foetal mortality or resorptions were observed after treatment on GD 12 or GD 13 and abnormal foetuses were observed after treatment on GD 13 and 14. When the dose was split in 2 x 0.5 mg/kg over 2 days, no abnormalities were observed on GD 15 63 . A single s.c. injection of 1 mg/kg to pregnant rats on GD 12 or 13 produced external malformations in 90% of the foetuses, including primarily general growth retardation, small meningocele, short mandible, syndactyly, and short kinky tail 64 . When the same treatment regimen was followed and the embryos were examined for chromosomal aberrations, the percentage of abnormal metaphases was 0.8% at 6 h, approximately 14% to 18% at 12 to 18 h, and approximately 3% at 24 h as compared to 0.1% in the controls.

DEGEE administration was well tolerated after repeated dosing. Dermal administration of 100% purified DEGEE up to a high dose of 1000 mg/kg/day in NZW rabbits or 40% DEGEE in water in NZW rabbits or rats did not lead to significant systemic toxicity.

DEGEE was neither teratogenic nor embryotoxic in Sprague-Dawley rats dosed topically four times per day (at 2.5 hour intervals) on GD 7 to 16 with 0.35 mL/application. Maternal weight gain was lower than in the controls (treated with water) which provided evidence of systemic exposure 67 .

There was no evidence of in vitro or in vivo genotoxicity with DEGEE 66 .

DEGEE was not carcinogenic in a GLP-compliant, 26-week topical carcinogenicity study in Tg.AC mice, in which DEGEE was used as the vehicle 68 . As detailed in a review publication 69 , there is no evidence for carcinogenicity of DEGEE based on use of 40% DEGEE in aqueous solution as an oral dose control arm in a rat study over 92 weeks for females and 100 weeks for males. In a 52-week albino hairless mouse study in which animals were treated with a cumulative UV dose (600 Robertson-Berger units/week), the 5% dapsone topical gel vehicle containing 25% DEGEE did not cause an increased incidence of tumours or reduce time to tumor development 69 .

## DEGEE Exposure and safety margin assessment

The mean daily clinical dose (DD) of chlormethine gel in the clinical trials was 2.81 g; the estimated highest daily dose of chlormethine gel in a single subject was 10.5 grams. DEGEE is present in the Gel at 49.91%. A dermal absorption of 50.4% of an applied DEGEE dose can be assumed, resulting in a mean clinically absorbed dose of 11.8 mg/kg/day and a maximal clinically absorbed dose of 44 mg/kg/day.

Topical administration of diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DEGEE) to rabbits resulted in a NOAEL of 1000 mg/kg/day in a 28-day study. When comparing the NOAEL with the estimated highest daily clinical dose of DEGEE with chlormethine gel, the safety margin is 22.7 based on body weight. For the mean daily clinical dose of 2.81 g chlormethine gel, the safety margin is 85 based on body weight.

Oral administration of DEGEE to dogs also resulted in a NOAEL of 1000 mg/kg/day in a 90-day GLP study. The resulting safety margins for the estimated highest daily dose of chlormethine gel are 22.7 based on weight and 12.6 based on human equivalent dose (HED). For the mean DD, the safety margin is 85 based on weight and 46 based on HED.

## 2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

An environmental risk assessment report was provided for evaluation of chlormethine gel. A Phase I estimation of exposure has been performed for chlormethine hydrochloride, since the use of chlormethine gel increases environmental exposure to chlormethine hydrochloride.

## Screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity

According to the CHMP guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, 1 June 2006), drug substances with a log Kow &gt; 4.5 should be screened for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. The measurement of the log Kow of chlormethine hydrochloride

69 Osborne DW. Diethylene glycol monoethyl ether: an emerging solvent in topical dermatology products. J Cosmet Dermatol 2011;10:324-9

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

should be assessed with an aqueous buffer set at a chosen pH so that mainly the neutral form of the molecule is present ('Shake-Flask method', OECD 107).

As chlormethine hydrochloride is an ionisable molecule due to a basic function with a pKa of 6.4 (TOXNET 2014), the neutral form of the molecule is predominant in aqueous solution at pH much above 6.4.

Therefore the measurement must be performed at pH = 7.4 or optimally at pH = 8.4 where 99% of the molecule is neutral. However, a dedicated stability study of chlormethine hydrochloride in aqueous buffered solutions at pH = 7.4 and pH = 8.4 showed its rapid decomposition (YAU-R5624): at the time-point 0 minute, chlormethine hydrochloride degraded ~50% at both pH values. By 30 minutes, 1 hour and 2 hours, degradation at both pH values was ~90%, 98-99% and 100%, respectively. Therefore, the log Kow of chlormethine hydrochloride could not be determined experimentally, and only the estimated log Kow value of -1.24, was used.

An Fpen default value of 0.01 (1%) is proposed in the guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, 1 June 2006). However, if data (reasonably justified market penetration data, e.g., based on published epidemiological data) are available to estimate a more accurate refined Fpen, this may be used. According to recent epidemiological data the number of people affected with MF-type CTCL in the EU-28 population is estimated to be 11,735, using available information 2 . This would correspond to an overall prevalence of MF-type CTCL in the EU of 0.22 per 10,000. This is the basis for estimating refined Fpen.

The worst-case (highest) calculation of the PECSURFACEWATER is shown below.

PECSURFACEWATER of chlormethine HCl = DOSEai × Refined Fpen WASTEWinhab × DILUTION

PECSURFACEWATER (mg/L)

= 2.1 × 0.000022 200 × 10

PECSURFACEWATER of chlormethine HCl = 0.000023 μg/L

In the worst-case predicted surface water concentration for chlormethine hydrochloride is 435 times lower than this default threshold value (action limit).

## 2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

Chlormethine is a bifunctional alkylating agent that inhibits rapidly proliferating cells. Chlormethine gel, a topical formulation of 0.016% w/w chlormethine (0.02% w/w as chlormethine hydrochloride), has been developed for the treatment in adult patients of mycosis fungoides type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF-type CTCL). The applicant submitted non-clinical literature to support the application which was considered to be acceptable in view of the known pharmaco-toxicological properties and the extensive clinical experience with chlormethine.

The available literature shows effects of toxic systemic doses of chlormethine on the function of vital organ systems. The relevance of these data (generated in the period 1947-1949) is considered to be limited as the investigated dose levels were often beyond the maximum tolerated dose.  Biomarker-based studies performed in mice using vaginal, rectal, and topical administration indicated an absence of systemic or extended local exposure at doses/concentrations relevant to the therapeutic application of chlormethine gel. These published nonclinical studies support a lack of any significant systemic exposure to chlormethine following topical application of chlormethine gel. Thus the lack of secondary pharmacology programme is considered acceptable. This conclusion is in line with ICH S7A (Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals), which states in Section 2.9 that safety pharmacology studies may not be needed for locally applied agents (e.g., dermal or ocular) where the pharmacology of the test substance is well characterized, and where systemic exposure or distribution to other organs or tissues is demonstrated to be low.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

It appears that the metabolism of chlormethine is not fully known. It is possible that after topical application chlormethine is transformed into three of the most common chlormethine degradation products that are formed in aqueous solutions: the half mustard [N-methyl ß-chloroethyl) 2-hydroxyethylamine], the dimer N,N'-dimethyl-N,N' bis(2-chloroethyl)piperazinium, and N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). With the exception of the dimer, these transformations are likely to occur within minutes after contact with body constituents although the rate of transformation in skin is unknown.  As no signs of systemic exposure to chlormethine were observed in animals after topical application, no excretion of the test compound or its degradation products is expected. There are no anticipated systemic interactions involving chlormethine or its metabolites following topical administration of chlormethine gel, given the lack of detectable systemic exposure.

The single dose toxicity of chlormethine has been adequately characterised in the published literature. Topical application of 0.01% - 2% chlormethine to animals, concentrations comparable to or up to 100-fold higher than in chlormethine gel, did not lead to systemic toxicity, suggesting absence of relevant systemic exposure to chlormethine.

Chlormethine was genotoxic both in vitro and in vivo . The genotoxicity of chlormethine is well established, since its pharmacological mechanism of action is primarily due to DNA cross-linking. Chlormethine was shown to be genotoxic in bacterial, plant, and mammalian cells. Chlormethine was carcinogenic in rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies after subcutaneous and intravenous administration.

Chlormethine was carcinogenic following dermal, i.v., s.c., and i.p. administration in mice and/or rats. Dermal application of chlormethine to mice at a dose of 15 mg/kg for up to 33 weeks resulted in skin tumours (squamous cell carcinomas and skin papilloma). There were no reports of systemic tumours after topical administration of chlormethine., which is consistent with no relevant systemic availability of chlormethine.

Chlormethine adversely affected male fertility and was embryotoxic and teratogenic in mice and rats after systemic chlormethine administration. Intravenously administered chlormethine impaired male fertility in rats at a daily dose of ≥ 0.25 mg/kg for 2 weeks. No dedicated animal studies on the effects of chlormethine on female fertility have been reported in the literature. Chlormethine caused foetal malformations in mice and rats when given as single injections of 1-2.5 mg/kg. Other findings in animals included embryo-lethality and growth retardation when administered as a single injection. Chlormethine is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of child bearing potential not using contraception.

There was no information on pharmacodynamic drug interaction, repeated-dose toxicity, toxicokinetic data, and in pre-and postnatal development presented. The systemic and local toxicities are well characterised and thus, the lack of studies is acceptable and no further non-clinical studies are considered necessary.

The toxicity of DEGEE following topical administration was well characterized. DEGEE is neither genotoxic, carcinogenic nor teratogenic.

The absence of systemic exposure after dermal application of chlormethine at relevant concentrations limits potential toxicity to local effects. Topical administration appeared to be well tolerated up to high doses. However, nitrogen mustards are vesicants causing skin, eye, and respiratory tract injury. Thus, dermal irritation and hypersensitivity reactions are expected (see clinical safety). No additional local toxicity studies for the gel formulation are considered necessary.

Chlormethine hydrochloride is not a PBT substance as log Kow is much below 4.5 and hence, an assessment of chlormethine hydrochloride for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity was not considered necessary. The Phase I action limit of 0.01 μg/L is not exceeded for chlormethine hydrochloride from the use of chlormethine gel. In the worst-case, predicted surface water concentration for chlormethine hydrochloride is 435 times lower

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

than this default threshold value (action limit). It is expected that the relative half-life of the active form of the compound is short in water and body fluids, chlormethine undergoes rapid chemical transformation and combines with water or reactive compounds in cells. Thus, chlormethine gel does not appear to represent a risk to the environment. However, chlormethine hydrochloride should be used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC section 6.6 (any unused medicinal product or waste material, including nitrile gloves used for application, must be disposed of in accordance with local requirements) in order to minimise any potential risks to the environment.

Non-clinical information has been reflected in section 5.3 and relevant statements have been included in SmPC section 4.6.

## 2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The non-clinical effects of chlormetine containing products have been well established in a comprehensive literature review. There is extensive and long term clinical experience with the test substance and no additional nonclinical studies are considered.

Ledaga is not expected to pose a significant risk to the environment.

Information has been adequately reflected in the SmPC sections 4.6, 5.3 and 6.6.

## 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics

## Absorption

## Study 201 (pivotal study)

Study 201 was a multi-centre, randomised study comparing the efficacy, tolerability and safety of 0.02% chlormethine gel with AP in patients with MF. In a cohort of patients, blood samples were collected pre-dose at the baseline visit and 1, 3 and 6 hours after the first application of study treatment and at pre-dose the month 1 visit (see methods section in 2.4.6.). Samples were analysed using HPLC method

## Results

Plasma samples were collected from 23 patients (16 patients treated with chlormethine gel and 7 patients treated with AP, including patients who received whole body treatment. No measurable plasma concentrations of chlormethine were observed in any of the samples assayed.

## Study 202 (extension study)

Study 202 was an open-label, single-arm study in patients who had completed study 201 but who had not achieved a complete response. Patients received up to 7 months of further treatment with a higher strength of chlormethine gel, 0.04%. Plasma samples were collected prior to treatment and 1 h after treatment at the baseline visit (or month 2 or 4 if the patient had already started the trial). A third sample per patient was also scheduled for collection prior to treatment and 1 h after application after 4 or 6 months' exposure. Samples were analysed using LC/MS/MS method (see methods section in 2.4.6).

## Results

Plasma samples were collected from 15 patients. For all 39 plasma samples assayed, the concentrations of chlormethine and half-mustard were below the LLOQ. Further, the chromatograms were examined, and there were no detectable peaks, based on lower limits of detection estimated to be 0.3 ng/mL for chlormethine and 1.0 ng/mL for half-mustard.

## 2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics

The applicant did not submit pharmacodynamic studies (see pharmacology discussion).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 2.4.4. Discussion on the pharmacology aspects

In clinical study 201 there was no evidence of systemic exposure following topical application of chlormethine gel. In study 202 there was also no evidence of systemic exposure following topical application of the higher strength gel, thus confirming the lack of systemic exposure at the recommended topical doses of chlormethine gel that has been seen in non-clinical studies. Patients who received chlormethine gel in Study 201 had no measurable concentrations of chlormethine in blood collected 1, 3 and 6 hours post-application on Day 1, and at the first month visit. Similarly, patients who received chlormethine gel 0.04% in a follow-up study (Study 202) had no measurable concentrations of chlormethine or its degradation product (half-mustard) in blood collected 1 hour post-application on Day 1 or after 2, 4, or 6 months of treatment (See SmPC section 5.2.). Animal safety pharmacology data collected from publications (see discussion on non-clinical aspects) are considered supportive of the pharmacological effect of chlormethine in humans. In view of these findings and since there is extensive clinical safety experience with chlormethine gel and related formulations, no further pharmacological studies are required.

## 2.4.5. Conclusion on the pharmacology aspects

The clinical pharmacology of chlormethine gel is considered to have been adequately evaluated from the data in the Studies 201 and 202. There was no evidence of systemic exposure following topical application of chlormethine gel. There was also no evidence of systemic exposure following topical application of the higher strength gel.  It has been demonstrated that there is no systemic exposure to chlormethine following local cutaneous administration of chlormethine gel. Therefore, the lack of dedicated PK and PD studies are acceptable.

## 2.4.6. Clinical efficacy

| Dose and mode of administration     | Daily application of a thin topical film at approximately the same time each day, not to wash off for a minimum of 4 hours and not to cover the areas of application for 5-10 minutes. Patients were treated in an outpatient setting. Patients with stage IA disease were generally instructed to treat all affected lesions. Full body application (excluded the area around the eyes and mucous membranes) was generally prescribed if the subject had either (1) stage IB or IIA MF or (2) severity of new lesions developing after treatment initiation met the criteria for progressive disease (≥25% worsening). The final decision to treat specific lesions or whole body was at the discretion of the investigator. Treatment Adjustments for Toxicity: Frequency of application was adjusted for toxicity. The frequency of application could be reduced or temporarily suspended, then re-introduced with a reduced frequency, in case of Grade 3 - 4 skin toxicity/local | Daily application of a thin topical film at approximately the same time each day, not to wash off for a minimum of 4 hours and not to cover the areas of application for 5-10 minutes.

## Objectives

The primary objective: To evaluate the efficacy of topical application of nitrogen mustard (NM) 0.02% in a propylene glycol ointment (PG) vs. NM 0.02% in an Aquaphor ointment (AP) in subjects with stage I or IIA mycosis fungoides (MF).

The secondary objective: To evaluate the tolerability and safety of topical application of NM 0.02% ointment formulations in patients with stage IA, IB or IIA MF.

## Outcomes/endpoints

The primary efficacy endpoint was response rate defined as response rate (complete + partial) using the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) score. The CAILS requires scoring of up to five index lesions (lesions selected for assessment of efficacy) for scaling (0-8), erythema (0-8), plaque elevation (0-3), and surface area (0-18). The sum of the scores for each of these categories and each of the five index lesions represents the total CAILS score. 70

The CAILS score utilised in Studies 201 and 202 differed slightly from previously published versions. The assessment of hypo/hyperpigmentation was eliminated from the scale as well as the assessment of plaque elevation was simplified into a more compressed scale because the available data did not support the ability to clinically differentiate smaller gradations. There was also the substitution of the percent BSA value for index lesions rather than a 0-18 categorical scale.  A comparison of these CAILS scores is shown in Table 5.

BSA = body surface area.

The main secondary endpoint was as follows:

- Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (SWAT)  70  was determined by weighting BSA involvement for patches, plaques and tumours, and summing the scores for each category. The SWAT score is the sum of (1 × patch %BSA) + (2 × plaque %BSA) + (3 × tumour/ulcer %BSA).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Response rate defined as ≥ 50% improvement in the SWAT which was derived by measuring each involved area as a percentage of total body surface area (%BSA) and multiplying it by a severity-weighting factor (1=patch, 2=plaque, 3=tumour).Response was defined as ≥ 50% improvement in the baseline SWAT score on two or more consecutive observations over at least 4 weeks.

Other secondary endpoints are as follows:

- % of total body surface area response rate defined as change in the percent of total body surface area involved, a component of the SWAT, as a measure of extent of cutaneous disease. Confirmed by two or more consecutive observations over at least 4 weeks.
- Time to first confirmed CAILS response defined as time to first confirmed response for a given patient, defined as the time interval from the first day study drug was dispensed to the time of the first confirmed response. This is the date of the evaluation at least 28 days after the first assessment of complete or partial response which shows that the response was sustained for at least that period of time with no intervening assessments indicating otherwise.
- Duration of response (CAILS score) defined as time from the first appearance of the response to the first assessment where the response is no longer apparent.
- Time to disease progression defined as time from first day study medication was applied to the date the first disease progression occurred ( ≥ 25% increase from baseline CAILS score)
- Safety: All patients who received at least one dose of study medication. AEs, physical examination, and clinical laboratory data
- PK: Plasma samples were collected to determine/ detect any levels of chlormethine.

## Sample size

The required sample size to demonstrate non-inferiority was estimated to be 250 patients. This was based on assumptions that the response rate in the AP comparator arm would be approximately 68% for patients who completed at least 6 months of therapy (Efficacy Evaluable population; no major protocol violations). It was considered that approximately 25% of patients would not complete 6 months of therapy e.g. due to dermatitis, concomitant illnesses.

## Randomisation

The Master List of Randomisation Numbers with the corresponding study drug assignments were sent to the site pharmacist. It was the responsibility of the site pharmacist to order and provide the correct study drug using the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

master list. Eligible patients were stratified into two groups by MF stage (IA vs. IB, IIA).

## Blinding (masking)

The study site personnel not involved with patient assessment were not blinded. Investigators and any other individuals involved with patient assessments were blinded to the assigned treatment.

## Statistical methods

This trial is designed as a non-inferiority study comparing the PG formulation of NM, 0.02% to the AP formulation of NM, 0.02% in the treatment of Stage I and IIA mycosis fungoides.  The two treatment arms were compared with respect to the response rate defined as ≥50% improvement in baseline Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) score during the 12 month study, confirmed at the next visit that is at least four weeks later (primary endpoint). Non-inferiority was assessed based on the 95% confidence interval around the ratio of the response rate of the patients treated with the PG formulation to the response rate of the patients treated with the AP formulation using the likelihood ratio methods of Miettinen and Nurminen. The PG formulation will be determined to be non-inferior to the AP formulation if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval is ≥0.75. Based on the response of a placebo controlled trial 72 , where placebo response rate was 24% (95%CI:12.6%, 38.8%),  the estimated effect size of 68% for chlormethine exceeds the placebo effect of 24% and its upper limit of the 95%CI (51%).  All statistical tests of primary endpoint were 2-sided with significance level of 0.05. No interim analysis was planned or conducted.  Time to event parameters were estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methodology and treatment arms compared using a log-rank statistic.

As secondary measures of efficacy, the response rates, defined as ≥50% improvement from baseline score confirmed at the next visit that is at least 4 weeks later, was compared between the two treatment arms based on the SWAT and the percent of total body surface area affected (%BSA). Additional secondary endpoints in the SAP were time to first confirmed response, duration of first confirmed response, and the time to initial disease progression based on the CAILS score. To control the Type I error, differences in secondary endpoints were tested at the 0.01 level.

The response categories for CAILS and SWAT in the clinical studies are shown in Table 6. All responses were assessed at the patient level and were to be confirmed at least 4 weeks after the first assessment (confirmed response).

## Recruitment

The study duration was 4 years. The date of first patient enrolment: May 2006 and date of last completed: July 2010.

## Conduct of the study

There were two significant changes to the supply of chlormethine gel during the study:

- Instruction to patients to store the gel in the refrigerator rather than at room temperature, once dispensed (made after approximately one third of patients had completed the study)
- Introduction of gel produced on a commercial scale at the intended commercial facility.

There were also a number of protocol amendments, including:

- Follow-up period was extended to 12 months to capture the occurrence of skin cancer
- The sample size was increased from 90-110 patients to 240-250 patients in recognition that the response rates in the Efficacy Evaluable population using the CAILS score would be expected to be closer to 70% than 84%. To achieve this sample size, the number of clinical sites was increased to 13.
- The requirement for mid- and post-treatment skin biopsies was eliminated. In recognition of this the FDA requested that the designation of complete (pathologic) response be deleted from the protocol.
- There had to be concordance on the diagnosis of early MF between the local and coordinating dermatopathologist (Fox Chase Cancer Center)
- Prior topical nitrogen mustard was permitted if at least 2 years had elapsed
- The language in the protocol was clarified for:
- o No other treatments for MF were permitted
- o Prior BCNU was not permitted
- The SAP was revised to control for the Type I error rate for secondary endpoints as well as incorporate changes based on other protocol amendments.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The majority of exclusions in the EE data set (75 patients) were due to the protocol deviations at the one study site (18 patients) and skin toxicity (39 patients).

The major protocol deviations that occurred were related to randomisation.

## Randomisation

The pharmacist at the site #7 assigned treatments assigned to patients based on their MF Stage and not on the master list. A total of 18 patients were recruited at this site (6.9% of patients enrolled). When it was discovered, this protocol violation was reviewed with the investigator, who was unblinded. At this time, 6 patients were still on treatment. Failure to randomise patients in accordance with the protocol was considered to be a major protocol violation. Sensitivity analyses have been introduced to evaluate the impact of this issue.

## Concomitant therapy

The records of all patients who had corticosteroids listed as a concomitant medicine while receiving study therapy were reviewed. The review showed that no patient met the criterion for a major protocol violation. One AP arm patient was treated with UVB 3 days prior to the last visit, but 2 weeks after the last application of topical chlormethine gel and subsequently withdrew from the study prior to month 2 due to TLT and wasn't excluded from the EE data set.

## Outcomes and estimation

The primary endpoint efficacy analyses were conducted on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT), the Efficacy Evaluable (EE) populations (patients with no major protocol violations who were on study for at least 6 months) and an analysis for the ITT excluding mis-randomised subjects from the site #7. The results are presented in Table 12.

## Time to first confirmed response based on CAILS score

The time to first CAILS confirmed response for a given patient was defined as the time interval from the first day of study drug was dispensed to the time of the first confirmed response.

## Duration of response based on CAILS score

For patients who achieved a confirmed CAILS response, the duration of response was defined as the time from the first appearance of the confirmed response to the first assessment where the response was no longer apparent (i.e., the CAILS score showed &lt; 50% improvement from baseline).

## Time to progression based on CAILS Score

Time to disease progression was defined as time to the first ≥ 25% increase from baseline CAILS score. 15 patients randomised to chlormethine gel arm and 10 patients randomised to the AP arm had a ≥ 25% increase from baseline CAILS score at some time during the study (protocol-defined disease progression). However, the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

majority of patients remained on treatment and 7 of the patients on the gel arm who stayed on treatment achieved a confirmed response.

## Ancillary analyses

Across the different subgroups, the response ratio (chlormethine gel/ AP) was near 1 or exceeded 1 (favouring chlormethine gel), (see Table  below) consistent with the overall study results. In addition, in all subgroups, the 95% CIs for response ratio overlapped those observed in the overall population.

## Supportive study

## Study 2007NMMF-202-US (Study 202)

## Study design

Study 202 was an open-label, multi-center, 7-month extension of Study 201 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of higher dosage strengths of Ledaga, i.e. chlormethine gel 0.04% in patients who had completed up to 12 months of treatment with chlormethine gel or AP without achieving a complete response. Patients who entered Study 202 were followed and evaluated for adverse events and skin cancers during the 7-month study treatment period and for 5 months thereafter (or the remainder of the 12-month safety follow-up period of Study 201, if treatment was discontinued prematurely).

The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a response (≥ 50% reduction in the baseline CAILS score of Study 202), confirmed by two or more consecutive observations over at least 4 weeks. Secondary efficacy endpoints were ≥ 50% improvement from baseline in the SWAT score, %BSA change from baseline and time to CAILS response by KM.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

All analyses were conducted using the Safety analysis set (N = 98), which included all patients who received at least one application of chlormethine gel 0.04%.

Patients were counted once under their primary reason for withdrawal.

AE = adverse event, AP = Chlormethine HC1 0.02% compounded in Aquaphor ointment, AE = adverse event, CAILS = composite assessment of index lesion severity.

b Two patients were withdrawn for other reasons. Patient 009-00024 initiated treatment with Chlormethine gel 0.04%, but had a CAILS score of 0 at the end of Study 201with a subsequent biopsy that confirmed a complete response. She was withdrawn after one month since she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Patient 012-00054 had a dispensing elror at the Month 6 visit.

## Primary endpoint

CAILS responses for 'Prior Index Lesions' (i.e., index lesions that were used to assess efficacy in Study 201) were assessed both relative to the baseline scores of Study 201 and relative to the baseline scores of Study 202. CAILS responses at the end of Study 202, relative to Study 201 baseline, showed that 12.2% of patients had a complete response and 63.3% had a partial response, resulting in a confirmed overall response rate of 75.5%.

Responses based on assessment of lesions compared to baseline of Study 201.

CAILS = Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity, CI=confidence interval.

CAILS responses relative to the Study 202 baseline showed that 10.2% of patients had a complete response and 13.3% had a partial response, resulting in a confirmed response rate of 23.5%. CAILS responses for 'All Index Lesions' (i.e., Prior Index Lesions still present at baseline of Study 202 and new lesions that were identified as index lesions upon entry into Study 202 but were already present at baseline of Study 201) were assessed by comparison with the Study 202 baseline score only. The confirmed overall response rate was 26.5%, with 6.1% of patients showing a complete response and 20.4% showing a partial response.

Confirmed responses occurred in 20.4% patients (95% CI: 13.4-29.2%). Of the 20 confirmed responses, 3.1% patients had complete responses and 17.3% had partial responses.

## Discussion on clinical efficacy

## Design and conduct of clinical studies

Nitrogen mustard has been part of the treatment of MF-type CTCL for more than a half century. Thus, the clinically acceptable dose of nitrogen mustard is well-known and has been well-characterised. The treatment of lesions was for the duration of the trial (maximum of 12 months), unless patients suffered treatment-limiting toxicities, which would require permanent discontinuation. If toxicity occurred, patients were required to adjust the frequency of application according to the protocol-defined guidelines (SmPC section 4.2). It has been reported in the literature that maintenance therapy has been variously continued for months, 1-2 years or

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

longer 73 . Patients with early MF-type CTLC stage IA, IB or IIA disease require management of the disease by application of skin-directed therapies and subsequent monitoring once the lesions have resolved. The EORTC consensus recommendations for the treatment of mycois fungoides/Sezary syndrome recommends that topical chlormethine therapy is continued for 6 months after clearance of skin lesions. 74 Therefore, it is expected that patients will be treated for as long as benefit is derived from the treatment of the skin lesions.

In addition, the application is includes two studies (study 201 andstudy 202). Study 201 is a multi-centre, randomised and observer-blinded study to support the efficacy and safety of this new pharmaceutical form. The study randomised 260 patients to the two treatment arms. Included patients have stage I or IIA MF-type CTCL, who have been treated with at least one skin-directed therapy (excl. nitrogen mustard and carmustine, which is a mustard gas-related nitrosourea compound). Both the inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable.

The treatment of chlormethine in the proposed indication is fully acceptable from a clinical point of view as the trial is comparing different pharmaceutical forms for an indication that has been previously approved for the active substance. Current first-line standard of care of MF-type CTCL stage I and IIA is skin-directed therapies, such as topical steroids, psoralens + PUVA, UVB and topical cystostatic agents (mechlorethamine or carmustine). The chlormethine control group used in the pivotal study is acceptable to establish efficacy and safety of Ledaga, and the activity observed for the control group was in the range of what has been reported for chlormethine formulations in clinical trials.

The principal objective of study 201 was to evaluate the efficacy of topical application of nitrogen mustard (NM) 0.02% in a propylene glycol ointment (PG) vs. NM 0.02% in an Aquaphor ointment (AP) in subjects with stage I or IIA mycosis fungoides (MF). The primary endpoint (CAILS) and several secondary endpoints (SWAT, %BSA, time to first comfirmed response, duration of response and time to progression) were considered acceptable. The primary endpoint is well-known and has previously been used as one of two co-primary endpoints in the approval of Targretin by the CHMP in 2001. The CAILS score utilised in Studies 201 and 202 differed slightly from previously published versions (see methods section). SWAT is fully acceptable as a secondary endpoint and supports the primary endpoint in the interpretation of data, as it involves direct assessment of the body surface area of each MF-type CTCL lesion. The study was designed as a non-inferiority study which is considered to be acceptable for this hybrid application. The protocol-defined criteria for non-inferiority was the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the ratio of the overall response rate for chlormethine Gel / AP ≥ 0.75. The chosen non-inferiority margin of 0.75 was selected to ensure that the efficacy of chlormethine gel would be greater than the historical placebo response rate. Based on the results of Study 201 the conclusion of the non-inferiority would have been reached with more conservative margins.

With regard to the conduct of the study, seven major amendments were made to the protocol during the study, and they are all considered reasonable and thus endorsed. There were no major concerns raised on the conduct of the study or major non-compliance issues revealed during the assessment of the dossier. There was a breach of randomisation at site #7. The applicant has taken account of the breach at the site #7 site in the analyses sets of the primary and secondary endpoints and it was concluded that there is no statistical difference between the data with or without the site and the results are consistent with the outcome of the primary endpoint. Study 201 appears to be a well-conducted study with an acceptable study design to support the demonstration of non-inferior clinical efficacy relative to the AP formulation in the selected MF patients population.

The baseline characteristics are well balanced, however, there are slightly more patients with stage IA disease in the chlormethine gel group, however, it is not considered to have a major impact on the results. Very few patients were stage IIA (only two in each arm). Most patients are 18-64 years, have stage IA or IB disease, with prior therapy consisting of corticosteroids, phototherapy or Targretin.

## Efficacy data and additional analyses

The efficacy data derived from Study 201 demonstrate that the gel formulation is non-inferior to the comparatorfor both ITT and EE populations for the primary endpoint CAILS response and for the important secondary endpoint, SWAT. For the EE analysis set, the overall response rates were 76.7% for chlormethine gel and 58.9% for AP comparator (ratio 1.301; 95% CI: 1.065-1.609). The SWAT results demonstrated an overall response rate of 63.3% for gel vs 55.8% for the AP in the EE analysis set (ratio 1.135; 95% CI: 0.8931.448). There are slightly more patients with stage IA in the chlormethine gel arm, which appear to fair better than those with more advanced disease. Time to first confirmed response based on CAILS scores (a secondary endpoint), also showed a statistically significant difference in favour of chlormethine gel. The difference is only borderline significant in the EE analysis, while non-significant in the ITT analyses. The expected response rate for the AP formulation is within the range of responses observed in other studies with other compounded presentations of chlormethine. Therefore, the differences observed between Ledaga and the AP comparator are not considered clinically relevant and comparable equivalence can be considered demonstrated.

Additional supportive evidence is shown in study 202. Increasing the dose and extending the treatment period seems to increase the chances for complete or partial response, when compared to baseline index lesions at study start in study 201. However, the chances for partial responses diminish substantially, when compared to index lesion at study start in study 202. This study is considered to be supportive only- as the strength is higher than the proposed marketed product.

The indication ' topical treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF type CTCL) in adult patients' is broader than the inclusion criteria of study 201 (early stage I or IIA disease and previously treated with at least one skin-directed therapy). Although the claimed indication represents a broader population of patients than the inclusion criteria of the pivotal study, no relevant differences in efficacy and safety are expected. Safety and efficacy of Ledaga are considered established for treatment of patients at any stage of the disease.

## Conclusions on clinical efficacy

The formulation of chlormethine (AP) used in the pivotal trial is considered to be comparable in terms of efficacy to the reference product, based on the known pharmacokinetics of the products and given that the two products have the same active substance, strength, route of administration and indication, and based on indirect comparison of the efficacy and safety profiles.

Based on the non-inferiority in efficacy of Ledaga compared to the formulation of chlormethine used in the pivotal trial, the CHMP considered that the results of appropriate clinical trials have been submitted to demonstrate efficacy of Ledaga. These results are supported by the secondary endpoints as well as the results from the extension study 202. No additional toxicological, pharmacological or clinical tests were considered necessary to establish the efficacy of Ledaga.

## 2.4.7. Clinical safety

Safety data are derived from studies 2005NMMF-201-US and 2005NMMF-202-US. 255 patients were enrolled in study 2005NMMF-201-US, 128 on the chlormethine gel and 127 on AP formulation. Approximately 65% of patients received study treatment for &gt; 48 weeks. The median duration of treatment for the gel was 51.7 weeks and 52.0 weeks for the AP. Safety information is also provided from the published literature, based on the known safety profile of the reference product and post-marketing experience in the US. Safety topics of special interest were identified as non-melanoma skin cancer, hypersensitivity and adverse events that could indicate systemic effects of topical administration of chlormethine.

## Patient exposure

Patient exposure includes:

- 255 patients in study 201, (128 on chlormethine gel, 127 on AP)
- 98 patients in study 202, 90.8% patients received more than 24 weeks of treatment
- Chlormethine gel has been approved in the US under the brand name Valchlor. 4 quarterly Periodic Adverse Drug Experience Reports have been submitted to the FDA (23 August 2013 to 22 August 2014 - total of 784 patients)

In Study 202, patients were treated for an average of 28.8 weeks and a total of 89 (90.8%) patients received &gt; 24 weeks of treatment.  8.2% of patients required a reduction in dosing frequency, 5.1% of patients required a temporary suspension of dosing and 5.1% of patients discontinued study treatment due to AEs.

## Adverse events

In study 201, 84.4% of patients treated with chlormethine gel and 90.6% of patients treated with AP experienced at least one AE. AEs that were considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug were reported by 62% of the patients on the gel arm and 50% of patients on the AP arm. In both treatment arms, the majority of AEs were associated with the skin, with the most frequently reported AEs:

- Dermatitis (54.7% on chlormethine gel, 57.5% on AP)
- Pruritus (20.3% on chlormethine gel, 16.5% on AP)
- Skin infections (11.7% on chlormethine gel, 11.0% on AP)

AP = chlormethine HC1 0.02% compounded in Aquaphor ointment, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, SoC = system organ class a： Post-hoc analysis with pooling and re-coding of preferred terms as described in Table 35.

b: Preferred terms with an incidence &lt; 2% were pooled under *Other preferred terms*.

SOCs with an incidence &lt; 2% were pooled under *Any other class*.

For Study 202, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were the most frequently reported AEs (53.1% [dermatitis 48.0%]). No cases of hypersensitivity were reported. 6.1% experienced at least one SAE, although none were considered to be related to study treatment. No deaths occurred in the study or within 30 days of stopping study treatment.

## Adverse events of special interest

## Skin cancers

Given the known mechanism of action of chlormethine, and specifically the alkylation of DNA, attention has been placed on whether treatment with topical chlormethine increases the risk for other forms of skin cancer, especially squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas. Vonderheid, in his review of the records of 331 patients, reported an estimated relative risk of 7.8 for squamous cell carcinoma and a risk of 1.8 for basal cell carcinoma  75 . Vonderheid included patients in his analysis who received concurrent skin-damaging or immunosuppressive therapies and did not evaluate a chlormethine monotherapy group separately for risk of secondary cancer development. Exposure to ultraviolet light or radiation therapy can increase risk of developing

skin cancer. In the Stanford series 76   where topical chlormethine was applied as monotherapy, non-melanoma skin cancers occurred in 8 of 203 patients; however, 6 of these 8 patients had received subsequent therapies such as psoralen UVA (PUVA) or total skin electron beam therapy prior to secondary skin cancer detection. In the 2 patients who developed skin cancer with chlormethine monotherapy, the skin cancer occurred in sites of actinic damage (face) that were not exposed to chlormethine application. The author concluded that the potential for secondary skin cancer development is increased in patients who have used multiple sequential topical skin-damaging therapies and chlormethine, but not in patients who have used chlormethine as monotherapy 76  . Similar findings were reported in an earlier publication 77 .

Secondary non-melanoma skin cancers have been reported in the  76 literature as a potential toxicity associated with chlormethine and other skin-directed therapies such as PUVA and electron beam radiation.  10 patients (3 on the gel; 7 on the AP arm) developed non-melanoma skin cancers during the study or during the 12 month follow-up period. The majority of skin cancers occurred in untreated areas.

- Squamous cell carcinoma: 5 patients (updated)
- o 2 on the gel arm (1 in an untreated area) and 3 on the AP arm (2 in an untreated area)
- o 1 AP patient, there was no MF lesion on the dorsal hand, but it could not be confirmed that the drug did not get on the dorsal hand during application
- o 1 PG patient developed a SCC in a treated area on her right upper back during the follow-up period (previous history of BCC, SCC, breast cancer and prior MF therapies included UVB and targretin)
- Basal cell carcinoma: 6 patients (updated)
- o 2 on the gel arm patients and 4 on the AP arm

a: A serious adverse event was submitted for Patient 002-0042 (PG) due to hospitalization for an appendectomy. His Were monitored, and on 28 May he was diaguosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MDS was considered by the investigator not to be related to Chlommethine Gel, but was secondary to extensive exposuue to systemic alkylating agent and other fonms of chemotherapy received for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the 1980s and 1990s.

## Deaths

## Study 201:

There was one death reported during the study, and none during the 12-month follow-up period. One patient was diagnosed with widely disseminated metastatic cancer less than 2 months after the initiation of treatment with chlormethine gel and died on Day 84 of the study.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The MRI revealed widely disseminated carcinoma (biopsy results favoured colon primary). The disseminated metastatic cancer could have been present at baseline and thus, was deemed not related to study treatment.

## Study 202:

There were no deaths during the study or within 30 days of stopping study treatment. One patient died due to metastatic lung cancer 6 months after premature discontinuation of study treatment due to lung cancer. The metastatic lung cancer was considered by the investigator as unrelated to study treatment.

## Laboratory findings

There are no reports of laboratory abnormalities associated with topical chlormethine use in the published literature.  Clinical laboratory safety data were monitored throughout the two studies and no trend toward abnormal values were noted.

## Safety in special populations

## Elderly patients

In Study 201, 79 patients (31%) were ≥ 65 years of age. There was a higher frequency of AEs in elderly patients and higher proportions of elderly patients discontinued due to an AE. However, overall, drug related safety observations in the ≥ 65 years of age are consistent with the whole population.

## Paediatric patients

Only one 11 year old patient was enrolled in the pivotal trial and completed 10 months of therapy (AP arm). The patient was withdrawn for non-compliance.

## Race

No impact of race can be concluded from the presented studies.

## Pregnancy and lactation

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The applicant did not submit data on use in pregnancy and lactation. Study protocols for studies 201 and 202 excluded pregnant or nursing women, and all men and women of childbearing potential had to agree to use an effective method of contraception. However, the female partner of one of the male patients became pregnant approximately 1-2 months after the initiation of treatment with AP. It was reported that the outcome of the pregnancy was a healthy, full-term infant. No other reports of pregnancy in patients treated with topical chlormethine were identified in the published literature.

## Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

The applicant did not submit studies on drug-drug interactions.

## Discontinuation due to adverse events

## AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment in study 201

AEs leading to discontinuation of chlormethine are well described in the published literature. More dose modifications triggered by TLTs (reduced frequency/ temporary suspensions) occurred in patients who received the gel formulation. A similar number of patients discontinued study treatment due to an AE in both treatment groups. The most frequently reported AEs were associated with skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

## AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment in Study 202

The most frequent reason for early withdrawal from the study was lack of efficacy, which was reported for 3 (3.1%) patients. Two (2.0%) patients each withdrew for TLT and other AEs. Of the 98 patients who were treated in Study 202, 40 had previously received treatment with chlormethine gel, and 58 had previously received treatment with the AP formulation in Study 201. Most premature withdrawals from the study in Study 202 (10/13) were for patients who had previously received the AP formulation in Study 201.

Five (5.1%) patients prematurely discontinued study treatment due to AEs: 2 patients who had previously received chlormethine gel and 3 patients who had previously received AP. Of these, 4 patients discontinued due to AEs of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (one patient who had previously received chlormethine gel and 3 patients who had previously received AP), and one patient discontinued due to SAEs (hip fracture and metastatic lung cancer).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Of the 4 patients who withdrew due to skin-related AEs, 2 patients experienced treatment-limiting skin toxicity requiring discontinuation from the study, as defined in the protocol, and 2 patients were discontinued due to skin AEs: one due to pruritus and one due to erythema.

AE = adverse event, AP= chlommethine HC1 0.02%6 compouwde in Aquaphorointmeut, SoC = system organ class a: Patients are categorized *Discontinued' if the cowse of action following an AE includes Study Discontinuation.

## AEs leading to dose modification

Few patients required dosing modifications: 8 (8.2%) patients required a temporary reduction in dosing frequency, and 5 (5.1%) patients required a temporary suspension of dosing. Dose modifications were triggered by TLTs.

## 2.4.8. Post marketing experience

The published experience demonstrates that the vast majority of AEs observed are related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Chlormethine 0.02% gel was approved as Valchlor in the US in August 2013. 4 quarterly Periodic Adverse Drug Experience Reports for Valchlor have been submitted to the FDA, covering the review period from 23 August 2013 to 22 August 2014. A total of 784 patients have been treated with Valchlor since approval to the 22 August 2014, and 243 reports were received including 241 cases from 222 treated patients. The remaining 2 cases were reports from care givers who experienced adverse reactions through secondary exposure (one who experienced itching after smelling the medication whilst applying the gel to the patient and the other who noticed a neck rash in the morning after her partner applied the chlormethine gel at bedtime, the night before).

The most commonly reported AEs were:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (266 events, 45.5%)
- o Pruritus (49, 8.4%)
- o Erythema (37, 6.3%)
- o Rash (20, 3.4%)
- o Blister (18, 3.1%)
- o Skin irritation (17, 2.9%)
- o Burning sensation (13, 2.2%)
- General disorders and administration site conditions (119 events, 20.3%)
- Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (56 events, 9.6%)

## 2.4.9. Discussion on clinical safety aspects

The safety evaluation is based on two sponsored studies (Study 2005NMMF-201-US (Study 201) and Study 2007NMMF-202-US (Study 202)) and post-marketing data reported for Valchlor (mechlorethamine) which is marketed in the US.

The safety database included 255 patients; approximately 65% of patients were treated for more than 48 weeks in both treatment arms.  Overall, the mean duration of exposure is 39.3 weeks in the chlormethine gel arm compared to 41.5 weeks in the AP arm. The median exposure time is 51.7 weeks vs. 51.9 weeks in chlormethine gel arm and AP arm, respectively. Taking into consideration the known safety and tolerability of the active substance, the safety database provides an acceptable number of exposed patients as well as exposure time to the product.

Given the lack of evidence for systemic exposure to chlormethine after topical use, non-skin related AEs such as nausea, sinusitis, back pain, dyspnoea and pneumonia were not considered to be ADRs. The following reactions have been assessed as ADRs and have been included in section 4.8 of the Ledaga SmPC: dermatitis, pruritus, skin infections, skin ulceration and blistering, skin hyperpigmentation and hypersensitivity.

The most common AEs are within the SOC 'Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders'. Dermatitis is the most commonly observed AE and was reported for 70 (54.7%) patients in the chlormethine gel arm vs. 73 in the AP arm (57.5%), with a higher incidence of moderate-moderately severe intensity in the chlormethine gel arm. The second most common AE is pruritus 20.3% vs. 16.5% in chlormethine gel arm and AP arm, respectively. These AEs are all well-known and manageable in the clinical setting. Hypersensitivity was observed in 2% (5 patients, 3 with chlormethine and 2 with AP) of patients in the study 201. Thus, local skin reactions and hypersensitivity have been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC and in the RMP as important identified risks. In addition, based on the non-clinical toxicity data and the causality of the skin-related-ADRs and severity of the AEs, contact with mucous membranes, especially those of the eyes, must be avoided. Exposure of mucous membranes such as the oral mucosa or nasal mucosa causes pain, redness, and ulceration, and these may be severe. Exposure of the eyes to chlormethine causes pain, burns, inflammation, photophobia, and blurred vision. Blindness and severe irreversible anterior eye injury may occur (section 4.4 of the SmPC). Toxicity to mucous membranes/eyes has been included as an important identified risk.

Five (3.9%) patients experienced 9 Grade 4 AEs in the chlormethine gel arm vs. 9 (7.1%) patients with 10 Grade 4 AEs in the AP arm. Most of the Grade 4 AEs were observed in the SOC 'Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders'. Three malignant neoplasms (1 basal cell carcinoma, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, and 1 basal cell and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

squamous cell carcinoma) were observed in the chlormethine gel arm compared to 7 in the AP arm (3 basal cell carcinoma, 2 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 merkel cell carcinoma and 1 basal cell/squamous cell carcinoma). However, none of the AEs were judged related to chlormethine treatment.  Development of secondary skin cancers is a known risk of skin targeted therapies in the treatment MF-type CTCL. Thus, patients treated with topical chlormethine should be monitored for skin cancers, as described in section 4.4 of the proposed SmPC and skin cancers is included in the RMP as important potential risks. The ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC are consistent with the approved SmPC of Caryolysine (chlormethine).

As chlormethine is to be applied at home by the patient or the caregiver, there is the risk to secondary exposure to someone other than the patient, a risk which has been included in the RMP as an important potential risk. The PRAC and CHMP considered that given the risk of secondary exposure as well the severity of the toxicity to mucous membranes, educational material in the form of a patient and caregiver card (included in each box of Ledaga) was necessary in order to educate patients on all steps to be followed when applying Ledaga, to inform patients what to do in case of secondary exposure and to inform patients on the use of the transparent sealable plastic bag.

In general, there are comparable number of AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation in the two treatment arms, with only small percentage differences, however it must be noted that the numbers are small.

There are more dose modifications in the chlormethine gel, mainly due to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. The guidance on dose modification in section 4.2 of the SmPC is considered adequate.

No laboratory abnormalities have been noted. This is consistent with the observation that there is no documented systemic exposure following topical administration of chlormethine gel.

There are limited data on the use of chlormethine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity after systemic administration (see section 5.3 of the SmPC and non-clinical discussion). Ledaga is not recommended during pregnancy (section 4.6 of the SmPC). It is unknown whether chlormethine is excreted in human milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded due to the potential for topical or systemic exposure of the suckling infant to chlormethine through contact with the mother's skin. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Ledaga therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the breast feeding mother (section 4.6 of the SmPC). The use of Ledaga during pregnancy and lactation has been added as an important potential risk.

The safety and efficacy of Ledaga in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data are available (section 4.2 of the SmPC). Therefore, the use of chlormethine in paediatric patients has been included as missing information.

## 2.4.10. Conclusions on clinical safety aspects

The safety of Ledaga has been adequately characterised. The ADRs observed in the clinical trials are broadly consistent with those in the SmPC for the reference medicinal product, Caryolysine and the published literature. Post-marketing events reported to date have not identified any new risks or signals and no regulatory actions have been taken for safety reasons.

## 3. Benefit-risk balance

This application concerns a hybrid version of chlormethine for a new pharmaceutical form (gel for cutaneous use) with reference to Caryolysine (a solution for injection and cutaneous use). The indication for the product Ledaga is for the topical treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF type CTCL) in adult patients the same as for the reference medicinal product Caryolysine. Typical bioequivalence studies in plasma cannot be conducted for topical products that are not absorbed, and in any case plasma would not be a relevant compartment. This is consistent with the guidance from the guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). A review of the published literature was provided for this application and considered sufficient to cover the non-clinical aspects as well as to support the clinical aspects (efficacy and safety). In addition, this application relies also on the results from a clinical trial and a follow up study comparing the commercial formulation chlormethine gel against an adequate chlormethine comparator were submitted to provide further pharmacological data (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics) as well as confirm the efficacy and safety data of the product. These data demonstrate the efficacy and safety chlormethine gel, and based on indirect comparison, the efficacy and safety of the gel formulation are in line with what has been observed with the reference medicinal product in term of all important clinical endpoints.

The safety and tolerability of topical chlormethine are well known and no new concerns have been raised from the reported AEs in the safety database from the studies 201 and 202. The ADRs observed are considered well tolerated and manageable following the recommendations in the SmPC, routine PhV and implementation of additional risk minimisation activities. The PRAC and CHMP considered that educational material for patients and caregivers was necessary to ensure the safe use of the product.

Taking into account the overall evidence in terms of efficacy and safety, the data are considered robust and adequate to establish the efficacy and safety of Ledaga.

Therefore, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks and concluded that a positive benefit-risk balance has been established for Ledaga in the topical treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF-type CTCL) in adult patients.

## 4. Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Ledaga is favourable in the following indication:

Ledaga is indicated for the topical treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF type CTCL) in adult patients (see section 5.1).

The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

## Additional risk minimisation measures

In order to minimise and prevent the Important Identified Risk of 'Toxicity to mucous membranes / eye ' and the Important Potential Risk of 'Secondary exposure to someone other than the patient', the MAH shall ensure that in each MS where Ledaga is marketed, following additional risk minimisation measures are fulfilled:

- Ledaga should be supplied with a transparent, sealable, child-resistant plastic bag to prevent secondary exposure and contamination when Ledaga is stored in the refrigerator:
- o Instruction on how to accurately use, open and dispose a plastic bag should be printed on the plastic bag. The MAH must agree about the content and format of the text prior to launch of Ledaga in each MS with the National Competent Authority (NCA).
- o The plastic bag should not be used for any other purposes and must be disposed after 60 days together with unused refrigerated Ledaga and any waste material, including nitrile gloves in accordance with local requirements.
- A patient alert card, sized to be included in Ledaga outer packaging, together with the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) is provided to all patients and caregivers who are expected to administer and use Ledaga.
