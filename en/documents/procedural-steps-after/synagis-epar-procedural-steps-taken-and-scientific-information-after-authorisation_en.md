2  A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The

CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

No significant elevations of anti-palivizumab antibody titer were observed in these 14 participants. Transient, low levels of anti palivizumab antibody were observed in one child after the second dose of palivizumab that dropped to undetectable levels at the fifth and seventh dose.' Additionally, the following new text was included in section 5.2: 'In the open label prospective trial evaluating pharmacokinetics with administration of 6 monthly intramuscular doses of 15 mg/kg of palivizumab, mean 30 day trough serum concentrations were approximately 40  g/ml after the first dose, 120  g/ml after the fourth dose, and 140  g/ml after the sixth dose.' The following sentence was added to Section 4.8: 'In a small open label prospective trial of 14 subjects, who received 6 doses, the adverse events reported were consistent with the known safety profile of palivizumab.'

| II/0093 | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with additional information on in vitro antiviral activity and resistance. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 24/10/2013 | 04/12/2013 | SmPC        | The antiviral activity of palivizumab was assessed in a microneutralization assay in which increasing concentrations of antibody were incubated with RSV prior to addition of the human epithelial cells HEp-2. Palivizumab exhibited median EC50 values of 0.65  g/ml and 0.28  g/ml against clinical RSV A and RSV B isolates, respectively. In a genotypic analysis of 126 clinical isolates from 123 children who failed immunoprophylaxis, all RSV mutants that exhibited resistance to palivizumab (n=8) were shown to contain amino acid changes in this region of the F protein. At least one of the palivizumab resistance- associated substitutions, N262D, K272E/Q, or S275F/L was identified in these 8 clinical RSV isolates, resulting in a combined resistance-associated mutation frequency of 6.3% in these patients. Analysis of 254 clinical RSV isolates collected from immunoprophylaxis-naïve subjects revealed palivizumab resistance-associated substitutions in 2 (1 with N262D and 1 with S275F), resulting in a resistance associated mutation frequency of 0.79%. |

It should be highlighted that in the palivizumab pivotal clinical studies, the positive efficacy of Synagis was shown among children who received the full dose of 15 mg/kg monthly throughout the RSV season. This information has been added to the posology section of the Summary of product Characteristics. The benefit/risk profile for Synagis for the prophylaxis of serious RSV infection requiring hospitalization remains favourable for young children at high risk for serious RSV infection. |

| II/0077   | Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to reflect a risk of false-negative results in diagnostic tests for RSV in palivizumab-treated patients. The MAH has also updated the section on human anti-human antibody responses in section 4.8 based on a review of the available immunogenicity data. Furthermore, Annex II was brought in line with the latest QRD template version 8.3. C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre- clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data | 21/02/2013   | 04/12/2013 | SmPC and Annex II | A comparison of 19 commercially available diagnostic tests for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) demonstrated that palivizumab can interfere with certain assays, which could lead to false-negative results. Information on the types of tests affected or not affected was therefore added to section 4.5. Due to its limited relevance for the disease diagnostics and clinical management of patients, no further actions were deemed necessary. In addition, the immunogenicity data from five large multicentre clinical trials were reviewed and it was concluded that the anti-palivizumab antibody response is infrequent, transient and of low titre, and that no clinical safety effect seems to be associated with the presence of anti-palivizumab antibodies. These observations are in line with the information present in the SmPC section 4.8; however the wording was updated to reflect all currently available data. |

The MAH performed the search from 3 perspectives: published literature, clinical reports (including the development program and Phase 4 studies), and spontaneous post-marketing reports. On the basis of this analysis, information related to anaphylactic shock and the rare potential for fatal outcome has been added to the product information. |

| II/0064   | Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information with the results of study M03- 681 conducted in paediatric patients. This submission is done in fulfilment of FU2 17.6. In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the representatives of Bulgaria and Romania. C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the MAH | 17/11/2011 | 19/12/2011 | SmPC and PL     | An extension of the indication for palivizumab in children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (HSCHD) was granted based on study MI-CP048 (EMEA/H/C/257/II/13). At the time of approval, the MAH committed to perform a post marketing study (M03-681) to further assess the rates of serious infection, serious arrhythmia, and death associated with palivizumab prophylaxis in children with HSCHD. The final study report for study M03-681 was evaluated by the CHMP as part of FU2 17.6. The CHMP concluded that the results of this study indicate no increased risk of serious infections, serious arrhythmias, or death associated with palivizumab compared with matched untreated controls in young children with HSCHD. The benefit/risk profile for palivizumab for the prophylaxis of serious RSV infection requiring hospitalization remains favourable for young children with HSCHD. As requested by the CHMP, the MAH updated section 5.1 of the SmPC with information on this paediatric study. |

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet   |            |     | non-febrile convulsions with no apparent alternative etiology for the event. These reports include reports from both premature infants and those with CHD. In 13 of these reports, the convulsion occurred within 24 hours of the palivizumab dose, and in 4 of these 13 reports, there was a positive rechallenge. There were 16 reports of convulsions associated with fever. In 8 reports, a cause for the fever was listed or could be deduced from the narrative. In the other 8 reports, there was no cause for the fever apart from the palivizumab therapy. The reports with no apparent alternate etiology described patients who may have had concurrent immunizations, or intercurrent illnesses, but none of these factors were reported. Although a causal relationship between palivizumab therapy and convulsions cannot be proven, there appears to be a temporal relationship between the two. Based on the analysis of these reports, section 4.8 of the SPC is updated to include thrombocytopenia and convulsions as potential undesirable effects of palivizumab. An additional correction was made to the Post-marketing section of the Synagis SPC regarding events of apnoea, anaphylaxis, and urticaria. Section 4.9 of the SPC has been further enhanced with a   |

| II/0033   | Correction of the position of the frequency of two adverse drug reactions in section 4.8 of the SPC. Update of Summary of Product Characteristics | 28/06/2006   | 25/07/2006   | SmPC | Section 4.8 of the SPC has been corrected with regard to the frequency of two adverse events: the correct frequency of \"common\" for \"injection site reaction\" and \"fever\" has been amended. Namely, Table 1 \"Undesirable Effects in Prophylactic Clinical Studies with Premature and Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Paediatric Populations\" and Table 2 \"Undesirable Effects in the Prophylactic Paediatric Congenital Heart Disease Clinical Study\" in section 4.8 of the SPC have been amended to represent the adverse event of injection site reaction and fever in the correct frequency of \"common\", respectively. As the Package Leaflet reflects the correct frequency of \"common\" for injection site reaction and fever, no changes have been proposed to the PL as a result of this variation. |
