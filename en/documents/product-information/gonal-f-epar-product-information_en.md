## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## In adult women

- Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
- Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer.
- GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.

## In adult men

- GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) therapy.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders.

## Posology

Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring procedures should be individualised to optimise follicular development and to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome)

GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.

In the registration trials, a commonly used regimen commenced at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and was increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7- or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.

In clinical practice, the starting dose is typically individualised based on the patient's clinical characteristics, such as markers of ovarian reserve, age, body mass index, and, if applicable, previous ovarian response to ovarian stimulation.

## Starting dose

The starting dose can be adjusted in a stepwise manner (a) lower than 75 IU per day if an excessive ovarian response in terms of number of follicles is anticipated based on the patient's clinical profile (age, body mass index, ovarian reserve); or (b) higher than 75 up to a maximum of 150 IU per day may be considered if a low ovarian response is anticipated.

The patient's response should be closely monitored by measuring follicle size and number by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion.

## Dose adjustments

If a patient fails to respond adequately (either low or excessive ovarian response), continuation of that treatment cycle should be evaluated and managed according to the physician's standard of care. In cases of low response, the daily dose should not exceed 225 IU FSH.

If an excessive ovarian response is obtained according to the physician's assessment, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle.

## Final follicular maturation

When an optimal ovarian response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed.

## Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies

In the registration trials, a commonly used regimen for superovulation involved the administration of 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.

In clinical practice, the starting dose is typically individualised based on the patient's clinical characteristics, such as markers of ovarian reserve, age, body mass index, and, if applicable, previous ovarian response to ovarian stimulation.

## Starting dose

If a low ovarian response is anticipated, the starting dose may be adjusted in a stepwise manner to not higher than 450 IU daily. Conversely, if an excessive ovarian response is expected, the starting dose may be decreased below 150 IU.

The patient's response should continue to be closely monitored by measuring follicle size and number by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion until adequate follicular development has been achieved. GONAL-f can be given either alone, or, to prevent premature luteinisation, in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Dose adjustments

If a patient fails to respond adequately (either low or excessive ovarian response), continuation of that treatment cycle should be evaluated and managed according to the physician's standard of care. In cases of low response, the daily dose should not exceed 450 IU FSH.

## Final follicular maturation

When an optimal ovarian response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.

## Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency

In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.

A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response.

If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.

When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on the physician's judgment of the clinical case.

Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.

If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4).

## Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism

GONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.

## Special populations

## Elderly

There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of GONAL-f in elderly patients have not been established.

## Renal or hepatic impairment

Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established.

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Method of administration

GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day.

The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Selfadministration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice.

The injection site should be alternated daily.

For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product see section 6.6 and the package leaflet.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1
- tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland
- ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst unrelated to polycystic ovarian disease and of unknown origin
- gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown origin
- ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma

GONAL-f must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:

- primary ovarian failure
- malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy
- fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
- primary testicular insufficiency

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## General recommendations

GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.

## Porphyria

Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Treatment in women

Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given.

Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.

In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments.

No direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG.

## Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)

A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment.

In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.

The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction.

Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles.

Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors.

There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.

Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started.

## Multiple pregnancy

In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.

In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.

The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.

## Pregnancy loss

The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception.

## Ectopic pregnancy

Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population.

## Reproductive system neoplasms

There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women.

## Congenital malformation

The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.

## Thromboembolic events

In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events.

## Treatment in men

Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained.

Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Sodium content

GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of follitropin alfa.

No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of GONAL-f.

## Breast-feeding

GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

GONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

GONAL-f has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection).

Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4).

Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.9 Overdose

The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS may occur (see section 4.4).

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, ATC code: G03GA05.

## Mechanism of action

Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle development, steroidogenesis and maturation.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days from the start of r-hFSH administration.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in women

In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level &lt; 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.

In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and in ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation.

In ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Table: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of GONAL-f with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies)

|                                                           | GONAL-f (n = 130)   | urinary FSH (n = 116)   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Number of oocytes retrieved                               | 11.0 ± 5.9          | 8.8 ± 4.8               |
| Days of FSH stimulation required                          | 11.7 ± 1.9          | 14.5 ± 3.3              |
| Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) | 27.6 ± 10.2         | 40.7 ± 13.6             |
| Need to increase the dose (%)                             | 56.2                | 85.3                    |

Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p&lt; 0.05) for all criteria listed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Clinical efficacy and safety in men

In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered simultaneously.

## Distribution

Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L.

Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days.

## Elimination

Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC.

Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.

Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

## Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome)

GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.

In the registration trials, a commonly used regimen commenced at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and was increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7- or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.

In clinical practice, the starting dose is typically individualised based on the patient's clinical characteristics, such as markers of ovarian reserve, age, body mass index, and, if applicable, previous ovarian response to ovarian stimulation.

## Starting dose

The starting dose can be adjusted in a stepwise manner (a) lower than 75 IU per day if an excessive ovarian response in terms of number of follicles is anticipated based on the patient's clinical profile (age, body mass index, ovarian reserve); or (b) higher than 75 up to a maximum of 150 IU per day may be considered if a low ovarian response is anticipated.

The patient's response should be closely monitored by measuring follicle size and number by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion.

## Dose adjustments

If a patient fails to respond adequately (either low or excessive ovarian response), continuation of that treatment cycle should be evaluated and managed according to the physician's standard of care. In cases of low response, the daily dose should not exceed 225 IU FSH.

If an excessive ovarian response is obtained according to the physician's assessment, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle.

## Final follicular maturation

When an optimal ovarian response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies

In the registration trials, a commonly used regimen for superovulation involved the administration of 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.

In clinical practice, the starting dose is typically individualised based on the patient's clinical characteristics, such as markers of ovarian reserve, age, body mass index, and, if applicable, previous ovarian response to ovarian stimulation.

## Starting dose

If a low ovarian response is anticipated, the starting dose may be adjusted in a stepwise manner to not higher than 450 IU daily. Conversely, if an excessive ovarian response is expected, the starting dose may be decreased below 150 IU.

The patient's response should continue to be closely monitored by measuring follicle size and number by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion until adequate follicular development has been achieved. GONAL-f can be given either alone, or, to prevent premature luteinisation, in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist.

## Dose adjustments

If a patient fails to respond adequately (either low or excessive ovarian response), continuation of that treatment cycle should be evaluated and managed according to the physician's standard of care. In cases of low response, the daily dose should not exceed 450 IU FSH.

## Final follicular maturation

When an optimal ovarian response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.

## Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency

In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.

A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response.

If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.

When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on the physician's judgment of the clinical case.

Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.

If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism

GONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.

## Special populations

## Elderly

There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of GONAL-f in elderly patients have not been established.

## Renal or hepatic impairment

Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established.

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population.

## Method of administration

GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day.

The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Selfadministration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice.

As GONAL-f multidose is intended for several injections, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation.

Due to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol, the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive days.

Individual reconstituted vials should be for single patient use only.

For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product see section 6.6 and the package leaflet.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1
- tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland
- ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst unrelated to polycystic ovarian disease and of unknown origin
- gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown origin
- ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma

GONAL-f must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:

- primary ovarian failure
- malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy
- fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
- primary testicular insufficiency

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Traceability

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## General recommendations

GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.

## Porphyria

Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.

## Treatment in women

Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given.

Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.

In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments.

No direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG.

## Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)

A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment.

In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.

The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction.

Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles.

Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors.

There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.

In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.

Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started.

## Multiple pregnancy

In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.

In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.

The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.

## Pregnancy loss

The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception.

## Ectopic pregnancy

Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population.

## Reproductive system neoplasms

There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Congenital malformation

The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.

## Thromboembolic events

In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events.

## Treatment in men

Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained.

Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response.

## Sodium content

GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Solvent containing benzyl alcohol

Following reconstitution with the solvent provided, this medicinal product contains 1.23 mg benzyl alcohol in each 75 IU dose, which is equivalent to 9.45 mg/mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.

## Latex sensitivity

The needle shield of the pre-filled syringe containing the solvent for reconstitution contains latex (natural dry rubber), which may cause severe allergic reactions.

A presentation (GONAL-f 75 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection) without benzyl alcohol and latex is available in case of hypersensitivity to these excipients.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of follitropin alfa.

No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of GONAL-f.

## Breast-feeding

GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

GONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

GONAL-f has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection).

Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4).

Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

## 4.9 Overdose

The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS may occur (see section 4.4).

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, ATC code: G03GA05.

## Mechanism of action

Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle development, steroidogenesis and maturation.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days from the start of r-hFSH administration.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in women

In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level &lt; 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.

In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and in ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation.

In ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Table: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of GONAL-f with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies)

|                                                           | GONAL-f (n = 130)   | urinary FSH (n = 116)   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Number of oocytes retrieved                               | 11.0 ± 5.9          | 8.8 ± 4.8               |
| Days of FSH stimulation required                          | 11.7 ± 1.9          | 14.5 ± 3.3              |
| Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) | 27.6 ± 10.2         | 40.7 ± 13.6             |
| Need to increase the dose (%)                             | 56.2                | 85.3                    |

Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p&lt; 0.05) for all criteria listed.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in men

In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered simultaneously.

## Distribution

Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L.

Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elimination

Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC.

In rabbits, the formulation reconstituted with 0.9% benzyl alcohol and 0.9% benzyl alcohol alone, both resulted in a slight haemorrhage and subacute inflammation after single subcutaneous injection or mild inflammatory and degenerative changes after single intramuscular injection respectively.

Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.

Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Posology

Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring procedures should be individualised to optimise follicular development and to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.

Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of GONAL-f.

The following table states the volume to be administered to deliver the prescribed dose:

|   Dose (IU) |   Volume to be injected (mL) |

## Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome)

GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.

In the registration trials, a commonly used regimen commenced at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and was increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7- or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.

In clinical practice, the starting dose is typically individualised based on the patient's clinical characteristics, such as markers of ovarian reserve, age, body mass index, and, if applicable, previous ovarian response to ovarian stimulation.

## Starting dose

The starting dose can be adjusted in a stepwise manner (a) lower than 75 IU per day if an excessive ovarian response in terms of number of follicles is anticipated based on the patient's clinical profile (age, body mass index, ovarian reserve); or (b) higher than 75 up to a maximum of 150 IU per day may be considered if a low ovarian response is anticipated.

The patient's response should be closely monitored by measuring follicle size and number by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion.

## Dose adjustments

If a patient fails to respond adequately (either low or excessive ovarian response), continuation of that treatment cycle should be evaluated and managed according to the physician's standard of care. In cases of low response, the daily dose should not exceed 225 IU FSH.

If an excessive ovarian response is obtained according to the physician's assessment, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle.

## Final follicular maturation

When an optimal ovarian response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies

In the registration trials, a commonly used regimen for superovulation involved the administration of 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.

In clinical practice, the starting dose is typically individualised based on the patient's clinical characteristics, such as markers of ovarian reserve, age, body mass index, and, if applicable, previous ovarian response to ovarian stimulation.

## Starting dose

If a low ovarian response is anticipated, the starting dose may be adjusted in a stepwise manner to not higher than 450 IU daily. Conversely, if an excessive ovarian response is expected, the starting dose may be decreased below 150 IU.

The patient's response should continue to be closely monitored by measuring follicle size and number by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion until adequate follicular development has been achieved. GONAL-f can be given either alone, or, to prevent premature luteinisation, in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist.

## Dose adjustments

If a patient fails to respond adequately (either low or excessive ovarian response), continuation of that treatment cycle should be evaluated and managed according to the physician's standard of care. In cases of low response, the daily dose should not exceed 450 IU FSH.

## Final follicular maturation

When an optimal ovarian response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.

## Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency

In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.

A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response.

If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.

When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on the physician's judgment of the clinical case.

Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.

If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism

GONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.

## Special populations

## Elderly

There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of GONAL-f in elderly patients have not been established.

## Renal or hepatic impairment

Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established.

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population.

## Method of administration

GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day.

The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Selfadministration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice.

As GONAL-f multidose is intended for several injections, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation.

Due to a local reactivity to benzyl alcohol, the same site of injection should not be used on consecutive days.

Individual reconstituted vials should be for single patient use only.

For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product see section 6.6 and the package leaflet.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1
- tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland
- ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst unrelated to polycystic ovarian disease and of unknown origin
- gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown origin
- ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma

GONAL-f must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:

- primary ovarian failure
- malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy
- fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
- primary testicular insufficiency

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

Traceability

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## General recommendations

GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.

## Porphyria

Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.

## Treatment in women

Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given.

Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.

In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments.

No direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG.

## Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)

A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment.

In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.

The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction.

Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles.

Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors.

There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.

In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.

Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started.

## Multiple pregnancy

In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.

In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.

The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.

## Pregnancy loss

The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception.

## Ectopic pregnancy

Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population.

## Reproductive system neoplasms

There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Congenital malformation

The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.

## Thromboembolic events

In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events.

## Treatment in men

Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained.

Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response.

## Sodium content

GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

## Solvent containing benzyl alcohol

Following reconstitution with the solvent provided, this medicinal product contains 1.23 mg benzyl alcohol in each 75 IU dose, which is equivalent to 9.45 mg/mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.

## Latex sensitivity

The needle shield of the pre-filled syringe containing the solvent for reconstitution contains latex (natural dry rubber), which may cause severe allergic reactions.

A presentation (GONAL-f 75 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection) without benzyl alcohol and latex is available in case of hypersensitivity to these excipients.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of follitropin alfa.

No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of GONAL-f.

## Breast-feeding

GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding.

Fertility

GONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

GONAL-f has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection).

Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4).

Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

## 4.9 Overdose

The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS may occur (see section 4.4).

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, ATC code: G03GA05.

## Mechanism of action

Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle development, steroidogenesis and maturation.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days from the start of r-hFSH administration.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in women

In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level &lt; 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.

In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and in ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation.

In ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Table: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of GONAL-f with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies)

|                                                           | GONAL-f (n = 130)   | urinary FSH (n = 116)   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Number of oocytes retrieved                               | 11.0 ± 5.9          | 8.8 ± 4.8               |
| Days of FSH stimulation required                          | 11.7 ± 1.9          | 14.5 ± 3.3              |
| Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) | 27.6 ± 10.2         | 40.7 ± 13.6             |
| Need to increase the dose (%)                             | 56.2                | 85.3                    |

Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p&lt; 0.05) for all criteria listed.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in men

In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered simultaneously.

## Distribution

Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L.

Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Elimination

Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC.

In rabbits, the formulation reconstituted with 0.9% benzyl alcohol and 0.9% benzyl alcohol alone, both resulted in a slight haemorrhage and subacute inflammation after single subcutaneous injection or mild inflammatory and degenerative changes after single intramuscular injection respectively.

Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.

Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## In adult women

- Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
- Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer.
- GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.

## In adult men

- GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) therapy.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders.

Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques.

## Posology

Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring procedures should be individualised to optimise follicular development and to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.

Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of GONAL-f.

## Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome)

GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.

In the registration trials, a commonly used regimen commenced at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and was increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7- or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.

In clinical practice, the starting dose is typically individualised based on the patient's clinical characteristics, such as markers of ovarian reserve, age, body mass index, and, if applicable, previous ovarian response to ovarian stimulation.

## Starting dose

The starting dose can be adjusted in a stepwise manner (a) lower than 75 IU per day if an excessive ovarian response in terms of number of follicles is anticipated based on the patient's clinical profile (age, body mass index, ovarian reserve); or (b) higher than 75 up to a maximum of 150 IU per day may be considered if a low ovarian response is anticipated.

The patient's response should be closely monitored by measuring follicle size and number by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion.

## Dose adjustments

If a patient fails to respond adequately (either low or excessive ovarian response), continuation of that treatment cycle should be evaluated and managed according to the physician's standard of care. In cases of low response, the daily dose should not exceed 225 IU FSH.

If an excessive ovarian response is obtained according to the physician's assessment, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle.

## Final follicular maturation

When an optimal ovarian response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed.

## Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies

In the registration trials, a commonly used regimen for superovulation involved the administration of 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.

In clinical practice, the starting dose is typically individualised based on the patient's clinical characteristics, such as markers of ovarian reserve, age, body mass index, and, if applicable, previous ovarian response to ovarian stimulation.

## Starting dose

If a low ovarian response is anticipated, the starting dose may be adjusted in a stepwise manner to not higher than 450 IU daily. Conversely, if an excessive ovarian response is expected, the starting dose may be decreased below 150 IU.

The patient's response should continue to be closely monitored by measuring follicle size and number by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion until adequate follicular development has been achieved.

GONAL-f can be given either alone, or, to prevent premature luteinisation, in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist.

## Dose adjustments

If a patient fails to respond adequately (either low or excessive ovarian response), continuation of that treatment cycle should be evaluated and managed according to the physician's standard of care. In cases of low response, the daily dose should not exceed 450 IU FSH.

## Final follicular maturation

When an optimal ovarian response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.

## Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency

In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.

A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response.

If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.

When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on the physician's judgment of the clinical case.

Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.

If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4).

## Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism

GONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.

## Special populations

## Elderly

There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of GONAL-f in elderly patients have not been established.

## Renal or hepatic impairment

Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population.

## Method of administration

GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day.

The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Selfadministration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice.

As GONAL-f pre-filled pen with multidose cartridge is intended for several injections, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation.

For instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the 'Instructions for use'.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1
- tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland
- ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst unrelated to polycystic ovarian disease and of unknown origin
- gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown origin
- ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma

GONAL-f must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:

- primary ovarian failure
- malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy
- fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
- primary testicular insufficiency

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## General recommendations

GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Porphyria

Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.

## Treatment in women

Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given.

Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.

In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments.

No direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG.

## Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)

A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment.

In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.

The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction.

Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles.

Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors.

There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hyperstimulation occur, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.

In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.

Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started.

## Multiple pregnancy

In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.

In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.

The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.

## Pregnancy loss

The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception.

## Ectopic pregnancy

Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population.

## Reproductive system neoplasms

There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women.

## Congenital malformation

The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.

## Thromboembolic events

In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events.

## Treatment in men

Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response.

## Sodium content

GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of follitropin alfa.

No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of GONAL-f.

## Breast-feeding

GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

GONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

GONAL-f has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection).

Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4).

Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

## 4.9 Overdose

The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS may occur (see section 4.4).

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, ATC code: G03GA05.

## Mechanism of action

Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle development, steroidogenesis and maturation.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days from the start of r-hFSH administration.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in women

In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level &lt; 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.

In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and in ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation.

In ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Table: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of GONAL-f with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies)

|                                                           | GONAL-f (n = 130)   | urinary FSH (n = 116)   |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p&lt; 0.05) for all criteria listed.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in men

In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered simultaneously.

## Distribution

Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L.

Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days.

## Elimination

Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC.

Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.

Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## In adult women

- Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
- Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer.
- GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.

## In adult men

- GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) therapy.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders.

Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques.

## Posology

Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring procedures should be individualised to optimise follicular development and to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.

Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of GONAL-f.

## Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome)

GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.

In the registration trials, a commonly used regimen commenced at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and was increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7- or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.

In clinical practice, the starting dose is typically individualised based on the patient's clinical characteristics, such as markers of ovarian reserve, age, body mass index, and, if applicable, previous ovarian response to ovarian stimulation.

## Starting dose

The starting dose can be adjusted in a stepwise manner (a) lower than 75 IU per day if an excessive ovarian response in terms of number of follicles is anticipated based on the patient's clinical profile (age, body mass index, ovarian reserve); or (b) higher than 75 up to a maximum of 150 IU per day may be considered if a low ovarian response is anticipated.

The patient's response should be closely monitored by measuring follicle size and number by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion.

## Dose adjustments

If a patient fails to respond adequately (either low or excessive ovarian response), continuation of that treatment cycle should be evaluated and managed according to the physician's standard of care. In cases of low response, the daily dose should not exceed 225 IU FSH.

If an excessive ovarian response is obtained according to the physician's assessment, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle.

## Final follicular maturation

When an optimal ovarian response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed.

## Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies

In the registration trials, a commonly used regimen for superovulation involved the administration of 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.

In clinical practice, the starting dose is typically individualised based on the patient's clinical characteristics, such as markers of ovarian reserve, age, body mass index, and, if applicable, previous ovarian response to ovarian stimulation.

## Starting dose

If a low ovarian response is anticipated, the starting dose may be adjusted in a stepwise manner to not higher than 450 IU daily. Conversely, if an excessive ovarian response is expected, the starting dose may be decreased below 150 IU.

The patient's response should continue to be closely monitored by measuring follicle size and number by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion until adequate follicular development has been achieved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

GONAL-f can be given either alone, or, to prevent premature luteinisation, in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist.

## Dose adjustments

If a patient fails to respond adequately (either low or excessive ovarian response), continuation of that treatment cycle should be evaluated and managed according to the physician's standard of care. In cases of low response, the daily dose should not exceed 450 IU FSH.

## Final follicular maturation

When an optimal ovarian response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.

## Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency

In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.

A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response.

If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.

When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on the physician's judgment of the clinical case.

Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.

If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4).

## Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism

GONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.

## Special populations

## Elderly

There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of GONAL-f in elderly patients have not been established.

## Renal or hepatic impairment

Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population.

## Method of administration

GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day.

The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Selfadministration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice.

As GONAL-f pre-filled pen with multidose cartridge is intended for several injections, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation.

For instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the 'Instructions for use'.

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## General recommendations

GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Porphyria

Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.

## Treatment in women

Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given.

Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.

In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments.

No direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG.

## Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)

A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment.

In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.

The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction.

Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles.

Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors.

There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hyperstimulation occur, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.

In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.

Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started.

## Multiple pregnancy

In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.

In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.

The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.

## Pregnancy loss

The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception.

## Ectopic pregnancy

Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population.

## Reproductive system neoplasms

There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women.

## Congenital malformation

The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.

## Thromboembolic events

In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events.

## Treatment in men

Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response.

## Sodium content

GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of follitropin alfa.

No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of GONAL-f.

## Breast-feeding

GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

GONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

GONAL-f has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection).

Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4).

Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS may occur (see section 4.4).

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, ATC code: G03GA05.

## Mechanism of action

Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle development, steroidogenesis and maturation.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days from the start of r-hFSH administration.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in women

In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level &lt; 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.

In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and in ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation.

In ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Table: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of GONAL-f with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies)

|                                                           | GONAL-f (n = 130)   | urinary FSH (n = 116)   |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p&lt; 0.05) for all criteria listed.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in men

In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered simultaneously.

## Distribution

Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L.

Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days.

## Elimination

Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC.

Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.

Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## In adult women

- Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
- Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer.
- GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.

## In adult men

- GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) therapy.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders.

Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques.

## Posology

Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring procedures should be individualised to optimise follicular development and to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.

Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of GONAL-f.

## Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome)

GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.

In the registration trials, a commonly used regimen commenced at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and was increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7- or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.

In clinical practice, the starting dose is typically individualised based on the patient's clinical characteristics, such as markers of ovarian reserve, age, body mass index, and, if applicable, previous ovarian response to ovarian stimulation.

## Starting dose

The starting dose can be adjusted in a stepwise manner (a) lower than 75 IU per day if an excessive ovarian response in terms of number of follicles is anticipated based on the patient's clinical profile (age, body mass index, ovarian reserve); or (b) higher than 75 up to a maximum of 150 IU per day may be considered if a low ovarian response is anticipated.

The patient's response should be closely monitored by measuring follicle size and number by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion.

## Dose adjustments

If a patient fails to respond adequately (either low or excessive ovarian response), continuation of that treatment cycle should be evaluated and managed according to the physician's standard of care. In cases of low response, the daily dose should not exceed 225 IU FSH.

If an excessive ovarian response is obtained according to the physician's assessment, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle.

## Final follicular maturation

When an optimal ovarian response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed.

## Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies

In the registration trials, a commonly used regimen for superovulation involved the administration of 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.

In clinical practice, the starting dose is typically individualised based on the patient's clinical characteristics, such as markers of ovarian reserve, age, body mass index, and, if applicable, previous ovarian response to ovarian stimulation.

## Starting dose

If a low ovarian response is anticipated, the starting dose may be adjusted in a stepwise manner to not higher than 450 IU daily. Conversely, if an excessive ovarian response is expected, the starting dose may be decreased below 150 IU.

The patient's response should continue to be closely monitored by measuring follicle size and number by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion until adequate follicular development has been achieved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

GONAL-f can be given either alone, or, to prevent premature luteinisation, in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist.

## Dose adjustments

If a patient fails to respond adequately (either low or excessive ovarian response), continuation of that treatment cycle should be evaluated and managed according to the physician's standard of care. In cases of low response, the daily dose should not exceed 450 IU FSH.

## Final follicular maturation

When an optimal ovarian response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.

## Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency

In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.

A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response.

If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.

When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on the physician's judgment of the clinical case.

Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.

If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4).

## Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism

GONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.

## Special populations

## Elderly

There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of GONAL-f in elderly patients have not been established.

## Renal or hepatic impairment

Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population.

## Method of administration

GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day.

The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Selfadministration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice.

As GONAL-f pre-filled pen with multidose cartridge is intended for several injections, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation.

For instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the 'Instructions for use'.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland
- ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst unrelated to polycystic ovarian disease and of unknown origin
- gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown origin
- ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma

GONAL-f must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:

- primary ovarian failure
- malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy
- fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
- primary testicular insufficiency

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## General recommendations

GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Porphyria

Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.

## Treatment in women

Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given.

Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.

In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments.

No direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG.

## Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)

A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment.

In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.

The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction.

Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles.

Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors.

There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hyperstimulation occur, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.

In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.

Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started.

## Multiple pregnancy

In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.

In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.

The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.

## Pregnancy loss

The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception.

## Ectopic pregnancy

Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population.

## Reproductive system neoplasms

There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women.

## Congenital malformation

The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.

## Thromboembolic events

In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events.

## Treatment in men

Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response.

## Sodium content

GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of follitropin alfa.

No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of GONAL-f.

## Breast-feeding

GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

GONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

GONAL-f has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection).

Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4).

Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

## 4.9 Overdose

The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS may occur (see section 4.4).

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, ATC code: G03GA05.

## Mechanism of action

Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle development, steroidogenesis and maturation.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days from the start of r-hFSH administration.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in women

In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level &lt; 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.

In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and in ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation.

In ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Table: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of GONAL-f with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies)

|                                                           | GONAL-f (n = 130)   | urinary FSH (n = 116)   |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p&lt; 0.05) for all criteria listed.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in men

In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered simultaneously.

## Distribution

Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L.

Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days.

## Elimination

Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC.

Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.

Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

## 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS

## 4.1 Therapeutic indications

## In adult women

- Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate.
- Stimulation of multifollicular development in women undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer and zygote intra-fallopian transfer.
- GONAL-f in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency.

## In adult men

- GONAL-f is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) therapy.

## 4.2 Posology and method of administration

Treatment with GONAL-f should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders.

Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques.

## Posology

Clinical assessment of GONAL-f indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration, and treatment monitoring procedures should be individualised to optimise follicular development and to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below.

Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between equivalent doses of the monodose presentation and the multidose presentation of GONAL-f.

## Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome)

GONAL-f may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle.

In the registration trials, a commonly used regimen commenced at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and was increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7- or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response.

In clinical practice, the starting dose is typically individualised based on the patient's clinical characteristics, such as markers of ovarian reserve, age, body mass index, and, if applicable, previous ovarian response to ovarian stimulation.

## Starting dose

The starting dose can be adjusted in a stepwise manner (a) lower than 75 IU per day if an excessive ovarian response in terms of number of follicles is anticipated based on the patient's clinical profile (age, body mass index, ovarian reserve); or (b) higher than 75 up to a maximum of 150 IU per day may be considered if a low ovarian response is anticipated.

The patient's response should be closely monitored by measuring follicle size and number by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion.

## Dose adjustments

If a patient fails to respond adequately (either low or excessive ovarian response), continuation of that treatment cycle should be evaluated and managed according to the physician's standard of care. In cases of low response, the daily dose should not exceed 225 IU FSH.

If an excessive ovarian response is obtained according to the physician's assessment, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle.

## Final follicular maturation

When an optimal ovarian response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU, up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be performed.

## Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies

In the registration trials, a commonly used regimen for superovulation involved the administration of 150 to 225 IU of GONAL-f daily, commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle.

In clinical practice, the starting dose is typically individualised based on the patient's clinical characteristics, such as markers of ovarian reserve, age, body mass index, and, if applicable, previous ovarian response to ovarian stimulation.

## Starting dose

If a low ovarian response is anticipated, the starting dose may be adjusted in a stepwise manner to not higher than 450 IU daily. Conversely, if an excessive ovarian response is expected, the starting dose may be decreased below 150 IU.

The patient's response should continue to be closely monitored by measuring follicle size and number by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion until adequate follicular development has been achieved.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

GONAL-f can be given either alone, or, to prevent premature luteinisation, in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist.

## Dose adjustments

If a patient fails to respond adequately (either low or excessive ovarian response), continuation of that treatment cycle should be evaluated and managed according to the physician's standard of care. In cases of low response, the daily dose should not exceed 450 IU FSH.

## Final follicular maturation

When an optimal ovarian response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection to induce final follicular maturation.

## Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency

In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of GONAL-f therapy in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final maturation after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). GONAL-f should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic and has low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time.

A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response.

If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks.

When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on the physician's judgment of the clinical case.

Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum.

If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4).

## Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism

GONAL-f should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.

## Special populations

## Elderly

There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of GONAL-f in elderly patients have not been established.

## Renal or hepatic impairment

Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GONAL-f in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of GONAL-f in the paediatric population.

## Method of administration

GONAL-f is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day.

The first injection of GONAL-f should be performed under direct medical supervision. Selfadministration of GONAL-f should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice.

As GONAL-f pre-filled pen with multidose cartridge is intended for several injections, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the multidose presentation.

For instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the 'Instructions for use'.

## 4.3 Contraindications

- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1
- tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland
- ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst unrelated to polycystic ovarian disease and of unknown origin
- gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown origin
- ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma

GONAL-f must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as:

- primary ovarian failure
- malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy
- fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy
- primary testicular insufficiency

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Traceability

In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

## General recommendations

GONAL-f is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of GONAL-f calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Porphyria

Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with GONAL-f. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment.

## Treatment in women

Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given.

Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests.

In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to GONAL-f was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments.

No direct comparison of GONAL-f/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with GONAL-f/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG.

## Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)

A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment.

In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities.

The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction.

Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles.

Adherence to recommended GONAL-f dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors.

There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

hyperstimulation occur, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration.

In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation.

Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started.

## Multiple pregnancy

In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended.

In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age.

The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment.

## Pregnancy loss

The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception.

## Ectopic pregnancy

Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART, was reported to be higher than in the general population.

## Reproductive system neoplasms

There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women.

## Congenital malformation

The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.

## Thromboembolic events

In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events.

## Treatment in men

Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to GONAL-f/hCG therapy. GONAL-f should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response.

## Sodium content

GONAL-f contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Concomitant use of GONAL-f with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of GONAL-f needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product interaction has been reported during GONAL-f therapy.

## 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation

## Pregnancy

There is no indication for use of GONAL-f during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity of follitropin alfa.

No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of GONAL-f.

## Breast-feeding

GONAL-f is not indicated during breast-feeding.

## Fertility

GONAL-f is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1).

## 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines

GONAL-f has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

## 4.8 Undesirable effects

## Summary of the safety profile

The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection).

Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4).

Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

## 4.9 Overdose

The effects of an overdose of GONAL-f are unknown, nevertheless, there is a possibility that OHSS may occur (see section 4.4).

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, ATC code: G03GA05.

## Mechanism of action

Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle development, steroidogenesis and maturation.

## Pharmacodynamic effects

Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days from the start of r-hFSH administration.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in women

In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level &lt; 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories.

In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and in ovulation induction, GONAL-f was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation.

In ART, GONAL-f at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Table: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of GONAL-f with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies)

|                                                           | GONAL-f (n = 130)   | urinary FSH (n = 116)   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Number of oocytes retrieved                               | 11.0 ± 5.9          | 8.8 ± 4.8               |
| Days of FSH stimulation required                          | 11.7 ± 1.9          | 14.5 ± 3.3              |
| Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) | 27.6 ± 10.2         | 40.7 ± 13.6             |
| Need to increase the dose (%)                             | 56.2                | 85.3                    |

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p&lt; 0.05) for all criteria listed.

## Clinical efficacy and safety in men

In men deficient in FSH, GONAL-f administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis.

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered simultaneously.

## Distribution

Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L.

Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days.

## Elimination

Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine.

## 5.3 Preclinical safety data

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC.

Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.

Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being a teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). However, since GONAL-f is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical relevance.

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you.

- Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
- If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
- This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
- If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f
3. How to use GONAL-f
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store GONAL-f
6. Contents of the pack and other information
7. How to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solvent

## 1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for

## What GONAL-f is

GONAL-f contains a medicine called 'follitropin alfa'. Follitropin alfa is a type of 'follicle stimulating hormone' (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called 'gonadotropins'. Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility.

## What GONAL-f is used for

## In adult women, GONAL-f is used:

- to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not respond to treatment with a medicine called 'clomiphene citrate'.
- together with another medicine called 'lutropin alfa' ('luteinising hormone' or LH) to help release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH).
- to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as ' in vitro fertilisation', 'gamete intra-fallopian transfer' or 'zygote intra-fallopian transfer'.

## In adult men, GONAL-f is used:

- together with another medicine called 'human chorionic gonadotropin' (hCG) to help produce sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones.

## 2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f

You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor experienced in treating fertility disorders.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Do not use GONAL-f

- if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6.
- if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain).
- if you are a woman :
- -with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin.
- -with unexplained vaginal bleeding.
- -with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts.
- -with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure (early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs.
- if you are a man :
- -with damaged testicles that cannot be healed.

Do not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before using this medicine.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Gonal-f.

## Porphyria

Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children).

Tell your doctor straight away if:

- your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the sun, and/or
- you have stomach, arm or leg pain.

In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment.

## Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)

If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4).

In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four days.

## Multiple pregnancy

When using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same time ('multiple pregnancy', mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy by using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Miscarriage

When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman.

## Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)

If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become worse with GONAL-f treatment.

## Men with too much FSH in their blood

If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f usually does not work if you have this problem.

If your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment.

## Children and adolescents

GONAL-f is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old.

## Other medicines and GONAL-f

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

- If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles.
- If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a 'gonadotropin-releasing hormone' (GnRH) agonist or antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may need a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Do not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines.

## GONAL-f contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How to use GONAL-f

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

## Using this medicine

- GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously).
- The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor.
- Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject GONAL-f before you can inject yourself.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the instructions at the end of this leaflet called 'How to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solution'.

## How much to use

Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below are stated in International Units (IU).

## Women

## If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods.

- GONAL-f is usually given every day.
- If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day.
- The starting dose of GONAL-f is usually individualised and may be adjusted in a stepwise manner.
- The daily dose of GONAL-f should not exceed 225 IU.
- When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after.

If your doctor cannot see a desired response, the continuation of that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be evaluated and managed accordingly to the standard clinical practice.

If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before.

## If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones

- The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
- You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks.
- Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you get the desired response.
- When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on your doctor's judgment.

If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than before.

If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before.

## If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology

- The starting dose of GONAL-f is usually individualised and may be adjusted in a stepwise manner to not higher than 450 IU daily.
- Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. Your doctor will use blood tests and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your eggs ready for collection.

## Men

- The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG.
- You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months.
- If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months.

## If you use more GONAL-f than you should

The effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)').

## If you forget to use GONAL-f

If you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk to your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Serious side effects in women

- Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under 'Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people).
- The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).
- Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may affect up to 1 in 1 000 people).
- Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under 'Blood clotting problems').

## Serious side effects in men and women

- Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people).

## If you notice any of the above-listed side effects, you should immediately contact your doctor who might ask you to stop using GONAL-f.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Other side effects in women

Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):

- Sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts)

- Feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and bloating

Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people):

- Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing may occur. These reactions can sometimes be serious.
- Your asthma may get worse.

## Other side effects in men

Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):

- Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness, bruising, swelling and/or irritation

Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people):

- Swelling of the veins above and behind the testicles (varicocele)
- Breast development, acne or weight gain

Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people):

(If you have been prescribed more than one vial of GONAL-f, slowly re-inject the solution into another powder vial, until you have the prescribed number of powder vials dissolved in the solution. If you have been prescribed lutropin alfa in addition to GONAL-f, you may also mix the two medicines as an alternative to injecting each product separately. After dissolving the lutropin alfa powder, draw the solution back into the syringe and re-inject it into the vial containing GONAL-f. Once the powder has dissolved, draw the solution back into the syringe. Inspect for particles as before, and do not use if the solution is not clear. Up to three containers of powder may be dissolved in 1 mL of solvent.)

## 5. Injecting the dose

- Immediately inject the solution: Your doctor or nurse will have already advised you where to inject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh). To minimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day.
- Clean the chosen skin area with an alcohol swab using a circular motion.
- Firmly pinch the skin together and insert the needle at a 45° to 90° angle using a dart-like motion.
- Inject under the skin by pushing gently the plunger, as you were taught. Do not inject directly into a vein. Take as much time as you need to inject all the solution.
- Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol swab using a circular motion.

## 1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for

## What GONAL-f is

GONAL-f contains a medicine called 'follitropin alfa'. Follitropin alfa is a type of 'follicle stimulating hormone' (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called 'gonadotropins'. Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility.

## What GONAL-f is used for

## In adult women, GONAL-f is used:

- to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not respond to treatment with a medicine called 'clomiphene citrate'.
- together with another medicine called 'lutropin alfa' ('luteinising hormone' or LH) to help release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH).
- to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as ' in vitro fertilisation', 'gamete intra-fallopian transfer' or 'zygote intra-fallopian transfer'.

## In adult men, GONAL-f is used:

- together with another medicine called 'human chorionic gonadotropin' (hCG) to help produce sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones.

## 2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f

You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor experienced in treating fertility disorders.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Do not use GONAL-f

- if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6.
- if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain).
- if you are a woman :
- -with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin.
- -with unexplained vaginal bleeding.
- -with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts.
- -with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure (early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs.
- if you are a man :
- -with damaged testicles that cannot be healed.

Do not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before using this medicine.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Gonal-f.

## Porphyria

Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children).

Tell your doctor straight away if:

- your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the sun, and/or
- you have stomach, arm or leg pain.

In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment.

## Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)

If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4).

In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four days.

## Multiple pregnancy

When using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same time ('multiple pregnancy', mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy by using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Miscarriage

When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman.

## Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)

If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become worse with GONAL-f treatment.

## Men with too much FSH in their blood

If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f usually does not work if you have this problem.

If your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment.

## Children and adolescents

GONAL-f is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old.

## Other medicines and GONAL-f

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

- If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles.
- If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a 'gonadotropin-releasing hormone' (GnRH) agonist or antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may need a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Do not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines.

## GONAL-f contains sodium, benzyl alcohol and latex

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

When prepared with the solvent provided, this medicine contains 1.23 mg benzyl alcohol in each 75 IU dose which is equivalent to 9.45 mg/mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.

The needle shield of the pre-filled syringe containing the solvent for reconstitution contains latex (natural dry rubber), which may cause severe allergic reactions.

A presentation (GONAL-f 75 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection) without benzyl alcohol and latex is available in case you are allergic to these ingredients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 3. How to use GONAL-f

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

## Using this medicine

- GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The prepared solution can be used for several injections.
- The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor.
- Your doctor or nurse will show you how to inject GONAL-f before you can inject yourself.
- If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the instructions at the end of this leaflet called 'How to prepare and use the GONAL-f powder and solution'.

## How much to use

Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below are stated in International Units (IU), which reflects the grading of the administration syringes provided in the pack.

If you use another syringe, which shows millilitres (mL) instead of IUs, you can take the correct amount for injection in mL from the following table:

|   Dose to be injected (IU) |   Volume to be injected (mL) |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|
|                         75 |                         0.13 |
|                        150 |                         0.25 |
|                        225 |                         0.38 |
|                        300 |                         0.5  |
|                        375 |                         0.63 |
|                        450 |                         0.75 |

## Women

## If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods.

- GONAL-f is usually given every day.
- If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day.
- The starting dose of GONAL-f is usually individualised and may be adjusted in a stepwise manner.
- The daily dose of GONAL-f should not exceed 225 IU.
- When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after.

If your doctor cannot see a desired response, the continuation of that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be evaluated and managed accordingly to the standard clinical practice.

If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones

- The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
- You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks.
- Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you get the desired response.
- When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on your doctor's judgment.

If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than before.

If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before.

## If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology

- The starting dose of GONAL-f is usually individualised and may be adjusted in a stepwise manner to not higher than 450 IU daily.
- Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. Your doctor will use blood tests and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is.
- When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your eggs ready for collection.

## Men

- The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG.
- You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months.
- If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months.

## If you use more GONAL-f than you should

The effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)').

## If you forget to use GONAL-f

If you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk to your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Serious side effects in women

- Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under 'Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people).
- The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).
- Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may affect up to 1 in 1 000 people).
- Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under 'Blood clotting problems').

## Serious side effects in men and women

- Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people).

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

When prepared with the solvent provided, this medicine contains 1.23 mg benzyl alcohol in each 75 IU dose which is equivalent to 9.45 mg/mL. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions.

The needle shield of the pre-filled syringe containing the solvent for reconstitution contains latex (natural dry rubber), which may cause severe allergic reactions.

A presentation (GONAL-f 75 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection) without benzyl alcohol and latex is available in case you are allergic to these ingredients.

## How much to use

Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below are stated in International Units (IU), which reflects the grading of the administration syringes provided in the pack.

If you use another syringe, which shows millilitres (mL) instead of IUs, you can take the correct amount for injection in mL from the following table:

|   Dose to be injected (IU) |   Volume to be injected (mL) |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|
|                         75 |                         0.13 |
|                        150 |                         0.25 |
|                        225 |                         0.38 |

## Women

## If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods.

- GONAL-f is usually given every day.
- If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day.
- The starting dose of GONAL-f is usually individualised and may be adjusted in a stepwise manner.
- The daily dose of GONAL-f should not exceed 225 IU.
- When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after.

If your doctor cannot see a desired response, the continuation of that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be evaluated and managed accordingly to the standard clinical practice.

If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones

- The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
- You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks.
- Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you get the desired response.
- When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on your doctor's judgment.

If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than before.

If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before.

## If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology

- The starting dose of GONAL-f is usually individualised and may be adjusted in a stepwise manner to not higher than 450 IU daily.
- Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. Your doctor will use blood tests and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is.
- When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your eggs ready for collection.

## Men

- The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG.
- You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months.
- If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months.

## If you use more GONAL-f than you should

The effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)').

## If you forget to use GONAL-f

If you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk to your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Serious side effects in women

2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f
3. How to use GONAL-f
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store GONAL-f
6. Contents of the pack and other information Instructions for use

## 1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for

## What GONAL-f is

GONAL-f contains a medicine called 'follitropin alfa'. Follitropin alfa is a type of 'follicle stimulating hormone' (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called 'gonadotropins'. Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility.

## What GONAL-f is used for

## In adult women, GONAL-f is used:

- to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not respond to treatment with a medicine called 'clomiphene citrate'.
- together with another medicine called 'lutropin alfa' ('luteinising hormone' or LH) to help release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH).
- to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as ' in vitro fertilisation', 'gamete intra-fallopian transfer' or 'zygote intra-fallopian transfer'.

## In adult men, GONAL-f is used:

- together with another medicine called 'human chorionic gonadotropin' (hCG) to help produce sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones.

## 2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f

You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor experienced in treating fertility disorders.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Do not use GONAL-f

- if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6.
- if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain).
- if you are a woman :
- -with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin.
- -with unexplained vaginal bleeding.
- -with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts.
- -with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure (early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs.
- if you are a man :
- -with damaged testicles that cannot be healed.

Do not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before using this medicine.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Gonal-f.

## Porphyria

Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children).

Tell your doctor straight away if:

- your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the sun, and/or
- you have stomach, arm or leg pain.

In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment.

## Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)

If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4).

In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four days.

## Multiple pregnancy

When using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same time ('multiple pregnancy', mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy by using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Miscarriage

When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman.

## Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)

If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become worse with GONAL-f treatment.

## Men with too much FSH in their blood

If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f usually does not work if you have this problem.

If your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment.

## Children and adolescents

GONAL-f is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old.

## Other medicines and GONAL-f

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

- If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles.
- If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a 'gonadotropin-releasing hormone' (GnRH) agonist or antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may need a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Do not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines.

## GONAL-f contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How to use GONAL-f

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

## Using this medicine

- GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The prefilled pen can be used for several injections.
- The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on your doctor's judgment.

If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than before.

If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Get familiar with your GONAL-f pre-filled pen

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 1 Gather your supplies

- 1.1  Let the pre-filled pen sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before use to allow the medicine to reach room temperature.

Do not use a microwave or other heating element to warm up the pen.

- 1.2  Prepare a clean area and a flat surface, such as a table or countertop, in a well-lit area.
- 1.3  You will also need (not included in the pack):
- Alcohol swabs and a sharps container (Figure 4).
- 1.4  Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them well (Figure 5).
- 1.5  Use your hand to remove the GONAL-f pre-filled pen from the pack.

Do not use any tools, using tools might damage the pen.

- 1.6  Check the name on the pre-filled pen says GONAL-f.
- 1.7  Check the expiration date on the pen label (Figure 6).

Do not use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if the expiration date has passed or if your pre-filled pen does not say GONAL-f.

## Step 2 Get ready for injection

- 2.1  Pull-off the pen cap (Figure 7).
- 2.2  Check that medicine is clear, colourless and does not contain particles.

Do not use the pre-filled pen if the medicine is discolored or cloudy, as this can cause an infection.

- 2.3  Check that the Dose Feedback Window is set to '0' (Figure 8).

Choose your injection site:

- 2.4  Your healthcare provider should show you the injection sites to use around your stomach area (Figure 9). To minimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day.
- 2.5  Clean the skin at the injection site by wiping with an alcohol swab.

Do not touch or cover the cleaned skin.

## Step 3 Attach your needle

Important: Always make sure to use a new needle for each injection. Re-using needles can cause infection.

- 3.1  Get a new needle. Only use the 'single-use' needles supplied.
- 3.2  Check that the outer needle cap is not damaged.
- 3.3  Hold the outer needle cap firmly.

Fig. 10

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 3.4  Check that the peel-off seal on the outer needle cap is not damaged or loose, and that expiration date has not passed (Figure 10).
- 3.5  Remove the peel-off seal (Figure 11).

Do not use the needle if it is damaged, expired or if the outer needle cap or the peel-off seal is damaged or loose. Using expired needles or needles with damaged peel-off seal or outer needle cap can lead to infection. Throw it away in a sharps container and get a new needle.

- 3.6  Screw the outer needle cap onto the threaded tip of the GONAL-f   pre-filled pen until you feel a light resistance (Figure 12).

Do not attach the needle too tightly; the needle could be difficult to remove after the injection.

- 3.7  Remove the outer needle cap by pulling it gently (Figure 13).

3.8 Put it aside for later use (Figure 14).

Do not discard the outer needle cap, as it will prevent needle stick injury and infection when detaching the needle from the pre-filled pen.

- 3.9  Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen with the needle pointing upward (Figure 15).
- 3.10 Carefully remove and discard the inner needle shield (Figure 16).

Do not recap the needle with the inner needle shield, as it can lead to needle stick injury and infection.

- 3.11 Look closely at the tip of the needle for tiny droplet(s) of liquid (Figure 17).

Fig. 11

| If              | Then                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Using a new pen | Check for a droplet of liquid at the tip of the needle. • If you see a tiny droplet of liquid, proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose. • If you do not see a tiny droplet at or near the needle tip, you must perform the steps in the following section to remove air in the system. |
| Reusing a pen   | It is NOT required to check for a droplet of liquid. Proceed directly to Step 4 Dial your dose.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

1. Gently turn the dose setting knob forward until it reads '25' in the Dose Feedback Window (Figure 18).
- You can turn the dose knob backward if you turn it past '25'.
2. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward.
3. Tap the reservoir holder gently (Figure 19).
4. Press the dose setting knob as far as it will go . A tiny droplet of liquid will appear at the tip of the needle (Figure 20).
5. Check that the Dose Feedback Window reads '0' (Figure 21).
6. Proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose .

<!-- image -->

If a tiny droplet of liquid does not appear, contact your healthcare provider.

## Step 4 Dial your dose

Note: The pen contains 150 IU follitropin alfa. The 150 IU pen maximum single-dose setting is 150 IU. The smallest single-dose setting is 12.5 IU and the dose can be increased in increments of 12.5 IU.

- 4.1 Turn the dose setting knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Feedback Window.
- Example: If your intended dose is '150' IU, confirm that the Dose Feedback Window reads '150' (Figure 22). Injecting an incorrect amount of medicine could affect your treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fig.22

<!-- image -->

- Turn the dose setting knob forward to dial up (Figure 22).
- You can turn the dose setting knob backwards if you turn it past your intended dose (Figure 23).
- 4.2 Check that the Dose Feedback Window displays your complete prescribed dose before you move on to the next step.

Fig.23

<!-- image -->

## Step 5 Inject your dose

Important: Inject the dose as you were trained to do by your healthcare provider.

- 5.1 Slowly push the needle into the skin entirely (Figure 24).
- 5.2 Place your thumb in the middle of the dose setting knob. Slowly press the dose knob down as far as it will go and hold it to complete the full injection (Figure 25).

Note: The larger the dose, the longer it will take to inject.

- 5.3 Hold the dose knob down for a minimum of 5 seconds before you remove the needle from your skin (Figure 26).
- The dose number shown in the Dose Feedback Window will turn back to '0'.
- After a minimum of 5 seconds, pull the needle out of the skin while keeping the dose setting knob pressed down (Figure 27).
- When the needle is out of the skin, release the dose setting knob.

Do not release the dose knob until you remove the needle from the skin.

## Step 6 Remove the needle after each injection

- 6.1 Place the outer needle cap on a flat surface.
- 6.2 Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen firmly with one hand and slip the needle into the outer needle cap (Figure 28).

<!-- image -->

Fig. 28

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 6.3 Continue by pushing the capped needle against a firm surface until you hear a 'click' (Figure 29).
- 6.4 Grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the needle by turning it in the opposite direction (Figure 30).
- 6.5 Dispose of the used needle safely in a sharps container (Figure 31). Handle the needle with care to avoid getting injured by the needle.

Do not reuse or share any used needle.

## Step 7 After the injection

7.1 Check you have given a complete injection:

- Check that the Dose Feedback Window shows '0' (Figure 32).

If the Dose Feedback Window shows '0', you have completed your dose.

If the Dose Feedback Window shows a number higher than '0' , the GONAL-f pre-filled pen is empty. You have not received your full prescribed dose and you must perform step 7.2 below.

- 7.2 Complete a partial injection (only when needed):
- The Dose Feedback Window will indicate the missing amount you need to inject using a new pen. In the example shown, the missing amount is '50' IU (Figure 33).
- To complete the dose with a second pen, repeat Steps 1 through 8.

## Step 8 Store the GONAL-f pre-filled pen

- 8.1 Put the pen cap back onto the pen to avoid infection (Figure 34).
- 8.2 Store the pen with the cap on it in a safe place and as indicated in the Package Leaflet.
- 8.3 When the pen is empty, ask your healthcare provider how to dispose of it.

<!-- image -->

Fig. 29

## 1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for

## What GONAL-f is

GONAL-f contains a medicine called 'follitropin alfa'. Follitropin alfa is a type of 'follicle stimulating hormone' (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called 'gonadotropins'. Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility.

## What GONAL-f is used for

## In adult women, GONAL-f is used:

- to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not respond to treatment with a medicine called 'clomiphene citrate'.
- together with another medicine called 'lutropin alfa' ('luteinising hormone' or LH) to help release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH).
- to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as ' in vitro fertilisation', 'gamete intra-fallopian transfer' or 'zygote intra-fallopian transfer'.

## In adult men, GONAL-f is used:

- together with another medicine called 'human chorionic gonadotropin' (hCG) to help produce sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones.

## 2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f

You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor experienced in treating fertility disorders.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Do not use GONAL-f

- if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6.
- if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain).
- if you are a woman :
- -with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin.
- -with unexplained vaginal bleeding.
- -with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts.
- -with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure (early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs.
- if you are a man :
- -with damaged testicles that cannot be healed.

Do not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before using this medicine.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Gonal-f.

## Porphyria

Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children).

Tell your doctor straight away if:

- your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the sun, and/or
- you have stomach, arm or leg pain.

In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment.

## Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)

If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4).

In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four days.

## Multiple pregnancy

When using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same time ('multiple pregnancy', mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy by using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Miscarriage

When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman.

## Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)

If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become worse with GONAL-f treatment.

## Men with too much FSH in their blood

If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f usually does not work if you have this problem.

If your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment.

## Children and adolescents

GONAL-f is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old.

## Other medicines and GONAL-f

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

- If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles.
- If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a 'gonadotropin-releasing hormone' (GnRH) agonist or antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may need a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Do not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines.

## GONAL-f contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How to use GONAL-f

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

## Using this medicine

- GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The prefilled pen can be used for several injections.
- The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen to inject the medicine.
- If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the 'Instructions for use'.

## How much to use

Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below are stated in International Units (IU).

## Women

## If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods.

- GONAL-f is usually given every day.
- If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day.
- The starting dose of GONAL-f is usually individualised and may be adjusted in a stepwise manner.
- The daily dose of GONAL-f should not exceed 225 IU.
- When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after.

If your doctor cannot see a desired response, the continuation of that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be evaluated and managed accordingly to the standard clinical practice.

If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before.

## If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones

- The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
- You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks.
- Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you get the desired response.
- When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on your doctor's judgment.

If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than before.

If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology

- The starting dose of GONAL-f is usually individualised and may be adjusted in a stepwise manner to not higher than 450 IU daily.
- Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. Your doctor will use blood tests and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is.
- When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your eggs ready for collection.

## Men

- The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG.
- You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months.
- If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months.

## If you use more GONAL-f than you should

The effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)').

## If you forget to use GONAL-f

If you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk to your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Serious side effects in women

- Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under 'Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people).
- The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).
- Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may affect up to 1 in 1 000 people).
- Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under 'Blood clotting problems').

## Serious side effects in men and women

- Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you notice any of the above-listed side effects, you should immediately contact your doctor who might ask you to stop using GONAL-f.

## Other side effects in women

## Get familiar with your GONAL-f pre-filled pen

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 1 Gather your supplies

- 1.1  Let the pre-filled pen sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before use to allow the medicine to reach room temperature.

Do not use a microwave or other heating element to warm up the pen.

- 1.2  Prepare a clean area and a flat surface, such as a table or countertop, in a well-lit area.
- 1.3  You will also need (not included in the pack):
- Alcohol swabs and a sharps container (Figure 4).
- 1.4  Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them well (Figure 5).
- 1.5  Use your hand to remove the GONAL-f pre-filled pen from the pack.

Do not use any tools, using tools might damage the pen.

- 1.6  Check the name on the pre-filled pen says GONAL-f.
- 1.7  Check the expiration date on the pen label (Figure 6).

Do not use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if the expiration date has passed or if your pre-filled pen does not say GONAL-f.

## Step 2 Get ready for injection

- 2.1  Pull-off the pen cap (Figure 7).
- 2.2  Check that medicine is clear, colourless and does not contain particles.

Do not use the pre-filled pen if the medicine is discolored or cloudy, as this can cause an infection.

- 2.3  Check that the Dose Feedback Window is set to '0' (Figure 8).

Choose your injection site:

- 2.4  Your healthcare provider should show you the injection sites to use around your stomach area (Figure 9). To minimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day.
- 2.5  Clean the skin at the injection site by wiping with an alcohol swab.

Do not touch or cover the cleaned skin.

## Step 3 Attach your needle

Important: Always make sure to use a new needle for each injection. Re-using needles can cause infection.

- 3.1  Get a new needle. Only use the 'single-use' needles supplied.
- 3.2  Check that the outer needle cap is not damaged.
- 3.3  Hold the outer needle cap firmly.

Fig. 10

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 3.4  Check that the peel-off seal on the outer needle cap is not damaged or loose, and that expiration date has not passed (Figure 10).
- 3.5  Remove the peel-off seal (Figure 11).

Do not use the needle if it is damaged, expired or if the outer needle cap or the peel-off seal is damaged or loose. Using expired needles or needles with damaged peel-off seal or outer needle cap can lead to infection. Throw it away in a sharps container and get a new needle.

- 3.6  Screw the outer needle cap onto the threaded tip of the GONAL-f   pre-filled pen until you feel a light resistance (Figure 12).

Do not attach the needle too tightly; the needle could be difficult to remove after the injection.

- 3.7  Remove the outer needle cap by pulling it gently (Figure 13).

3.8 Put it aside for later use (Figure 14).

Do not discard the outer needle cap, as it will prevent needle stick injury and infection when detaching the needle from the pre-filled pen.

- 3.9  Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen with the needle pointing upward (Figure 15).
- 3.10 Carefully remove and discard the inner needle shield (Figure 16).

Do not recap the needle with the inner needle shield, as it can lead to needle stick injury and infection.

- 3.11 Look closely at the tip of the needle for tiny droplet(s) of liquid (Figure 17).

Fig. 11

| If              | Then                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Using a new pen | Check for a droplet of liquid at the tip of the needle. • If you see a tiny droplet of liquid, proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose. • If you do not see a tiny droplet at or near the needle tip, you must perform the steps in the following section to remove air in the system. |
| Reusing a pen   | It is NOT required to check for a droplet of liquid. Proceed directly to Step 4 Dial your dose.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

1. Gently turn the dose setting knob forward until it reads '25' in the Dose Feedback Window (Figure 18).
- You can turn the dose knob backward if you turn it past '25'.
2. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward.
3. Tap the reservoir holder gently (Figure 19).
4. Press the dose setting knob as far as it will go . A tiny droplet of liquid will appear at the tip of the needle (Figure 20).
5. Check that the Dose Feedback Window reads '0' (Figure 21).
6. Proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose .

<!-- image -->

If a tiny droplet of liquid does not appear, contact your healthcare provider.

## Step 4 Dial your dose

Note: The pen contains 300 IU follitropin alfa. The 300 IU pen maximum single-dose setting is 300 IU. The smallest single-dose setting is 12.5 IU and the dose can be increased in increments of 12.5 IU.

- 4.1 Turn the dose setting knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Feedback Window.
- Example: If your intended dose is '150' IU, confirm that the Dose Feedback Window reads '150' (Figure 22). Injecting an incorrect amount of medicine could affect your treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fig.22

<!-- image -->

- Turn the dose setting knob forward to dial up (Figure 22).
- You can turn the dose setting knob backwards if you turn it past your intended dose (Figure 23).
- 4.2 Check that the Dose Feedback Window displays your complete prescribed dose before you move on to the next step.

Fig.23

<!-- image -->

## Step 5 Inject your dose

Important: Inject the dose as you were trained to do by your healthcare provider.

- 5.1 Slowly push the needle into the skin entirely (Figure 24).
- 5.2 Place your thumb in the middle of the dose setting knob. Slowly press the dose knob down as far as it will go and hold it to complete the full injection (Figure 25).

Note: The larger the dose, the longer it will take to inject.

- 5.3 Hold the dose knob down for a minimum of 5 seconds before you remove the needle from your skin (Figure 26).
- The dose number shown in the Dose Feedback Window will turn back to '0'.
- After a minimum of 5 seconds, pull the needle out of the skin while keeping the dose setting knob pressed down (Figure 27).
- When the needle is out of the skin, release the dose setting knob.

Do not release the dose knob until you remove the needle from the skin.

## Step 6 Remove the needle after each injection

- 6.1 Place the outer needle cap on a flat surface.
- 6.2 Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen firmly with one hand and slip the needle into the outer needle cap (Figure 28).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 6.3 Continue by pushing the capped needle against a firm surface until you hear a 'click' (Figure 29).
- 6.4 Grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the needle by turning it in the opposite direction (Figure 30).
- 6.5 Dispose of the used needle safely in a sharps container (Figure 31). Handle the needle with care to avoid getting injured by the needle.

Do not reuse or share any used needle.

## Step 7 After the injection

7.1 Check you have given a complete injection:

- Check that the Dose Feedback Window shows '0' (Figure 32).

If the Dose Feedback Window shows '0', you have completed your dose.

If the Dose Feedback Window shows a number higher than '0' , the GONAL-f pre-filled pen is empty. You have not received your full prescribed dose and you must perform step 7.2 below.

## 7.2 Complete a partial injection (only when needed):

- The Dose Feedback Window will indicate the missing amount you need to inject using a new pen. In the example shown, the missing amount is '50' IU (Figure 33).
- To complete the dose with a second pen, repeat Steps 1 through 8.

## Step 8 Store the GONAL-f pre-filled pen

- 8.1 Put the pen cap back onto the pen to avoid infection (Figure 34).
- 8.2 Store the pen with the cap on it in a safe place and as indicated in the Package Leaflet.
- 8.3 When the pen is empty, ask your healthcare provider how to dispose of it.

1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f
3. How to use GONAL-f
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store GONAL-f
6. Contents of the pack and other information Instructions for use

## 1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for

## What GONAL-f is

GONAL-f contains a medicine called 'follitropin alfa'. Follitropin alfa is a type of 'follicle stimulating hormone' (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called 'gonadotropins'. Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility.

## What GONAL-f is used for

## In adult women, GONAL-f is used:

- to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not respond to treatment with a medicine called 'clomiphene citrate'.
- together with another medicine called 'lutropin alfa' ('luteinising hormone' or LH) to help release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH).
- to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as ' in vitro fertilisation', 'gamete intra-fallopian transfer' or 'zygote intra-fallopian transfer'.

## In adult men, GONAL-f is used:

- together with another medicine called 'human chorionic gonadotropin' (hCG) to help produce sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones.

## 2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f

You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor experienced in treating fertility disorders.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Do not use GONAL-f

- if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6.
- •
- if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain).
- if you are a woman :
- -with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin.
- -with unexplained vaginal bleeding.
- -with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts.
- -with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure (early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs.
- if you are a man :
- -with damaged testicles that cannot be healed.

Do not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before using this medicine.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Gonal-f.

## Porphyria

Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children).

Tell your doctor straight away if:

- your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the sun, and/or
- you have stomach, arm or leg pain.

In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment.

## Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)

If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4).

In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four days.

## Multiple pregnancy

When using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same time ('multiple pregnancy', mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy by using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Miscarriage

When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman.

## Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)

If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become worse with GONAL-f treatment.

## Men with too much FSH in their blood

If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f usually does not work if you have this problem.

If your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment.

## Children and adolescents

GONAL-f is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old.

## Other medicines and GONAL-f

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

- If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles.
- If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a 'gonadotropin-releasing hormone' (GnRH) agonist or antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may need a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Do not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines.

## GONAL-f contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How to use GONAL-f

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

## Using this medicine

- GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The prefilled pen can be used for several injections.
- The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen to inject the medicine.
- If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the 'Instructions for use'.

## How much to use

Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below are stated in International Units (IU).

## Women

## If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods.

- GONAL-f is usually given every day.
- If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day.
- The starting dose of GONAL-f is usually individualised and may be adjusted in a stepwise manner.
- The daily dose of GONAL-f should not exceed 225 IU.
- When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after.

If your doctor cannot see a desired response, the continuation of that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be evaluated and managed accordingly to the standard clinical practice.

If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before.

## If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones

- The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
- You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks.
- Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you get the desired response.
- When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on your doctor's judgment.

If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than before.

If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology

- The starting dose of GONAL-f is usually individualised and may be adjusted in a stepwise manner to not higher than 450 IU daily.
- Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. Your doctor will use blood tests and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is.
- When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your eggs ready for collection.

## Men

- The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG.
- You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months.
- If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months.

## If you use more GONAL-f than you should

The effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)').

## If you forget to use GONAL-f

If you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk to your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Serious side effects in women

- Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under 'Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people).
- The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).
- Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may affect up to 1 in 1 000 people).
- Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under 'Blood clotting problems').

## Serious side effects in men and women

- Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Get familiar with your GONAL-f pre-filled pen

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 1 Gather your supplies

- 1.1  Let the pre-filled pen sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before use to allow the medicine to reach room temperature.

Do not use a microwave or other heating element to warm up the pen.

- 1.2  Prepare a clean area and a flat surface, such as a table or countertop, in a well-lit area.
- 1.3  You will also need (not included in the pack):
- Alcohol swabs and a sharps container (Figure 4).
- 1.4  Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them well (Figure 5).
- 1.5  Use your hand to remove the GONAL-f pre-filled pen from the pack.

Do not use any tools, using tools might damage the pen.

- 1.6  Check the name on the pre-filled pen says GONAL-f.
- 1.7  Check the expiration date on the pen label (Figure 6).

Do not use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if the expiration date has passed or if your pre-filled pen does not say GONAL-f.

## Step 2 Get ready for injection

- 2.1  Pull-off the pen cap (Figure 7).
- 2.2  Check that medicine is clear, colourless and does not contain particles.

Do not use the pre-filled pen if the medicine is discolored or cloudy, as this can cause an infection.

- 2.3  Check that the Dose Feedback Window is set to '0' (Figure 8).

Choose your injection site:

- 2.4  Your healthcare provider should show you the injection sites to use around your stomach area (Figure 9). To minimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day.
- 2.5  Clean the skin at the injection site by wiping with an alcohol swab.

Do not touch or cover the cleaned skin.

## Step 3 Attach your needle

Important: Always make sure to use a new needle for each injection. Re-using needles can cause infection.

- 3.1  Get a new needle. Only use the 'single-use' needles supplied.
- 3.2  Check that the outer needle cap is not damaged.
- 3.3  Hold the outer needle cap firmly.

Fig. 10

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 3.4  Check that the peel-off seal on the outer needle cap is not damaged or loose, and that expiration date has not passed (Figure 10).
- 3.5  Remove the peel-off seal (Figure 11).

Do not use the needle if it is damaged, expired or if the outer needle cap or the peel-off seal is damaged or loose. Using expired needles or needles with damaged peel-off seal or outer needle cap can lead to infection. Throw it away in a sharps container and get a new needle.

- 3.6  Screw the outer needle cap onto the threaded tip of the GONAL-f   pre-filled pen until you feel a light resistance (Figure 12).

Do not attach the needle too tightly; the needle could be difficult to remove after the injection.

- 3.7  Remove the outer needle cap by pulling it gently (Figure 13).

3.8 Put it aside for later use (Figure 14).

Do not discard the outer needle cap, as it will prevent needle stick injury and infection when detaching the needle from the pre-filled pen.

- 3.9  Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen with the needle pointing upward (Figure 15).
- 3.10 Carefully remove and discard the inner needle shield (Figure 16).

Do not recap the needle with the inner needle shield, as it can lead to needle stick injury and infection.

- 3.11 Look closely at the tip of the needle for tiny droplet(s) of liquid (Figure 17).

|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Using a new pen | Check for a droplet of liquid at the tip of the needle. • If you see a tiny droplet of liquid, proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose. • If you do not see a tiny droplet at or near the needle tip, you must perform the steps in the following section to remove air in the system. |
| Reusing a pen   | It is NOT required to check for a droplet of liquid. Proceed directly to Step 4 Dial your dose.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

1. Gently turn the dose setting knob forward until it reads '25' in the Dose Feedback Window (Figure 18).
- You can turn the dose knob backward if you turn it past '25'.
2. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward.
3. Tap the reservoir holder gently (Figure 19).
4. Press the dose setting knob as far as it will go . A tiny droplet of liquid will appear at the tip of the needle (Figure 20).
5. Check that the Dose Feedback Window reads '0' (Figure 21).
6. Proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose .

<!-- image -->

If a tiny droplet of liquid does not appear, contact your healthcare provider.

## Step 4 Dial your dose

Note: The pen contains 450 IU follitropin alfa. The 450 IU pen maximum single-dose setting is 450 IU. The smallest single-dose setting is 12.5 IU and the dose can be increased in increments of 12.5 IU.

- 4.1 Turn the dose setting knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Feedback Window.
- Example: If your intended dose is '150' IU, confirm that the Dose Feedback Window reads '150' (Figure 22). Injecting an incorrect amount of medicine could affect your treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fig.22

<!-- image -->

- Turn the dose setting knob forward to dial up (Figure 22).
- You can turn the dose setting knob backwards if you turn it past your intended dose (Figure 23).
- 4.2 Check that the Dose Feedback Window displays your complete prescribed dose before you move on to the next step.

Fig.23

<!-- image -->

## Step 5 Inject your dose

Important: Inject the dose as you were trained to do by your healthcare provider.

- 5.1 Slowly push the needle into the skin entirely (Figure 24).
- 5.2 Place your thumb in the middle of the dose setting knob. Slowly press the dose knob down as far as it will go and hold it to complete the full injection (Figure 25).

Note: The larger the dose, the longer it will take to inject.

- 5.3 Hold the dose knob down for a minimum of 5 seconds before you remove the needle from your skin (Figure 26).
- The dose number shown in the Dose Feedback Window will turn back to '0'.
- After a minimum of 5 seconds, pull the needle out of the skin while keeping the dose setting knob pressed down (Figure 27).
- When the needle is out of the skin, release the dose setting knob.

Do not release the dose knob until you remove the needle from the skin.

## Step 6 Remove the needle after each injection

- 6.1 Place the outer needle cap on a flat surface.
- 6.2 Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen firmly with one hand and slip the needle into the outer needle cap (Figure 28).

<!-- image -->

Fig. 24

Fig.26

Fig. 28

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 6.3 Continue by pushing the capped needle against a firm surface until you hear a 'click' (Figure 29).
- 6.4 Grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the needle by turning it in the opposite direction (Figure 30).
- 6.5 Dispose of the used needle safely in a sharps container (Figure 31). Handle the needle with care to avoid getting injured by the needle.

Do not reuse or share any used needle.

## Step 7 After the injection

7.1 Check you have given a complete injection:

- Check that the Dose Feedback Window shows '0' (Figure 32).

If the Dose Feedback Window shows '0', you have completed your dose.

If the Dose Feedback Window shows a number higher than '0' , the GONAL-f pre-filled pen is empty. You have not received your full prescribed dose and you must perform step 7.2 below.

## 7.2 Complete a partial injection (only when needed):

- The Dose Feedback Window will indicate the missing amount you need to inject using a new pen. In the example shown, the missing amount is '50' IU (Figure 33).
- To complete the dose with a second pen, repeat Steps 1 through 8.

## Step 8 Store the GONAL-f pre-filled pen

- 8.1 Put the pen cap back onto the pen to avoid infection (Figure 34).
- 8.2 Store the pen with the cap on it in a safe place and as indicated in the Package Leaflet.
- 8.3 When the pen is empty, ask your healthcare provider how to dispose of it.

Fig. 29

<!-- image -->

Do not store the pen with the needle still attached, as this may cause infection.

Do not reuse the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if it has been dropped, or the pen is cracked or damaged as this can cause injury.

Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions.

1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for
2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f
3. How to use GONAL-f
4. Possible side effects
5. How to store GONAL-f
6. Contents of the pack and other information Instructions for use

## 1. What GONAL-f is and what it is used for

## What GONAL-f is

GONAL-f contains a medicine called 'follitropin alfa'. Follitropin alfa is a type of 'follicle stimulating hormone' (FSH) which belongs to the family of hormones called 'gonadotropins'. Gonadotropins are involved in reproduction and fertility.

## What GONAL-f is used for

## In adult women, GONAL-f is used:

- to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not respond to treatment with a medicine called 'clomiphene citrate'.
- together with another medicine called 'lutropin alfa' ('luteinising hormone' or LH) to help release egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little gonadotropins (FSH and LH).
- to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as ' in vitro fertilisation', 'gamete intra-fallopian transfer' or 'zygote intra-fallopian transfer'.

## In adult men, GONAL-f is used:

- together with another medicine called 'human chorionic gonadotropin' (hCG) to help produce sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones.

## 2. What you need to know before you use GONAL-f

You and your partner's fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor experienced in treating fertility disorders.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Do not use GONAL-f

- if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6.
- if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain).
- if you are a woman :
- -with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin.
- -with unexplained vaginal bleeding.
- -with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts.
- -with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure (early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs.
- if you are a man :
- -with damaged testicles that cannot be healed.

Do not use GONAL-f if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before using this medicine.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Gonal-f.

## Porphyria

Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children).

Tell your doctor straight away if:

- your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the sun, and/or
- you have stomach, arm or leg pain.

In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment.

## Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)

If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4).

In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. GONAL-f treatment seldom causes severe OHSS unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive method for at least four days.

## Multiple pregnancy

When using GONAL-f, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same time ('multiple pregnancy', mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy by using the right dose of GONAL-f at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Miscarriage

When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman.

## Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events)

If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become worse with GONAL-f treatment.

## Men with too much FSH in their blood

If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. GONAL-f usually does not work if you have this problem.

If your doctor decides to try GONAL-f treatment, to monitor the treatment, they may ask you to provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting treatment.

## Children and adolescents

GONAL-f is not for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old.

## Other medicines and GONAL-f

Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.

- If you use GONAL-f with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles.
- If you use GONAL-f at the same time as a 'gonadotropin-releasing hormone' (GnRH) agonist or antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may need a higher dose of GONAL-f to produce follicles.

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

Do not use GONAL-f if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.

## Driving and using machines

It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines.

## GONAL-f contains sodium

This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.

## 3. How to use GONAL-f

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.

## Using this medicine

- GONAL-f is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). The prefilled pen can be used for several injections.
- The first injection of GONAL-f should be given under supervision of your doctor.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen to inject the medicine.
- If you administer GONAL-f to yourself, please carefully read and follow the 'Instructions for use'.

## How much to use

Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below are stated in International Units (IU).

## Women

## If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods.

- GONAL-f is usually given every day.
- If you have irregular periods, start using GONAL-f within the first 7 days of your menstrual cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day.
- The starting dose of GONAL-f is usually individualised and may be adjusted in a stepwise manner.
- The daily dose of GONAL-f should not exceed 225 IU.
- When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last GONAL-f injection. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after.

If your doctor cannot see a desired response, the continuation of that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be evaluated and managed accordingly to the standard clinical practice.

If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before.

## If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones

- The usual starting dose of GONAL-f is 75 to 150 IU together with 75 IU of lutropin alfa.
- You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks.
- Your dose of GONAL-f may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you get the desired response.
- When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of GONAL-f and lutropin alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure may be performed based on your doctor's judgment.

If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with GONAL-f should be stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of GONAL-f than before.

If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with GONAL-f will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of GONAL-f than before.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology

- The starting dose of GONAL-f is usually individualised and may be adjusted in a stepwise manner to not higher than 450 IU daily.
- Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. Your doctor will use blood tests and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is.
- When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms 'recombinant hCG' (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last GONAL-f injection. This gets your eggs ready for collection.

## Men

- The usual dose of GONAL-f is 150 IU together with hCG.
- You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months.
- If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months.

## If you use more GONAL-f than you should

The effects of taking too much GONAL-f are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, 'Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)').

## If you forget to use GONAL-f

If you forget to use GONAL-f, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk to your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose.

If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

## 4. Possible side effects

Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

## Serious side effects in women

- Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also in section 2. under 'Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)'). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people).
- The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).
- Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may affect up to 1 in 1 000 people).
- Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also in section 2. under 'Blood clotting problems').

## Serious side effects in men and women

- Allergic reactions such as rash, red skin, hives, swelling of your face with difficulty breathing can sometimes be serious. This side effect is very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people).

## Get familiar with your GONAL-f pre-filled pen

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Step 1 Gather your supplies

- 1.1  Let the pre-filled pen sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before use to allow the medicine to reach room temperature.

Do not use a microwave or other heating element to warm up the pen.

- 1.2  Prepare a clean area and a flat surface, such as a table or countertop, in a well-lit area.
- 1.3  You will also need (not included in the pack):
- Alcohol swabs and a sharps container (Figure 4).
- 1.4  Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them well (Figure 5).
- 1.5  Use your hand to remove the GONAL-f pre-filled pen from the pack.

Do not use any tools, using tools might damage the pen.

- 1.6  Check the name on the pre-filled pen says GONAL-f.
- 1.7  Check the expiration date on the pen label (Figure 6).

Do not use the GONAL-f pre-filled pen if the expiration date has passed or if your pre-filled pen does not say GONAL-f.

## Step 2 Get ready for injection

- 2.1  Pull-off the pen cap (Figure 7).
- 2.2  Check that medicine is clear, colourless and does not contain particles.

Do not use the pre-filled pen if the medicine is discolored or cloudy, as this can cause an infection.

- 2.3  Check that the Dose Feedback Window is set to '0' (Figure 8).

Choose your injection site:

- 2.4  Your healthcare provider should show you the injection sites to use around your stomach area (Figure 9). To minimise skin irritation, select a different injection site each day.
- 2.5  Clean the skin at the injection site by wiping with an alcohol swab.

Do not touch or cover the cleaned skin.

## Step 3 Attach your needle

Important: Always make sure to use a new needle for each injection. Re-using needles can cause infection.

- 3.1  Get a new needle. Only use the 'single-use' needles supplied.
- 3.2  Check that the outer needle cap is not damaged.
- 3.3  Hold the outer needle cap firmly.

Fig. 10

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 3.4  Check that the peel-off seal on the outer needle cap is not damaged or loose, and that expiration date has not passed (Figure 10).
- 3.5  Remove the peel-off seal (Figure 11).

Do not use the needle if it is damaged, expired or if the outer needle cap or the peel-off seal is damaged or loose. Using expired needles or needles with damaged peel-off seal or outer needle cap can lead to infection. Throw it away in a sharps container and get a new needle.

- 3.6  Screw the outer needle cap onto the threaded tip of the GONAL-f   pre-filled pen until you feel a light resistance (Figure 12).

Do not attach the needle too tightly; the needle could be difficult to remove after the injection.

- 3.7  Remove the outer needle cap by pulling it gently (Figure 13).

3.8 Put it aside for later use (Figure 14).

Do not discard the outer needle cap, as it will prevent needle stick injury and infection when detaching the needle from the pre-filled pen.

- 3.9  Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen with the needle pointing upward (Figure 15).
- 3.10 Carefully remove and discard the inner needle shield (Figure 16).

Do not recap the needle with the inner needle shield, as it can lead to needle stick injury and infection.

- 3.11 Look closely at the tip of the needle for tiny droplet(s) of liquid (Figure 17).

Fig. 11

| If              | Then                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Using a new pen | Check for a droplet of liquid at the tip of the needle. • If you see a tiny droplet of liquid, proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose. • If you do not see a tiny droplet at or near the needle tip, you must perform the steps in the following section to remove air in the system. |
| Reusing a pen   | It is NOT required to check for a droplet of liquid. Proceed directly to Step 4 Dial your dose.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

1. Gently turn the dose setting knob forward until it reads '25' in the Dose Feedback Window (Figure 18).
- You can turn the dose knob backward if you turn it past '25'.
2. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward.
3. Tap the reservoir holder gently (Figure 19).
4. Press the dose setting knob as far as it will go . A tiny droplet of liquid will appear at the tip of the needle (Figure 20).
5. Check that the Dose Feedback Window reads '0' (Figure 21).
6. Proceed to Step 4 Dial your dose .

<!-- image -->

If a tiny droplet of liquid does not appear, contact your healthcare provider.

## Step 4 Dial your dose

Note: The pen contains 900 IU follitropin alfa. The 900 IU pen maximum single-dose setting is 450 IU. The smallest single-dose setting is 12.5 IU and the dose can be increased in increments of 12.5 IU.

- 4.1 Turn the dose setting knob until your intended dose shows in the Dose Feedback Window.
- Example: If your intended dose is '150' IU, confirm that the Dose Feedback Window reads '150' (Figure 22). Injecting an incorrect amount of medicine could affect your treatment.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Fig.22

<!-- image -->

- Turn the dose setting knob forward to dial up (Figure 22).
- You can turn the dose setting knob backwards if you turn it past your intended dose (Figure 23).
- 4.2 Check that the Dose Feedback Window displays your complete prescribed dose before you move on to the next step.

Fig.23

<!-- image -->

## Step 5 Inject your dose

Important: Inject the dose as you were trained to do by your healthcare provider.

- 5.1 Slowly push the needle into the skin entirely (Figure 24).
- 5.2 Place your thumb in the middle of the dose setting knob. Slowly press the dose knob down as far as it will go and hold it to complete the full injection (Figure 25).

Note: The larger the dose, the longer it will take to inject.

- 5.3 Hold the dose knob down for a minimum of 5 seconds before you remove the needle from your skin (Figure 26).
- The dose number shown in the Dose Feedback Window will turn back to '0'.
- After a minimum of 5 seconds, pull the needle out of the skin while keeping the dose setting knob pressed down (Figure 27).
- When the needle is out of the skin, release the dose setting knob.

Do not release the dose knob until you remove the needle from the skin.

## Step 6 Remove the needle after each injection

- 6.1 Place the outer needle cap on a flat surface.
- 6.2 Hold the GONAL-f pre-filled pen firmly with one hand and slip the needle into the outer needle cap (Figure 28).

<!-- image -->

Fig. 24

Fig.26

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Fig. 28

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

- 6.3 Continue by pushing the capped needle against a firm surface until you hear a 'click' (Figure 29).
- 6.4 Grip the outer needle cap and unscrew the needle by turning it in the opposite direction (Figure 30).
- 6.5 Dispose of the used needle safely in a sharps container (Figure 31). Handle the needle with care to avoid getting injured by the needle.

Do not reuse or share any used needle.

## Step 7 After the injection

7.1 Check you have given a complete injection:

- Check that the Dose Feedback Window shows '0' (Figure 32).

If the Dose Feedback Window shows '0', you have completed your dose.

If the Dose Feedback Window shows a number higher than '0' , the GONAL-f pre-filled pen is empty. You have not received your full prescribed dose and you must perform step 7.2 below.

- 7.2 Complete a partial injection (only when needed):
- The Dose Feedback Window will indicate the missing amount you need to inject using a new pen. In the example shown, the missing amount is '50' IU (Figure 33).
- To complete the dose with a second pen, repeat Steps 1 through 8.

## Step 8 Store the GONAL-f pre-filled pen

- 8.1 Put the pen cap back onto the pen to avoid infection (Figure 34).
- 8.2 Store the pen with the cap on it in a safe place and as indicated in the Package Leaflet.
- 8.3 When the pen is empty, ask your healthcare provider how to dispose of it.
