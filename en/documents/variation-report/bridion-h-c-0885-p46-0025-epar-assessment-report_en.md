## 1. Introduction

On 03-Jul-2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Bridion in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

## 2. Scientific discussion

## 2.1. Information on the development program

The MAH stated that 'A Phase 4 Double-Blinded, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled Clinical Trial to  Study  the  Efficacy,  Safety  and  Pharmacokinetics  of  Sugammadex  (MK-8616)  for  Reversal  of Neuromuscular Blockade in Pediatric Participants\" - MK-8616-089 is a stand-alone study.

## 2.2. Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study

The pharmaceutical formulation used in study MK-8616-089 was 100 mg/mL solution for injection (route of administration: intravenous).

The 100 mg/mL solution for injection formulation has been approved in the EU for routine reversal of rocuronium induced blockade in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years. The recommended dose is 2  mg/kg.  According  to  the  approved  product  information,  Bridion  100  mg/mL  may  be  diluted  to 10 mg/mL to increase the accuracy of dosing in the paediatric population.

Study MK-8616-089: 'A Phase 4 Double-Blinded, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled Clinical Trial  to  Study the Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Sugammadex (MK-8616) for Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade in Pediatric Participants\"

## 2.3.2. Clinical study

Study MK-8616-089: A Phase 4 Double-Blinded, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled Clinical Trial to  Study  the  Efficacy,  Safety  and  Pharmacokinetics  of  Sugammadex  (MK-8616)  for  Reversal  of Neuromuscular Blockade in Pediatric Participants

## Description

This was a randomized, active comparator-controlled, parallel group, multisite, double-blinded trial of sugammadex in pediatric participants from 2 to &lt;17 years of age for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced by rocuronium or vecuronium.

The study design consisted of 2 parts. Part A of the trial identified the doses of sugammadex that would be tested in Part B, and Part B of the trial assessed safety and efficacy parameters.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In Part A, participants were randomized to 1 of 2 intervention groups in a 1:1 ratio to:

- moderate block and reversal with 2 mg/kg sugammadex; or
- deep block and reversal with 4 mg/kg sugammadex

In Part B, participants were randomized to 1 of 3 intervention groups in an overall 1:1:5 ratio to:

- moderate block and reversal with 2 mg/kg sugammadex; or
- moderate  block  and  reversal  with  neostigmine  +  glycopyrrolate  or  atropine  sulfate  [active control]; or
- deep block and reversal with 4 mg/kg sugammadex

Randomization  was  stratified  by  age  (2  to  &lt;6  years,  6  to  &lt;12  years,  and  12  to  &lt;17  years)  and neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) (rocuronium or vecuronium).

Neuromuscular transmission was monitored using the TOF-Watch® SX device and accessories. Moderate NMB was defined as neuromuscular recovery up to at least the reappearance of the second twitch (T2) following the last dose of administered NMBA. Deep NMB was defined as neuromuscular recovery having reached at least 1 to 2 post-tetanic counts (PTC) following the last administered dose of NMBA.

## Study design

This was a randomized, active comparator-controlled, parallel group, multisite, double-blinded trial of sugammadex in pediatric participants from 2 to &lt;17 years of age for the reversal of NMB.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The trial consisted of 2 parts, Part A and Part B. Part A identified the doses of sugammadex that would be investigated in Part B based upon an evaluation of PK, safety, and efficacy endpoints. Part B of the trial assessed safety and efficacy parameters. Part A was conducted in the United States and Part B in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Spain, Turkey and the United States.

In Part A, participants were randomized to 1 of 2 intervention groups in a 1:1 ratio (moderate block and reversal with 2 mg/kg sugammadex or deep block and reversal with 4 mg/kg sugammadex). Once Part A of the study completed, an interim analysis (IA) was performed (prior to enrollment in Part B) to evaluate  PK  and  safety  data  and  was  reviewed  by  a  standing  internal  Data  Monitoring  Committee (siDMC). The safety data was also reviewed by an external data monitoring committee (DMC). Part A PK and efficacy data were also submitted to the FDA for review, upon which the FDA agreed with continued evaluation of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg in Part B.

In Part B, participants were randomized to 1 of 3 intervention groups in a 1:1:5 ratio (moderate block and reversal with either 2 mg/kg sugammadex or 50 mcg/kg neostigmine [active control] or deep block and reversal with 4 mg/kg sugammadex); randomization was stratified by age (2 to &lt;6 years, 6 to &lt;12 years, and 12 to &lt;17 years) and NMBA (rocuronium or vecuronium).

The study design and the study interventions randomization schema are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively.

Note: Approximately 30% of the overall planned sample was to be enrolled in the vecuronium stratum

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

PK samples were only collected in Part A of the study. Samples were planned to be collected at 2, 15, 30, and 60 minutes and 4 to 6 hours following IV bolus administration of sugammadex. Depending on the  length  of  hospital  stay,  an  optional  PK  sample  between  10  to  12  hours  after  sugammadex administration could be obtained. Sugammadex PK parameters were derived using a non-compartmental approach in Phoenix™ (WinNonlin® 6.4).

## Study population /Sample size

Approximately 238 participants were to be enrolled in the study.

Main inclusion criteria were as follows:

Male/female participants between the ages of 2 and &lt;17 years at Visit 2 who met the following key criteria were eligible to participate in the study:

1. Categorized as ASA physical status Class 1, 2, or 3, as determined by the investigator.
2. Had  a  planned  non-emergent  surgical  procedure  or  clinical  situation  (e.g,  intubation)  that required moderate or deep NMB with either rocuronium or vecuronium.
3. Had a planned surgical procedure or clinical situation that would allow objective neuromuscular monitoring techniques to be applied with access to the arm for neuromuscular transmission monitoring.

Participants were excluded from the study if any of the following key criteria were met:

1. Had any clinically significant condition or situation (eg, anatomical malformation that complicates intubation) other than the condition being studied that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the trial evaluations or optimal participation in the trial.
2. Had a neuromuscular disorder that could have affected NMB and/or trial assessments.
3. Dialysis-dependent or had (or was suspected of having) severe renal insufficiency.
4. Had or was suspected of having a family or personal history of malignant hyperthermia.
5. Had received or was planned to receive toremifene and/or fusidic acid via IV administration within 24 hours before or within 24 hours after administration of study treatment.

| Statistical Methods for Key Efficacy/Immunogenicity/ PK Analyses | PK : Separately for each PK parameter, individual values of CL, AUC, Cmax, and Vz , will be natural log-transformed and evaluated with a fixed effects model containing terms dose and age group. At each dose, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of geometric means for each parameter will be provided. Descriptive summary statistics will be provided for PK parameters including AUC, Cmax, dnAUC, dnCmax, CL, Vz and t½. Efficacy : The efficacy hypothesis will be evaluated within Part B by comparing sugammadex to neostigmine in the setting of moderate block using log-transformed time-to-recovery values via Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), adjusting for neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) and age. |
| Statistical Methods for Key Safety Analyses                      | P-values (Tier 1 only) and 95% CI (Tier 1 and Tier 2) will be provided for between- treatment differences in the percentage of participants with events; these analyses will be performed using the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] with NMBA and age group as stratification factors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Interim Analyses                                                 | One interim analysis (IA) will be performed in this study to evaluate PK and safety data. PK and safety data will be reviewed by a standing internal Data Monitoring Committee (siDMC) and safety data will be reviewed by an external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC). This interim analysis is summarized below • Timing: When Part A has been completed, prior to the commencement of enrollment of Part B. • Testing: IA will evaluate PK and safety data. No formal efficacy analyses are planned.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Multiplicity                                                     | No multiplicity adjustment is planned, as there is a single comparison of sugammadex versus neostigmine in the setting of moderate block using 1 endpoint in the primary efficacy hypothesis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Sample Size and Power                                            | The planned sample size is 238 participants, based on minimum safety database requirement. There will be 30 participants per treatment arm (sugammadex and neostigmine) in the setting of moderate block for efficacy analysis. For time to recovery to TOF ≥0.9, the trial has >99% power to demonstrate that sugammadex 2mg/kg is superior to neostigmine at an overall two-sided 5% alpha-level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Results

## Recruitment/ Number analysed

A total of 299 participants were screened and 288 were randomized across 28 global study sites. The main  reasons  for  not randomizing  participants  were  other  and  screen  failure.  Most  (&gt;90%)  of  the randomized participants received study intervention and completed the study as per protocol (Table 3).

One  participant  was  randomized  twice  into  the  study.  After  initial  enrollment,  the  participant  was withdrawn from the study before receiving  study  intervention  as  efficacy  assessments  could  not  be performed. At a later date, this participant was randomized again, assigned a second allocation number, received study intervention, and completed the study intervention.

Of 276 treated participants, 51 received sugammadex 2 mg/kg (18 from Part A, 33 from Part B), 191 received sugammadex 4 mg/kg (22 from Part A, 169 from Part B), and 34 received neostigmine (Part B).

## Baseline data

The  intervention  groups  were  comparably  balanced  for  all  baseline  characteristics  (Table  4).  The percentage of male participants in the overall population was 55.4%. The mean (SD) [range] age of participants  was  7.9  (4.4)  [2  to  16],  years.  Most  participants  were  white  (89.5%),  had  an  eGFR  of &gt;90 mL/min/1.73 m 2  (91.3%) computed using Schwartz formula, and were of ASA Class 1 (63.4%). Similar demographic and baseline characteristics were observed among the intervention groups in each part (A and B) of the study.

## Efficacy results

## Primary efficacy endpoint (Study Part B)

The time to recovery to a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.9 was statistically significantly faster (p&lt;0.0001) in participants dosed with sugammadex 2 mg/kg compared to neostigmine (ratio of geometric means = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.32) (Table 5). The supportive analysis results were consistent with the primary analysis results.

Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, 90.9% (30/33) of participants dosed with sugammadex 2 mg/kg recovered to a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.9 within 3 minutes compared with 8.8% (3/34) of participants in the

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

neostigmine group (Figure 3). Similar results were observed in the intervention groups with combined population from Parts A and B. The time to achieve full reversal was consistent (favouring sugammadex 2  mg/kg  as  compared  to  neostigmine)  across  the  subgroups  of  age,  NMBA,  gender,  and  region; consistency across race subgroups could not be evaluated as the sample size for races other than White was too small (Figure 4).

## Secondary efficacy endpoints (Study Part B)

The time to recovery to a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.8 was faster (nominal p value of &lt;0.0001, not controlled for multiplicity) in participants dosed with sugammadex compared to neostigmine (ratio of geometric means = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.37) (Table 6)

Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, 97.0% (32/33) of participants dosed with sugammadex 2 mg/kg recovered to a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.8 within 3 minutes compared with 26.5% (9/34) of participants in the neostigmine group (Figure 5).

The time to recovery to a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.7 was faster (nominal p value of &lt;0.0001, not controlled for multiplicity) in participants dosed with sugammadex compared to neostigmine (ratio of geometric means = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.41) (Table 7).

Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, 97.0% (32/33) of participants dosed with sugammadex 2 mg/kg recovered to a TOF ratio of ≥ 0.7 within 3 minutes compared with 44.1% (15/34) of participants in the neostigmine group (Figure 6).

## Tertiary/Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints

Delayed recovery was defined as any observation of the TOF ratio to ≥ 0.9 (in the original scale) that was &gt; 3 times the geometric mean recovery time of the TOF ratio to ≥ 0.9 within each treatment group. In combined analysis of Study, Parts A and B, the incidence of delayed recovery was 2.0%, 7.3% and 8.8% in sugammadex 2 mg/kg, sugammadex 4 mg/kg and neostigmine + (glycopyrrolate or atropine) groups,  respectively.  The  most  common  potential  reasons  for  delayed  recovery  were  potential measurement  anomaly  due  to  suboptimal  set-up  with  high  baseline  T1  and  potential  slow  drug administration.

When TOF data were pooled across Parts A and B, the results for time to recovery remained consistent with the primary analysis. Although no comparator existed for the reversal of deep block, sugammadex 4 mg/kg achieved rapid and complete reversal in this setting (Table 8).

## Pharmacokinetic results

Pharmacokinetic  data  were  only  collected  in  Study  Part  A.  The  mean  (±  SE)  plasma  sugammadex concentration-time profiles following a single IV dose of 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg sugammadex are shown in Figure 7. Given the critical interval over which drug effect is expected, a truncated postdose duration of 0 to 60 minutes shown separately in Figure 8.

In order to confirm the assumptions that dose-linearity and proportionality are conserved between the pediatric populations, the observed concentration-time data were dose-normalized with no appreciable differences identified in each of the age categories. CL and Vz and Vss relationships indicate that CL increased monotonically with age, with a similar trend for volume of distribution (Table 9, Table 10 and Table 11). Body weight-normalized CL and volume of distribution in children (&lt;12 years of age) was higher than those in adolescents and increased with decreasing age. Consequently, the elimination halflife  was  generally  comparable  across  all  age  cohorts.  Body  weight-normalized  CL  and  volume  of distribution as well as elimination half-life of sugammadex for each age category were largely similar at both sugammadex doses, confirming dose linearity.

Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable row and column.

A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title, after rounding.

In all, 13 of 276 (4.7%) participants experienced an AE that was determined by the investigator to be related to the study drug (Table 14). Across all treatment groups, bradycardia was the most frequently reported AE considered to be drug-related (10 out of 13 participants). There were no serious drugrelated AEs and no subject discontinued due to a drug-related AE.

Events of clinical interest (ECI) for this trial included the following:

- hypersensitivity and/or anaphylaxis
- clinically relevant bradycardia defined as bradycardia necessitating intervention, as determined by investigator judgment
- drug-induced liver injury

Clinically relevant bradycardia within 7 days post-treatment was reported in 1 of 51 (2.0%), 3 of 191 (1.6%)  and  2  of  34  (5.9%)  participants  in  sugammadex  2  mg/kg,  sugammadex  4  mg/kg  and neostigmine + (glycopyrrolate or atropine) group, respectively. No cases of hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis or potential drug-induced liver injury was reported at any time point.

## 2.3.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

Bridion is approved for routine reversal of rocuronium-induced blockade in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years. The recommended dosing time in children and adolescents (2-17 years) is at reappearance of T2 and the recommended dose is 2 mg/kg. The recommended posology is based on one clinical study in the paediatric population. In adults, the recommended dose for routine NMB reversal is 4 mg/kg if recovery  has  reached  at  least  1-2  post-tetanic  counts  following  rocuronium  or  vecuronium  induced blockade or 2 mg/kg if spontaneous recovery has occurred up to at least the reappearance of T2 following rocuronium or vecuronium induced blockade. In addition, if there is a clinical need for immediate reversal following administration of rocuronium a dose of 16 mg/kg sugammadex is recommended in adults. Immediate  reversal  in  children  and  adolescents  has  not  been  investigated  and  is  therefore  not recommended until further data become available.

In study MK-8616-089, the results for the primary efficacy endpoint (time to recovery to a TOF ratio of ≥0.9) indicate that the reversal of moderate NMB was faster following sugammadex 2 mg/kg (geometric mean: 1.6 minutes) compared with neostigmine (geometric mean: 7.5 minutes). The difference between the treatments was statistically significant and clinically meaningful. Pre-specified subgroup analyses and results for secondary and tertiary efficacy endpoints supported the primary analysis.

Efficacy data for sugammadex 4 mg/kg that were collected in 191 paediatric patients are relevant new information, although no comparator existed for reversal of deep block. In addition, data on the use for reversal of vecuronium-induced blockade in children and adolescents is valuable new information. The median time (range) to TOF ratio ≥0.9 wa s 1.7 (0.4; 118.1) minutes in patients with deep block. Delayed recovery was observed in 14 of 191 subjects (7.3%). Efficacy data for sugammadex 2 mg/kg (n = 33 in Part B) support the approved posology for reversal of moderate block in paediatric patients.

PK data were collected in 18 and 22 paediatric patients in sugammadex 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg groups, respectively. Two subjects in 4 mg/kg group had incomplete PK sampling and they were excluded from analysis of some PK parameters, which is acceptable. Overall, the PK data supported the conclusion of dose proportional increase in exposure over the dose range 2 to 4 mg/kg in paediatric subjects. This is in line with adult PK data.

AEs were reported in majority of patients, which is expected given the study population (patients with surgical procedure or clinical situation - e.g. intubation - that required moderate or deep NMB). The most common  reported  AE  was  procedural  pain  (reported  in  more  than  50%  of  patients),  followed  by procedural or other nausea and vomiting. Of more interest are the drug-related AEs that were reported in 7.8%, 2.6% and 11.8% of patients in sugammadex 2 mg/kg, sugammadex 4 mg/kg and neostigmine + (glycopyrrolate or atropine) group, respectively, and cases of clinically relevant bradycardia (prespecified  event  of  clinical  interest)  that  were  reported  in  2.0%,  1.6%  and  5.9%  of  patients  in sugammadex 2 mg/kg, sugammadex 4 mg/kg and neostigmine + (glycopyrrolate or atropine) group, respectively. Although the safety data are limited, they do not suggest dose-dependent or new safety

concerns in paediatric patients after a bolus IV dose of 4 mg/kg sugammadex for reversal of a deep NMB.
