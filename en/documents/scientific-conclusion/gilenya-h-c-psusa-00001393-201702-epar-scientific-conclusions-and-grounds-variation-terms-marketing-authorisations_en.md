## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for fingolimod, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Based on 48 cases (50 events), including 9 fatal cases, a potential link between fingolimod treatment and polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia (PVA) incidence was identified. In 17 cases, temporal relationship is strongly suggested. On the other hand, analysis of fatal cases showed potential risk factors such as cardiac underlying conditions. Overall, the PRAC recommended that the contra-indications section of the SmPC should be updated to include cardiac underlying conditions.

Based on a number of cases of malignant melanoma (MM), Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and Merkel cell carcinoma, the PRAC recommended that a warning should be added to sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to alert prescribers of the possible occurrence of Merkel cell carcinoma, SCC and MM, including cautions regarding exposure to sunlight without protection, regarding concomitant phototherapy with UV-B-radiation or PUVA-photochemotherapy and specific screening of the skin to be performed every six to 12 months.

Following the number of fatal outcome of cryptococcal meningitis (30 cases cumulatively including 9 with fatal outcome), the PRAC recommended that the SmPC should be updated to inform on the occurrence of fatal cases.

Infections, in particular opportunistic infection and cancer risk are due to the immunosuppressive effect of fingolimod, therefore the PRAC recommended that a warning should be included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to inform of the consequences of the immunosuppressive effect and that increased risks appear to be related to long term treatment with fingolimod and in patients that have history of immunosuppressive treatments or other risk factors that could increase this risk (for example, sun exposure, known active infections or malignancies).

The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for fingolimod the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing fingolimod is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information.

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
