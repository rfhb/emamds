ANNEX I SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions.

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Zinbryta 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe Zinbryta 150 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen

2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each pre-filled syringe contains 150 mg of daclizumab beta in 1 mL solution for injection. Each pre-filled pen contains a pre-filled syringe, containing 150 mg of daclizumab beta in 1 mL solution for injection. Daclizumab beta is produced in a mammalian cell line (NS0) by recombinant DNA technology. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection (injection). Colourless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly opalescent liquid with pH 6. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Zinbryta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) who have had an inadequate response to at least two disease modifying therapies (DMTs) and for whom treatment with any other DMT is contraindicated or otherwise unsuitable (see section 4.4). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of multiple sclerosis. Posology The recommended dose of Zinbryta is 150 mg injected subcutaneously once a month. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

In case a dose is missed and it is within 2 weeks of the missed dose, patients should be instructed to inject without delay their missed dose and then remain on their original monthly dosing schedule.

If a dose is missed and it is more than 2 weeks from the missed dose, patients should skip the missed dose, wait until their next scheduled dose, and then remain on their original monthly dosing schedule.

Only one dose should be administered at a time to make up for a missed dose.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Special populations

## Elderly population

There was limited exposure in patients over 55 years of age in clinical studies with daclizumab beta. It has not been determined whether these patients respond differently compared with younger patients.

## Renal impairment

Daclizumab beta has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. As renal excretion is not a major route of elimination, no dose adjustments are considered necessary (see section 5.2).

## Hepatic impairment

Daclizumab beta has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Zinbryta is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Zinbryta in children and adolescents below 18 years have not been established. No data are available. Method of administration Zinbryta is for subcutaneous use. It is recommended that patients should be trained in the proper technique for self-administering subcutaneous injection using the pre-filled syringe/pre-filled pen. The usual sites for subcutaneous injection include the thigh, abdomen, and back of the upper arm. Zinbryta is provided with the needle pre-attached. Pre-filled syringes/Pre-filled pens contain a single dose only and should be discarded after use. Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product Once removed from the refrigerator, Zinbryta should be allowed to warm to room temperature (20°C-30°C) (about 30 minutes) prior to injection. External heat sources such as hot water must not be used to warm Zinbryta. This medicinal product should not be used if: · the syringe/pen is cracked or broken · the solution is cloudy or you can see particles floating in it · the solution is any other colour than colourless to slightly yellow · the pen has been dropped or is visibly damaged. 4.3 Contraindications Zinbryta is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions) to all forms of daclizumab or to any of the excipients in Zinbryta (see section 6.1). Medicinal product no longer authorised

Pre-existing hepatic disease or hepatic impairment (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use

## Hepatic injury

Due to the risk of hepatic injury, the use of Zinbryta is restricted (see section 4.1). Serious hepatic injury including elevations of serum transaminases and fatal cases of autoimmune hepatitis and fulminant liver failure have occurred in patients treated with Zinbryta (see section 4.8). Cases occurred early after treatment initiation, in patients having received repeated treatment courses and several months after discontinuation.

Prior to treatment initiation with Zinbryta, serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels should be obtained, and patients should be screened  for Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV). Treatment initiation is not recommended in patients with ALT or AST ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). For patients who test positive for HBV or HCV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of HBV or HCV is recommended. Treatment initiation is not recommended in patients with history of concurrent autoimmune conditions other than multiple sclerosis. Patient serum transaminase and total bilirubin levels should be monitored at least monthly and as close as possible before each administration, and more frequently as clinically indicated during treatment and up to 6 months after the last dose of Zinbryta. Treatment discontinuation is recommended in patients who reach ALT or AST &gt;3 times the ULN regardless of bilirubin levels. Patients should be informed about the risk of hepatic injury, the need for periodic monitoring and warned about signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction. If a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g. unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine), it is recommended to promptly measure serum transaminases, discontinue treatment with Zinbryta, as appropriate, and promptly refer the patient to a hepatologist. Treatment discontinuation should be considered if an adequate response has not been achieved or the patient fails to follow the requirement for scheduled liver test monitoring. Caution should be exercised when administering medicinal products of known hepatotoxic potential, including non-prescription products and herbal supplements, concomitantly with Zinbryta (see section 4.5). Refer to section below, 'Educational Guidance', for details of the Hepatic Risk Management Guide for Physicians and Patient Card that are recommended for use with this medicine. Educational guidance All physicians who intend to prescribe Zinbryta must ensure they are familiar with the Hepatic Risk Management Guide for Physicians for this medicinal product. The physician should discuss the risk of hepatic injury with patients and provide them with a Patient Card. Medicinal product no longer authorised

The Card informs patients of the risk of serious hepatic injury, and its possible symptoms, so that they are aware of situations in which they should contact a healthcare professional in a timely manner. In addition, the Card explains the need for monitoring of liver function and educates the patient on the importance of adherence to their monthly blood tests.

## Skin reactions

Skin reactions, some serious (e.g. exfoliative rash or dermatitis, toxic skin eruption), have been reported with Zinbryta. Skin reactions generally resolved with standard care, including treatment with topical or systemic steroids. If a patient develops a diffuse or highly inflammatory rash, referral to a dermatologist and discontinuation of Zinbryta may be required (see section 4.8).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Depression

Zinbryta should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders. Patients treated with Zinbryta should be advised to report any symptoms of new or worsening depression, and/or suicidal ideation immediately to the prescribing physician. If a patient develops severe depression, and/or suicidal ideation, discontinuation of Zinbryta should be considered (see section 4.8).

## Infections

Infections, some serious (e.g. pneumonia and bronchitis), have been reported with Zinbryta. If serious infection develops, it could be necessary to withhold treatment with Zinbryta until the infection resolves.

Tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients treated with Zinbryta. In patients who have had tuberculosis or who live in endemic areas of the disease, screening for active tuberculosis should be performed before starting treatment, and patients should be monitored during treatment. In patients with severe active infection, a delay in initiation of Zinbryta therapy should be considered (see section 4.8). Zinbryta has not been studied in patients with immunodeficiency syndromes. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia has been reported in patients treated with Zinbryta which resolved with standard treatment and discontinuation of Zinbryta. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (e.g. pallor, fatigue, dark urine, jaundice, shortness of breath), consider referring to a specialist and discontinuing Zinbryta (see section 4.8). Gastrointestinal disorders Colitis has been reported with Zinbryta. The colitis improved with discontinuation of Zinbryta and standard treatment. Referring patients who develop symptoms of colitis (e.g. abdominal pain, fever, prolonged diarrhoea) to a specialist is advisable (see section 4.8). Lymphopenia When observed during Zinbryta clinical studies, lymphopenia was mostly mild to moderate (≥ 500/mm 3 ). Sustained severe lymphopenia (&lt; 500/mm 3 ), was not observed in clinical studies with Zinbryta.  However, as a precaution, monitoring of complete blood count is recommended every 3 months. The risk of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) associated to the treatment with Zinbryta has not been established. Excipient related considerations This medicinal product contains 0.14 mmol sodium per dose. It is essentially 'sodium-free' and can be used by patients on a sodium-restricted diet. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction

Zinbryta is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic enzymes or renal elimination. There is limited data on concomitant use of Zinbryta with MS symptomatic therapies.

## Hepatic injury

Cases of hepatic injury have occurred in patients taking Zinbryta with other hepatotoxic drugs, although the role of these medicinal products is uncertain. Caution is recommended when

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administering medicinal products of known hepatotoxic potential including non-prescription products and herbal supplements concomitantly with Zinbryta (see section 4.4).

## Immunisations

The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during treatment with Zinbryta has not been studied. Vaccination with live vaccines is not advised during treatment and up to 4 months after discontinuation.

In a clinical study, patients (n=90) on long-term treatment with Zinbryta mounted appropriate immune responses to an inactivated trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. The magnitude of the immune response to the seasonal influenza vaccine, and proportion of patients with seroconversion and seroprotection were consistent with those observed in healthy volunteer populations. Patients on Zinbryta may receive non-live vaccines.

In the placebo-controlled study (the SELECT study), 417 patients received Zinbryta (150 mg, n=208; 300 mg, n=209; every 4 weeks) for up to 1 year. In the active-controlled study (the DECIDE study), 919 patients received Zinbryta (150 mg, every 4 weeks) and 922 patients received interferon beta-1a intramuscular, (30 microgram weekly) for a minimum of 2 years and up to 3 years.

4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are limited data from the use of Zinbryta in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reprotoxicity (see section 5.3). Zinbryta should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Breast-feeding Available toxicology data in lactating cynomolgus monkeys have shown excretion of daclizumab beta in milk (for details see section 5.3). It is not known whether Zinbryta is secreted in human milk. Although human IgG is secreted into human milk, published data suggest that antibodies in breast milk do not enter the neonatal and infant circulations in substantial amounts. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. If a woman wishes to breast-feed during treatment with Zinbryta, the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and of therapy to the woman should be considered. Fertility No impact on male or female fertility as assessed by fertility indices was detected in animal studies (see section 5.3). There are no data on the effects of Zinbryta on human fertility. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Zinbryta has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile Medicinal product no longer authorised

The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  leading  to  discontinuation  in  patients  treated  with Zinbryta  were  hepatic  reactions,  including  elevations  of  serum  transaminases  (5%),  and  cutaneous reactions (4%) (see section 4.4).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The most common adverse reactions reported for Zinbryta were rash, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), depression, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, oropharyngeal pain, and lymphadenopathy.

*Observed with a ≥2% higher incidence than placebo †Observed with a ≥2% higher incidence than interferon beta-1a (intramuscular) Description of selected adverse reactions Hepatic injury Serious hepatic injury, including fatal cases of autoimmune hepatitis and fulminant liver failure have occurred in patients treated with Zinbryta. Serious reactions, including autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis and jaundice, were observed in 1.7% of patients in clinical trials. In clinical studies, serum transaminase elevations occurred at any time during treatment and up to 6 months after the last dose of Zinbryta. Most patients had mild elevations that were below or up to 3 x ULN and resolved spontaneously. In clinical trials, an increased incidence of elevations of ALT or AST was reported more frequently in Zinbryta-treated patients compared to placebo or interferon beta1a (intramuscular). The incidence of discontinuation due to medicine related hepatic disorders was 5% in Zinbryta-treated patients and 4% in interferon beta-1a (intramuscular). Table 2. Cumulative incidences of peak ALT or AST increase (based on laboratory data) observed in clinical trials Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Skin reactions

In clinical studies Zinbryta increased the incidence of skin reactions [18% vs 13% (placebo); 37% vs 19% (interferon beta-1a (intramuscular))] and serious skin reactions [&lt;1% vs 0% (placebo); 2% vs &lt;1% (interferon beta-1a (intramuscular))] compared to placebo and interferon beta-1a (intramuscular).

The most common skin reactions were rash, dermatitis, and eczema. The majority of patients had skin reactions that were mild or moderate in severity. Discontinuation due to skin reactions was 4% in Zinbryta-treated patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Depression

In clinical studies, Zinbryta increased the incidence of depression [5% vs 1% (placebo); 8% vs 6% (interferon beta-1a (intramuscular))]; the incidence of serious reactions of depression was &lt;1% with Zinbryta.

## Infections

In clinical studies, Zinbryta increased the incidence of infections [50% vs 44% (placebo) and 65% vs 57% (interferon beta-1a (intramuscular))] and serious infections [3% vs 0% (placebo); 4% vs 2% (interferon beta-1a (intramuscular))] compared to placebo and interferon beta-1a (intramuscular). The most common types of infections were upper respiratory tract infections and viral infections.  The median duration was similar between the treatment groups. The rate of infections and serious infections did not increase over time. The majority of patients with infections continued on treatment with Zinbryta. Discontinuation of Zinbryta due to infections was &lt;1%.

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia was reported in &lt; 1% of patients treated with Zinbryta in clinical studies. Gastrointestinal disorders An increased incidence of serious colitis (&lt;1%) was reported in patients treated with Zinbryta in clinical studies. Lymphadenopathy In clinical studies, Zinbryta increased the incidence of lymphadenopathy, with onset occurring throughout the treatment period. Discontinuation due to lymphadenopathy was &lt;1% in Zinbryta-treated patients. The majority of patients with lymphadenopathy continued on treatment with Zinbryta, and the majority of cases resolved within 3 months. Immunogenicity In the DECIDE study (see section 5.1), patients were tested for anti-drug (daclizumab beta) antibodies at week 4 and approximately every 3 months thereafter. Treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralising antibodies were observed in 19% (175/913) and 8% (71/913) of study patients, respectively. The majority of the treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies responses were transient (12% [110/913]) and the remaining minority (7% [65/913]) were persistent. Among the evaluable patients, the majority of treatment-emergent neutralising antibody responses were transient (6% [56 of 913]) and 2% of patients (15 of 913) had persistent responses. Treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralising antibodies responses predominantly occurred during the first year of treatment and their frequency declined with continued Zinbryta treatment. In patients with neutralising antibodies, daclizumab beta clearance was increased on average by 19% (see section 5.2). There was no apparent correlation of anti-drug antibodies or neutralising antibodies development to clinical response, adverse reactions, or pharmacodynamic profile of daclizumab beta.

## 4.9 Overdose

Reported experience with overdose is limited. The safety of doses above 300 mg administered subcutaneously and 400 mg intravenously have not been evaluated. Doses up to this level were well tolerated with no evidence of acute toxicity. Potential adverse reactions beyond this level are expected to be consistent with the safety profile for daclizumab beta in MS patients.

## Management

In case of overdose, patients may require medical attention and appropriate supportive treatment should be given.

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC01

The efficacy of Zinbryta was demonstrated in two studies (SELECT and DECIDE) in patients with RMS. The SELECT study was double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, with either Zinbryta 150 mg (n=208), or 300 mg (n=209) versus placebo (n=204) every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. The DECIDE study was double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled with Zinbryta 150 mg every 4 weeks (n=919) versus interferon beta-1a (intramuscular) 30 micrograms weekly (n=922), for a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 3 years (96 to 144 weeks). The study designs and baseline characteristics are presented in Table 3.

Mechanism of action Daclizumab beta is a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to CD25 (IL-2Rα), and prevents IL-2 binding to CD25. Daclizumab beta modulates IL-2 signalling by blocking CD25dependent, high-affinity IL-2 receptor signalling, resulting in higher levels of IL-2 available for signalling through the intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor.  Key effects of this IL-2 pathway modulation potentially related to the therapeutic effects of daclizumab beta in MS include selective antagonism of activated T-cell responses, and expansion of immunoregulatory CD56 bright natural killer (NK) cells, which have been shown to selectively decrease activated T-cells. Together, these immunomodulatory effects of daclizumab beta are believed to reduce CNS pathology in MS and thereby reduce the occurrence of relapses and disability progression. Pharmacodynamic effects In clinical studies, the pharmacodynamic effects of Zinbryta 150 mg administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks were consistent with modulation of IL-2 signalling as evidenced by the rapid and sustained saturation of the target CD25 receptors on circulating T-cells and a sustained approximately 2-fold increase in serum IL-2 concentration. In addition, an increase in CD56 bright NK cells and a decrease in regulatory T-cells (defined as CD4 + CD127 low FoxP3 + T-cells) was observed within 2 weeks after the first dose, with a sustained 5-fold increase in CD56 bright NK cells above baseline and an approximately 60% decrease in regulatory T-cells in the treatment phase, with a return to baseline levels approximately 20-24 weeks after the last dose. During Zinbryta treatment, mean cell counts for the major immune subsets (T, B, and NK cells) remained within normal ranges; total lymphocyte, T and B cell counts decreased on average ≤10% from baseline during the first year of treatment. Total lymphocyte counts returned to baseline levels approximately 8-12 weeks after the last dose of Zinbryta (150mg). Total lymphocyte counts &lt;0.8x10 9 cells/L ([Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events - CTCAE] Grade 2; at least one measurement) occurred in 4% of placebo-treated and 5% of Zinbryta-treated patients in the SELECT study, and 9% of the interferon beta-1a (intramuscular)-treated and 8% of Zinbryta-treated patients in the DECIDE study. Total NK cell counts increased approximately 1.5-fold as a result of the change in CD56 bright NK cells. Clinical efficacy and safety Medicinal product no longer authorised

Results for the SELECT study are shown in Table 4. Treatment with Zinbryta 150 mg every 4 weeks versus placebo significantly reduced the annualised relapse rate (ARR) and risk of relapse compared to placebo. In addition, there was a statistically significant effect on 24 week confirmed disability progression in Zinbryta treated patients with a hazard ratio 0.24  [95% CI: 0.09, 0.63]. The 300 mg dose did not provide additional benefit over the 150 mg dose. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Table 5 and Figures 1-2 show the results for the DECIDE study. Zinbryta significantly reduced the ARR and the risk of relapse, compared to interferon beta-1a (intramuscular)-treated patients. In addition, there was a statistically significant effect on 24 week confirmed disability progression in Zinbryta treated patients with a hazard ratio 0.73  [95%  CI: 0.55, 0.98]. At week 96, Zinbryta demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions, the number of new T1 Gd-enhancing lesions and the mean number of new T1 hypointense lesions. In addition, Zinbryta reduced clinically meaningful worsening in the patientreported physical impact of MS (≥7.5 point worsening from baseline to week 96 in the MSIS-29 physical score) compared to interferon beta-1a (intramuscular).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Subgroup analyses of the SELECT and DECIDE studies demonstrated a consistent effect of Zinbryta compared to placebo and interferon beta-1a (intramuscular) across subgroups defined by demographic and MS disease characteristics.  In the DECIDE study subgroup analysis, there was a statistically significant reduction observed compared to interferon beta-1a (intramuscular) on ARR and the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions across subgroups (gender, age, prior MS DMT therapy, and disease activity levels).

Although the effect on disability progression was mainly seen in patients with baseline EDSS &lt; 3.5, evidence of efficacy was shown in patients with relapsing secondary progressive MS (SPMS) as defined by baseline EDSS ≥ 3.5 and at least one of the three: confirmed 24 week worsening of EDSS, or ≥ 20% decline on Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW), or, ≥ 20% decline on 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT).

Efficacy in patients with highly active disease Highly active disease was defined as follows: · Patients with 2 or more relapses in 1 year, and with 1 or more Gd-enhancing lesions on brain MRI, or · Patients who had failed to respond to a full and adequate course (at least 1 year) of prior DMT treatment, having had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and at least 9 T2 hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gd-enhancing lesion, or having an unchanged or increased relapse rate in the prior year as compared to the previous 2 years. Clinical trial data from the DECIDE study demonstrated consistent treatment effects in the highly active disease subgroup. Compared with interferon beta-1a intramuscular (n=440), Zinbryta (n=404) led to reductions on ARR (rate ratio 0.52 [95% CI: 0.42, 0.64], p&lt;0.0001), number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions (lesion mean ratio 0.46 [95% CI: 0.37, 0.57], p&lt;0.0001), and 24 weeks confirmed disability progression (hazard ratio 0.60 [95% CI: 0.40, 0.89], p=0.012).

## 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties

Daclizumab beta pharmacokinetics are well described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination.

## Absorption

Following subcutaneous administration of daclizumab beta, the median time to reach maximum serum concentrations (Tmax) ranged from 5 to 7 days. The absolute bioavailability of daclizumab beta 150 mg subcutaneously administered was approximately 90% based on a cross-study population pharmacokinetic analysis of subcutaneous and intravenous dosing.

Distribution Following subcutaneous administration of daclizumab beta 150 mg every 4 weeks, steady-state serum daclizumab beta concentrations were achieved by the 4th dose and daclizumab beta accumulated to a level approximately 2.5-fold compared to a single dose. At steady state, daclizumab beta mean maximum serum concentration (Cmax), minimum serum concentration (Cmin) and area under the serum concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUCtau) values were approximately 30 micrograms/mL, 15 micrograms/mL and 640  day*micrograms/mL, respectively, with inter-patient variability (% CV) of approximately 40%. Based on the cross-study population pharmacokinetic analysis, the steady-state volume of distribution of daclizumab beta is 6.34 L in a patient with a body weight of 68 kg (approximate median of evaluated patients). This small volume of distribution indicates that daclizumab beta is primarily confined to the vascular and interstitial spaces. Biotransformation The exact metabolic pathway for daclizumab beta has not been characterised. As an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, daclizumab beta is expected to undergo catabolism to peptides and amino acids in the same manner as endogenous IgG. Daclizumab beta is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic enzymes such as CYP isoenzymes (see section 4.5). Elimination As an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, daclizumab beta is not expected to undergo renal elimination. Based on the cross-study population pharmacokinetic analysis, the clearance of daclizumab beta is 0.212 L/day with a terminal half-life value of approximately 21 days. Daclizumab beta clearance in patients who developed neutralising antibodies was, on average, 19% higher (see section 4.8 Immunogenicity). Linearity/non-linearity Consistent with results from individual studies, a cross-study population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that daclizumab beta exposure is more than dose-proportional in the 50 mg to 100 mg subcutaneous dose range and is dose proportional in the 100 mg to 300 mg subcutaneous dose range. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship(s) Medicinal product no longer authorised

Within the studied regimens of daclizumab beta 150 mg and 300 mg administered subcutaneous every 4 weeks in MS patients, there was no clear relationship between daclizumab beta exposure and clinical efficacy endpoints (ARR, T2 lesions and Gd-enhancing lesions) or safety endpoints of interest (serious infection status, moderate or severe cutaneous adverse reaction, and AST/ALT &gt; 5 times the ULN).

## Special populations

## Renal or hepatic impairment

No studies were conducted to evaluate daclizumab beta pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Daclizumab beta is not expected to undergo renal elimination or metabolism by hepatic enzymes (see section 4.2).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Weight

Based on the cross-study population pharmacokinetic analysis, body weight accounted for less than 40% of the inter-patient variability in daclizumab beta clearance. No meaningful differences in clinical efficacy or safety were observed among the subgroups of MS patients by weight quartile in the DECIDE study.

## Age and gender

Based on the cross-study population pharmacokinetic analysis, daclizumab beta pharmacokinetics were not influenced by age (range: 18 to 66 years; n=1670) or gender (n = 567 males and 1103 females).

A dose dependent increase in incidence of microglial aggregates above background was observed in the brain and spinal cord of monkeys treated with ≥35 mg/kg, (AUC 27 times higher than the clinical dose). Following a recovery period of up to 12 weeks, there was evidence of reversibility. Microglial aggregates in monkeys did not increase in incidence or severity with increased duration of dosing and were not associated with neuronal damage or neurobehavioral effects. A small subset of microglial aggregates were associated with microhaemorrhage but with no evident functional sequelae in monkeys.

Race No pharmacokinetic differences were observed between Japanese and Caucasian healthy volunteers. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Preclinical safety studies were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys due to species specificity of daclizumab beta binding only to human or primate CD25. Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies with daclizumab beta have not been conducted.  In two 9 month studies in monkeys there were no pre-neoplastic or neoplastic tissue observed. Mutagenesis Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted. Reproductive toxicity Daclizumab beta did not affect reproductive capacity in female and male cynomolgus monkeys (AUC in females and males up to 85 and 100 times higher than the exposure at the clinical dose respectively). There was no effect on foetal development and no evidence of teratogenicity. Daclizumab beta had no effect on peri- and post-natal development from birth to up to 6 months in the offspring. Exposures (AUC) in these studies ranged from 55 to 140 times that observed with the clinical dose.  Daclizumab beta was detected in the milk of 11/14 lactating monkeys at levels that were &lt;0.122% of the maternal serum levels, with no adverse reactions observed in the off-spring. Toxicology In two 9 month studies conducted in cynomolgus monkeys daclizumab beta was subcutaneously administered at bi-weekly doses of 10-200 mg/kg. Chronic administration of daclizumab beta at all doses increased the incidence of skin findings (compared to those observed in control animals). These findings (dry, red raised patchy areas of the skin, as compared to controls, that correlated microscopically with acanthosis/hyperkeratosis and subacute to chronic inflammation) were characterised predominantly as mild to moderate, with one case assessed as severe. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In vitro investigative studies suggest that microglial aggregates are not due to a direct effect of daclizumab beta on microglial cells but are likely to be attributable to an increase in local IL-2 bioavailability.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The clinical relevance of microglial aggregates is unknown, however no deleterious neurologic effects attributed to the microscopic change have been observed in monkeys.

This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 for how to report side effects.

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important information for you. In addition to this leaflet you will be given a Patient Card by your doctor. This has important safety information that you need to know before and during treatment with Zinbryta. · Keep this leaflet and the Patient Card. You may need to read them again. Keep the leaflet and Card with you during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of Zinbryta, since side effects may occur even after you have stopped treatment. · If you have any further questions, ask your doctor. · This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. · If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. What is in this leaflet 1. What Zinbryta is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you use Zinbryta 3. How to use Zinbryta 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Zinbryta 6. Contents of the pack and other information 7. Instructions for injecting Zinbryta 1. What Zinbryta is and what it is used for The active substance in Zinbryta is daclizumab beta. This is a type of medicine called a monoclonal antibody. What Zinbryta is used for Zinbryta is used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults who have failed to respond despite therapy with at least two MS treatment and who cannot be given other treatments. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In MS, the body's immune system causes inflammation which damages the protective sheath (called myelin) around the nerves in the central nervous system (including the brain and spinal cord). This loss of myelin is called demyelination. This stops nerves from working properly.

People with relapsing MS have repeated attacks (relapses) of symptoms caused by their nerves not working properly. These symptoms vary from patient to patient but usually involve problems such as difficulty with walking, vision and balance.

Symptoms may disappear completely after the relapse is over but, over time, some problems may remain between relapses and interfere with daily activities.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## How Zinbryta works

Zinbryta works by stopping the body's immune system from damaging your brain and spinal cord. This can help to reduce the number of relapses that you have and slow down the disabling effects of MS. Treatment with Zinbryta can help to prevent you from getting worse, although it will not cure MS. Your doctor will decide whether Zinbryta is the right medicine for you.

## 2. What you need to know before you use Zinbryta

## Do not use Zinbryta

-if you have previously had a serious allergic reaction to any form of daclizumab, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6. -if you have liver problems. Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor before using Zinbryta: -if you have any other autoimmune disorders in addition to MS -if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines and herbal supplements.  Your doctor will evaluate if any medicines or supplements you are taking have liver side effects and whether you should continue these medicines while taking Zinbryta -if you have depression or have had it in the past. -if you have a serious infection , such as pneumonia. -if you have ever had tuberculosis (also called TB) or live in a region where TB infections are common, you may be at greater risk of TB. You may be tested for TB before starting Zinbryta and monitored during treatment. Possible liver problems Zinbryta may cause serious liver problems that may be life-threatening or result in death.  Serious liver problems can occur both early after starting treatment with Zinbryta, any time during treatment and several months after discontinuing treatment. Even if you have had no previous liver problems, your doctor will carry out blood tests to test your liver function. You will need: -a blood test before starting treatment to check your liver function and if you have hepatitis B and C. If your blood test shows that you have some liver problems, your doctor will decide whether to start Zinbryta -at least monthly blood tests during treatment, as close as possible before each dose of Zinbryta, and more often if your doctor decides this is necessary -tests for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. Side effects may occur even after stopping treatment (see serious side effects in section 4). It is very important that you have these regular blood tests. If you do not not undergo your scheduled blood tests your doctor may decide to stop treatment with Zinbryta. Medicinal product no longer authorised

You will be given a Patient Card with further information about the things to watch out for while taking Zinbryta. Keep this Card with you during treatment and for 6 months afterwards.

ANNEX IV SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS OF THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION(S) Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for daclizumab beta, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

## Sarcoidosis

Twelve cases of sarcoidosis confirmed by health-care professionals were reported from clinical trials cumulatively. No risk factors or alternative aetiology have been reported in any of these cases. There is also a plausible mechanism of action for the development of sarcoidosis due to the immunomodulatory effects of daclizumab beta and involvement of daclizumab beta in the origin of other immune-mediated events. The causal relationship between daclizumab beta and sarcoidosis is considered possible.

Colitis Four new serious cases of colitis confirmed by health-care professionals have been received during this period. Cumulatively, 24 cases of colitis have been retrieved from clinical trials. There is a plausible mechanism of action for the development of this colitis due to immunomodulatory properties of daclizumab beta and involvement of daclizumab beta in the origin of other immune-mediated events. The causal relationship between daclizumab beta and colitis is possible. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been reviewed to add the adverse reaction sarcoidosis with a frequency uncommon and the adverse reaction colitis with a frequency common. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) On the basis of the scientific conclusions for daclizumab beta the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing daclizumab beta is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
