Section 4.8 of the SPC and section 4 of the PL have been updated accordingly. |

The pathogenesis of this chronic neuropathy seems to differ from that of Guillain Barre Syndrome. The CHMP concluded that based on the epidemiological data and on the mechanism of action of efalizumab, a causal relationship between efalizumab and inflammatory neuropathies cannot be excluded. The following warning was added to section 4.4 and reflected in section 4.8 and Patient Leaflet. 'Inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy' 'Cases of inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy have been observed in patients receiving Raptiva. Patients have recovered after discontinuation of Raptiva, therefore Raptiva should be stopped following the diagnosis of inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy.'   |

| II/0015 | product Update of sections 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use) and 4.8 (Undesirable effects) of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) as requested by CHMP further to the assessment of PSUR4. The MAH also applied for minor changes in Package Leaflet (PL) section 4 and an update of the contact details of some local representatives. In addition the Bulgarian and Romanian local representatives were included. The Product Information was also updated in accordance to QRD templates version 7.2. | no 24/01/2007 23/02/2007 | SPC, PL  | Infections: The cases of infections reported during the PSUR 4 covered period were analysed by the MAH, the MAH concluded that the SPC should be amended for the sections on Warnings as well as on Undesirable effects. The CHMP agreed. Consequently in section 4.4 'Special warnings and precautions for use' the following sentence has been amended as follows: 'Raptiva is a selective immunosuppressor that alters T-lymphocyte function and may affect host defences against infections. It has the potential to increase the risk or the severity of infections, e.g. tuberculous pneumonia, and reactivate latent, chronic infections. Patients developing an infection during treatment with Raptiva should be monitored                                                                                  |

In a patient with history of clinically significant recurring infections, Raptiva should be used with caution.' 'Severe infections' was also added to the table in section 4.8 of the SPC. This reaction was placed under SOC 'infections and infestations' with frequency 'not known'. Lymphoproliferative disorders : Although it is still unclear whether or not the use of efalizumab is associated with an increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders in psoriasis patient, the CHMP proposed to reword the warning as follows: \"It is not yet known whether or not Raptiva can increase the risk of lymphoproliferative disorders or other malignancies in psoriasis patients. Raptiva should be discontinued if a malignancy develops while the patient is on treatment.\" Arthritis The MAH has reworded section 4.4 regarding arthritis as requested: Cases of arthritis have been observed during treatment or after discontinuation of Raptiva. It is recommended to discontinue Raptiva if arthritis occurs during treatment.   |

| II/0010   | product The variation relates to an update of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) following the assessment of the Periodic Safety Update Report 2 (PSUR) covering the period from 27 October 2004 to 26 April 2005. Section 4.4 of the SPC is updated to include or strengthen warnings regarding infections, immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia, vaccinations and section 4.8 is updated to include immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia, interstitial pneumonitis, arthritis, and erythema multiform and to revise the wording on hypersensitivity. Sections 2 and 4 of the Package Leaflet (PL) were updated accordingly. Section 4.5 of the SPC was updated with regard to the antibody response during immunisation. Minor rewording in sections 4.2, 4.6 and 4.8 were also made. Additionally the product information (SPC, Annex II, Labelling and PL) was updated in accordance with the latest QRD template. | 23/02/2006   | no 29/03/2006 | longer SPC, Labelling, PL | Following assessment of the second Periodic Safety Update Report, the CHMP requested an update of section 4.4 to include or strengthen warnings regarding opportunistic infections and tuberculosis and an update of section 4.8 of the SPC with regard to immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia, interstitial pneumonitis, arthritis, and erythema multiforme. In the context of a post-marketing follow-up measure the MAH submitted the final report of a clinical study on the immune responses during and after efalizumab treatment. This study showed that the model of T-cell dependent antibody response was lowered during efalizumab treatment. Therefore, Section 4.5 (Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction) of the SPC was updated with regard to the antibody response during immunisation to reflect appropriately clinically relevant effects of efalizumab on the responses to Tetanus toxoid booster vaccination and Pneumococcal vaccination and reduction in cellular immune response (e.g. Candida recall antigen). |
