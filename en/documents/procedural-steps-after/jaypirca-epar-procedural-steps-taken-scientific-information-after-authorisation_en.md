|                                       | In view of available data on pirtobrutinib from clinical trials and spontaneous reports, including cases with a close temporal relationship, including positive de-challenges and re-challenges (of which one case had multiple positive rechallenges), the PRAC considers a causal relationship between pirtobrutinib and hepatic enzyme increased is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing pirtobrutinib should be amended accordingly.   |            |            |
