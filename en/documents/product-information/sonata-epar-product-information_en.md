SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS

Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT

Sonata 5 mg hard capsules

## 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION

Each capsule contains 5 mg of zaleplon.

Excipient with known effect: Lactose monohydrate 54 mg.

For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Capsule, hard. Capsules have an opaque white and opaque light brown hard shell with the strength '5 mg'. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Sonata is indicated for the treatment of patients with insomnia who have difficulty falling asleep. It is indicated only when the disorder is severe, disabling or subjecting the individual to extreme distress. 4.2 Posology and method of administration For adults, the recommended dose is 10 mg. Treatment should be as short as possible with a maximum duration of two weeks . Sonata can be taken immediately before going to bed or after the patient has gone to bed and is experiencing difficulty falling asleep. As administration after food delays the time to maximal plasma concentration by approximately 2 hours no food should be eaten with or shortly before intake of Sonata. The total daily dose of Sonata should not exceed 10 mg in any patient. Patients should be advised not to take a second dose within a single night. Elderly Elderly patients may be sensitive to the effects of hypnotics; therefore, 5 mg is the recommended dose of Sonata. Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Paediatric patients

Sonata is contraindicated in children and adolescents under 18 years of age (see section 4.3).

## Hepatic impairment

As clearance is reduced, patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should be treated with Sonata 5 mg. For severe hepatic impairment see section 4.3.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency, because Sonata pharmacokinetics is not altered in such patients. Severe renal impairment is contraindicated (see section 4.3.).

## 4.3 Contraindications

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Severe hepatic impairment Severe renal impairment Sleep apnoea syndrome Myasthenia gravis Severe respiratory insufficiency Children and adolescents (under 18 years of age)

<!-- image -->

Co-administration of Sonata with medicinal products known to influence CYP3A4 is expected to result in changes in zaleplon's plasma concentrations. (See section 4.5).

4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Complex behaviours such as 'sleep-driving' (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic, with amnesia for the event) have been reported in patients taking sedativehypnotics. These events can occur in sedative-hypnotic-naive as well as in sedative-hypnotic experienced persons. Although behaviours such as sleep-driving may occur with a sedative-hypnotic alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants with sedative-hypnotics appears to increase the risk of such behaviours, as does exceeding the maximum recommended dose. Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of zaleplon is recommended for patients who report a 'sleep-driving' episode. Other complex behaviours (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events. Severe anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with the use of sedative-hypnotics, including zaleplon. Cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including zaleplon. Some patients taking sedative-hypnotics have had additional symptoms such as dyspnoea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with zaleplon should not be rechallenged with the active substance. Insomnia may represent an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder. Insomnia that persists or worsens after a short course of zaleplon treatment may indicate a need to re-evaluate the patient. Due to zaleplon's short plasma half-life, alternative therapy should be considered if early morning awakening is experienced. Patients should be advised not to take a second dose within a single night. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Concomitant intake with alcohol is not recommended. The sedative effect may be enhanced when the product is used in combination with alcohol which may affect the ability to drive or use machines the next day (see section 4.7).

## Tolerance

Some loss of efficacy to the hypnotic effects of short-acting benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like agents may develop after repeated use for a few weeks.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Dependence

Use of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like agents may lead to physical and psychic dependence. The risk of dependence increases with dose and duration of treatment and is greater with patients having a history of alcohol and medicinal product abuse. Once physical dependence has developed, abrupt termination of treatment will be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms. These may consist of headaches, muscle pain, extreme anxiety, tension, restlessness, confusion and irritability. In severe cases the following symptoms may occur: unreality, depersonalisation, hyperacusis, numbness and tingling of the extremities, hypersensitivity to light, noise and physical contact, hallucinations or epileptic seizures. There have been post-marketing reports of dependence associated with zaleplon, predominantly in combination with other psychotropic agents.

## Rebound insomnia and anxiety

A transient syndrome whereby the symptoms that led to the treatment with a benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like agent recur in an enhanced form, may occur on withdrawal of treatment. It may be accompanied by other reactions including mood changes, anxiety, or sleep disturbances and restlessness.

Benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like agents should be used with extreme caution in patients with a history of alcohol or medicinal product abuse.

Duration of treatment The duration of treatment should be as short as possible (see section 4.2), and should not exceed two weeks. Extension beyond these periods should not take place without clinical re-evaluation of the patient. It may be useful to inform the patient when treatment is started that it will be of limited duration. It is important that patients be aware of the possibility of rebound phenomena, thereby minimising anxiety should such symptoms develop when the medicinal product is discontinued. Memory and psychomotor impairment Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like agents may induce anterograde amnesia and psychomotor impairment. These occur most often up to several hours after ingesting the product. To reduce the risk, patients should not undertake activities requiring psychomotor co-ordination until 4 hours or more after taking Sonata (see section 4.7). Psychiatric and 'paradoxical' reactions Reactions like restlessness, agitation, irritability, decreased inhibition, aggressiveness, abnormal thinking, delusion, rages, nightmares, depersonalisation, hallucinations, psychoses, inappropriate behaviour, extroversion that seems out of character and other behavioural effects are known to occur when using benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-like agents. They may be active substance-induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. These reactions are more likely to occur in the elderly. Should this occur, use of this product should be discontinued. Any new behavioural sign or symptom requires careful and immediate evaluation. Specific patient groups Alcohol and medicinal product abuse Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hepatic impairment

Benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like agents are not indicated to treat patients with severe hepatic insufficiency as they may precipitate encephalopathy (see section 4.2). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency, the bioavailability of zaleplon is increased because of reduced clearance, and the dose will therefore need to be modified in these patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

Sonata is not indicated to treat patients with severe renal impairment as it has not been adequately studied in those patients. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, the pharmacokinetic profile of zaleplon is not significantly different than that in healthy subjects. Hence, no dose adjustment is required in these patients.

## Respiratory insufficiency

Caution should be observed when prescribing sedative medicinal products to patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency.

## Psychosis

Benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like agents are not recommended for the primary treatment of psychotic illness.

<!-- image -->

Diphenhydramine is reported to be a weak inhibitor of aldehyde oxidase in rat liver, but its inhibitory effects in human liver are not known. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between zaleplon and diphenhydramine following the administration of a single dose (10 mg and 50 mg, respectively) of each drug. However, because both of these compounds have CNS effects, an additive pharmacodynamic effect is possible.

Depression Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like agents should not be used alone to treat depression or anxiety associated with depression (suicide may be precipitated in such patients). Also, because of the increased risk for intentional overdose in patients with depression in general, the quantity of a medicinal product, including zaleplon, prescribed for such patients should be kept to the necessary minimum. Sonata contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant intake with alcohol is not recommended. The sedative effect may be enhanced when the product is used in combination with alcohol which may affect the ability to drive or use machines the next day (see section 4.7). Combination with other CNS-acting compounds should be taken into account. Enhancement of the central sedation may occur in cases of concomitant use with antipsychotics (neuroleptics), hypnotics, anxiolytics/sedatives, antidepressant agents, narcotic analgesics, anti-epileptic medicinal products, anaesthetics, and sedative antihistamines. Concomitant use of zaleplon with these drugs may increase the risk of next day drowsiness, including impaired driving ability (see section 4.7). Coadministration of a single zaleplon 10 mg dose and venlafaxine (extended release) 75 mg or 150 mg daily did not produce any interaction on memory (immediate and delayed word recall) or psychomotor performance (digit symbol substitution test). Additionally, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction between zaleplon and venlafaxine (extended release). In the case of narcotic analgesics enhancement of the euphoria may occur leading to an increase in physiological dependence. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Cimetidine, a non-specific moderate inhibitor of several hepatic enzymes including both aldehyde oxidase and CYP3A4, produced an 85% increase in plasma concentrations of zaleplon because it inhibited both the primary (aldehyde oxidase) and secondary (CYP3A4) enzymes responsible for zaleplon's metabolism. Therefore, caution is advisable in co-administering cimetidine and Sonata.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Co-administration of Sonata with a single 800 mg dose of erythromycin, a strong, selective CYP3A4 inhibitor, produced a 34% increase in zaleplon's plasma concentrations. A routine dosage adjustment of Sonata is not considered necessary, but patients should be advised that the sedative effects might be enhanced.

In contrast, rifampicin, a strong inducer of several hepatic enzymes, including CYP3A4 resulted in a four fold reduction in zaleplon plasma concentration. Co-administration of Sonata together with inducers of CYP3A4 such as rifampicin, carbamazepine and phenobarbitone, may result in a reduction of zaleplon's efficacy.

Sonata did not affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of digoxin and warfarin, two compounds with a narrow therapeutic index. In addition, ibuprofen, as an example of compounds that alter renal excretion, showed no interaction with Sonata.

4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Although animal studies have shown no teratogenic or embryotoxic effects, insufficient clinical data are available on Sonata to assess its safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Use of Sonata is not recommended during pregnancy. If the medicinal product is prescribed to a woman of child-bearing potential, she should be warned to contact her physician regarding discontinuance of the medicinal product if she intends to become or suspects that she is pregnant. If for compelling medical reasons, the medicinal product is administered during the late phase of pregnancy, or during labour at high doses, effects on the neonate, such as hypothermia, hypotonia and moderate respiratory depression, can be expected, due to the pharmacological action of the compound. Infants born to mothers who took benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like agents chronically during the latter stages of pregnancy may have developed physical dependence and may be at some risk for developing withdrawal symptoms in the postnatal period. Because zaleplon is excreted in the breast milk, Sonata should not be administered to breast-feeding mothers. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Sonata has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Sedation, amnesia, impaired concentration and impaired muscular function may adversely affect the ability to drive or to use machines the next day. If insufficient sleep duration occurs, the likelihood of impaired alertness may be increased. Furthermore, the co-administration of zaleplon with alcohol and other CNS depressants increases this risk (see section 4.5). Caution is recommended for patients performing skilled tasks. Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery until it is established that their performance is not impaired. 4.8 Undesirable effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Psychiatric and 'paradoxical' reactions

Reactions like restlessness, agitation, irritability, decreased inhibition, aggressiveness, abnormal thinking, delusions, rages, nightmares, depersonalisation, hallucinations, psychoses, inappropriate behaviour, extroversion that seems out of character, and other adverse behavioural reactions are known to occur when using benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-like agents. Such reactions are more likely to occur in the elderly.

## Dependence

Use (even at therapeutic doses) may lead to the development of physical dependence: discontinuation of therapy may result in withdrawal or rebound phenomena (see section 4.4). Psychic dependence may occur. Abuse of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like active substances has been reported.

## Reporting of suspected adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose There is limited clinical experience with the effects of an acute overdose of Sonata, and overdose levels in humans have not been determined. As with other benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-like agents, overdose should not present a threat to life unless combined with other CNS depressants (including alcohol). Symptoms of overdose Overdose of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like agents is usually manifested by degrees of central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild cases, symptoms include drowsiness, mental confusion, and lethargy, in more serious cases, symptoms may include ataxia, hypotonia, hypotension, respiratory depression, rarely coma and very rarely death. Chromaturia (bluegreen urine discolouration) has been reported with zaleplon overdose. Therapy of overdose In the management of overdose with any medicinal product, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been taken. Treatment  of  Sonata  overdose  is  largely  supportive.  Attention  to  airway  patency  and  supportive management of ventilation and haemodynamics are usually sufficient. In mild cases patients should sleep under control of respiratory and circulatory function. Induced vomiting is not recommended. In severe  cases,  use  of  activated  charcoal  or  gastric  lavage  may  be  useful  when  performed  soon  after ingestion. Further, stabilization of circulatory function and intensive monitoring may be required. The value of forced dialysis or haemodialysis in the treatment of over dosage has not been determined. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Animal studies suggest that flumazenil is an antagonist to zaleplon and should be considered in the management of Sonata overdose. However, there is no clinical experience with the use of flumazenil as an antidote to a Sonata overdose.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Benzodiazepine related drugs, ATC Code N05CF03

Zaleplon is a pyrazolopyrimidine hypnotic that is structurally different from benzodiazepines and other hypnotics. Zaleplon binds selectively to the benzodiazepine type I receptor.

Zaleplon's pharmacokinetic profile shows rapid absorption and elimination (see section 5.2). In combination with its subtype selective receptor-binding characteristics, with high selectivity and low affinity for the benzodiazepine type I receptor, these properties are responsible for the overall characteristics of Sonata.

Zaleplon is primarily metabolised by aldehyde oxidase to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. Additionally, zaleplon is metabolised by CYP3A4 to form desethylzaleplon which is further metabolised by aldehyde oxidase to form 5-oxo-desethylzaleplon. The oxidative metabolites are further metabolised by conjugation via glucuronidation. All of zaleplon's metabolites are inactive in both animal behavioural models and in vitro activity assays.

Sonata's efficacy has been demonstrated in both sleep laboratory studies using objective polysomnography (PSG) measures of sleep and in outpatient studies using patient questionnaires to assess sleep. In these studies, patients were diagnosed with primary (psychophysiological) insomnia. Sleep latency in outpatient studies was decreased for up to 4 weeks in non-elderly patients with Sonata 10 mg. In elderly patients, sleep latency was often significantly decreased with Sonata 5 mg and was consistently decreased with Sonata 10 mg compared with placebo in 2-week studies. This decreased sleep latency was significantly different from that observed with placebo. Results from the 2- and 4week studies showed that no pharmacological tolerance developed with any dose of Sonata. In Sonata studies using objective PSG measures, Sonata 10 mg was superior to placebo in decreasing sleep latency and increasing sleep duration during the first half of the night. Sonata has been shown to preserve sleep stages in controlled studies that measured the percentage of sleep time spent in each sleep stage. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption Zaleplon is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration, and peak concentrations are reached in approximately 1 hour. At least 71% of the orally-administered dose is absorbed. Zaleplon undergoes presystemic metabolism, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 30%. Distribution Zaleplon is lipophilic with a volume of distribution of about 1.4 ± 0.3 l/kg following intravenous administration. The in vitro plasma protein binding is approximately 60%, suggesting little risk of active substance interaction due to protein binding. Metabolism Medicinal product no longer authorised

Zaleplon plasma concentrations increased linearly with dose, and zaleplon showed no signs of accumulation following administration of up to 30 mg/day. The elimination half-life of zaleplon is approximately 1 hour.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Excretion

Zaleplon is excreted in the form of inactive metabolites, mainly in the urine (71%) and faeces (17%). Fifty-seven percent (57%) of the dose is recovered in urine in the form of 5-oxo-zaleplon and its glucuronide metabolite, an additional 9% is recovered as 5-oxo-desethylzaleplon and its glucuronide metabolite. The remainder of the urinary recovery consists of minor metabolites. The majority of the faecal recovery consists of 5-oxo-zaleplon.

## Hepatic Impairment

Zaleplon is metabolised primarily by the liver and undergoes significant presystemic metabolism. Consequently, the oral clearance of zaleplon was reduced by 70% and 87% in compensated and decompensated cirrhotic patients, respectively, leading to marked increases in mean C max and AUC (up to 4-fold and 7-fold in compensated and decompensated patients, respectively) relative to healthy subjects. The dose of zaleplon should be reduced in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, and zaleplon is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Renal Impairment The single dose pharmacokinetics of zaleplon were studied in patients with mild (creatinine clearance 40 to 89 ml/min) and moderate (20 to 39 ml/min)   renal impairment, and in patients on dialysis. In patients with moderate impairment and those on dialysis there was a reduction of approximately 23% in peak plasma concentration compared to healthy volunteers. The extent of exposure to zaleplon was similar among all groups. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Zaleplon has not been adequately studied in patients with severe renal impairment. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Repeated dose toxicity In line with effects observed with other compounds binding to benzodiazepine receptors, reversible increases in liver and adrenal weights in rats and dogs were only noted upon repeated oral administration of high multiples of the maximum human therapeutic dose. At these doses, a significant reduction in the weight of both prostate and testes was apparent in a three month study in prepubescent dogs. Reproduction toxicity In a fertility and reproductive performance study in rats, mortality and decreased fertility were observed in males and females at an oral zaleplon dose of 100 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 49-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg on a mg/m 2 basis). Follow-up studies indicated that impaired fertility was due to an effect on the female. In embryofetal development studies, oral administration of zaleplon up to 100 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively, produced no evidence of teratogenicity (equivalent to 49- (rat) and 48-(rabbit) times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Pre-and postnatal growth of rats was reduced at the maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose for growth of rat offspring was 10 mg/kg (equivalent to 5-times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). No adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed in rabbits. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, increased stillbirth and postnatal mortality, and decreased growth and physical development, were observed in the offspring of females treated with doses of ≥ 7 mg/kg/day that did not elicit maternal toxicity. The no-effect dose for postnatal development was 1 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 0.5-times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). In a subsequent cross-fostering study, adverse effects on offspring viability and growth appeared to result from both in utero and lactational exposure to zaleplon.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Carcinogenicity

Oral administration of zaleplon to rats for 104 consecutive weeks at dosage levels up to 20 mg/kg/day did not result in compound-related tumorigenicity. Oral administration of zaleplon to mice for 65 or 104 consecutive weeks at high dosage levels ( ≥ 100 mg/kg/day) elicited a statistically significant increase in benign but not in malignant liver tumors. The increased incidence of benign liver tumors in mice was likely an adaptive event.

Overall, the results of the preclinical studies do not suggest any significant safety hazard for use of Sonata at recommended doses in humans.

Other complex behaviours (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events. Severe anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with the use of sedative-hypnotics, including zaleplon. Cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including zaleplon. Some patients taking sedative-hypnotics have had additional symptoms such as dyspnoea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with zaleplon should not be rechallenged with the active substance. Insomnia may represent an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder.

There have been post-marketing reports of dependence associated with zaleplon, predominantly in combination with other psychotropic agents.

## Rebound insomnia and anxiety

A transient syndrome whereby the symptoms that led to the treatment with a benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like agent recur in an enhanced form, may occur on withdrawal of treatment. It may be accompanied by other reactions including mood changes, anxiety, or sleep disturbances and restlessness.

Benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like agents should be used with extreme caution in patients with a history of alcohol or medicinal product abuse.

Duration of treatment The duration of treatment should be as short as possible (see section 4.2), and should not exceed two weeks. Extension beyond these periods should not take place without clinical re-evaluation of the patient. It may be useful to inform the patient when treatment is started that it will be of limited duration.  It is important that patients be aware of the possibility of rebound phenomena, thereby minimising anxiety should such symptoms develop when the medicinal product is discontinued. Memory and psychomotor impairment Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like agents may induce anterograde amnesia and psychomotor impairment. These occur most often up to several hours after ingesting the product. To reduce the risk, patients should not undertake activities requiring psychomotor co-ordination until 4 hours or more after taking Sonata (see section 4.7). Psychiatric and 'paradoxical' reactions Reactions like restlessness, agitation, irritability, decreased inhibition, aggressiveness, abnormal thinking, delusion, rages, nightmares, depersonalisation, hallucinations, psychoses, inappropriate behaviour, extroversion that seems out of character and other behavioural effects are known to occur when using benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-like agents. They may be active substance-induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. These reactions are more likely to occur in the elderly. Should this occur, use of this product should be discontinued. Any new behavioural sign or symptom requires careful and immediate evaluation. Specific patient groups Alcohol and medicinal product abuse Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Hepatic impairment

Benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like agents are not indicated to treat patients with severe hepatic insufficiency as they may precipitate encephalopathy (see section 4.2). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency, the bioavailability of zaleplon is increased because of reduced clearance, and the dose will therefore need to be modified in these patients.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Renal impairment

Sonata is not indicated to treat patients with severe renal impairment as it has not been adequately studied in those patients. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, the pharmacokinetic profile of zaleplon is not significantly different than that in healthy subjects. Hence, no dose adjustment is required in these patients.

## Respiratory insufficiency

Caution should be observed when prescribing sedative medicinal products to patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency.

## Psychosis

Benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like agents are not recommended for the primary treatment of psychotic illness.

Diphenhydramine is reported to be a weak inhibitor of aldehyde oxidase in rat liver, but its inhibitory effects in human liver are not known. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between zaleplon and diphenhydramine following the administration of a single dose (10 mg and 50 mg, respectively) of each drug. However, because both of these compounds have CNS effects, an additive pharmacodynamic effect is possible.

Depression Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like agents should not be used alone to treat depression or anxiety associated with depression (suicide may be precipitated in such patients). Also, because of the increased risk for intentional overdose in patients with depression in general, the quantity of a medicinal product, including zaleplon, prescribed for such patients should be kept to the necessary minimum. Sonata contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant intake with alcohol is not recommended. The sedative effect may be enhanced when the product is used in combination with alcohol which may affect the ability to drive or use machines the next day (see section 4.7). Combination with other CNS-acting compounds should be taken into account. Enhancement of the central sedation may occur in cases of concomitant use with antipsychotics (neuroleptics), hypnotics, anxiolytics/sedatives, antidepressant agents, narcotic analgesics, anti-epileptic medicinal products, anaesthetics, and sedative antihistamines. Concomitant use of zaleplon with these drugs may increase the risk of next day drowsiness, including impaired driving ability (see section 4.7). Coadministration of a single zaleplon 10 mg dose and venlafaxine (extended release) 75 mg or 150 mg daily did not produce any interaction on memory (immediate and delayed word recall) or psychomotor performance (digit symbol substitution test). Additionally, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction between zaleplon and venlafaxine (extended release). In the case of narcotic analgesics enhancement of the euphoria may occur leading to an increase in physiological dependence. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Cimetidine, a non-specific moderate inhibitor of several hepatic enzymes including both aldehyde oxidase and CYP3A4, produced an 85% increase in plasma concentrations of zaleplon because it inhibited both the primary (aldehyde oxidase) and secondary (CYP3A4) enzymes responsible for zaleplon's metabolism. Therefore, caution is advisable in co-administering cimetidine and Sonata.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Co-administration of Sonata with a single 800 mg dose of erythromycin, a strong, selective CYP3A4 inhibitor, produced a 34% increase in zaleplon's plasma concentrations. A routine dosage adjustment of Sonata is not considered necessary, but patients should be advised that the sedative effects might be enhanced.

In contrast, rifampicin, a strong inducer of several hepatic enzymes, including CYP3A4 resulted in a four fold reduction in zaleplon plasma concentration. Co-administration of Sonata together with inducers of CYP3A4 such as rifampicin, carbamazepine and phenobarbitone, may result in a reduction of zaleplon's efficacy.

Sonata did not affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of digoxin and warfarin, two compounds with a narrow therapeutic index. In addition, ibuprofen, as an example of compounds that alter renal excretion, showed no interaction with Sonata.

4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Although animal studies have shown no teratogenic or embryotoxic effects, insufficient clinical data are available on Sonata to assess its safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Use of Sonata is not recommended during pregnancy. If the medicinal product is prescribed to a woman of child-bearing potential, she should be warned to contact her physician regarding discontinuance of the medicinal product if she intends to become or suspects that she is pregnant. If for compelling medical reasons, the medicinal product is administered during the late phase of pregnancy, or during labour at high doses, effects on the neonate, such as hypothermia, hypotonia and moderate respiratory depression, can be expected, due to the pharmacological action of the compound. Infants born to mothers who took benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like agents chronically during the latter stages of pregnancy may have developed physical dependence and may be at some risk for developing withdrawal symptoms in the postnatal period. Because zaleplon is excreted in the breast milk, Sonata should not be administered to breast-feeding mothers. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Sonata has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Sedation, amnesia, impaired concentration and impaired muscular function may adversely affect the ability to drive or to use machines the next day. If insufficient sleep duration occurs, the likelihood of impaired alertness may be increased. Furthermore, the co-administration of zaleplon with alcohol and other CNS depressants increases this risk (see section 4.5). Caution is recommended for patients performing skilled tasks. Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery until it is established that their performance is not impaired. 4.8 Undesirable effects Medicinal product no longer authorised

## Amnesia

Anterograde amnesia may occur using recommended therapeutic dosages, the risk increasing at higher dosages. Amnestic effects may be associated with inappropriate behaviour (see section 4.4).

## Depression

Pre-existing depression may be unmasked during benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like agent use.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Psychiatric and 'paradoxical' reactions

Reactions like restlessness, agitation, irritability, decreased inhibition, aggressiveness, abnormal thinking, delusions, rages, nightmares, depersonalisation, hallucinations, psychoses, inappropriate behaviour, extroversion that seems out of character and other adverse behavioural reactions are known to occur when using benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-like agents. Such reactions are more likely to occur in the elderly.

## Dependence

Use (even at therapeutic doses) may lead to the development of physical dependence: discontinuation of therapy may result in withdrawal or rebound phenomena (see section 4.4). Psychic dependence may occur. Abuse of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like active substances has been reported.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose There is limited clinical experience with the effects of an acute overdose of Sonata, and overdose levels in humans have not been determined. As with other benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-like agents, overdose should not present a threat to life unless combined with other CNS depressants (including alcohol). Symptoms of overdose Overdose of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like agents is usually manifested by degrees of central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild cases, symptoms include drowsiness, mental confusion, and lethargy, in more serious cases, symptoms may include ataxia, hypotonia, hypotension, respiratory depression, rarely coma and very rarely death. Chromaturia (bluegreen urine discolouration) has been reported with zaleplon overdose. Therapy of overdose In the management of overdose with any medicinal product, it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been taken. Treatment  of  Sonata  overdose  is  largely  supportive.  Attention  to  airway  patency  and  supportive management of ventilation and haemodynamics are usually sufficient. In mild cases patients should sleep under control of respiratory and circulatory function. Induced vomiting is not recommended. In severe  cases,  use  of  activated  charcoal  or  gastric  lavage  may  be  useful  when  performed  soon  after ingestion. Further, stabilization of circulatory function and intensive monitoring may be required. The value of forced dialysis or haemodialysis in the treatment of over dosage has not been determined. Medicinal product no longer authorised

Animal studies suggest that flumazenil is an antagonist to zaleplon and should be considered in the management of Sonata overdose. However, there is no clinical experience with the use of flumazenil as an antidote to a Sonata overdose.

## 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

## 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties

Pharmacotherapeutic Group: Benzodiazepine related drugs, ATC Code N05CF03

Zaleplon is a pyrazolopyrimidine hypnotic that is structurally different from benzodiazepines and other hypnotics. Zaleplon binds selectively to the benzodiazepine type I receptor.

Zaleplon's pharmacokinetic profile shows rapid absorption and elimination (see section 5.2). In combination with its subtype selective receptor-binding characteristics, with high selectivity and low affinity for the benzodiazepine type I receptor, these properties are responsible for the overall characteristics of Sonata.

Zaleplon is primarily metabolised by aldehyde oxidase to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. Additionally, zaleplon is metabolised by CYP3A4 to form desethylzaleplon which is further metabolised by aldehyde oxidase to form 5-oxo-desethylzaleplon. The oxidative metabolites are further metabolised by conjugation via glucuronidation. All of zaleplon's metabolites are inactive in both animal behavioural models and in vitro activity assays.

Sonata's efficacy has been demonstrated in both sleep laboratory studies using objective polysomnography (PSG) measures of sleep and in outpatient studies using patient questionnaires to assess sleep. In these studies, patients were diagnosed with primary (psychophysiological) insomnia. Sleep latency in outpatient studies was decreased for up to 4 weeks in non-elderly patients with Sonata 10 mg. In elderly patients, sleep latency was often significantly decreased with Sonata 5 mg and was consistently decreased with Sonata 10 mg compared with placebo in 2-week studies. This decreased sleep latency was significantly different from that observed with placebo. Results from the 2- and 4week studies showed that no pharmacological tolerance developed with any dose of Sonata. In Sonata studies using objective PSG measures, Sonata 10 mg was superior to placebo in decreasing sleep latency and increasing sleep duration during the first half of the night. Sonata has been shown to preserve sleep stages in controlled studies that measured the percentage of sleep time spent in each sleep stage. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption Zaleplon is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration, and peak concentrations are reached in approximately 1 hour. At least 71% of the orally-administered dose is absorbed. Zaleplon undergoes presystemic metabolism, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 30%. Distribution Zaleplon is lipophilic with a volume of distribution of about 1.4 ± 0.3 l/kg following intravenous administration. The in vitro plasma protein binding is approximately 60%, suggesting little risk of active substance interaction due to protein binding. Metabolism Medicinal product no longer authorised

Zaleplon plasma concentrations increased linearly with dose, and zaleplon showed no signs of accumulation following administration of up to 30 mg/day. The elimination half-life of zaleplon is approximately 1 hour.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Excretion

Zaleplon is excreted in the form of inactive metabolites, mainly in the urine (71%) and faeces (17%). Fifty-seven percent (57%) of the dose is recovered in urine in the form of 5-oxo-zaleplon and its glucuronide metabolite, an additional 9% is recovered as 5-oxo-desethylzaleplon and its glucuronide metabolite. The remainder of the urinary recovery consists of minor metabolites. The majority of the faecal recovery consists of 5-oxo-zaleplon.

## Hepatic Impairment

Zaleplon is metabolised primarily by the liver and undergoes significant presystemic metabolism. Consequently, the oral clearance of zaleplon was reduced by 70% and 87% in compensated and decompensated cirrhotic patients, respectively, leading to marked increases in mean C max and AUC (up to 4-fold and 7-fold in compensated and decompensated patients, respectively) relative to healthy subjects. The dose of zaleplon should be reduced in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, and zaleplon is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Renal Impairment The single dose pharmacokinetics of zaleplon were studied in patients with mild (creatinine clearance 40 to 89 ml/min) and moderate (20 to 39 ml/min)   renal impairment, and in patients on dialysis. In patients with moderate impairment and those on dialysis there was a reduction of approximately 23% in peak plasma concentration compared to healthy volunteers. The extent of exposure to zaleplon was similar among all groups. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Zaleplon has not been adequately studied in patients with severe renal impairment. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Repeated dose toxicity In line with effects observed with other compounds binding to benzodiazepine receptors, reversible increases in liver and adrenal weights in rats and dogs were only noted upon repeated oral administration of high multiples of the maximum human therapeutic dose. At these doses, a significant reduction in the weight of both prostate and testes was apparent in a three month study in prepubescent dogs. Reproduction toxicity In a fertility and reproductive performance study in rats, mortality and decreased fertility were observed in males and females at an oral zaleplon dose of 100 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 49-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg on a mg/m 2 basis). Follow-up studies indicated that impaired fertility was due to an effect on the female. In embryofetal development studies, oral administration of zaleplon up to 100 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively, produced no evidence of teratogenicity (equivalent to 49- (rat) and 48-(rabbit) times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). Pre-and postnatal growth of rats was reduced at the maternally toxic dose of 100 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose for growth of rat offspring was 10 mg/kg (equivalent to 5-times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). No adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed in rabbits. Medicinal product no longer authorised

In a pre- and postnatal development study in rats, increased stillbirth and postnatal mortality, and decreased growth and physical development, were observed in the offspring of females treated with doses of ≥ 7 mg/kg/day that did not elicit maternal toxicity. The no-effect dose for postnatal development was 1 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 0.5-times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). In a subsequent cross-fostering study, adverse effects on offspring viability and growth appeared to result from both in utero and lactational exposure to zaleplon.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Carcinogenicity

Oral administration of zaleplon to rats for 104 consecutive weeks at dosage levels up to 20 mg/kg/day did not result in compound-related tumorigenicity. Oral administration of zaleplon to mice for 65 or 104 consecutive weeks at high dosage levels ( ≥ 100 mg/kg/day) elicited a statistically significant increase in benign but not in malignant liver tumors. The increased incidence of benign liver tumors in mice was likely an adaptive event.

Overall, the results of the preclinical studies do not suggest any significant safety hazard for use of Sonata at recommended doses in humans.

## PACKAGE LEAFLET: INFORMATION FOR THE USER

Sonata 5 mg hard capsules zaleplon

## Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important information for you.

-  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.
-  If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
-  This medicine has been prescribed for you. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.
-  If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

What is in this leaflet 1. What Sonata is and what it is used for 2. What you need to know before you take Sonata 3. How to take Sonata 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store Sonata 6. Contents of the pack and other information 1. What Sonata is and what it is used for Sonata belongs to a class of substances called benzodiazepine-related medicinal products, which consists of preparations with hypnotic actions. Sonata will help you to sleep. Sleeping problems do not usually last long, and most people only need a short course of treatment. The duration of treatment should usually vary from a few days to two weeks. If you still have problems sleeping after you have finished your capsules, contact your doctor again. 2. What you need to know before you take Sonata Do not take Sonata  if you are allergic to zaleplon or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  if you have sleep apnoea syndrome (stopping breathing for short periods while asleep).  if you have severe kidney or liver problems.  if you have myasthenia gravis (very weak or tired muscles).  if you have severe breathing or chest problems. Medicinal product no longer authorised

<!-- image -->

If you are in any doubt about whether you have any of these conditions, do ask your doctor.

Children and adolescents under 18 years of age must not take Sonata.

## Warnings and precautions

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Sonata.

-  Never drink alcohol while you are being treated with Sonata. Alcohol can increase the undesirable effects of any medicine taken to help you sleep.
-  Use with extreme caution if you have ever been addicted to medicines or alcohol.
-  If you are taking any medicines belonging to the sleep inducing group, including Sonata, there is a possibility that you may become dependent on them. Once physical dependence has developed, abrupt termination of treatment may be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

These may consist of headaches, muscle pain, extreme anxiety, tension, restlessness, confusion and irritability.

-  Do not use Sonata or any other sleeping medicine for longer than your doctor tells you to.
-  Do not use a second dose of Sonata within a single night.
-  If your sleeplessness persists or worsens after a short course of Sonata treatment contact your doctor.
-  There is a chance that you may experience a certain type of temporary memory loss (amnesia) and lack of coordination when taking sleep medicines. This can usually be avoided if you remain inactive for at least 4 hours after taking Sonata.
-  There is a chance that you may experience somnambulism (sleepwalking), including eating or driving while not fully awake with no memory of the event. If you experience these events, contact your doctor immediately.

 Reactions like restlessness, agitation, irritability, aggressiveness, abnormal thinking, delusion, rages, nightmares, depersonalisation, hallucinations, psychoses, inappropriate behaviour, extroversion that seems out of character and other behavioural effects have been reported following use of any medicines belonging to the sleep inducing group, including Sonata.  These reactions may be active substance-induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. They are more likely to occur in the elderly. If you experience these events, contact your doctor immediately.  Rare cases of severe allergic reactions have been reported. An allergic reaction may include a rash, itching, difficulty breathing or swelling of the face, lips, throat or tongue, or nausea and vomiting. If you experience any of these events, contact your doctor immediately. Children and adolescents Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Other medicines and Sonata Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Do not take any other medicines without asking your doctor or pharmacist first. This includes medicines that can be bought without a prescription. Some can cause drowsiness and should not be taken while taking Sonata. When Sonata is taken with other medicines that act on the brain, the combination may make you more drowsy than it should. Be aware that such combinations may cause you to feel drowsy the next day. These medicines include: substances used in the treatment of mental conditions (antipsychotics, hypnotics, anxiolytics/sedatives, antidepressants), medicines used for strong pain relief (narcotic analgesics), medicines used for the treatment of seizures/convulsions (antiepileptic medicines), medicines used for loss of feeling/ insensibility (anaesthetics), and medicines used in the treatment of allergies (sedative antihistamines). Drinking alcohol while being treated with Sonata may also cause you to feel drowsy the next day. Never drink alcohol while you are being treated with Sonata (see 'Warnings and precautions'). Medicinal product no longer authorised

You should tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking cimetidine (a stomach medicine) or erythromycin (an antibiotic).

## Sonata with food, drink and alcohol

It is not recommended that you take Sonata with or immediately after eating a large meal as it may work more slowly. Swallow the capsule(s) with a small glass of water. Never drink alcohol while you are being treated with Sonata (see 'Warnings and precautions').

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Sonata should not be taken at these times because there are not enough clinical data available to assess its safety during pregnancy and breast-feeding.

-  Never drink alcohol while you are being treated with Sonata. Alcohol can increase the undesirable effects of any medicine taken to help you sleep.
-  Use with extreme caution if you have ever been addicted to medicines or alcohol.
-  If you are taking any medicines belonging to the sleep inducing group, including Sonata, there is a possibility that you may become dependent on them. Once physical dependence has developed, abrupt termination of treatment may be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms.

Annex IV Scientific conclusions and grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation Medicinal product no longer authorised

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for zaleplon, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:

Literature articles regarding next day effects on driving and mental alertness were published during the reporting period which examined these effects with zaleplon and other agents of the class. While there were no significant findings in relation to zaleplon, a small number of cases have been reported in the post-marketing setting, although mostly in combination with other CNS depressant agents and at doses greater than 10mg.

Warnings already exist in the zaleplon product information however based on the available information the PRAC considered it prudent within this procedure to strengthen the wording in SmPC and PL to ensure clear information is available for patients and healthcare professionals given the potentially serious consequences of next day psychomotor impairment. Therefore, in view of available data regarding next day effects on driving and mental alertness, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted. The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation On the basis of the scientific conclusions for zaleplon the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing zaleplon is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.
