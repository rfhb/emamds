## Scientific conclusions

Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for respiratory syncytial virus, glycoprotein f, recombinant, stabilised in the pre-fusion conformation, adjuvanted with AS01E, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:

In view of available data on Guillain-Barré syndrome from clinical trial(s), the literature, spontaneous reports including in some cases a compatible temporal relationship  and the information from the SCCS performed by FDA, the PRAC considers that a causal relationship between respiratory syncytial virus, glycoprotein f, recombinant, stabilised in the pre-fusion conformation, adjuvanted with AS01E and Guillain-Barré syndrome is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing respiratory syncytial virus, glycoprotein f, recombinant, stabilised in the pre-fusion conformation, adjuvanted with AS01E should be amended accordingly.

Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and grounds for recommendation.

## Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)

On the basis of the scientific conclusions for respiratory syncytial virus, glycoprotein f, recombinant, stabilised in the pre-fusion conformation, adjuvanted with AS01E the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing respiratory syncytial virus, glycoprotein f, recombinant, stabilised in the pre-fusion conformation, adjuvanted with as01e is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information

The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.
