## Procedural steps taken after granting the Marketing Authorisation

For procedures finalised after 1 February 2004 please refer to module 8B.

- On 7 August 2000, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA an application (II/1) for a Type II variation to add another presentation, i.e. a vial containing 5 ml solution in addition to the 2.5 ml vial, which was originally authorised on 27 July 2000. The opportunity was also taken to revise some of the preclinical safety margins defined in the original SPC. A positive  CPMP  opinion  was  given  on  19  October  2000,  and  a  Commission  Decision  with revised annexes was issued on 22 February 2001

Subsequent post Marketing Authorisation applications agreed upon are summarised in the table below:
