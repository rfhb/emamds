## 1. Introduction

Chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  represents  7-20%  of  all  leukaemia  cases,  with  a  worldwide  incidence projected at less than one to two per 100.000 people. Approximately 85% of patients are diagnosed with  chronic-phase  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia.  The  overall  5-year  survival  rate  (1992-1998)  was approximately 35%. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is predominantly a disease of childhood and the incidence in adults is less than one per 100.000 people. Of these approximately 20-25% produces the Philadelphia chromosome, long-term survival at 10 years in adults is in the range of 25-35%.

Chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  is  a  haematopoietic  stem  cell  disorder  associated  with  a  reciprocal translocation  between  chromosomes  9  and  22  to  produce  the  Philadelphia  chromosome.  This chromosomal translocation results in a chimeric protein product BCR-ABL, which is a constitutively active form of the ABL tyrosine kinase. CML is a progressive disease, which evolves through chronic, accelerated,  and  blast  crisis  phases.  Blast  phase  is  the  most  advanced  stage  of  CML  and  is  highly refractory  to  therapy.  The  blast  phase  phenotype  is  myeloblastic  in  two-thirds  of  patients  and lymphoblastic in the remaining one-third.

Both imatinib, an oral inhibitor of the ABL kinase, and interferon, an injectable immune modulator, produce  durable  responses  in  patients  with  CML.  Based  on  high  rates  of  both  haematologic  and cytogenetic responses, imatinib is currently approved for use in newly diagnosed CML patients as well as in CML blast phase patients previously treated with interferon. Imatinib is most effective in patients with chronic phase CML, in whom the complete haematologic response (CHR) rate is 95% and the complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rate is 39%. In patients with accelerated, myeloid, or lymphoid blast phase CML, or Ph+ ALL, imatinib is less effective.

Although imatinib is effective in treating newly diagnosed CML, resistance to imatinib has emerged. The 2-year incidence of resistance is estimated to be 80% in blast phase, 40% to 50% in accelerated phase, and at least 10% in chronic phase.

## About the product

Dasatinib inhibits the activity of the BCR-ABL kinase and SRC family kinases along with a number of  other  selected  oncogenic  kinases  including  c-KIT,  ephrin  (EPH)  receptor  kinases,  and  PDGF β receptor.  Dasatinib  is  a  potent,  subnanomolar  inhibitor  of  the  BCR-ABL  kinase  with  potency  at concentration of 0.6-0.8 nM.

## SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Active Substance

The active substance is dasatinib and its chemical name is N -(2-chloro-6-methylphenyl)-2-[[6-[4-(2hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]-2-methyl-4-pyrimidinyl]amino]-5-thiazolecarboxamide, monohydrate according to the IUPAC nomenclature.

Dasatinib  is  a  crystalline  white  powder  and  exhibits  pH  dependent  aqueous  solubility  (from  18.4 mg/ml at pH 2.6 to 0.008mg/ml at pH 6.0). It is very slightly soluble in acetone and acetonitrile and slightly  soluble  in  ethanol,  methanol,  polyethyleneglycol  400  and  propyleneglycol.  It  is  practically insoluble in corn oil.

## · Manufacture

Dasatinib  is  synthesised  in  two  reactions  steps  with  three  solid  isolations  followed  by  purification (Crystallisation).

The manufacturing process has been adequately described. Critical parameters have been identified and adequate in-process controls included.

## Medicinal Product

## · Pharmaceutical Development

All  information  regarding  the  choice  of  the  active  substance  and  the  excipients  are  sufficiently justified.

Dasatinib tablets were developed in 5 and 50-mg strengths to cover a dose range of 15 - 180 mg for Phase I clinical studies. These tablets were manufactured using a wet granulation process. For Phase II clinical studies and commercialization, a wet granulation process was developed to cover a potential tablet strength of 20 - 150 mg. 20 and 50-mg tablets were developed using the 25% w/w drug load granulation for Phase II clinical studies to cover a dose range of 20 - 100 mg (twice a day). This same formulation (i.e., same drug load granulation) was used to manufacture 150-mg tablets for long-term stability studies (LTSS) to provide a bracket for any intermediate strengths (i.e., between 20 and 150 mg).  Additionally,  70-mg  tablets  developed  for  commercialization  using  the  same  drug  load granulation.

In fact the proposed commercial tablets, 20, 50, and 70 mg, will be manufactured from the same drug load granulation and use similar processes that were used to manufacture tablets for Phase II clinical studies  and  LTSS.  However  the  only  difference  between  the  Phase  II/LTSS  and  the  proposed commercial  tablets  is  in  their  debossing.  This  difference  in  debossing  is  not  expected  to  have  any impact on the quality or performance of the finished product.

The  Phase II/LTSS/commercial  formulation  has  the  same  qualitative  composition  as  the  Phase  I formulations with the exception of the film coat.

The  manufacturing  process  of  major  unit  operations  (i.e.,  granulation,  drying,  and  lubrication)  was characterized  at  both  laboratory  and  pilot  scales  using  statistical  experimental  designs.  Coating parameters were chosen based on prior experience with similar coating materials.

Dasatinib is characterized as a low solubility/high permeability (BCS II) compound according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS). In this context, dissolution of dasatinib can potentially be  rate-limiting  for  absorption.  The  dissolution  of  a  poorly  soluble  drug  can  be  influenced  by  its particle size distribution. After several studies it was concluded that the active substance with particle size D[90] ranging from 4 to 130 microns has been shown to have no impact on blend flow, in-vitro tablet dissolution and content uniformity, and has produced tablets with satisfactory hardness. Results of the study demonstrated the ruggedness of the formulation and manufacturing process with respect to active substance particle size.

The MAH intends to market 20, 50, and 70-mg strength tablets. The proposed commercial tablets, 20 and 50 mg, are qualitatively and quantitatively identical to the 20 and 50-mg tablets used in Phase II studies with the exception of debossing. The results of a bioequivalence study demonstrated that the 70-mg tablet is bioequivalent to the combination of 20-mg plus 50-mg tablets.

In  conclusion,  statistical  experimental  designs,  in  combination  with  characterization  of  functional excipients and active substance, have been used to understand the tablet formulation and manufacturing process. Results of formulation and process development studies demonstrate that the tablet formulation and the manufacturing process are robust.

## · Manufacture of the Product

The  proposed  commercial  manufacturing  process  involves  standard  technology  using  standard manufacturing  processes  such  as  wet  granulation,  drying,  milling,  blending,  compression  and  filmcoating unit operations. Furthermore, the equipment used is commonly available in the pharmaceutical industry.

The  major  steps  to  prepare  dasatinib  tablets  are  the  granulation  and  drying  processes  for  the manufacture of the granules, the blending/lubrication process for the manufacture of the final blend, and the tablet compression process.

The  batch  analysis  results  show  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  manufactured  reproducibly according the agreed finished product specifications.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Product Specification

The medicinal product specifications were established according the ICH guidelines and include the following tests: appearance, identification (HPLC and Raman or ATR:IR), assay, impurities/degradants (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units, dissolution and microbial limits (Ph Eur). All analytical procedures which were used for testing the medicinal product were properly described. Moreover, all relevant methods were satisfactorily validated in accordance with the CHMP and ICH guidelines.

## · Stability of the Product

The stability studies were conducted according to the current ICH guideline. Three production scale batches  of  each  strength  have  been  stored  at  long  term  and  accelerated  conditions  in  the  proposed market packaging.

One production batch per strength was stored under elevated temperature and humidity conditions for 3  months  and  at  ICH  conditions  and  another  production  batch  per  strength  was  stored  for photostability at ICH conditions.

Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable.

## Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information  on  development,  manufacture,  control of  the  active  substance  and  the  finished  product have been presented in a satisfactory manner and justified in accordance with relevant guidelines. The results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of  the  finished  product. Therefore, this medicinal product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were two minor unresolved quality issues which do not have any  impact  on  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  the  medicinal  product.  The  applicant  gave  a  letter  of undertaking and committed to resolve these as follow up measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe.

## 3. Non-clinical aspects

## Introduction

The non-clinical toxicity studies were conducted according to GLP. The safety pharmacology studies were GLP-compliant with exception of the hERG and Purkinje fibre evaluations (conducted before the release of the ICH S7B guideline).

## Pharmacology

Pharmacology studies included in vitro and in vivo studies to determine dasatinib's kinase inhibition selectivity  spectrum,  potency  versus  BCR-ABL  kinase  activity,  mode  of  binding  to  BCR-ABL, leukemic cell-killing potency, and activity against multiple forms of imatinib resistance. These studies defined a pharmacological profile for dasatinib that has some distinct aspects as compared to imatinib and provide a rationale for the development of dasatinib for the treatment of CML and ALL.

## · Primary pharmacodynamics

## In vitro pharmacology

X-ray crystal structure analysis of the ABL kinase domain in complex with dasatinib revealed that, like imatinib, dasatinib binds in the ATP-binding site of the ABL kinase. Dasatinib binds to the active or  'opened'  conformation  of  the  BCR-ABL  kinase  domain  and  is  predicted,  based  on  modeling studies, to also bind to the inactive or 'closed' conformation.

The inhibitory activity of dasatinib was evaluated in vitro on five tyrosine kinase families SRC family kinases (SRC, LCK, YES, FYN), BCR-ABL, KIT, EPHA2 and PDGF β .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Results demonstrated, that dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of selected protein tyrosine kinases of which SRC, BCR-ABL, KIT, PDGF receptor and EPH receptor have been linked to various forms of human malignancies.

Moreover, dasatinib killed or inhibited the proliferation of three human BCR-ABL dependent CML cell  lines  and  one  human  BCR-ABL  dependent  ALL  cell  line.  Dasatinib  exhibited  a  high  growth inhibitory  potential  in  the  four  tested  leukaemia  cell  lines  with  IC 50 values ≤ 1  nM.  Imatinib  was considerably less potent in this cellular assay with a 300-655 fold difference in potency.

Both imatinib and dasatinib induced erythroid differentiation and cell death in the erythromyeloblastoid K-562 CML cell line although dasatinib appeared to be at least 150-fold more potent than imatinib in inducing this response.

Dasatinib demonstrated antiproliferative activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) treated with VEGF or bFGF. IC50 values of 42 nM and 248 nM were obtained under conditions with VEGF-stimulated and bFGF-stimulated growth, respectively. Additionally, dasatinib attenuated VEGF and bFGF stimulated HUVEC endothelial cell migration in vitro (IC50&lt;5 nM).

## In vivo pharmacology

The tumour inhibiting activity of dasatinib was evaluated in human CML xenograft models grown SC in SCID mice. Cures were defined as the absence of detectable tumour at a time greater than ten times the tumour volume doubling time after the cessation of treatment.

Dasatinib was curative in mice bearing K562 human CML tumours over a range of dose levels (8-50 mg/kg) when administered PO once a day for 10 days using a '5-days-on and 2-days off' treatment regimen. Treatment was initiated when the tumours reached a size of 200 to 500 mg. High doses of imatinib  failed  to  produce  a  comparative  response.  The  minimum  effective  dose  for  dasatinib  was determined as 2.5 mg/kg. In addition, dasatinib was highly efficient in this model when administered IV. Dasatinib was curative in mice bearing large KU812 tumours (up to &gt; 1g tumour) when treated with 50 mg/kg/day for 5 days.

The SRC phosphorylation was investigated in peripheral mononuclear cell (PBMCs) collected from human prostate cancer cell (PC-3) bearing mice administered 1, 5, 15 or 50 mg/kg dasatinib. Dasatinib treatment resulted  in  a  dose-dependent  inhibition  of  SRC  phosphorylation  with  an  almost  complete inhibition  within  5  hours  following  administration  of  15  and  50  mg/kg.  Administration  of  5  mg/kg resulted in 44% inhibition of SRC phosphorylation whereas 1 mg/kg was almost inactive. Based on AUC0-24h values, the animal:human plasma exposure ratios were 0.8 and 1.9 for the 5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. Based on pharmacokinetic data it was estimated that the dasatinib plasma concentration required to inhibit 50% of phospho-SRC was 91 nM in PBMCs.

Dasatinib  treatment  (10  mg/kg/day)  increased  survival  in  mice  inoculated  intracranially  with  K562 CML  cells  and  the  survival  efficacy  was  superior  to  what  was  observed  with  imatinib  (300 mg/kg/day). In a similar study, increased survival was observed following treatment with 10 and 30 mg/kg/day  dasatinib  whereas  200  mg/kg/day  imatinib  failed  to  inhibit  intracranial  tumour  growth. Thus dasatinib appears to have a therapeutic advantage over imatinib in the treatment of intracranial CML.

Dasatinib  was  equally  active  against  a  human  CML  model  in  mice  whether  treatment  was administered daily for ten consecutive days or if a short treatment break (5-days-on and 2-days off) was introduced into the dosing regimen. Moreover, a twice-daily dosing regimen produced efficacy that was superior to the once daily dosing regimen. Consequently, in mice bearing K562 human CML tumours, a superior anti-tumour activity (cure) was observed in the twice-daily 1.25 mg/kg dose group when compared to the dose group administered 2.5 mg/kg dasatinib on a once-daily schedule (growth inhibition).

## Cellular activity of human dasatinib metabolites

In  cancer  patients,  the  systemic  exposure  of  the  metabolites  represented  1-13%  of  the  drug-related material.  Furthermore,  BMS-582691,  the  pharmacologically  most  potent  metabolite,  represented maximally  4%  of  dasatinib-related  radioactivity  in  the in  vitro and in  vivo metabolism  studies conducted  with  humans  or  human  liver  microsomes.  Therefore,  the  dasatinib  metabolites  are  not expected to contribute significantly to the pharmacological activity of dasatinib.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Secondary pharmacodynamics

Dasatinib affinity towards 42 different receptors and channels was evaluated in a competitive binding assay. Dasatinib had no significant effect (all assays were ≤ 46% inhibition at 10 µM) on the binding of any of the receptor or ion-channel ligands evaluated and no effect on acetylcholinesterase activity (930003305).

Dasatinib proved less potent against selected non-target protein tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine kinases. An IC50 value of at least 5,000 nM was obtained for FAK, IGF1 receptor, insulin receptor, PKA, PKC, GSK-3, MET, EMT/ZAP-70, SYK and CAMKII. Moreover, IC50 values were obtained for VEGF receptor-2 (&gt;2,000 nM), FGF receptor (880 nM), MEK kinase (1700 nM), HER1 receptor (180 nM), HER2 receptor (710 nM) and p38 (103 nM) (930003300).

The three major dasatinib metabolites, BMS-573188 (carboxylic acid), BMS-582691 (N-dealkylated), and BMS-606181 (N-oxide), were evaluated in vitro for their ability to inhibit or stimulate the binding of appropriate radioligands to 34 different receptors or ion channels and to inhibit the activities of 4 different  enzymes  (acetylcholinesterase,  monamine  oxidases  A  and  B,  and  phosphodiesterase-3). BMS-573188, and BMS-606181 at 10 µ M had no biologically relevant effect on binding of any of these ligands to their receptors or ion channels or on any enzyme activities evaluated. BMS-582691 at 10 µ M had ≥ 50% effects on 7 of the 34 receptors/channels evaluated (adrenergic β 2, non-selective adrenergic α 2,  non-selective  serotonin  5-HT1,  serotonin  5-HT1A,  norepinephrine  transporter,  and dopamine transporter receptors, and the sodium channel) (930011274).

## · Safety pharmacology programme

When tested in HEK cells stably transfected with the human hERG/IKr channel, dasatanib inhibited the hERG currents by 6, 37 and 77% at 3, 10 and 30 µM, respectively. The calculated IC50 was 14.3 µM. In accordance with these findings, 30 µM dasatinib prolonged APD50 by 26% and APD90 by 11% in the rabbit Purkinje fibre assay. The recorded action potential prolongations were ≤ 5% at 3 and 10 µM (non-GLP,  920018211).  Nevertheless  no  changes  in  ECG  parameters  were  observed  up  to  22 hours  following  administration  of  10  mg/kg  dasatinib  to  six  instrumented  conscious  monkeys. Treatment-related  findings  consisted  of  increases  in  systolic  (5  -15%)  and  diastolic  (8-21%)  blood pressure for  approximately two hours following dasatinib administration when compared to vehicle control  (GLP,  930005453).  In  addition,  no  effect  on  ECG  following  single-dose  administration  to monkeys at plasma exposure levels up to 27 times higher than what is seen in patients administered 70 mg/kg BID (n=2) (930003271). Moreover, no effect on heart rate or ECG (anesthetized animals) was observed in a one-month intermittent oral toxicity study in monkeys.

Evaluation of the potential effects of dasatinib on CNS and respiratory system were conducted as part of single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies in monkeys. Nervous system evaluations were conducted as part of comprehensive physical examinations and included assessments of temperament or behaviour, movement, coordination or balance/muscle tone, peripheral reflexes, proprioception, and functions of cranial nerves II through XII. These evaluations did not demonstrate any dasatinib-related changes in neurologic function at exposures approximately 3- to 28-fold greater than exposures in humans at the recommended clinical dose.

Respiratory  system  evaluations  included  assessments  of  lung  sounds  by  thoracic  auscultation  and respiratory  rate.  These  evaluations  did  not  demonstrate  any  dasatinib-related  changes  in  respiratory function at  exposures  approximately  3-  to  28-fold  greater  than  exposures  in  humans  at  the recommended clinical dose.

The  major  dasatinib  metabolites  were  tested  in  hERG  and  Purkinje  fibre  assays  for  their  potential effects  on  cardiac  function.  BMS-573188 inhibited IKr currents by approximately 6 and 11% at 10 and 30 µ M; BMS-582691 inhibited IKr currents by 24, 72, and 95% at 3, 10 and 30 µM; and BMS606181 inhibited IKr currents by 8 and 12% at 10 and 30 µ M, respectively. In the Purkinje-fibre assay at  30 µ M,  BMS-573188  and  BMS-606181  had  no  biologically  relevant  effects  on  action  potential duration, whereas BMS-582691 prolonged APD50 and APD90 by 10 and 9%, respectively (non-GLP, 930010945).

## · Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

It is possible that the onset of acquired drug resistance will be minimized by combining imatinib and dasatinib  treatment.  The  effect  of  concomitant  imatinib  and  dasatinib  treatment  was  investigated applying assays for cellular proliferation and BCR-ABL phosphorylation on Ba/F3 expressing wildtype  BCR-ABL and four common imatinib-resistant mutants (Y253F, E255K, T315I, and M351T).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The studies showed that dasatinib retains its inhibitory capacity when coadministered with imatinib at concentrations  several-fold  above  typical  clinical  levels.  In  fact,  co-administering  imatinib  with dasatinib  resulted  in  lower  cell  proliferation  IC 50  values  than  observed  with  the  single-treatments, suggesting  an  additive  antiproliferative  effect.  As  expected,  cells  expressing  the  BCR-ABL  mutant T315I were not sensitive to neither imatinib nor dasatinib treatment (O'Hare et al., 2005).

## Pharmacokinetics

Plasma samples collected from rats, rabbits, and monkeys in GLP toxicokinetic studies were analysed with validated  liquid  chromatography  with  tandem  mass  spectrometry  methods  to  determine concentrations  of  dasatinib.  Adequate  precision  and  accuracy  were  obtained  with  the  analytical methods.  The  toxicokinetic  method  validation  studies  were  not  GLP-compliant;  however  the toxicokinetic  evaluations  performed  in  the  course  of  the  toxicity  studies  were  compliant  with  GLP regulations.

Dasatinib was rapidly absorbed following oral administration to mice, rats, dogs and monkeys with Tmax ranging from 0.6 to 2.3 hours. The oral bioavailability was rather low with values ranging from 14% to 34%. The steady state volume of distribution of dasatinib in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys were greater than the volume of total body water, suggesting extravascular distribution of the drug. Based  on  a  Caco-2  permeability  assay  and in  vivo data,  dasatinib  does  not  appear  to  be  a  Pglycoprotein substrate.

The serum protein  binding  of  dasatinib  was  determined  by  equilibrium  dialysis  at  10  µM  and  was found to be 92%, 97%, 96%, 97%, and 94% in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human, respectively. The largest percentages of the radioactive dose were associated with tissues of the gastrointestinal tract and liver  following  a  single  PO  administration  of 14 C-dasatinib  to  Long-Evans  rats.  These  findings  are consistent with the oral route of dasatinib administration and major route of elimination in the faeces. At 168 h post-dose, radioactivity was only detected in 4 of the 22 sampled tissues (adrenal glands, eyes, kidneys, and liver). Dasatinib displayed melatonin affinity and absorbs light in the 290 to 700 nm range thus a phototoxicity study has been conducted by the Applicant.

The metabolism of 14 C-dasatinib was investigated in vivo in rats, monkeys, and humans following PO administration. Unchanged dasatinib was the most abundant drug-related component in the plasma of rats (34-55% at 1-8 h), monkeys (32% at 4 h), and humans (26% at 2 h). Still, the studies showed that dasatinib undergoes extensive oxidative metabolism and conjugation thus in total 29 metabolites were detected the samples collected from rats, monkeys, and humans. CYP3A4 appears to play a major role in  dasatinib  metabolism.  In  addition,  FMO3  seems  involved.  Multiple  glucuronide  conjugates  of dasatinib were detected, however the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes responsible for the direct glucuronidation of dasatinib have not been identified. Dasatinib treatment did  not  increase  CYP  enzyme  activity  or  expression  in  primary  human  hepatocytes  whereas  it inhibited the activites of liver microsome CYP2C8 (Ki of 3.6 µ M) and CYP3A4 (Ki = 1.9 µ M). A Cmax  value  of  0.12 µ M  has  been  reported  in  humans  and  accordingly,  there  is  a  possibility  of interactions between dasatinib and drugs that are CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrates. A clinical drug interaction study showed that coadministration with the CYP3A4 substrate simvastatin increased the exposures  of  simvastatin  and  simvastatin  acid  with  approximately  20%  and  27%,  respectively. Warnings are given in the SPC on the risk for pharmacokinetic drug interactions when dasatinib is coadministered  with  other  CYP3A4  substrates.  However,  the  risk  for  interactions  with  CYP2C8 substrates (e.g. the cancer drug paclitaxel, glitazones, torsemide) has not been evaluated.

Biliary excretion was the predominant route for dasatinib elimination in rats, monkeys and humans following oral administration whereas urinary excretion only played a minor role.

## Toxicology

Dasatinib was administered PO in all the toxicological studies since this is the intended clinical way of administration.

## · Single dose toxicity

Single-dose toxicity was  evaluated in rats and monkeys.  Mortalities were observed in rats administered  100  mg/kg.  All  monkeys  were  sacrificed  due  to  a  moribund  condition  following

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

administration of 45 mg/kg; a dose resulting in dasatinib plasma exposure levels 27 times higher than is  observed  in  patients  administered  70  mg/kg  BID.  The  major  target  tissues  appeared  to  be  skin (haemorrhage),  immune  system  (lymphoid  depletion  and  decrease  in  lymphocytes),  gastrointestinal tract  (ulceration,  haemorrhage),  kidney  (kidney  tubule  dilatation)  and  heart  (haemorrhage  and/or necrosis).  In  addition,  bone  resorption  was  inhibited  leading  to  decreased  plasma  calcium  and phosphorus levels. The majority of the findings were reversible or partially reversible within the 14 Days recovery period.

Based  on  toxicokinetic  analysis  performed  in  monkeys,  dasatinib  plasma  exposure  (AUC)  was  on average  2493,  4587  and  8258  for  both  sexes  following  administration  of  15,  25  and  45  mg/kg, respectively. The obtained exposure levels were approximately 8, 15 and 27 times higher than what is seen in patients administered 70 mg/kg BID.

## · Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics)

Repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats and Cynomolgus monkeys. All doses and concentrations were corrected for free base content and drug purity. The vehicle consisted either of sodium acetate buffer or sodium citrate buffer.

An exploratory repeat-dose toxicity study conducted in two dogs was discontinued after two days due to  gastrointestinal  toxicity  (930003268).  Dasatinib  treatment  (5  mg/kg)  induced  emesis  and  bloody vomitus  and  liquid,  mucous  and  bloody  faeces  within  two  hours  post-dosing.  Additional  findings consisted  of  red  discolouration  of  the  mesenteric  lymph  node  and  mucosae  of  the  stomach,  small intestine  and  colon.  Microscopically,  thymic  lymphoid  depletion  was  observed  in  the  female. Decreases in total protein, albumin, and globulins were observed.

The gastrointestinal, haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the major target organs in the repeatdose toxicity studies. The major dose-limiting event was gastrointestinal toxicity and in the 9-month monkey  study,  animals  were  euthanized  due  to  GI  toxicity  when  exposed  to  clinically  relevant dasatinib plasma levels. In rats, mortalities were observed in studies of 4 weeks duration or longer at plasma  exposure  levels  (AUC)  four-fold  higher  than  observed  in  patients  (70  mg  BID).  The predominant causes of death in rats were GI and lymphoid toxicity. Consistent GI findings were doserelated  enteropathy,  faecal  abnormalities,  vomiting,  distension  of  the  GI  tract  with  gas/fluid/digesta and  GI  tract  haemorrhage.  Microscopic  evaluations  performed  in  rats  detected  dose-related  villus alterations  in  the  small  intestine  along  with  epithelial  hyperplasia  and  fibrosis.  In  addition,  small intestine villous blunting and inflammation were recorded in monkeys. The haematology and clinical chemistry findings suggested inflammation, blood loss, poor food consumption and electrolyte loss. The GI toxicity findings occurred at clinically relevant AUC levels. Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are  very  common  findings  in  the  clinical  setting  while  e.g.  GI  haemorrhage,  stomatitis,  colitis  and abdominal  pain  are  common  findings  in  patients  undergoing  dasatinib  treatment.  Bleeding  is exacerbated by treatment since dasatinib prolongs bleeding time via an effect on platelet function and bleeding-related  events  have  been  reported  in  patients  taking  dasatinib.  Erythroid  toxicity  was observed  in  the  form  of  reduced  erythrocytes,  haemoglobin  and  haematocrit  counts.  Moreover,  a reduction  in  the  number  of  erythroid  cells  was  observed  in  the  bone  marrow  of  monkeys  without safety  margin.  Anaemia  is  a  common  finding  in  dasatinib-treated  patients.  Lymphoid  toxicity  was observed in the form of lymphoid depletion of the thymus and spleen and an accompanying reduction in thymus and spleen weight. In addition, reductions in plasma lymphocytes and splenic T-cells and Bcells were observed in rats. Hypocellularity of the bone marrow was observed in rats at a dose giving rise to 4 to 6-fold higher AUC values than observed in patients. Infections were not observed in the non-clinical  studies  but  are  common  in  the  clinical  setting.  Dasatanib  potently  inhibits  osteoclastic bone resorption and reduced plasma calcium and/or phosphorus levels were frequent findings in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. Increases in liver weight and aspartate aminotransferase were observed in rats  without  correlative  microscopic  findings.  Furthermore,  increased  heart  weight  (no  microscopic findings), increased ovary weight and an increase in corpora lutea were observed in dasatinib-treated rats.  These  findings  were  also  observed  in  a  long-term  toxicity  study  conducted  with  imatinib. Dasatinib administration caused an increase in the incidence and severity of kidney mineralization in the  monkey  9-month  toxicity  study.  In  addition,  an  increase  in  prerenal  or  renal  azotemia  was observed. No signs of renal function impairment were detected in the other non-clinical studies. All dasatinib-related  changes  were  generally  reversible  in  surviving  animals  except  for  the  increase  in kidney mineralization.

## · Genotoxicity

The genotoxic potential of dasatinib was evaluated in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. Moderate  to  marked  cytotoxicity  was  observed  in  the Salmonella and E.  coli strains  cultured  at dasatinib concentrations of 400 and 1600 µg/plate, respectively. Dasatinib was tested for its ability to induce  chromosomal  aberrations  in  CHO  cells  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  metabolic  activation (S9) and with treatment period of 4 or 20 hours. Under the conditions tested, dasatinib was clastogenic at the highest concentrations evaluated with 12-31% structural aberrations versus 0% for the vehicle control. Cytotoxicity was observed at these concentrations levels. At lower dasatinib concentrations, the  percentage of cells  with  structural  aberrations  (1.5-5%)  were  within  the  historical  control  range although  a  significant  increase  was  detected  when  compared  to  vehicle  control.  No  chromosomal aberrations  were  observed  at  2.5  µg/mL  following  20  h  incubation  in  the  absence  of  metabolic activation. There was no significant increase in the incidence of numerical aberrations. Dasatinib did not  increase  the  frequency  of  polychromatic  erythrocytes  (PCE)  with  micronuclei  when  compared with to the vehicle control values. Bone marrow toxicity was observed at the 20 and 40 mg/kg dose levels with PCE reductions of approximately 20 and 45%, respectively.

## · Carcinogenicity

No studies have been performed.

## · Reproduction Toxicity

Dasatanib's  potential  effects  on  embryo-foetal  development  were  evaluated  in  pregnant  rats  and rabbits.

In rats, administration of dasatinib during the period of organogenesis induced embryolethality at all doses  with  17%,  77%,  100%  and  100%  resorbed  conceptuses  per  litter  at  2.5,  5,  10,  or  20  mg/kg, respectively.  Foetal  skeletal  alterations  at  2.5  and  5  mg/kg/day  (mean  maternal  AUC  values ≤ 239 ng·hr/mL) included bent scapula or humerus and reduced ossification of the sternebrae and thoracic vertebral  centra.  Besides  skeletal  findings,  foetal  abnormalities  at  5  mg/kg/day  included  fluid-filled thoracic and abdominal cavities, oedema and small liver. There were no surviving foetuses at 10 or 20 mg/kg/day (mean maternal AUC values of 1270 to 1490 ng·hr/mL). Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses ≥ 10 mg/kg/day; mortality occurred at 20 mg/kg/day.

Embryolethality with associated decreases in litter size was observed at 10 mg/kg/day dasatinib in a rabbit  dose-finding  study,  whereas  lower  doses  did  not  give  rise  to  embryo-foetal  findings.  In  the pivotal rabbit study, dasatinib induced foetal skeletal alterations in the absence of maternal toxicity at all  doses  (0.5,  2,  or  6  mg/kg/day,  mean  AUC  values ≥ 44  ng·hr/mL).  The  skeletal  abnormalities consisted of delays in ossification of foetal lumbar vertebrae and pelvis. At 6 mg/kg, dasatinib also caused irregular ossification of the hyoid. Thus, dasatinib caused foetal alterations in rats and rabbits at doses that did not produce maternal toxicity.

## · Local tolerance

No studies were conducted.

## · Other toxicity studies

Dasatinib was phototoxic in a neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay performed in BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblast (in duplicate trials, PIF values were 12 and 37 and MPE values were 0.2 and 0.4).

## Immunotox

Dasatinib at daily doses of 20 and 50 mg/kg for 3 days inhibited the proliferation of murine splenic Tcells  in  a  dose-dependent manner. In the cardiac transplant study, dasatinib given twice daily at 25 mg/kg for up to 30 days inhibited graft rejection in mice. The observed immunosuppression appeared comparable to that of cyclosporine. However, 15 mg/kg given twice daily (continuous daily dosing) or 25  mg/kg  given  twice  daily  (5-days  on  and  2-days  off  schedule)  for  30  days  did  not  extend  graft survival time.

Immunotoxicity was observed in the standard toxicity studies in the form of lymphoid depletion of the thymus and spleen and an accompanying reduction in thymus and spleen weight at clinically relevant doses in long-term studies. Hypocellularity of the bone marrow was observed in rats at a dose giving rise  to  4  to  6-fold  higher  AUC  values  than  observed  in  patients.  In  addition,  reductions  in  plasma lymphocytes and splenic T-cells and B-cells were observed in rats administered 15 mg/kg dasatinib

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

for  two  weeks  (rat:human  AUC  exposure  margin  around  3).  Despite  the  decreases  in  splenic lymphocyte subpopulations and weights at 15 mg/kg, dasatinib treatment did not have any adverse effect on the T-cell dependent antibody response to the antigen Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH).

## Other

Dasatanib potently inhibited osteoclastic bone resorption. Dasatinib dose-dependently inhibited PTHstimulated release of 45 Ca into the medium by fetal rat long bones in vitro with an apparent IC50 of 2 nM.  At  5  nM  dasatinib  completely  blocked  PTH-stimulated  bone  resorption in  vitro .  Moreover, dasatinib blocked the normalization of plasma calcium in the thyro-parathyroidectomized rat model after PTH infusion.

In vitro ,  dasatinib inhibited agonist-induced platelet aggregation in human, monkey, and rat plateletrich plasma at concentrations of 0.5 and 5 µ g/mL, but no effect was observed at 0.05 µ g/mL (0.1 µ M). Dasatinib  produced  near-complete  (94%)  inhibition  of  shear-induced  platelet  aggregation  of  human platelets at 5 µ g/mL, with 46% inhibition at 0.5 µ g/mL, and no effect at 0.05 µ g/mL. The effect of dasatinib on human whole blood clot formation was limited to a 29% reduction in clot strength at 5 µ g/mL, with no effect at 0.5 µ g/mL. In vivo , dasatinib at mean plasma concentrations ≥ 144 ng/mL in rats prolonged cuticle bleeding time, but did not cause spontaneous bleeding. Bleeding time was not extended at a plasma exposure of 61 ng/mL.

## Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

In the calculations of PECSW, the market penetration factor (normally default 1%) was calculated to 0.006 µg/L. Studies were performed including an acute toxicity study in green algae, a full life-cycle toxicity test in Daphnia magna and an acute toxicity study in rainbow trout. In addition, dasatinib was evaluated with respect to activated sludge respiration inhibition and the biodegradation and adsorption of  dasatinib  was  determined  under  aerobic  conditions  in  an  activated  sludge  respiration  inhibition study. Altogether, the evaluation of PEC/PNEC ratios for surface water, groundwater and wastewater treatment microorganisms all gave ratios well below 1.

## · Discussion on the non-clinical aspects

With IC50 values in the lower nM range, dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of members of five tyrosine kinase families: SRC family kinases (SRC, LCK, YES, FYN), BCR-ABL, KIT, EPHA2 and PDGF β .

The pharmacokinetics of dasatinib were evaluated in 229 adult healthy subjects and in 84 patients.



Dasatinib  is  rapidly  absorbed  in  patients  following  oral  administration,  with  peak  concentrations between  0.5-3 hours.  Following  oral  administration,  the  increase  in  the  mean  exposure  (AUC τ )  is approximately proportional to the dose increment across doses ranging from 25 mg to 120 mg BID. The overall mean terminal half-life of dasatinib is approximately 5-6 hours in patients.

Data from healthy subjects administered a single, 100 mg dose of dasatinib 30 minutes following a high-fat  meal  indicated  a  14%  increase  in  the  mean  AUC  of  dasatinib.  A  low-fat  meal  30 minutes prior to dasatinib resulted in a 21% increase in the mean AUC of dasatinib. The observed food effects do not represent clinically relevant changes in exposure.

In  patients,  dasatinib  has  a  large  apparent  volume  of  distribution  (2,505 l)  suggesting  that  the medicinal  product  is  extensively  distributed in the extravascular space. At  clinically relevant concentrations of dasatinib, binding to plasma proteins was approximately 96% on the basis of in vitro experiments.

Dasatinib is extensively metabolized in humans with multiple enzymes involved in the generation of the  metabolites.  In  healthy  subjects  administered  100 mg  of  [ 14 C]-labelled  dasatinib,  unchanged dasatinib represented 29% of circulating radioactivity in plasma. Plasma concentration and measured in vitro activity indicate that metabolites of dasatinib are unlikely to play a major role in the observed pharmacology of the product. CYP3A4 is a major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dasatinib. Elimination is predominantly in the faeces, mostly as metabolites. Following a single oral dose of [ 14 C]labelled dasatinib, approximately 89% of the dose was eliminated within 10 days, with 4% and 85% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine and faeces, respectively. Unchanged dasatinib accounted for 0.1% and 19% of the dose in urine and faeces, respectively, with the remainder of the dose as metabolites. Dasatinib  and  its  metabolites  are  minimally  excreted  via  the  kidney.  Exposure  to  dasatinib  may  be expected to increase if liver function is impaired.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The gastrointestinal, haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the major target organs in the repeatdose toxicity studies. The major dose-limiting event was gastrointestinal toxicity and in the 9-month monkey  study,  animals  were  euthanized  due  to  GI  toxicity  when  exposed  to  clinically  relevant dasatinib plasma levels. In rats, mortalities were observed in studies of 4 weeks duration or longer at plasma  exposure  levels  (AUC)  four-fold  higher  than  observed  in  patients  (70  mg  BID).  The predominant causes of death in rats were GI and lymphoid toxicity. Consistent GI findings were doserelated  enteropathy,  faecal  abnormalities,  vomiting,  distension  of  the  GI  tract  with  gas/fluid/digesta and GI tract haemorrhage

The  haematology  and  clinical  chemistry  findings  suggested  inflammation,  blood  loss,  poor  food consumption and electrolyte loss. The GI toxicity findings occurred at clinically relevant AUC levels. Bleeding is exacerbated by treatment since dasatinib prolongs bleeding time via an effect on platelet function  erythroid  toxicity  was  observed  in  the  form  of  reduced  erythrocytes,  haemoglobin  and haematocrit  counts.  Anaemia  is  a  common  finding  in  dasatinib-treated  patients.  Lymphoid  toxicity was  observed  in  the  form  of  lymphoid  depletion  of  the  thymus  and  spleen  and  an  accompanying reduction in thymus and spleen weight. In addition, reductions in plasma lymphocytes and splenic Tcells and B-cells were observed in rats. Hypocellularity of the bone marrow was observed in rats at a dose  giving  rise  to  4  to  6-fold  higher  AUC  values  than  observed  in  patients.  All  dasatinib-related changes were generally reversible in surviving animals except for an increase in kidney mineralization.

Dasatinib  was  clastogenic  in  CHO  cells.  The  lowest  nonclastogenic  concentration  of  2.5 µ g/mL is approximately 50-fold greater  than the  maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)  measured in humans given the recommended  clinical dose of 70 mg  BID. According to ICH  S1A, long-term carcinogenicity studies are not required when the life-expectancy in the indicated population is short (i.e. less than 2-3 years). Consequently, the lack of carcinogenicity studies for dasatinib is justified.

Considering the indication the lack of a fertility study is acceptable. Administration of dasatinib to rats during  the  period  of  organogenesis  induced  embryolethality  at  clinically  relevant  maternal  plasma exposures (AUC). In addition, dasatinib induced foetal skeletal alterations in the absence of maternal toxicity in rats and rabbits at clinically relevant maternal plasma exposures.

The  lack  of  a  prenatal  and  postnatal  development  study  is  acceptable  when  considering  the  lifethreatening indication.

Dasatinib was phototoxic in the neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay and this is stated in the SPC section 5.3. Dasatinib treatment inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation and causes reductions in plasma  lymphocytes  and  splenic  T-cells  and  B-cells.  Immunotoxicty  studies  demonstrated  that  a threshold  exists  for  the  dasatinib-induced  immunosuppressive  effect  but  based  on  the  non-clinical studies  some  immunotoxicity  findings  are  expected  in  the  clinic.  Dasatinib  inhibited  platelet aggregation in human, monkey, and rat platelet-rich plasma in  vitro .  The  no-effect concentration of 0.05 µ g/mL is equivalent to the plasma Cmax measured in humans given the clinical dose of 70 mg BID. In vivo , dasatinib in rats prolonged cuticle bleeding time, but did not cause spontaneous bleeding. In accordance with what has been reported for other SRC tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dasatanib potently inhibits osteoclastic bone  resorption when  tested in vitro and in vivo at clinically relevant concentrations.

Dasatinib is unlikely to represent a risk to the environment.

## · Absorption

Dasatinib is rapidly absorbed in subjects following oral administration. The oral bioavailability was low with values ranging from 14% to 34%. The steady state volume of distribution of dasatinib in mice,  rats,  dogs  and  monkeys  was  greater  than  the  volume  of  total  body  water,  suggesting extravascular  distribution  of  the  drug.  Mean  peak  concentrations  at  the  suggested  clinical  dose regimen of 70 mg twice daily were observed between median Tmax of 1.00 to 1.42 hours either in healthy subjects or in leukaemia patients.

## · Distribution

On the basis of in vitro studies at clinically relevant concentrations (100 and 500 ng/mL), binding of dasatinib to serum proteins was approximately 96%. Dasatinib distributes freely in human red blood cells;  the  blood  to  plasma  concentration  ratio  was  1.8.  The  Vz/F  after  multiple  dosing  with  the proposed  therapeutic  dose  of  70  mg  q12h  for  5  or  8  days  was  2505  L.  In  animals,  the  absolute bioavailability of dasatinib ranged from 14% to 34%. Assuming the most conservative value of F in humans (15.2%), Vz corrected for oral bioavailability is calculated (0.152·Vz/F) to be approximately 381 L. The apparent volume of distribution is about 9-fold greater than total body water suggesting an extensive extravascular distribution in humans.

## · Metabolism

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In human liver microsomes, dasatinib inhibited CYP2A6 (IC50 = 35 µ M), CYP2C8 (IC50 = 12 µ M), CYP2C9 (IC50 = 50 µ M), and CYP3A4 (IC50 values of 18 and 10 µ M for midazolam and testosterone substrates, respectively).CYP2C8 inhibition by dasatinib followed a competitive inhibition model with a  Ki  of  3.6 µ M. While none of the other enzymes tested showed any signs of time-dependent CYP inhibition, CYP3A4 inhibition by dasatinib was time-dependent with a KI = 1.9 µ M. Dasatinib has little potential to induce CYP3A4 and, at concentrations ≤ 25 µ M, dasatinib did not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, and 3A4 in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.

The metabolism of 14 C-dasatinib was investigated in vivo in rats, monkeys, and humans following PO administration. Unchanged dasatinib was the most abundant drug-related component in the plasma of rats  (34-55%  at  1-8  h),  monkeys  (32%  at  4  h),  and  humans  (26%  at  2  h).  Nevertheless  studies demonstrated, that dasatinib undergoes extensive oxidative metabolism and conjugation. In total 29 metabolites were detected. CYP3A4 appears to play a major role in dasatinib metabolism. Dasatinib treatment inhibited the activites of liver microsome CYP2C8 (Ki of 3.6 µ M) and CYP3A4 (Ki = 1.9 µ M). A Cmax value of 0.12 µ M has been reported in humans.

## · Elimination

Following repeated doses of 70 mg orally administered dasatinib in the target population, the terminal elimination half-life was 5.4 hours (SD3.5), and apparent oral clearance was 578 L/h (SD 537).

Subjects  eliminated  radioactivity  primarily  in  faeces.  Mean  total  recoveries  of  total  radioactivity through 9 days post-dose were approximately 4% and 85% in urine and faeces, respectively, with a mean total of approximately 89%. Negligible amounts of dasatinib and BMS-606181 were excreted in the urine ( ≤ 1% of dose) and approximately 19% of the dose was recovered in the faeces as dasatinib.

## · Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Dose  proportionality  was  examined  in  an  open-label,  Phase  1,  dose-escalation  study  administered orally to patients with chronic, accelerated, or blast phase chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  who  have  primary  or  acquired haematologic resistance to or intolerance of imatinib mesylate. Patients received the following dosing regimens of dasatinib in the fasted state:

- 15,  30,  50,  75,  105,  140,  or  180  mg  once  daily  (15-180  mg/day)  for  5  consecutive  days followed by 2 non-treatment days every week (Q5D Regimen)
- 25, 35, 50, or 70 mg twice daily (50-140 mg/day) for 5 consecutive days followed by 2 nontreatment days every week (B5D Regimen)
- 35,  50,  70,  90,  or  120  mg  twice  daily  (70-240  mg/day)  continuous  dosing  schedule  (B7D Regimen)

The AUC of dasatinib is approximately dose proportional in the dose range of 15 to 240 mg/day. The 90% CIs are wide, indicating that the variability in AUC is high. Similar results were obtained when AUC(TAU) was analyzed separately for the q12h and QD regimens.

For the suggested clinical dosing regimen of 70mg twice daily, the geometric means for accumulation index ranged between 1.60 and 1.73 on day 8 and between 0.78 to 1.53 on Day 29.

## · Special populations

The PK of dasatinib has not been studied in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function.

No PK studies have been performed in children.

No marked gender, race (Caucasian vs. other) or age (&lt;65, &gt;65) differences in the PK parameters of dasatinib in healthy subjects have been detected.

## · Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

## In vivo

The potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions has been subject to clinical drug interaction studies with rifampin, simvastatine, famotinine and an antacid.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Rifampicin decreases mean Cmax and AUC of dasatinib by 81% and 82%, respectively.

## Simvastatine:

Mean Cmax and AUC (INF) of simvastatin were increased by 37% and 20%, respectively, and the mean Cmax and AUC (INF) of simvastatin acid were increased by 41% and 27%, respectively, when simvastatin was administered in combination with a single 100 mg dose of dasatinib.

When 30 mL of aluminium hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide-containing antacid was administered to the same subjects concomitantly with a 50 mg dose of dasatinib, a 55% reduction in dasatinib AUC, and  a  58%  reduction  in  Cmax  were  observed.  When  a  single  50  mg  dose  of  dasatinib  was administered to 24 healthy subjects 10 hours following famotidine, the AUC and Cmax of dasatinib were reduced by 61% and 63%, respectively.

## Pharmacodynamics

No clinical Pharmacodynamic studies have been performed.

## Clinical efficacy

- Dose response study(ies)

Determination of the recommended dose was developed based upon:

- 1) Non-clinical pharmacology and clinical pharmacokinetic information

2) Efficacy in subjects with chronic, accelerated, or blast phase CML resistant or intolerant to imatinib The in vitro inhibitory concentration (IC50) against imatinib-naive strains ranged from 0.7 nM - 1.8 nM, and the IC50 against imatinib-resistant strains ranged from 1 nM - 2.1 nM. After adjusting for protein binding, the IC50 of dasatinib in vivo is estimated to be in the range of 17.5 to 52.5 nM. On the proposed 70 mg BID dosing regimen, the geometric mean Cmax for dasatinib on day 5/8 is 2.4- to 7.4-fold higher than the in vivo protein binding adjusted IC50, and mean concentration is above the protein-binding adjusted IC50 for 10 of 12 hours in each dosing interval. This compares with a mean concentration that is above the target concentration for 4 of 12 hours on the 50 mg BID regimen, and for 12 of 24 hours on the 140 mg QD regimen.

In study CA180002 (40 subjects were in chronic phase and 44 subjects had advanced disease), intrasubject  dose  escalation  and  schedule  escalation  were  allowed  in  order  to  optimize  an  individual subject's haematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular response while maintaining and evaluating safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, BCR-ABL  mutation  status, and dasatinib's effect on specific biomarkers. In this study, the majority (83%) of subjects were resistant to imatinib, and doses were escalated from 15 mg QD to 180 mg QD (chronic phase), 25 mg BID to 90 mg BID (chronic phase), and  35  mg  BID  to  120  mg  BID  (advanced  phases).  In  all  cohorts,  haematologic  and  cytogenetic responses were reported.

Pharmacokinetic information showed that doses greater than 50 mg BID produced serum concentrations  of  dasatinib  above  the  level  of  the  IC50  of  in  vitro  growth  inhibition  assays. Pharmacodynamic  information  showed  that  phosphorylated  CRKL,  a  substrate  of  BCR-ABL,  was inhibited over a greater period of time with the BID regimen than the QD regimen and provided a rationale for the BID dosing regimen. Although this study was not powered for a comparison between dosing  schedules,  the  BID  and  QD  schedules  in  chronic  phase  showed  no  difference  in  efficacy despite  the  pharmacodynamic  data  showing  more  prolonged  BCR-ABL  inhibition  with  the  BID regimen.

A review of each subject's dosing and the date a haematologic and cytogenetic response were noted shows that most subjects (9 of 14 with CCyR) in chronic phase CML achieved a CCyR at doses of 100 - 140 mg total daily dose of dasatinib.  One subject achieved a CCyR at 50 mg QD of dasatinib who was previously imatinib intolerant. Three subjects achieved a CCyR at 70 - 75 mg total daily dose. No one achieved a CCyR at 15 or 30 mg QD.

CHR  was  achieved  across  doses  ranging  from  15  -  180  mg  QD  and  from  25  -  70  mg  BID.  In accelerated  phase  CML,  CHR  was  achieved  at  all  dose  levels  ranging  from  50  -  120  mg  BID  and CCyR was achieved at the 70 mg BID (1 subject) and 120 mg BID (1 subject) dose levels only. In blast phase CML, CHR and NEL were achieved in all dose levels ranging from 35 - 90 mg BID but in no subject at 120 mg BID. In blast phase CML, CCyR was reported at doses ranging from 50 - 90 mg BID. No CCyR was noted at 35 mg BID, 120 mg BID nor the majority of the 50 mg BID doses.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Although this trial  was  not  designed  to  determine  responses  at  each  dose  level  and  the  majority  of subjects  (40  out  of  84)  began  treatment  with  dasatinib  at  a  total  daily  dose  of  100  -  140  mg/day, haematologic responses were noted in subjects taking 15 - 180 mg/day and most complete cytogenetic responses occurred in subjects taking dasatinib doses in the 100 - 140 mg/day range, thus, a dose of 70 mg BID was concluded as a reasonable dose for Phase 2 studies.

## · Main study(ies)

The claimed efficacy is based upon 6 studies, one Phase 1 and five pivotal Phase 2, in subjects with chronic,  accelerated,  myeloid  blast,  and  lymphoid  blast  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  (CML)  and Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Safety and efficacy data collected on 481 treated subjects with leukaemia from 5 pivotal Phase  2  studies  (CA180005,  CA180006,  CA180013,  CA180015,  and  CA180017)  comprise  the primary efficacy and safety analyses for the current application.

IM-R: imatinib-resistant subjects; IM-I: imatinib-intolerant subjects

a Additional subjects were enrolled until other dasatinib studies could be initiated. The total number of enrolled subjects  reflects  the  enrolment  number  in  the  interactive  voice  response  system.  All  treated  subjects  were counted  once.  However,  some  subjects  were  counted  twice  in  enrolment  numbers  because  disease  status necessitated rolling over from one study to a different study.

b In CA180017, the first 36 randomized and treated (with dasatinib [N = 22] or imatinib [N = 14]) subjects were included in the interim analysis.

Study  CA180013: A  Phase  2  Study  (open-label)  to  Determine  the  Activity  of  BMS-354825  in Subjects  with  Chronic  Phase  Philadelphia  Chromosome  Positive  Chronic  Myeloid  Leukemia  who have Disease that is Resistant to High Dose Imatinib or who are Intolerant of Imatinib

## METHODS

## Study Participants

Subjects of either gender, at least 18 years of age, who signed informed consent and who have chronic phase CML and imatinib resistant/intolerant criteria were included.

Resistance or intolerance to imatinib defined as 1 of the following:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

a) developed  progressive  disease  while  being  treated  with  imatinib  &gt;  600  mg/day  with  acquired  or primary resistance defined as follows:

- i) acquired resistance to imatinib. Subjects who achieved MCyR or CHR on imatinib at any dose prior to progression, defined by 1 of the following:
- loss of MCyR: achieved a confirmed MCyR and subsequently no longer met the MCyR criteria, and had a ≥ 30% increase in Ph+ metaphases on
3. 2 cytogenetic analyses performed at least 4 weeks apart while receiving imatinib
- loss of CHR: achieved a confirmed CHR and subsequently no longer met the CHR criteria consistently on all assessments over a consecutive 2 week period while receiving imatinib
- an increasing white-cell count: defined as a doubling of the count from the nadir to more than 20,000 per cubic millimeter or an increase by more than 50,000 per cubic millimeter on 2 occasions at least 2 weeks apart in the subject who had never strictly had a CHR despite receiving maximally tolerated doses of therapy

ii) primary resistance to imatinib. Subjects who never achieved MCyR or CHR at any dose, and met one of the following continuously increasing white blood cell count on at least  2  consecutive  evaluations  at  least  2  weeks  apart  with  the  final  assessment  showing  a doubling of WBC from the nadir to ≥ 20,000/mm3 or an absolute increase in WBC by more than  50,000/  mm3  above  lowest  count  after  starting  imatinib  no  CHR  after  3  months,  no cytogenetic response (CyR) after 6 months and no MCyR after 12 months b) CML with resistance to imatinib ≤ 600 mg/d with genetic mutation in the BCR-ABL gene that was associated with a high level of resistance to imatinib.

(L248V, G250E, Q252H/R, Y253H/F, E255K/V, T315I/D, F317L, H369P/R).

- c) intolerant of imatinib at any dose. Subjects intolerant to imatinib 800 mg must have demonstrated progressive disease or lack of CyR at doses ≤ 600 mg. Intolerance was defined as:
- i) Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity that is imatinib-related
3. ii) Grade 4 hematologic toxicity that is imatinib-related lasting more than 7 days

Subjects were excluded if they suffer from uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, had a history of a significant bleeding disorder unrelated to CML, previous diagnosis of accelerated phase or blast crisis CML or concurrent incurable malignancy other than CML.

## Treatments

Dasatinib was administered continuous daily at an oral dose of 70 mg BID. Dose modifications were allowed  for  management  of  disease  progression  or  toxicity.  Subjects  with  evidence  of  disease progression could have their dose increased to 90 mg BID, in the absence of prohibitive toxicity.

## Objectives

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  estimate  the  MCyR  rate  to  dasatinib  in  subjects  with chronic phase CML who had disease that was resistant to imatinib.

Secondary objectives were to estimate the MCyR rate in the imatinib-intolerant subjects and to assess the durability of MCyR and time to MCyR in the imatinib-resistant and the imatinib-intolerant groups

## Outcomes/endpoints

Determination of cytogenetic response was based on the prevalence of Ph+ metaphases among cells with metaphases in a bone marrow sample. If possible at least 20 metaphases were evaluated, please refer to the following table:

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

|                                        | Ph+ Cells in Metaphase in Bone Marrow   |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) a | 0%                                      |
| Partial Cytogenetic Response (PCyR) a  | 1% to 35%                               |
| Minor Cytogenetic Response             | 36% to 65%                              |
| Minimal Cytogenetic Response           | 66% to 95%                              |
| No Cytogenetic Response                | 96% to 100%                             |

## Source: Appendix 1.1

a Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) is the combination of CCyR and PCyR.

## CHR was defined as:

- 1) WBC ≤ institutional ULN
- 2) platelets &lt; 450,000/mm3
- 3) no blasts or promyelocytes in peripheral blood
- 4) &lt; 5% myelocytes plus metamyelocytes in peripheral blood
- 5) peripheral blood basophils &lt; 20%
- 6) no extramedullary involvement (including no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly).

Response, as defined, must be maintained for at least 4 weeks after first documented. A CHR could begin only 14 days after dosing start date.

## Sample size

With a minimum accrual of 100 imatinib-resistant treated subjects, the maximum width of the exact 2sided 95% confidence interval (CI) would have been 19% if the MCyR rate was in the expected 5% to 30% range.

## Randomisation and Blinding (masking)

Not applicable since this study had an unblinded single-arm design.

## Statistical methods

Frequency  tables  were  used  to  summarize  categorical  variables.  Continuous  and  other  numeric variables  were  summarized  with  the  number  of  observations,  mean,  standard  deviation,  median, minimum and maximum. Response rates (haematologic and cytogenetic) were estimated along with their  95%  exact  CIs  based  on  the  Clopper-Pearson  method.  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  the  median time-to and durations of MCyR and CHR were provided along with their 95% CIs. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the probability curve was also provided.

## Recruitment

The study population for this interim analysis is subjects who were enrolled by 12-May-2005 and received their first dose of study drug by 31-May-2005. A total of 201 subjects were enrolled in the study by May 12, 2005.

## Conduct of the study

Major changes incorporated in this amendment were eliminating the possible use of anagrelide in case of thrombocytosis in subjects with CML, as this is not an approved indication for the use of anagrelide in Europe (28-Apr-2005).

## Baseline data

The median time from initial  diagnosis  of  CML  to  first  dosing  with  dasatinib  was  64  months  (5.3 years, range = 4 to 251 months). Notably, this duration was longer in the imatinib-resistant subjects (median 77 months or 6.4 years, range 4 - 251 months) than the imatinib-intolerant subjects (median 26 months or 2.2 years, range 4 - 145 months).

A majority of imatinib-resistant subjects (72%) had received more than 3 years of prior therapy with imatinib; the highest dose of imatinib was &gt; 600 mg/day in 72% of subjects.

A majority of imatinib-intolerant subjects (54%) had received less than 1 year of prior therapy with imatinib; the highest dose of imatinib was 400-600 mg/day in 92% of subjects.

Fifty-nine  subjects  in  this  study  were  determined  to  be  imatinib-intolerant.  The  primary  reasons included  rash,  hepatotoxicity,  arthralgia,  gastrointestinal  symptoms,  oedema,  haematologic  toxicity,

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

and 'other'. The 'other' reasons included: pulmonary toxicity, fatigue, weight gain, anaphylaxis, and renal failure.

## Numbers analysed

All over 186 subjects have been treated. The evaluable for cytogenetic response data set consisted of 169 subjects and for cytogenetic response based on ≥ 20 metaphases consisted of 151 subjects. 226 subjects have been additionally enrolled.

## Outcomes and estimation

At  a  median  follow-up  of  6  months,  the  MCyR  was  45%  (83/186)  ( 52% in  updated  analysis  at  8 months  median  follow-up) in  the  total  population,  31%  (40/127)  ( 39%  in  update) in  the  imatinibresistant subjects, and 73% (43/59) ( 80% in update) in the imatinib-intolerant subjects.

The median time for imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant subjects to achieve MCyR was 85 days. The complete haematologic response (CHR) rate was 90% in the total population including 87% in the primary target population of imatinib-resistant subjects and 97% in the imatinib-intolerant subjects. The median time for imatinib-resistant subjects to achieve CHR was 16 days.

A table demonstrating combined efficacy outcomes for all phase II studies is shown under 'Analysis performed across trials'.

Study  CA180017 is an open-label, randomised,  non-comparative  multicenter  study  that  was conducted in patients who failed initial treatment with 400 or 600 mg imatinib. They were randomised (2:1) to either dasatinib (70 mg BID) or imatinib (400 mg BID). Crossover to the alternative treatment arm was allowed if patients showed evidence of disease progression or intolerance that could not be managed by dose modification. Updated results are available for 150 patients : 101 were randomised to  SPRYCEL  and  49  to  imatinib  (all  imatinib-resistant).  The  median  time  from  diagnosis  to randomisation was 64 months in the dasatinib group and 52 months in the imatinib group. All subjects were extensively pretreated. Prior complete haematologic response (CHR) to imatinib was achieved in 91% of the overall patient population. A prior MCyR to imatinib was achieved in 28% and 29% of the patients in the dasatinib and imatinib arms, respectively.

Median  duration  of  treatment  was  5.5 months  for  dasatinib  (with  38%  of  patients  treated  for &gt; 6 months to date) and 3.2 months for imatinib (with 6% of patients treated for &gt; 6 months to date). In the dasatinib arm, 92% of patients achieved a CHR prior to cross-over, 82% of the patients in the imatinib  arm  achieved  a  CHR  prior  to  cross-over.  At  a  median  follow-up  of  3 months,  a  MCyR occurred  more  often  in  the  dasatinib  arm  (35%)  than  in  the  imatinib  arm  (29%).  Notably,  21%  of patients  reported  a  complete  cytogenetic  response  (CCyR)  in  the  dasatinib  arm  while  only  8% achieved a CCyR in the imatinib arm.

A total of 15% of the patients in the dasatinib arm, and 76% in the imatinib arm had treatment failure, defined  as  disease  progression  or  cross-over  to  the  other  treatment  (lack  of  response,  study  drug intolerance).

Study CA180005 : A Phase 2 Study of Dasatinib in Subjects with Accelerated Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Resistant to or Intolerant of Imatinib Mesylate

## Methods

- Study Participants

Subjects of either  gender, at  least  18  years  of  age,  who  signed  informed  consent  and  who  suffered from  Ph+  (or  BCR-ABL)  accelerated  phase  CML  and  met  the  imatinib  resistant/intolerant  criteria, were included.

Primary or acquired hematologic resistance or intolerance to imatinib:

- a) hematologic resistance defined as any of the following:

i)  initial  diagnosis  of  chronic  phase  CML  that  progressed  to  accelerated  phase  while  on treatment with imatinib ≥ 400 mg/day (primary or acquired resistance)

ii) initial diagnosis of accelerated phase CML and failure to achieve a hematologic response after ≥ 4 weeks (or ≥ 2 weeks for subjects showing rapid disease progression) of imatinib ≥ 600  mg/day;  the  required  prior  imatinib  dose  was  400  to  &lt;  600  mg/day  if  the  subject  was intolerant to ≥ 600 mg/day (primary resistance)

iii)  initial  diagnosis  of  accelerated  or  blast  phase  CML that progressed to accelerated phase CML  following  an  initial  hematologic  response  to  imatinib ≥ 600  mg/day  (acquired resistance).  The  required  prior  imatinib  dose  was  400  to  &lt;  600  mg/day  if  the  subject  was intolerant of ≥ 600 mg/day

- b) imatinib intolerance defined as either:

i) toxicity that was considered at least possibly related to imatinib ≤ 400 mg/day that led to a discontinuation of imatinib therapy ii)  ability  to  tolerate  only  &lt;  400  mg/day  imatinib.  A  subject  who  tolerated  400  mg/day imatinib, but was intolerant of higher doses, was not considered imatinib-tolerant

Similar exclusion criteria as in study CA180013 were applied please refer to study CA180013 above .

## · Treatments

Dasatinib was administered daily at an oral dose of 70 mg BID. Dose modifications were allowed for the  management  of  disease  progression  or  toxicity.  Subjects  with  evidence  of  disease  progression could have their dose increased to 100 mg BID in the absence of prohibitive toxicity.

## · Objectives

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  estimate  the  major  hematologic  response  (MaHR)  and overall  hematologic  response  (OHR)  rates  to  dasatinib  in  accelerated  phase  CML  subjects  with primary or acquired resistance to imatinib.

Secondary Objectives included the assessment of the: durability of hematologic response and time to hematologic  response  (overall  and  major)  in  the  imatinib-resistant  and  imatinib-tolerant  groups separately, the cytogenetic and molecular responses in the imatinib-resistant group and the assessment of the hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses in the imatinib-intolerant group.

## · Recruitment

This  study  was  designed  to  enroll  a  minimum  of  60  subjects  with  a  history  of  imatinib-resistant accelerated phase CML. This interim efficacy summary includes results collected on subjects enrolled on or before 12-May-2005 and received the first dose of study drug on or before 22-May-2005 with a data cutoff date of 10-Nov-2005.

As of the data cutoff date for this interim analysis, a total of 120 subjects were enrolled and 107 (99 imatinib-resistant, 8 imatinib-intolerant) received at least 1 dose of dasatinib.

## · Conduct of the study

A similar amendment regarding the use of anagrelide was made as in study CA180013.

On (18-Aug-2005) a modification of the hematologic response criteria has been amanded.

The changes to the hematologic response criteria for advanced subjects introduces the concept of a 'major hematologic response.' This groups CHR and NEL under 1 general category. This change was introduced  to  highlight  the  observation  that  subjects  achieving  NEL  have  a  durability  of  response similar to CHR but may have some degree of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia due to a long history of previous treatments for CML or ALL and thus do not meet the full criteria of CHR. The definition of return to chronic phase was renamed 'minor hematologic response' to separate this category from CHR and NEL as the duration of response was expected to be shorter for this cohort.

## · Baseline data

Gender was well balanced. About 47% of patients had an ECOG performance status of 0, 39% of patients  had  an  ECOG-PS  of  1  and  14%  ECOG-PS  of  2.  The  distribution  of  performance  status corresponded  to  the  advanced  stage  of  disease  compared  to  chronic  CML  .  The  vast  majority  of patients  were  of  white  race.  Most  patients  had  been  treated  with  imatinib  for  more  than  3  years (68,2%) and with highest imatinib doses &gt; 600mg daily. Approximately 30% of patients had a MCyR as best cytogenetic response to imatinib. Only 8 patients were defined as Imatinib intolerant.

## · Numbers analysed

All over 107 subjects have been treated. The evaluable for cytogenetic response data set consisted of 98  subjects  and  for  cytogenetic  response  based  on ≥ 20  metaphases  consisted  of  85  subjects.  77 subjects have been additionally enrolled.

## · Outcomes and estimation

After follow-up of ≥ 6 months, the MaHR rate was 59% (63/107) in the total population (64% in the updated analysis at a median of 8 months follow-up), 59% (58/99) in the primary target population of imatinib-resistant subjects (65% in update), , and 63% (5/8) in imatinib-intolerant subjects (unchanged

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

in update), . The OHR rate was 80% (86/107) in the total population, and 81% (80/99) and 75% (6/8) in imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant subjects, respectively.

The median time for imatinib-resistant subjects to achieve MaHR was 57 days and treatment response seemed to be persistent in the majority of patients. Among the 63 subjects that had achieved MaHR, only 1 imatinib-resistant subject progressed ( In the update 7 out of the 69 imatinib intolerant and imatinib resistant MaHR patients had progressed. The longest duration of MaHR was 12.3+ months). 8 patients only were defined as imatinib intolerant.

## BCR-ABL mutation analysis:

Out of 107 total enrolled (99 imatinib-resistant, 8 imatinib-intolerant) subjects, 56 (52%) subjects had imatinib-resistant  mutations  identified  at  one  of  3  central  laboratories.  Among  56  subjects  with mutations,  twenty-seven  (48%)  subjects  have  mutations  located  within  the  P  loop  of  the  kinase domain. In  addition,  47  (84%)  subjects  with  detectable  mutations  had  a  mild  to  very  high  level  of

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

imatinib insensitivity. Nine (16%) subjects with detectable mutations had mutations of an unknown sensitivity level

Despite the presence of imatinib-resistant mutations in these subjects with accelerated phase CML, a major hematologic response (MaHR) in 37 (66%) subjects was detected.

Many (18, 67%) of the subjects with mutations within the P loop were able to achieve a MaHR by either  achieving  a  CHR  or  NEL.  Additionally,  the  majority  (30,  64%)  of  subjects  with  detectable mutations with mild to very high imatinib insensitivity achieved a MaHR .

A MCyR was also achieved in 17 (30%) subjects with imatinib-resistant mutations. Over a third (6, 35%) of the subjects who achieved a MCyR had detectable mutations within the P loop, and over half (11,  65%)  of  the  subjects  who  achieved  a  MCyR  had  mutations  with  mild  to  very  high  imatinib insensitivity.

## Concomitant Therapy

In  imatinib-resistant  subjects,  hydroxyurea  use  was  reported  during  the  study  in  17  subjects,  and anagrelide use was reported in 4 subjects. These agents were not reported as being used during the study in imatinib-intolerant subjects.

Study  CA180006: A  Phase  2  Study  of  Dasatinib  in  Subjects  with  Myeloid  Blast  Phase  Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Resistant to or Intolerant of Imatinib Mesylate

## Methods

- Study Participants

Subjects were enrolled at 35 sites worldwide. Subjects of either gender, at least 18 years of age, who signed  informed  consent  and  who  suffer  from  Ph+  (or  BCR-ABL+)  myeloid  blast  phase  chronic myeloid leukemia whose disease has primary or acquired haematologic resistance to imatinib or who are intolerant of imatinib. Subjects were considered to have myeloid blast phase CML if they met at least 1 of the following criteria:

a) ≥ 30% myeloid blasts in peripheral blood or in bone marrow b)  Extramedullary  infiltrates  of  leukemic  cells  (other  than  in  spleen  or  liver)  with  peripheral  blood myeloid blast morphology were included:

## Hematologic resistance or intolerance to imatinib was defined as:

a) Hematologic resistance to imatinib defined as any of the following:

i)  Subjects  initially  diagnosed  with  chronic  phase  CML  who  progressed  to  myeloid  phase CML  while  on  treatment  with  a  prescribed  imatinib  dose  of ≥ 400  mg/day.  This  includes subjects who had no response to imatinib (primary resistance) and those who responded and subsequently progressed to myeloid blast phase (acquired resistance).

ii) Subjects initially diagnosed with accelerated phase CML who progressed to myeloid phase CML while on treatment with a prescribed imatinib dose of ≥ 600 mg/day (or 400 mg to &lt; 600 mg/day  if  the  subject  is  intolerant  of ≥ 600  mg/day).  This  includes  subjects  who  had  no response  to  imatinib  (primary  resistance)  and  those  who  responded  and  subsequently progressed to myeloid blast phase (acquired resistance).

iii)  Subjects  initially  diagnosed  with  myeloid  blast  phase  CML  who  meet  the  criteria  for myeloid phase blast  crisis  after  at  least  4  weeks  of  treatment  prescribed  at  a  dose  of ≥ 600 mg/day (or 400 mg to &lt; 600 mg/day if the subject is intolerant of ≥ 600 mg/day). This 4-week treatment requirement can be shortened to 2 weeks for patients who are rapidly progressing. This includes subjects who had no response to imatinib (primary resistance) and those who responded and subsequently progressed back to myeloid blast phase (acquired resistance).

- b) Imatinib intolerance defined as:

i) Toxicity that was considered at least possibly related to imatinib ≤ 400 mg/day that led to a discontinuation of imatinib therapy.

ii)  Ability  to  tolerate  only  &lt;  400  mg/day  imatinib.  A  subject  who  tolerated  400  mg/day imatinib, but was intolerant of higher doses was not considered imatinib-intolerant.

Similar exclusion criteria as in study CA180013 were applied please refer to study CA180013 above .

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## · Treatments

Dasatinib was administered daily at an oral dose of 70 mg BID.

Dose modifications were allowed for the management of disease progression or toxicity. Subjects with evidence  of  disease  progression  could  have  their  dose  increased  to  100  mg  BID  in  the  absence  of prohibitive toxicity. The following criteria were to be used for dose escalation:

- Rising percent blasts on 2 consecutive haematologic assessments at least 1 week apart
- No CHR within 1 month of starting study therapy
- No CCyR at or after 3 months of study therapy
- Loss of response
- Objectives

The primary objective was to estimate the major and overall haematologic response rates to dasatinib in myeloid blast phase CML subjects with primary or acquired resistance to imatinib.

Secondary Objectives included the assessment of: the durability of hematologic response and time to hematologic  response  (overall  and  major)  in  the  imatinib-resistant  group  and  imatinib-intolerant groups  separately,  the  cytogenetic  and  molecular  responses  in  the  imatinib-resistant  group,  the hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses in the imatinib-intolerant group

## · Outcomes/endpoints

The definition of primary and secondary outcomes are similar to study CA180005, please refer to the definitions presented above.

## · Sample size

With a minimum accrual of 30 treated subjects in each group, the maximum width of the exact 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) was 35% when the hematologic response rate was in the expected 5% to 30% range.

## · Conduct of the study

Similar amendments regarding the use of anagrelide and the Modification of the hematologic response criteria were made as in study CA18005.

## · Baseline data

Demographic characteristics of the study population were representative of patients with myeloid blast phase CML. Most subjects in both imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant subsets were between 45 and  65  years  of  age  and  22%  were  &gt;  65  years.  Gender  was  balanced  in  this  study,  patients  were predominantly white (76%). 38% of patients had a performance status of 2 at study entry, as defined by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG).

All  subjects  had  received  prior  imatinib.  Thirty-six  (49%)  of  the  subjects  had  received  &gt;  600  mg imatinib daily while the remaining 38 (51%) subjects had received 400-600 mg imatinib daily. Nearly half of the subjects, 35 (47%) had received imatinib for &gt; 3 years, 28 (38%) had received imatinib for 1-3 years, and 11 (15%) had received imatinib for &lt; 1 year.

Twenty-four (32%) subjects,  including  22  (32%)  imatinib-resistant  and  2  (33%)  imatinib-intolerant subjects, had CCyR to imatinib.

## · Numbers analysed

All over 74 subjects have been treated. The evaluable for cytogenetic response data set consisted of 71 subjects and for cytogenetic response based on ≥ 20 metaphases consisted of 62 subjects. 44 subjects have been additionally enrolled.

## · Outcomes and estimation

After follow-up of ≥ 6  months, the MaHR rate was 32% (24/74) (34% in the updated analysis at a median of 8 months follow-up), in the total population, 34% (23/68) (35% in update), in the primary target  population  of  imatinib-resistant  subjects,  and  17%  (1/7) (unchanged  in  update), in  imatinibintolerant subjects.

The median time for imatinib-resistant subjects to achieve any haematologic response was 30 days. None of the 24 subjects who had achieved MaHR had progressed (Update: Among 25 MaHR patients 3 progressed. The longest duration of MaHR was 9.9+ months).

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

## Progression-Free Survival (Study CA180006)

The  MCyR  rate  was  30%  (22/74) (31%  in  update), in  the  total  population,  29%  (20/68) (31%  in update) in  imatinib-resistant  subjects,  and  33%  (2/6)  for  imatinib-intolerant  subjects (unchanged in update).

Approximately  3%  (2/74)  of  all  subjects  had  minor  cytogenetic  responses,  and  10%  (7/74)  had minimal cytogenetic responses resulting in an OCyR rate of 42% (31/74).

## BCR-ABL mutation analysis:

Out of a total of 74 (68 imatinib-resistant, 6 imatinib-intolerant) treated subjects 27 (37%) subjects had imatinib-resistant mutations detected at one of 3 central laboratories.

21 unique imatinib-resistant mutations have been detected, with G250E being the most common one detected in 6 subjects. Among 27 subjects with mutations, over half (15, 56%) of them had mutations located within the P loop of the kinase domain. In addition, the majority (21, 78%) of the subjects had detectable mutations with a mild to very high level of imatinib insensitivity. Six (22%) subjects had detectable mutations of an unknown sensitivity level.

A third (5, 33%) of the subjects with detectable mutations within the P loop were able to achieve a MaHR. Additionally, seven (33%) of the subjects with detectable mutations with mild to very high imatinib insensitivity achieved a MaHR.

A MCyR was also achieved in 6 (22%) of the subjects with detectable imatinib-resistant mutations. Four (67%) of the subjects who achieved a MCyR had detectable mutations within the P loop, and four (67%) of the subjects who achieved a MCyR had detectable mutations with mild to very high imatinib insensitivity.

## Concomitant Therapy:

Sixteen subjects received hydroxyurea and 1 subject received anagrelide.

As of the enrollment cutoff date, the first 81 subjects had been enrolled and 78 had received at least 1 dose of dasatinib (42 lymphoid blast CML subjects and 36 Ph+ ALL subjects). Three subjects were enrolled but not treated.

## · Conduct of the study

Similar amendments regarding the use of anagrelide and the modification of the hematologic response criteria were made as in study CA18005.

## · Baseline data

## History of Lymphoid Blast CML and Ph+ ALL

The median time from initial diagnosis to the start of dosing was 28 months for lymphoid blast CML subjects and 20 months for Ph+ ALL subjects. The most common previous therapies received by the subjects  in  lymphoid  blast  CML  subjects  included  chemotherapy  (79%),  interferon  (48%),  bone marrow transplant (33%), and radiotherapy (19%); and in Ph+ ALL subjects, chemotherapy (92%), bone marrow transplant (42%), radiotherapy (33%), and interferon (8%). The 3 most commonly used prior chemotherapies other than imatinib in lymphoid blast CML subjects were hydroxyurea (79%), vincristine (60%), and cytarabine (50%); in Ph+ ALL subjects they were vincristine (75%), cytarabine (75%), and methotrexate (72%).

## Prior Imatinib Therapy

Twentynine percent of lymphoid blast CML subjects and 53% of Ph+ ALL subjects received imatinib for 1 to 3 years. Approximately 50% of the subjects (52% lymphoid blast CML subjects and 47% Ph+ ALL subjects) had received an imatinib dosage &gt; 600 mg/day. In the lymphoid blast CML population, CHR and CCyR to imatinib were reported in 67% and 33% of subjects, respectively; while in the Ph+ ALL population, CHR and CCyR to imatinib were reported in 75% and 42% of subjects, respectively.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

Patients with Lymphoid Blast CML had a mean age of 47 years (range 19-72) and patients with Ph+ ALL a mean age of 48 (range 15-85). Subjects treated in this study were mostly male and the vast majority were white (&gt;95%). 17% of  Lymphoid Blast CML patients had a  performance status of 2 at study entry compared to 31% of Ph+ ALL patients.

## · Numbers analysed

All over 78 subjects have been treated. The evaluable for cytogenetic response data set consisted of 78 subjects and for cytogenetic response based on ≥ 20 metaphases consisted of 75 subjects. 20 subjects have been additionally enrolled.

## · Outcomes and estimation

35 (83.3%) subjects with lymphoid blast CML, including 30 that were imatinib-resistant and 5 that were imatinib-intolerant, have discontinued dasatinib at the time of the 6-months interim analysis. The median duration of therapy is 2.8 months (range 0.1 - 6.4 months) for all treated subjects and 25 weeks (range 23.0 - 29.0 weeks) for all treated subjects still on study. Eighty-six percent of all lymphoid blast subjects still on study have had ≥ 24 weeks of therapy.

At the time of this analysis, 24 (67%) Ph+ ALL subjects, all of whom were imatinib resistant, have discontinued dasatinib. The median duration of therapy was 3.2 months (range 0.2 - 8.1 months) for all treated subjects and 25 weeks (range 24.0 - 36.0 weeks) for treated subjects still on study. All 12 Ph+ ALL subjects still on study have had ≥ 24 weeks of therapy.

## Lymphoid Blast Phase

At the time of the analysis, the MaHR rate was 31% (13/42) in the total population, 32% (12/37) in the primary target population of imatinib-resistant subjects, and 20% (1/5) in imatinib-intolerant subjects. The OHR rate was 36% (15/42) in the total population, and 38% (14/37) and 20% (1/5) in imatinibresistant and imatinib-intolerant subjects, respectively.

Among  the  13  subjects  who  had  achieved  a  MaHR,  6  imatinib-resistant  subjects  had  progressed. Subject  CA180015-2-15017  progressed  after  3.3  months  of  therapy,  subject  CA180015-4-15021 progressed after 1.9 months of therapy, subject CA180015-13-15010 progressed after 1.9 months of therapy, subject CA180015-21-15076 progressed after 3.7 months of therapy, subject CA180015-3115040 progressed after 2.8 months of therapy, and subject CA180015-39-15050 progressed after 3.5 months of therapy.

No imatinib-intolerant subjects who had achieved a MaHR had progressed. The longest duration of response has been 5.4+ months (imatinib-resistant subject) and the shortest duration of response has been 1.6+ months (imatinib-intolerant subject). The median time for these imatinib-resistant subjects to achieve MaHR was 35 days. In the total subject population, the median PFS was 2.8 months (95% CI: 2.0-4.3)

## Ph+ ALL

At the time of this analysis, the MaHR rate was 42% (15/36) in the total population, 38% (13/34) in the  primary  target  population  of  imatinib-resistant  subjects,  and  100%  (2/2)  in  imatinib-intolerant subjects. In the MaHR group 6/13 and 10/15 remain in remission at the 8.month update does speak in favour of a true clinical benefit.

The  OHR  rate  was  47%  (17/36)  in  the  total  population,  and  44%  (15/34)  and  100%  (2/2)  in  the imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant subjects, respectively.

At the time of this analysis, among the 15 subjects who had achieved a MaHR, 3 imatinib-resistant subjects had progressed. No imatinib-intolerant subject had progressed.

The  longest  duration  of  MaHR  has  been  5.4+  months  (imatinib-resistant  subject)  and  the  shortest duration has been 1.9+ months. ( In the 8 month update 7 out of 13 MaHR patients with lymphoid blast crisis had progressed while only 5 out of 15 Ph+ALL responders had progressed).

The median time for these subjects to achieve MaHR was 57 days.

In the total subject population, the median PFS was 3.3 months (range 1.1-7.2).

## Cytogenetic Response

For Lymphoid Blast Phase CML patients the MCyR rate was 50% (21/42) for the total population, 49% (18/37) in imatinib-resistant subjects, and 60% (3/5) for imatinib-intolerant subjects.

For Ph+ ALL patients the MCyR rate was 58% (21/36) for the total population and 56% (19/34) for the imatinib-resistant subjects. Both subjects in the imatinib-intolerant subgroup achieved McyR.

## BCR-ABL mutation analysis:

Of the 42 subjects with lymphoid blast CML, 37 are imatinib-resistant and 5 are imatinib-intolerant. Twenty (48%) subjects had imatinib-resistant mutations detected at one of 3 central laboratories. Of the imatinib resistant subjects, 19 (51%) had detectable mutations versus only 1 (20%) of the imatinib intolerant subjects.

Among the 36 subjects with Ph+ ALL, 34 are imatinib-resistant and 2 are imatinib-intolerant among which 17 (47%) subjects had imatinib-resistant mutations detected. Of the imatinib-resistant subjects, 16 (47%) had detectable mutations, in addition to 1 (50%) of the imatinib-intolerant subjects.

A MaHR was achieved in 6 (30%) of the subjects with lymphoid blast CML and in 7 (41%) of those with Ph+ ALL. Three (33%) of the subjects with lymphoid blast CML and 2 (29%) of the subjects with Ph+ ALL with mutations within the P loop were able to achieve a MaHR. Two (14%) of the subjects with lymphoid blast CML and 5 (36%) of the subjects with Ph+ ALL with detectable mild to very high imatinib insensitive mutations had MaHR.

A MCyR was also achieved in 9 (45%) of the subjects with lymphoid blast CML and in 8 (47%) of the subjects  with  Ph+  ALL  with  detectable  imatinib-resistant  mutations.  Nearly  half  (4,  44%)  of  the subjects with lymphoid blast CML and 2 (25%) of the subjects with Ph+ ALL who achieved a MCyR had detectable mutations within the P loop.

## Concomitant Therapy

1  subject  (imatinib-resistant  lymphoid  blast  CML)  received  anagrelide.  Four  (10%)  lymphoid  blast CML  subjects  (all  imatinib-resistant)  and  2  Ph+  ALL  subjects  (both  imatinib-resistant)  received hydroxyurea. Subjects who required intrathecal chemotherapy during the study period were allowed to continue in the trial and receive dasatinib.

## · Discussion on clinical efficacy

The demonstration of efficacy in 481 subjects with chronic, accelerated, myeloid blast, and lymphoid blast chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)  and  Philadelphia chromosome  positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) resistant or intolerant to imatinib is based upon 6 studies, one Phase I and five pivotal Phase II (CA180005, CA180006, CA180013, CA180015, and CA180017).

The  efficacy  of  Sprycel  is  based  on  haematological  and  cytogenetic  response  rates  observed  in  all phases  of  CML  and  in  Ph+ ALL.  Combined  efficacy  outcomes  for  all  phase  II  studies  are  shown above in the table presented under 'Analysis performed across trials'.

In the Phase I study, haematologic and cytogenetic responses were observed in all phases of CML and in Ph+ ALL in 84 patients and followed for up to 19 months. Responses were durable across all phases of CML and Ph+ ALL.

## Clinical safety

The total dasatinib safety cohort discussed in this document represents 511 subjects , and a breakdown of subjects is presented in the table below. These are the same 6 clinical studies of dasatinib treatment (one Phase 1 and 5 Phase 2 studies), which provide the primary efficacy data.

## · Patient exposure

Of the total number (511) of patients treated in clinical trials with SPRYCEL that received a starting dose of 70 mg BID, 199 (22%) patients were over 65 years of age, while 33 (4%) patients were over 75 years of age.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

The majority of subjects  (57%;  N  =  289)  had  a  duration  of  between  3  and  6  months  of  treatment. Thirty-two percent (N = 166) were treated for 3 months or less, and 11% (N = 56) were treated for more than 6 months.

## · Adverse events

The  majority  of  SPRYCEL-treated  patients  experienced  adverse  reactions  at  some  time.  Most reactions were of mild-to-moderate grade, but treatment was discontinued for adverse reactions in 6% of patients in chronic phase CML, 5% in accelerated phase CML, 11% in myeloid blast phase CML, and 6% in lymphoid blast phase CML or Ph+ ALL.

The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  reactions  were  fluid  retention  (including  pleural  effusion), diarrhoea,  skin  rash,  headache,  haemorrhage,  fatigue,  nausea,  and  dyspnoea  (Table).  Drug-related febrile neutropenia was reported in 4% of patients.

Miscellaneous adverse reactions such as pleural effusion, ascites, pulmonary oedema and pericardial effusion with or without superficial oedema may be collectively described as 'fluid retention'. The use of dasatinib is associated with fluid retention with severe cases in 7% of patients. Severe pleural and pericardial effusion were reported in 4% and &lt; 1% of patients, respectively. Severe ascites and generalised  oedema  were  each  reported  in  &lt; 1%.  Less  than  1%  of  patients  have  had  severe  noncardiogenic  pulmonary  oedema.  Fluid  retention  events  were  typically  managed  by  supportive  care measures that include diuretics or short courses of steroids.

Bleeding  drug-related events, ranging from  petechiae and epistaxis to severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage and CNS  bleeding, were reported in patients  taking  SPRYCEL.  Severe  CNS haemorrhage occurred in &lt; 1% of patients; 3 cases were fatal and two of them were associated with CTC grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage occurred in 5% of patients and generally required treatment interruption and transfusions. Other severe haemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients. Most bleeding related events were typically associated with severe thrombocytopenia. In clinical trials, it was recommended that treatment with imatinib be discontinued at least 7 days before starting treatment with SPRYCEL.

## Adverse reactions:

Adverse drug reactions, excluding laboratory abnormalities, that were reported in ≥ 5% of patients in SPRYCEL clinical trials are shown in the following Table. These reactions are presented by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are defined as: very common ( ≥ 1/10); common ( ≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10); uncommon ( ≥ 1/1,000  to ≤ 1/100).  Within  each  frequency  grouping,  undesirable  effects  are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

## · Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events

## Chronic CML

A total of 3 (1%) deaths were reported in subjects enrolled in CA180013 and CA180017 with chronic CML. All 3 deaths occurred in CA180013. Two subjects died from disease progression and 1 died from a CNS bleed. In CA180002, 1 chronic CML subject died on-study or within 30 days of the last dose of dasatinib, and was attributed to disease progression.

Overall 45 (22%) subjects had SAEs that were considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to study drug. Thirty-nine (19%) subjects had Grade 3 to 4 SAEs. Respiratory system SAEs made up the largest percent of the drug-related SAEs (8%) and 4% were Grade 3 to 4. Five percent of subjects had drug-related SAEs of pleural effusion (2% severe) within this category. Cardiac disorders made up 7%, with 5% considered severe by the investigator. Gastrointestinal disorder SAEs were 2%, with 1% considered severe by the investigator. Thirty-eight (32%) subjects had Grade 3 to 4 SAEs.

## Accelerated CML

A total  of  7  (6%)  deaths  were  reported  in  subjects  with  accelerated  CML.  Two  subjects  died  from disease progression as assessed by the investigator. Three deaths were classified as due to infection, 1 was listed as 'other', and the last was reported due to unknown causes; the 1 subject listed as 'other' died from shock. The subject listed as having an unknown cause of death died 30 days beyond the last day of dosing.

Overall, 44 (37%) subjects had SAEs that were considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to study drug. Thirty-eight (32%) subjects had Grade 3 to 4 SAEs. Gastrointestinal disorder SAEs made up the largest percentage of drug-related nonhematologic SAEs in this group (14%) and 12% were Grade 3 to 4. Diarrhea and gastrointestinal hemorrhage made up the largest number of these events  (3%  each)  with  most  of  them  being  severe  (2%  and  3%,  respectively).  Respiratory  system SAEs made up the next largest group of the drug-related SAEs (8%), and 3% were Grade 3 to 4. Most of the respiratory SAEs were pleural effusions (7%), of which most were not severe (2%). Infections and  infestations  made  up  another  6%  of  the  drug-related  SAEs  with  all  of  them  considered  severe (Grade 3 to 4), with pneumonia taking up the largest number of these (3%).

## Myeloid Blast CML

Among 35 deaths listed as 'other', there was a death caused by bacterial sepsis and fungal pneumonia, and 1 caused by sepsis, heart failure, respiratory, and renal failure as well as pancytopenia. A third subject in this group died from a cerebellar hemorrhage, and a fourth subject died from a metastatic solid tumor. The last subject classified as 'other' died from acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by tumor lysis syndrome.

Overall, 37 (38%) subjects had SAEs that were considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to study drug. Twenty-eight (29%) subjects had Grade 3 to 4 SAEs. Respiratory system SAEs made up the largest  percentage  of  drug-related  nonhematologic  SAEs  in  this  group  (15%)  and  8% were Grade 3 to 4. The largest percentage of these were pleural effusions (6%), of which 3% were severe. Gastrointestinal disorder SAEs made up the next largest group of the drug-related SAEs (11%) and 9% were Grade 3 to 4. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage made up the largest number of these events (5%) with most of them being severe (3%). Cardiac disorders made up 4% of the SAEs with 3% being severe.  Infections  and  infestations  made  up  another  4%  of  the  drug-related  SAEs  with  1  (1%) considered severe.

## Lymphoid Blast CML and Ph+ ALL

A total of 35 (40%) deaths were reported in subjects with lymphoid blast CML and Ph+ ALL. The primary reason for death as listed by the investigator was disease progression, which occurred in 16 (18%) of the subjects. In addition, 11 (13%) deaths were due to infection, 3 (3%) were due to fatal bleeding,  and  6  (7%)  were  reported  as  'other'.  One  subject  had  2  causes  of  death  listed  (disease progression and fatal bleeding). Of the 2 subjects in CA180002 classified as 'other' for cause of death, 1 subject died of a massive brain hemorrhage that occurred beyond 30 days of the last day of dosing and  while  being  treated  with  another  chemotherapeutic  agent.  The  second  subject  had  a  relapse  of disease with Klebsiella sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Of the 4 subjects in CA180015 classified as 'other' for cause of death, 1 subject died of hypoxia and a pleural effusion, and another died of constrictive pericarditis. A third subject died of respiratory failure and the fourth had 'damage general status' as described by the investigator. Overall 30 (34%) subjects had SAEs that were considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to study drug. Twenty-five (28%) subjects had Grade 3 to 4

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

SAEs. Gastrointestinal disorder SAEs made up the largest percentage of drug-related nonhematologic SAEs  in  this  group  (7%)  and  all  of  them  were  considered  severe  (Grade  3  to  4).  Gastrointestinal hemorrhage made up the largest representative events (2%). Pyrexia was a drug-related SAE in 3% of the cases, but none of them were severe. Respiratory system SAEs made up 5% across all grades, and 3% were Grade 3 to 4. Half of these were pleural effusions (2%), of which 1 was severe. Infections and infestations made up another 3%; all were severe. Pneumonia accounted for 2 of these cases.

## · Laboratory findings

The  majority  of  patients  in  all  studies  with  grade  0  absolute  neutrophil  counts  (ANC)  at  baseline developed hematological toxicity with increasing severity related to advanced stages of the disease: 40% of patients with chronic CML developed grade 3-4 ANCs, compared to 68% of patients with accelerated  CML,  80%  of  patients  with  myeloid  blast  CML,  and  67%  with  lymphoid  blast CML/Ph+ALL. The vast majority (&gt;80%) of patients in all studies with grade 1-2 absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) at baseline developed grade 3-4 ANCs.

Similar results were observed regarding thrombocytopenia with the following percentages of patients with grade 0 at baseline developing grade 3-4 toxicities: chronic CML 40%, accelerated CML 71%, myeloid blast CML 59% and lymphoid blast CML/Ph+ALL 33%. The vast majority of patients in all studies with grade 1-2 thrombocytopenia at baseline developed grade 3-4 toxicity. Roughly 50-60% of patients with myeloid blast CML and lymphoid blast CML/Ph+ALL entered the study with a baseline platelet toxicity grade 3-4.

The time to the first occurrence of severe (grade 3-4) neutropenia or thrombocytopenia usually ranged from  0-8  weeks,  25-30%  of  neutropenias  in  chronic  and  accelerated  CML  were  observed  after  8 weeks.

Approximately  40-50%  of  patients  had  increases  of  liver  enzymes  at  some  time  during  the  study. Depending  on  the  stage  of  the  disease  40-75%%  of  subjects  with  no  abnormalities  at  baseline developed some degree of hypocalcemia at least once during the study, none of the subjects developed clinical symptoms, but care should be taken regarding possible interactions with other drugs causing hypocalcemia.

## · Safety in special populations

No meaningful differences, regardless of disease phase, in overall incidence of AEs, SAEs, or AEs leading to discontinuation based on age, gender or ECOG performance status were observed.

The majority of subjects with chronic, accelerated, myeloid blast, and lymphoid blast CML and Ph+ ALL  were  white.  Based  on  the  limited  number  of  subjects  enrolled  in  other  race  categories,  no clinically meaningful comparisons can be made based on race.

Of the 59 imatinib-intolerant subjects in study CA180013 (chronic CML), 41 subjects (69%) had no recurrence  of  the  toxicity  that  caused  intolerance  to  imatinib.  Eighteen  (31%)  subjects  experienced toxicities  while  on  treatment  with  dasatinib  that  were  similar  to  what  they  had  experienced  while receiving  prior  imatinib.  Eight  (8)  subjects  experienced  similar  non-hematologic  toxicities  to  those reported while on prior imatinib: 3 toxicities of the gastrointestinal system, 1 pulmonary, 2 skin, and 2 general (1 fatigue and 1 severe cramps).

Dasatinib may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. It is not known whether dasatinib is excreted in human milk; therefore women who are taking dasatinib should not breast-feed. The potential effects of dasatinib on sperm have not been studied.

## · Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Dasatinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 isoenzyme and, based on in vitro cytochrome P-450 [CYP] inhibition studies, is an inhibitor of CYP3A4.

Therefore coadministration of dasatinib with substances that inhibit CYP3A4  activity (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, Retrovir, atazanavir, and lopinavir) may increase dasatinib plasma concentrations. Results of an ongoing study in adult cancer subjects (CA180021) is expected to deliver further information.

Since dasatinib is a CYP3A4 substrate, the effect of rifampin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, on the PK of dasatinib was investigated (CA180032). Marked decreases in exposure parameters were noted when dasatinib was co-administered with rifampin compared with dasatinib given alone. The mean Cmax and AUC of dasatinib were decreased by 81% and 82%, respectively.

Another study investigated the effects of antacid coadministration on the dasatinib PK (CA180020). Concomitant administration of aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide products resulted in a

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

55% reduction in dasatinib AUC, and a 58% reduction in Cmax. Dasatinib may be administered with OTC antacids (aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide products) if the doses are temporally separated by at least 2 hours.

Exposure  to  dasatinib  was  decreased  when  administered  up  to  10  hours  following  famotidine (CA180020). Area under  the  curve  and  Cmax  were  reduced  by  61%  and  63%,  respectively.  Thus, administration of dasatinib with drugs that reduce gastric acid secretion (eg, famotidine, omeprazole) are likely to reduce dasatinib exposure.

Since dasatinib is a potential inhibitor of CYP3A4, the effect of dasatinib on the PK of simvastatin, a CYP3A4 substrate, was investigated (CA180022). The results of this study indicate that simvastatin exposure is increased when it is administered in combination with dasatinib; Cmax and AUC were increased  by  36.9%  and  19.8%,  respectively.  Therefore,  caution  is  warranted  when  dasatinib  is administered with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic margin (eg, cyclosporine).

Dasatinib does not inhibit the following cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1.

## · Discontinuation due to adverse events

In  study180002  (phase  I)  of  the  34  subjects  who  discontinued,  10  subjects  (6  myeloid  blast,  4 lymphoid blast/Ph+ ALL, respectively) reported adverse events that led to discontinuation. However, for all of these 10 subjects, the reported reason for study discontinuation was: disease progression (8 subjects), rapid progression of solid cancer (1 subject) or resistant mutation. In all cases, the adverse events that led to discontinuation were considered by the investigator as unrelated to dasatinib.

In  study  CA180013  (chronic  CML)  thirteen  (7%)  subjects  discontinued  study  drug  (10  imatinibresistant and 3 imatinib-intolerant) because of AEs of moderate to severe intensity:

-Grade 2 events in 4 cases: (i) neuropathy, (ii) QTc prolongation, (iii) pulmonary edema, and (iv) atrial fibrillation

-Grade  3  events  in  5  cases:  (i)  left  ventricular  diastolic  dysfunction,  (ii)  bone  pain,  (iii)  pyoderma gangrenosum, (iv) erythema, and (v) pneumonia

-Grade 4 in 2 cases: (i) rhabdomyolysis, and (ii) thrombocytopenia

-Grade 5 (or death) in 2 cases: (i) CNS hemorrhage, and (ii) severe renal failure.

Most  discontinuations  (10  subjects,  5%)  were  considered  by  the  investigator(s)  to  be  certainly, possibly, or probably related to dasatinib.

In  study  CA180005 (accelerated  CML) five imatinib-resistant  subjects  experienced  AEs  that  led  to discontinuation.  One  subject  died  (sudden  death  due  to  shock),  which  was  considered  by  the investigator  as  not  related  to  dasatinib.  Two  subjects  discontinued  due  to  progressive  disease,  both considered not related to study treatment; 1 subject due to dyspnea and 1 subject due to pulmonary embolism, both designated as not likely related to study treatment. One additional subject discontinued 30 days after the last dose of study therapy due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which was considered probably related to study treatment.

In study CA180006 (myeloid blast CML) twenty (27%) subjects experienced adverse events which led to discontinuation. Most AEs that led to discontinuation were Grades 3 to 5. The most common AE leading to medication discontinuation was  disease progression. Dasatinib-related AEs  led to discontinuation  in  4  subjects.  Three  of  these  subjects  had  \"study  drug  toxicity\"  as  a  reason  for discontinuation  on  the  End  of  Treatment  CRF.  One  had  \"disease  progression\"  as  the  reason  for discontinuing.

In study CA180015 (Lymphoid Blast CML and Ph+ ALL) adverse events leading to discontinuation regardless of causality occurred in 32 (36%) subjects with lymphoid blast CML or Ph+ ALL. Most AEs that led to discontinuation were Grade 3 or greater. The most common AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were worsening of disease and blast crisis. All other AEs leading to discontinuation occurred in no more than 2% of subjects.

Among all subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation, an attribution of a potential drug relationship occurred in a total of 3 (3%) subjects. One subject discontinued because of severe dyspnea, another discontinued because of a severe lung infiltrates, and the last subject discontinued with a severe rash and an exanthema.

## · Discussion on clinical safety

The most frequently reported ( ≥ 10%) non hematologic AEs included gastrointestinal AEs (diarrhea [32%],  nausea  [19%],  and  vomiting  [13%]),  fluid  retention  events  (peripheral  edema  [15%]  and pleural effusion [14%]), headache (23%), fatigue (18%), asthenia (14%), rash (14%), dyspnea (14%), and pyrexia (13%). The majority of adverse events were considered to be drug-related (roughly 5090%), except for adverse events leading to drug discontinuations (roughly 0-25% considered as drugrelated), where there was a notable difference.

Important  identified  risks  are  toxicity  regarding  the  gastrointestinal  system  and  fluid  retention. Approximately 14% of subjects in the dasatinib program experienced a pleural effusion considered related to dasatinib. Fluid retention seems usually manageable.

Hemorrhage occurred in one-third of subjects treated with dasatinib, the majority of the events were manageable.

Important missing information is long-term safety data on the treatment with dasatinib.

One out of 71 deaths in study CA180006 and CA180015 was considered to be caused by study drug toxicity.  The  number  of  deaths  due  to  study  drugs  toxicity  seems  to  be  underestimated  taking  the toxicity of dasatinib into consideration (e.g. neutropenia, thrombocytopenia).

The majority of the SAEs were related to the respiratory system (5-15%), gastrointestinal disorders (214%) and cardiac disorders (1- 7%). A general pattern of SAEs depending on the stage of the disease was not identified.

The  majority  of  patients  in  all  studies  with  grade  0  absolute  neutrophil  counts  (ANC)  at  baseline developed hematological toxicity with increasing severity related to advanced stages of the disease.

Similar  results  were  observed  regarding  thrombocytopenia  of  patients  with  grade  0  at  baseline developing grade 3-4 toxicities

The time to the first occurrence of severe (grade 3-4) neutropenia or thrombocytopenia usually ranged from  0-8  weeks,  25-30%  of  neutropenias  in  chronic  and  accelerated  CML  were  observed  after  8 weeks.

Overall toxicity to dasatinib is rated to be manageable. Considerable toxicity has been observed regarding cytopenia (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) and fluid retention.

Concomitant use of dasatinib and medicinal products that potently inhibit CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, telithromycin) may increase exposure to dasatinib. Therefore,  in  patients  receiving  SPRYCEL,  coadministration  of  a  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitor  is  not recommended.

Concomitant  use  of  dasatinib  and  medicinal  products  that  induce  CYP3A4  (e.g.  dexamethasone, phenytoin,  carbamazepine,  rifampicin,  phenobarbital  or Hypericum  perforatum ,  also  known  as St. John's Wort)  may  substantially  reduce  exposure  to  dasatinib,  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of therapeutic  failure.  Therefore,  in  patients  receiving  SPRYCEL,  coadministration  of  alternative therapeutic agents with less potential for CYP3A4 induction should be selected (see section 4.5).

Concomitant  use  of  dasatinib  and  a  CYP3A4  substrate  may  increase  exposure  to  the  CYP3A4 substrate. Therefore, caution is warranted when SPRYCEL is coadministered with CYP3A4 substrates of narrow therapeutic index, such as astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, bepridil or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine)

The  concomitant  use  of  dasatinib  and  a  H2  blocker  (e.g.  famotidine),  proton  pump  inhibitor  (e.g. omeprazole),  or  aluminium  hydroxide/magnesium  hydroxide  may  reduce  the  exposure  to  dasatinib. Thus, H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors are not recommended and aluminium hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide products should be administered up to 2 hours prior to, or 2 hours following the administration of dasatinib. These issues are addressed in the SmPC section 4.5.

There are currently no data available from clinical trials with SPRYCEL in patients with moderately to severely impaired liver function. Caution is recommended when administering SPRYCEL to patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. This is mentioned in the SPC 4.2.

Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should be corrected prior to SPRYCEL administration.

Patients  with  uncontrolled  or  significant  cardiovascular  disease  were  not  included  in  the  clinical studies.

## 6. Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation

## Quality

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

There are no unresolved quality issues which may affect the Benefit/Risk balance.

## Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology

With IC50 values in the lower nM range, dasatinib is a potent inhibitor of members of five tyrosine kinase families: SRC family kinases (SRC, LCK, YES, FYN), BCR-ABL, KIT, EPHA2 and PDGF β . The pharmacokinetics of dasatinib were evaluated in 229 adult healthy subjects and in 84 patients.



Dasatinib  is  rapidly  absorbed  in  patients  following  oral  administration,  with  peak  concentrations between  0.5-3 hours.  Following  oral  administration,  the  increase  in  the  mean  exposure  (AUC τ )  is approximately proportional to the dose increment across doses ranging from 25 mg to 120 mg BID.

The gastrointestinal, haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the major target organs in the repeatdose toxicity studies. The major dose-limiting event was gastrointestinal toxicity and in the 9-month monkey  study,  animals  were  euthanized  due  to  GI  toxicity  when  exposed  to  clinically  relevant dasatinib plasma levels. In rats, mortalities were observed in studies of 4 weeks duration or longer at plasma  exposure  levels  (AUC)  four-fold  higher  than  observed  in  patients  (70  mg  BID).  The predominant causes of death in rats were GI and lymphoid toxicity. Consistent GI findings were doserelated  enteropathy,  faecal  abnormalities,  vomiting,  distension  of  the  GI  tract  with  gas/fluid/digesta and GI tract haemorrhage

The  haematology  and  clinical  chemistry  findings  suggested  inflammation,  blood  loss,  poor  food consumption and electrolyte loss. The GI toxicity findings occurred at clinically relevant AUC levels. Bleeding is exacerbated by treatment since dasatinib prolongs bleeding time via an effect on platelet function  erythroid  toxicity  was  observed  in  the  form  of  reduced  erythrocytes,  haemoglobin  and haematocrit  counts.  Anaemia  is  a  common  finding  in  dasatinib-treated  patients.  Lymphoid  toxicity was  observed  in  the  form  of  lymphoid  depletion  of  the  thymus  and  spleen  and  an  accompanying reduction in thymus and spleen weight. In addition, reductions in plasma lymphocytes and splenic Tcells and B-cells were observed in rats. Hypocellularity of the bone marrow was observed in rats at a dose  giving  rise  to  4  to  6-fold  higher  AUC  values  than  observed  in  patients.  All  dasatinib-related changes were generally reversible in surviving animals except for an increase in kidney mineralization.

Dasatinib  was  clastogenic  in  CHO  cells.  The  lowest  nonclastogenic  concentration  of  2.5 µ g/mL is approximately 50-fold greater  than the  maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)  measured in humans given the recommended  clinical dose of 70 mg  BID. According to ICH  S1A, long-term carcinogenicity studies are not required when the life-expectancy in the indicated population is short (i.e. less than 2-3 years). Consequently, the lack of carcinogenicity studies for dasatinib is justified.

Considering the indication the lack of a fertility study is acceptable. Administration of dasatinib to rats during  the  period  of  organogenesis  induced  embryolethality  at  clinically  relevant  maternal  plasma exposures (AUC). In addition, dasatinib induced foetal skeletal alterations in the absence of maternal toxicity in rats and rabbits at clinically relevant maternal plasma exposures.

The  lack  of  a  prenatal  and  postnatal  development  study  is  acceptable  when  considering  the  lifethreatening indication.

Dasatinib was phototoxic in the neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay and this is stated in the SPC section 5.3. Dasatinib treatment inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation and causes reductions in plasma  lymphocytes  and  splenic  T-cells  and  B-cells.  Immunotoxicty  studies  demonstrated  that  a threshold  exists  for  the  dasatinib-induced  immunosuppressive  effect  but  based  on  the  non-clinical studies  some  immunotoxicity  findings  are  expected  in  the  clinic.  Dasatinib  inhibited  platelet aggregation in human, monkey, and rat platelet-rich plasma in  vitro .  The  no-effect concentration of 0.05 µ g/mL is equivalent to the plasma Cmax measured in humans given the clinical dose of 70 mg BID. In vivo , dasatinib in rats prolonged cuticle bleeding time, but did not cause spontaneous bleeding.

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

In accordance with what has been reported for other SRC tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dasatanib potently inhibits osteoclastic bone  resorption when  tested in vitro and in vivo at clinically relevant concentrations.

Dasatinib is unlikely to represent a risk to the environment.

## Efficacy

The demonstration of efficacy in 481 subjects with chronic, accelerated, myeloid blast, and lymphoid blast chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)  and  Philadelphia chromosome  positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) resistant or intolerant to imatinib is based upon 6 studies, one Phase I and five pivotal Phase II (CA180005, CA180006, CA180013, CA180015, and CA180017).

The  efficacy  of  Sprycel  is  based  on  haematological  and  cytogenetic  response  rates  observed  in  all phases  of  CML  and  in  Ph+ ALL.  Combined  efficacy  outcomes  for  all  phase  II  studies  are  shown above in the table presented under 'Analysis performed across trials'.

In the Phase I study, haematologic and cytogenetic responses were observed in all phases of CML and in Ph+ ALL in 84 patients and followed for up to 19 months. Responses were durable across all phases of CML and Ph+ ALL.

## Safety

The most frequently reported ( ≥ 10%) non hematologic AEs included gastrointestinal AEs (diarrhea [32%],  nausea  [19%],  and  vomiting  [13%]),  fluid  retention  events  (peripheral  edema  [15%]  and pleural effusion [14%]), headache (23%), fatigue (18%), asthenia (14%), rash (14%), dyspnea (14%), and pyrexia (13%). The majority of adverse events were considered to be drug-related (roughly 5090%), except for adverse events leading to drug discontinuations (roughly 0-25% considered as drugrelated), where there was a notable difference.

Important  identified  risks  are  toxicity  regarding  the  gastrointestinal  system  and  fluid  retention. Approximately 14% of subjects in the dasatinib program experienced a pleural effusion considered related to dasatinib. Fluid retention seems usually manageable.

Hemorrhage occurred in one-third of subjects treated with dasatinib, the majority of the events were manageable.

Important missing information is long-term safety data on the treatment with dasatinib.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

## · User consultation

The  Sprycel  leaflet  passed  the  European  benchmark  for  usability  performance  over  two  rounds  of testing.

## Risk-benefit assessment

The  clinical  benefit  of  Sprycel  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia (CML)  or  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  (Ph+)  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (ALL)  with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy has been demonstrated in terms of relevant clinical endpoints such as haematological and cytogenetic response rates in patients who had failed or been unable to tolerate  prior  imatinib  therapy.  Taking  into  account  the  manageable  toxicity,  the  risk-benefit  of Sprycel in the claimed indications is positive.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the product information

## Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

The Applicant claimed at the time of submission of the application, that SPRYCEL is not similar (as defined  in  Art.  3  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  847/2000)  to  the  Orphan  medicinal  product Glivec (imatinib) which is authorised for a condition relating to the proposed therapeutic indication for Sprycel (dasatinib).

The CHMP, having considered the arguments presented by the applicant, the Rapporteurs similarity assessment,  and  the  conclusions  of  the  Quality  working  Party,  concluded  that  there  are  substantial differences in the molecular structure of the two active substances.

The  CHMP  concluded  that  dasatinib  and  imatinib  are  not  similar  in  terms  of  molecular  structural aspects. Both molecular structures contain an N-phenyl-amide, a piperazine ring and a pyrimidin ring, but  the  interconnections  between  these  moieties  do  not  indicate  that  the  two  molecules  share  a common framework such as structural analogues. Despite the presence of some common structural features, it was concluded that this is not enough to comply with the definition of structural similarity in the legislation. The overall structural differences were regarded as major, not minor.

The CHMP is therefore of the opinion that Sprycel  is  not  similar  to  Glivec  within  the  meaning  of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

Aditionally the Applicant claimed during the  evaluation procedure  that SPRYCEL is not similar (as defined in Art. 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000) to the authorised Orphan medicinal product Evoltra (clofarabine) , which is authorized for a condition relating to the proposed therapeutic indication  for  Sprycel  (dasatinib).  The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  arguments  presented  by  the applicant, the Rapporteurs assessment, and the conclusions of the Quality working Party, concluded that there are substantial differences in the molecular structure of the two active substances.

The CHMP concluded that dasatinib and clofarabine are not similar in terms of molecular structural aspects  since  the  molecular  structural  of  dasatinib  is  not  similar  to  clofarabine  on  the  basis  of  the difference in principal molecular structural features.

The CHMP is therefore of the opinion that Sprycel is not similar to Evoltra within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

## Recommendation

Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Sprycel  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

In addition, the CHMP, with reference to Article 8 of Regulation EC No 141/2000, considers Sprycel not to be similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation EC No. 847/2000) to Glivec or Evoltra for the same therapeutic indication.
