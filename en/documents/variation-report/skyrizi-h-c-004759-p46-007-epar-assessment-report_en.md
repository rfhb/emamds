## Description

## Methods

This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab as induction treatment in subjects with moderately to

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

severely active CD. The study enrolled subjects who had an inadequate response (IR) to prior biologic therapy (bio-IR) and subjects who had not (non-bio-IR).

Study duration was up to 49 weeks, including a Screening period of up to 35 days, a 12-week induction period, an additional 12-week Induction Period 2 for those subjects who did not achieve SF/APS clinical response at Week 12, and a 140-day follow up period from the last dose of study drug. Visits for clinical evaluation occurred at Baseline, and Weeks 4, 8, and 12 or premature discontinuation (PD). Subjects who did not achieve SF/APS clinical response at Week 12 were offered blinded induction therapy with risankizumab in Induction Period 2 with additional visits at Weeks 12, 16, and 20 and evaluation for SF/APS clinical response at Week 24.

## Treatments

Blinded  study  drug  (risankizumab  1200  mg,  risankizumab  600  mg,  or  placebo)  was  administered intravenously (IV) during 12-Week Induction Period at Weeks 0, 4, and 8.

Blinded study drug (risankizumab 1200 mg) was administered IV during Induction Period 2 at Weeks 12, 16, and 20. Blinded study drug (360 mg risankizumab, or 180 mg risankizumab) was administered subcutaneously (SC) in Induction Period 2 at Weeks 12 and 20.

Risankizumab was provided as 90 mg/mL solution for infusion in vial (bulk lot numbers: 16-006818, 17008086, 18-004856, 18-006696, 18-005859, 19-003343) and 90 mg/mL solution for injection in PFS (bulk lot numbers: 17-002008, 17-004111, 18-004275, 18-004857, 18-007358). Placebo was provided as  placebo  solution  for  infusion  in  vial  (bulk  lot  numbers:  16-006836,  17-005978,  18-002773,  18006697, 18-004274, 19-005914) and placebo solution for injection in PFS (bulk lot numbers: 17-001231, 17-003128, 18-005511, 18-004273).

## Objective(s)

The objective of Study M16-006 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab versus placebo during induction therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active CD.

## Outcomes/endpoints

## Efficacy:

The co-primary endpoints for the OUS protocol were:

- Proportion of subjects with SF/APS clinical remission at Week 12
- Proportion of subjects with endoscopic response at Week 12

The co-primary endpoints for the US protocol were:

- Proportion of subjects with CDAI clinical remission at Week 12
- Proportion of subjects with endoscopic response at Week 12

The ranked secondary endpoints for the OUS protocol were:

1. Proportion of subjects with CDAI clinical remission at Week 12
2. Proportion of subjects with CDAI clinical response at Week 4

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

3. Proportion of subjects with SF/APS clinical remission at Week 4
4. Proportion of subjects with CDAI clinical response at Week 12
5. Mean change from baseline of induction in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Fatigue (FACIT) fatigue at Week 12
6. Mean change from baseline of induction in IBDQ total score at Week 12
7. Proportion of subjects with enhanced SF/APS clinical response and endoscopic response at Week 12
8. Proportion of subjects with endoscopic remission at Week 12
9. Proportion of subjects with enhanced SF/APS clinical response at Week 4
10. Proportion of subjects with ulcer-free endoscopy at Week 12
11. Enhanced SF/APS clinical response at Week 12
12. Proportion  of  subjects  with  resolution  of  extra-intestinal  manifestations  (EIMs)  at  Week  12,  in subjects with any EIMs at Baseline
13. Proportion of subjects with CD-related hospitalization through Week 12
14. Proportion  of  subjects  without  draining  fistulas  at  Week  12  in  subjects  with  draining  fistulas  at Baseline

## Sample size

Sample size calculation was based on the larger sample size needed to detect treatment differences between the risankizumab treatment arms and the placebo arm for each of the co-primary endpoints. Assuming the clinical remission (SF/APS) rate at Week 12 would be 27.8% for one of the risankizumab treatment arms and 12% for the placebo arm, a sample size of 342 subjects for each of the risankizumab arms and 171 for the placebo arm would have 97% power to detect the treatment difference between risankizumab and placebo using a Fisher's exact test at alpha of 0.025 (two-sided). Assuming the CDAI clinical remission rate at Week 12 would be 37% for one of the risankizumab treatment arms and 17% for the placebo arm, this sample size would have 99% power to detect the treatment difference between risankizumab and placebo using a Fisher's exact test at a 0.025 significant level (two-sided). Assuming the endoscopic response rate at Week 12 would be 25.5% for one of the risankizumab treatment arms and 8% for the placebo arm, this sample size would have 99% power to detect a treatment difference between risankizumab and placebo using a Fisher's exact test at a 0.025 significant level (two-sided). Further details on sample size calculation are presented in Protocol Section 8.2 and SAP Version 5.0 Section 2.4.

## Randomisation and blinding (masking)

## Statistical Methods

## Efficacy:

The co-primary endpoints were analyzed between placebo and each of risankizumab 600 mg IV and 1200 mg IV arms using the CMH test, stratified by the randomization factors of number of prior biologics failed (0, 1, &gt; 1) and baseline steroid use (Yes, No) based on ITT1A. A CMH based two -sided 95% CI for the difference between treatment groups will be constructed. For the co-primary efficacy endpoints, an additional  analysis  using  the  same  CMH  test  was  performed  using  As  Observed  (AO)  data  handling without any imputation. The analysis was conducted using the ITT1A population.

In general, continuous secondary efficacy endpoints with repeat measurements were analyzed using a MMRM model including factors for treatment group, visit, visit by treatment interaction, stratification variables  and  the  continuous  fixed  covariates  of  baseline  measurement.  The  MMRM  analysis  was

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

considered primary for inferential purposes. Continuous secondary efficacy variables were analysed using ANCOVA-C approach.

Categorical secondary efficacy variables were analyzed using the CMH test controlling for stratification variables (prior biologics failed [0, 1, &gt; 1] and baseline steroid use [Yes, No]), except for the endpoints related  to  draining  fistulas  and  CD-related  hospitalization.  A  CMH  based  two-sided  95%  CI  for  the difference  between  each  risankizumab  treatment  group  and  placebo  group  was  constructed.  The endpoints of \"The achievement of no draining fistulas at Week 12 in subjects with draining fistulas at baseline\"  and  \"Occurrence  of  CD-related  hospitalization  through  Week  12\"  were  analyzed  using Chisquare test (or Fisher's exact test if ≥ 20% of the cells have expected cell count &lt; 5).

## Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity:

Serum risankizumab concentrations were summarized at each time point for each dosing regimen using descriptive statistics. In addition, ADA incidence was summarized by cohorts and study visits. ADA titers were tabulated for each subject at the respective study visits.

Safety:

Safety analyses were carried out using the safety analysis sets, which included all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. Incidence of AEs, including those related to study drug, changes in vital signs,  physical  examination  results,  clinical  laboratory  values,  and  product  quality  complaints  were analyzed.

## Results

## Participant flow

## 12-Week Induction Period

A total of 931 subjects were randomized in the study and received at least 1 dose of study drug during the study. The primary efficacy population (ITT1A) included 850 subjects.

During the first 12-week Induction Period, a higher percentage of subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg and  risankizumab  1200  mg  treatment  arms  compared  to  placebo  completed  study  drug.  The  most frequent primary reason for discontinuation of study drug in all treatment arms was an AE, and the number of subjects who discontinued study drug due to AE was numerically higher in the placebo arm compared to either risankizumab arm. The most frequently reported AE that led to discontinuation was Crohn's disease (2 subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg arm, 2 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg arm, and 7 subjects in the placebo arm), suggesting a lack of efficacy of study drug in these subjects. Subject final status and reasons for discontinuation of study drug during the first 12-Week Induction Period are shown in Table 1.

## Induction Period 2

A total of 278 subjects entered Induction Period 2 at Week 12 and received at least 1 dose of study drug. The rate of completion of study drug during Induction Period 2 was similar across all treatment arms. Lack of efficacy, withdrawal by subject, and COVID-19 logistical restrictions were the most frequently reported  primary  reasons  for  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  Subject  final  status  and  reasons  for discontinuation of study drug during Induction Period 2 are shown in Table 2.

Protocol deviations were collected for all subjects in the 12-Week Induction Period and Induction Period 2 and are presented for the subjects in ITT1A. Protocol deviations were defined in accordance with the ICH guidelines and included, but were not limited to, the following: inclusion/exclusion criteria violation (75 [8.8%] total subjects), receipt of wrong treatment or incorrect dose of study drug (4 [0.5%] total

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

subjects),  development  of  withdrawal  criteria  without  being  withdrawn  (no  subjects),  and  use  of prohibited concomitant medications (35 [4.1%] total subjects).

Deviations were assessed for their impact on analyses and data integrity or subject safety.

Efficacy data for subjects enrolled at an investigational site with significant noncompliance were excluded from the statistical analyses. Otherwise, reported protocol deviations did not have an impact on analyses and data integrity. Overall, protocol deviations did not compromise subject safety.

## Paediatric Data

Study M16-006 enrolled a total of 931 patients, including 9 paediatric patients, 4 subjects were randomized to risankizumab 1200 IV treatment, 3 subjects to risankizumab 600 mg IV, and 2 subjects to placebo .

Baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced among treatment arms (Table 6). In the ITT1A population, there were 491 subjects in the Bio-IR population and 359 subjects in the non-Bio-IR population; 28.1% of subjects failed 1 biologic and 29.6% of subjects failed more than 1 biologic. In the Bio-IR population, 95.1% subjects failed 1 or more anti-TNF and 28.9% failed vedolizumab. The most common  CD  location  per  SES-CD  was  in  the  ileal-colonic  region  (49.6%  of  all  subjects).  Overall, approximately 30% and approximately 24% of subjects were on concomitant corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators at baseline, respectively.

Induction Period 2

Disease characteristics at study baseline (Week 0) were generally similar among treatment arms (Table 7). In the ITT2A population, there were 145 subjects in the Bio-IR population and 109 subjects in the non-Bio-IR popul ation; 23.6% of subjects failed 1 biologic and 33.5% of subjects failed more than 1 biologic.  In  the  Bio-IR  population,  93.8%  subjects  failed  1  or  more  anti-TNF  and  35.2%  failed vedolizumab.  The  most  common  CD  location  per  SES-CD  was  in  the  ileal-colonic  region  (51.2%  of subjects).

Overall, approximately 32% and approximately 22% of subjects were on concomitant corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators at baseline (Week 0), respectively.

## Efficacy results

The  study  met  the  co-primary  endpoints  of  clinical  remission  and  endoscopic  response  for  the risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms compared to the placebo arm for both the US protocol and the OUS protocol. At Week 12, a statistically significantly greater (pvalue &lt; 0.001) proportion of subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg and risankizumab 1200 arms achieved the co-primary endpoint of clinical remission (as defined by the CDAI in the US protocol and by the SF/APS in the OUS protocol) compared to the placebo arm (Table 10 and Table 11). At Week 12, a statistically significantly greater (pvalue &lt; 0.001) proportion of subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg and risankizumab 1200 mg arms achieved endoscopic response, assessed in both the US protocol and the OUS protocol, compared to the placebo arm (Table 12). In addition, a clear treatment effect was demonstrated in the key subgroup populations of non-Bio-IR and Bio-IR for all co-primary endpoints, with higher efficacy and effect size noted in the non-Bio-IR population. Overall, numerically similar results were observed for the risankizumab 600 mg arm and the risankizumab 1200 mg arm in the overall population as well as both subgroup populations.

The key secondary endpoints (i.e., endpoints under the overall Type I error control) for the US and OUS protocols are summarized in tables below.

Overall, both risankizumab arms (600 mg and 1200 mg) demonstrated clear treatment effects over placebo for resolution of clinical symptoms, improvements in quality of life (QoL), reduction in mucosal

inflammation as measured by endoscopy, and CD-related hospitalizations. A majority of endpoints were statistically significant for the risankizumab 600 mg arm and the risankizumab 1200 mg arm versus placebo for both the US and OUS protocols. Overall efficacy rates for the risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms were numerically similar.

Clinical response and clinical remission, as defined by CDAI and SF/APS, were seen at Week 4, with statistically  significant differences observed for the risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms versus placebo.  Additionally,  clinical  response  per  CDAI  and  SF/APS  were  statistically  significant  for  each risankizumab arm versus placebo at Week 12, with greater efficacy and treatment differences relative to those at Week 4. Other patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires that summarize QoL, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue, Work Productivity and Impairment Questionnaire - Crohn's disease (WPAI-CD), and SF-36, showed overall numerically better improvement in the risankizumab arms versus placebo and statistical significance is shown in Table 13 and Table 14.

Endoscopic  remission  and  ulcer-free  endoscopy  at  Week  12  were  statistically  significant  in  the risankizumab arms versus placebo. The composite endpoint for clinical response (per CDAI and SF/APS) and endoscopic response (i.e., clinical response and endoscopic response in the same patient), were also statistically significant for the risankizumab arms versus placebo.

CD-related  hospitalizations  were  lower  in  the  risankizumab  arms  versus  placebo  and  met  statistical significance. Additionally, while the total number of subjects analyzed was small, there was a trend for reduction in EIMs for subjects who received risankizumab versus placebo, with statistical significance for the risankizumab 1200 mg arm versus placebo. Due to the small sample size of the number of subjects with draining fistulas at baseline (N = 51), no meaningful conclusions can be drawn and the endpoint did not meet statistical significance.

## CHMP comment in relation to efficacy

The  purpose  of  this  submission  is  to  comply  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  as amended, by submitting data available from patients less than 18 years of age recruited to Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Risankizumab in Adult and Adolescent Subjects with Moderately to Severely active Crohn´s Disease. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab as induction treatment in subjects with moderately to severely active CD. The study enrolled subjects who had an inadequate response (IR) to prior biologic therapy (bio-IR) and subjects who had not received such therapy. This study enrolled adult patients ≥ 18 to ≤ 80 years but it also could enrol subjects 16 to &lt; 18 years of age who met the definition of Tanner stage 5 for development.

The objective of Study M16-006 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab versus placebo during induction therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active CD. There were two co-primary endpoints i.e proportion of subjects with SF/APS clinical remission at Week 12 and proportion of subjects with endoscopic response at Week 12.

A total of 931 subjects were randomized in the study and received at least 1 dose of study drug during the study.  However, this study only enrolled a total of 9 paediatric patients, 4 subjects were randomized to risankizumab 1200 IV treatment, 3 subjects to risankizumab 600 mg IV, and 2 subjects to placebo.

Overall, the study met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response for the risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms compared to the placebo arm.  In relation to paediatric patients no conclusion could be made as the number of paediatric patients was too small.

## Safety results

Safety analyses included reporting of AEs, infusion site assessment, laboratory test results, and vital sign measurements

Results of safety analyses were similar between the SA1 and SA1A populations.

## Adverse Events

All  AEs described in this report were considered treatment-emergent and summarized using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®), Version 23.1 primary system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) for the 12-Week Induction Period are defined as events that began either on or after the first dose of the study drug in the 12-Week Induction Period through one of the following:

1) the first dose of study drug in Study M16000; 2) the first dose of study drug in Induction Period 2; or 3) within 140 days after the last dose administration of study drug if the subject did not continue in the Study M16-000 or Induction Period 2.

## 12-Week Induction Period

During the 12-Week Induction Period, a total of 210 subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg arm (56.3% and 569.5 E/100 patientyears [PY]) and 191 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg arm (51.3% and 499.3 E/PY) reported at least 1 AE; these rates were similar to the placebo arm (56.5% and 622.8 E/100 PY). A smaller proportion of subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg arm and risankizumab 1200 mg arm experienced serious AEs, severe AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug compared with the placebo arm. There were no deaths in risankizumab-treated subjects and 2 subjects died in the placebo arm.

## Induction Period 2

During Induction Period 2, the rate of AEs reported among treatment groups was similar: a total of 31 subjects  in  the  risankizumab  180  mg  SC  arm  (46.3%  and  316.7  E/100  PY), 34  subjects  in  the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm (50.0% and 333.4 E/100 PY), 35 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm (52.2% and 403.9 E /100 PY), and 40 subjects in the placebo IV/ risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm (52.6% and 466.1 E/100 PY) reported at least 1 AE (Table 25). In total, the proportion of subjects who experienced serious AEs was 5.0% and the proportion of subjects who experienced severe AEs was also 5.0%; a single subject in the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm had an AE that led to discontinuation of study drug. There were no deaths.

## 12-Week Induction Period

During the 12-Week Induction Period, the most frequently reported AEs in the risankizumab 600 mg and risankizumab  1200  mg  arms  were  headache,  nasopharyngitis,  and  fatigue  (Table  18).  The  most frequently reported AEs in the placebo arm were Crohn's disease, nausea, and abdominal pain. Crohn's disease  was  reported  more  frequently  by  subjects  in  the  placebo  arm  (13.4%)  compared  to  the risankizumab 600 mg arm (2.7%) and risankizumab 1200 mg arm (1.6%).

The SOC with the most frequently reported AEs in the risankizumab total group was infections and infestations (20.6% in the risankizumab 600 mg arm, 18.5% in the risankizumab 1200 mg arm, and 23.7%  in the placebo arm). The most  frequently reported infections and infestations were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection.

## 12-Week Induction Period

During the 12-Week Induction Period, the majority of AEs observed in the risankizumab treatment arms were mild to moderate (CTCAE Grade 1 or 2) in severity, which was similar to the placebo arm. The proportion of subjects with severe AEs was numerically lower in the risankizumab 600 mg arm (5.9%) and in the risankizumab 1200 mg arm (4.8%) compared to placebo arm (9.7%). The most commonly reported severe AE in the risankizumab total group and in the placebo arm was Crohn's disease (0.8% in the risankizumab total group and 4.3% in the placebo arm).

## Induction Period 2

During Induction Period 2, the majority of AEs observed were mild to moderate (CTCAE Grade 1 or 2) in severity. The most commonly reported severe AE was intestinal obstruction (3 [1.1%] total subjects: 1 [1.5%] subject in the risankizumab 180 mg SC arm, 1 [1.5%] subject in the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm,  no  subjects  in  the  risankizumab  1200  mg  IV  arm,  and  1  [1.3%]  subject  in  the  placebo IV/risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm); all other severe AEs occurred in a single subject.

## All risankizumab

Overall, during the study, the majority of AEs observed were mild to moderate (CTCAE Grade 1 or 2) in severity. The most commonly reported severe AE was Crohn's disease (7 [0.9%] in any risankizumabtreated subjects).

During the 12-Week Induction Period, the proportions of subjects in the risankizumab treatment arms who experienced AEs assessed by the investigator as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug were comparable to the placebo arm. The most frequently reported AEs considered by the investigator  to  have  a  reasonable  possibility  of  being  related  to  study  drug  in  risankizumab-treated subjects were fatigue (20 [2.7%] in the risankizumab total group compared to 0 subjects in the placebo group) and headache (16 [2.1%] in the risankizumab total group compared to 3 [1.6%] in the placebo group).

## Induction Period 2

During Induction Period 2, the proportions of subjects in the risankizumab 180 mg SC, 360 mg SC, 1200 mg IV, and placebo IV/risankizumab 1200 mg IV treatment arms who experienced AEs assessed by the investigator as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug were 13.4%, 22.1%, 13.4%, and 22.4% respectively. The most frequently reported AEs considered by the investigator to have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug in risankizumab-treated subjects were arthralgia (4 [1.4%]), headache (4 [1.4%]), bronchitis (3 [1.1%]), and influenza (3 [1.1%]).

## Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events

## Deaths

## 12-Week Induction Period

During the 12-Week Induction Period, 2 deaths were reported; both deaths were treatment-emergent and occurred in subjects in the placebo arm. The cause of 1 death was cardiovascular collapse due to septic shock/necrotic peritonitis due to intestinal perforation (autopsy report) or severe acute pulmonary edema/acute bronchopneumonia (death certificate). The cause of the other death was \"multi-organic failure  due  to  septic  shock/severe  acute  respiratory  failure  due  to  nosocomial  pneumonia\"  (death certificate).

## Induction Period 2

No subjects died during Induction Period 2.

## Other Serious Adverse Events

## 12-Week Induction Period

During the 12-Week Induction Period, the proportion of subjects with treatment-emergent SAEs was lower in the risankizumab arms compared with the placebo arm (Table 21).

The most frequently reported SAE was Crohn's disease, with lower rates in the risankizumab arms, or events primarily gastrointestinal in nature, which may reflect underlying disease. A total of 7 (0.9%) subjects treated with risankizumab (3 subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg arm and 4 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg arm) compared to 5 (2.7%) subjects treated with placebo had SAEs considered by the investigator as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. A total of 3 subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg arm, 4 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg arm, and 8 subjects in the placebo arm discontinued study drug due to an SAE.

## Induction Period 2

During Induction Period 2, the proportion of subjects with treatment-emergent SAEs was ≤ 6.0% and comparable among treatment arms. The most frequently reported SAE was intestinal obstruction (3 [1.1%] total subjects) and may reflect underlying disease; all other SAEs occurred in a single subject each. One subject in the placebo IV/risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm had an SAE (gastroenteritis norovirus) considered by the investigator as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug; all other SAEs were considered by the investigator as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. One subject in the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm discontinued study drug due to an SAE, severe intestinal obstruction; no other subjects were withdrawn due to an SAE.

## All Risankizumab

Overall, during the study, the proportion of subjects with treatment-emergent SAEs was 6.6% (Table 22). The most frequently reported SAEs were Crohn's disease and events primarily gastrointestinal in nature, which may reflect underlying disease.

## Adverse Events Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation

## 12-Week Induction Period

During the 12-Week Induction Period, the proportion of subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was lower in the risankizumab arms (600 mg: 2.4%; 1200 mg: 1.9%) compared to the placebo arm (7.5%). The most frequently reported AE leading to discontinuation of study drug in any treatment arm was worsening of the underlying disease (Crohn's disease) (risankizumab 600 mg: 0.5%; risankizumab 1200  mg:  0.5%;  placebo:  3.8%).  The  following  notable  events  led  to  study  drug discontinuation:  1  subject  in  the  risankizumab  600  mg  arm  had  SAEs  of  rash  and  hepatic  function abnormal; 1 su bject in the risankizumab 600 mg arm had non-serious AEs of aspartate aminotransferase increased with onset on Day 23; and 1 subject in the risankizumab 600 mg arm had non-serious infusionrelated reaction.

## Induction Period 2

During  Induction  Period  2,  1  subject  had  an  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug  (intestinal obstruction).

## Areas of Safety Interest

## 12-Week Induction Period

Overall, ASI rates were ≤ 5.1% during the 12 -Week Induction Period. The most frequently reported ASIs were hypersensitivity, hepatic events, and serious infection.

Observed rates of serious infection were lower in the risankizumab arms compared to placebo; some instances of serious infection in the placebo group are reflective of underlying CD (see Table 36). Rates of  hepatic  events  were  comparable  between  the  risankizumab  arms  and  placebo  arm.  Rates  of hypersensitivity events were numerically higher in the risankizumab arms compared to the placebo arm. During  the  12-Week  Induction  Period,  no  subject  in  any  treatment  arm  had  treatment-emergent adjudicated  major  adverse  cardiac  event  (MACE),  adjudicated  extended  MACE,  malignant  tumors, malignancies excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), NMSC, adjudicated anaphylactic reactions, or serious anaphylactic reactions, and these ASI are not discussed further. A summary of the incidence rate and exposure-adjusted event rate (EAER) of ASIs is presented in Table 23.

## Induction Period 2

Overall, ASI rates were ≤ 6%, with the exception of hyp ersensitivity, during Induction Period 2. The most  frequently  reported  ASIs  were  hypersensitivity,  hepatic  events,  and  injection  site  reactions. Observed rates of hypersensitivity and injection site reactions were numerically higher in the IV arms compared to the SC arms. During Induction Period 2, no subject in any treatment arm had treatmentemergent adjudicated MACE, adjudicated extended MACE, active tuberculosis, opportunistic infections excluding tuberculosis and herpes zoster, malignancies excluding NMSC, serious hypersensitivity events, adjudicated anaphylactic reactions, or serious anaphylactic reactions and these ASI are not discussed further.

## All risankizumab

The  most  frequently  reported  ASIs  in  risankizumab-treated  subjects  were  hypersensitivity,  hepatic events,  and  injection  site  reactions.  No  risankizumab-treated  subjects  had  treatment-emergent adjudicated MACE, adjudicated extended MACE, malignancies excluding NMSC, adjudicated anaphylactic reactions, or serious anaphylactic reactions.

A summary of the incidence rate and EAER of ASIs is presented in Table 25.

## Safety in children - individual data:

1. Three subjects were randomized to receive risankizumab 1200 mg IV in the 12-Week Induction Period. Each completed all dosing and were classified as responders at the end of the 12-Week Induction Period. There were no AEs reported for these subjects.
2. A subject was randomized to receive risankizumab 600 mg IV in the 12-Week Induction Period. The subject completed all dosing and was classified as a responder at the end of the 12-Week Induction  Period. The  subject  experienced  2  mild,  non-serious  AEs  of  pyrexia  and headache  on  Day  89.  Both  events  resolved  the  same  day  and  neither  event  was considered by the investigator to  have  a  reasonable  possibility of  being  related  to study drug.
3. A subject was randomized to receive risankizumab 600 mg IV in the 12-Week Induction Period. The subject completed all dosing and was classified as a responder at the end of the 12-Week Induction  Period.  On  Day  1,  the  subject experienced  2  mild,  non-serious  AEs  of acrochordon (skin tags) and skin haemorrhage . Both events were considered ongoing at

<div style=\"page-break-after: always\"></div>

the  end  of  the  study  and  both  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  have  no  reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. On Day 24, the subject experienced a mild, nonserious AE of influenza-like illness . The subject was administered concomitant medications for the event and it was considered resolved 12 days later. The event was considered by the investigator to have no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. On Day 34, the subject experienced a mild, non-serious AE of ocular hyperaemia. The event was considered resolved 3 days later and the event was considered by the investigator to have no reasonable possibility  of  being  related  to  study  drug. On Day 38, Day 54, and Day 68, the subject experienced  a  mild,  non-serious  AE  of  nasopharyngitis,  vomiting,  and  ear  pain, respectively .  The  subject  was  administered  concomitant  medications  for  the  events  of nasopharyngitis and ear pain. All 3 events resolved and all were considered by the investigator to have no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug.

4. A subject was randomized to receive risankizumab 600 mg IV in the 12-Week Induction Period. The subject completed all dosing and was classified as a responder at the end of the 12-Week Induction Period. On Day 22 and Day 47, the subject experienced a mild, non-serious AE of arthralgia and nasopharyngitis, respectively. The subject was administered concomitant medications  for  the  event  of  nasopharyngitis.  Both  events  resolved  and  both  event  were considered by the investigator to have no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug.
5. A subject was randomized to receive risankizumab 1200 mg IV in the 12-Week Induction Period. The subject completed all dosing and was classified as a non-responder at the end of the 12Week Induction Period and was then randomized to risankizumab 360 mg SC in Induction Period 2, where the subject completed all dosing. On Day 35 (12-Week Induction Period), the subject experienced 2 mild, nonserious AEs of headache and myalgia . The subject was administered concomitant medication for the headache. Both events resolved the same day and both events were considered by the investigator to have no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. On Day 112 (Induction Period 2), the subject experienced a moderate, non-serious AE of anaemia .  The subject was administered concomitant medication for the event, the event was considered ongoing at the end of the study and the investigator considered the  event  to  have  a  reasonable  possibility  of  being  related  to  study  drug. On  Day  147 (Induction Period 2), the subject experienced mild, non-serious AE of injection site swelling . Concomitant medication was administered, the event considered resolved the same day, and the investigator considered the event to have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. On Day 213 (Follow-Up Period), the subject experienced a mild, nonserious AE of oligomenorrhoea . Concomitant medication was administered, the event was considered ongoing at the end of the study, and the investigator considered the event to have no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug.
6. A subject was randomized to receive placebo IV in the 12-Week Induction Period. On Day 10, the subject experienced a serious AE of Crohn's Disease (CD flare) and a moderate non-serious AE of hypoalbumin emia. The subject received cipronex and metronidazole for the  aggravated  CD  and  study  drug  was  withdrawn  on  Day  24  in  response  to  the  SAE.  The investigator considered the SAE to have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. AbbVie assessed the SAE as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug and more likely related to pre-existing Crohn's disease . The subject also experienced moderate, non-serious AEs of electrolyte imbalance on Day 14 and anaemia on Day 24. The subject was administered concomitant medications for both events. The AE of electrolyte imbalance resolved 18 days later and the AE of anaemia was considered ongoing at the end of the study. Both events were considered by the investigator to have a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug.

## 2.2.3. Discussion on clinical aspects

The purpose of this submission was to comply with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended, by submitting data available from patients less than 18 years of age recruited to Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Risankizumab in Adult and Adolescent Subjects with Moderately to Severely active Crohn´s Disease. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab as induction treatment in subjects with moderately to severely active CD. This study enrolled adult patients ≥ 18 to ≤ 80 years but it also could enrol subjects 16 to &lt; 18 years of age who met the definition of Tanner stage 5 for development.

The objective of Study M16-006 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risankizumab versus placebo during induction therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active CD. There were two co-primary endpoints i.e proportion of subjects with SF/APS clinical remission at Week 12 and proportion of subjects with endoscopic response at Week 12.

A total of 931 subjects were randomized in the study and received at least 1 dose of study drug during the study.  However, this study only enrolled a total of 9 paediatric patients, 4 subjects were randomized to risankizumab 1200 IV treatment, 3 subjects to risankizumab 600 mg IV, and 2 subjects to placebo.

Overall, the study met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response for the risankizumab 600 mg and 1200 mg arms compared to the placebo arm. In relation to paediatric patients no conclusion could be made as the number of paediatric patients was too small. Subgroup analysis for paediatric patients was provided by the applicant.

In relation to safety, during the 12-Week Induction Period, a total of 210 subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg arm (56.3% and 569.5 E/100 patientyears [PY]) and 191 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg arm (51.3% and 499.3 E/PY) reported at least 1 AE; these rates were similar to the placebo arm (56.5% and 622.8 E/100 PY). A smaller proportion of subjects in the risankizumab 600 mg arm and risankizumab 1200 mg arm experienced serious AEs, severe AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug compared with the placebo arm. There were no deaths in risankizumab-treated subjects and 2 subjects died in the placebo arm.

During Induction Period 2, the rate of AEs reported among treatment groups was similar: a total of 31 subjects  in  the  risankizumab  180  mg  SC  arm  (46.3%  and  316.7  E/100  PY),  34  subjects  in  the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm (50.0% a nd 333.4 E/100 PY), 35 subjects in the risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm (52.2% and 403.9 E/100 PY), and 40 subjects in the placebo IV/ risankizumab 1200 mg IV arm (52.6% and 466.1 E/100 PY) reported at least 1 AE. In total, the proportion of subjects who experienced serious AEs was 5.0% and the proportion of subjects who experienced severe AEs was also 5.0%; a single subject in the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm had an AE that led to discontinuation of study drug. There were no deaths.

The applicant provided the safety data for 8 paediatric patients enrolled to this study. It is noted that for 3 paediatric subjects no AEs were reported. The remaining paediatric subjects mainly experienced mild, non-serious AEs such as pyrexia, headache, acrochordon (skin tags), skin haemorrhage, influenza-like illness, nasopharyngitis, vomiting, ear pain, myalgia and injection site swelling. A subject experienced moderate, non-serious AE of anaemia. Another subject experienced a serious AE of Crohn's Disease (CD flare) and a moderate non-serious AE of hypoalbuminemia however, this subject was receiving placebo in the study.

## In  general  the  risankizumab  treatment  seems  to  be  tolerated  in  this  study  by  paediatric patients however, no firm conclusion could be made as the number of paediatric patients was too small.

It needs to be noted that the variation application to add a new indication for the treatment of Crohn's Disease is planned to be submitted by the applicant shortly.
